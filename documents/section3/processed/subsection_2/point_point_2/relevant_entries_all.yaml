    \ \n\"Things\" that are part of the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) are equipped\
    \ with sensors, software, and network \nconnectivity, giving them the ability\
    \ to gather and share data with one another and with other devices. The \nongoing\
    \ digital transformation is taking place in many different domains, including\
    \ medical, industry, \ntransportation, and urban planning[1]. Connected devices\
    \ and their networks are important to this \ntransformation. This response will\
    \ concentrate on the architecture, applications, and future directions of \npotential\
    \ development of IoT networks.The term \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) describes\
    \ a network of actual \nphysical objects that are linked to the internet and are\
    \ capable of exchanging data and information with one \nanother. These items,\
    \ often known as \"smart devices,\" have sensors, software, and network connectivity\
    \ that \nenable data collection and transmission[2]. Healthcare, industry, transportation,\
    \ and smart cities are just a few of \nthe sectors being transformed by IoT networks.IoT\
    \ networks are becoming more and more significant as \nbusinesses all over the\
    \ world continue to utilize this technology to increase operational effectiveness,\
    \ cut costs, \nand improve customer experience[3]. Over the coming years, the\
    \ global IoT industry is anticipated to expand \nrapidly, increasing in size to\
    \ an estimated $1.5 trillion by 2030.This study paper's main goal is to give a\
    \ \nthorough review of IoT networks, covering its design, uses, and prospects.\
    \ Also, this study will emphasize the \ndrawbacks and restrictions of IoT networks\

    \ \nTable 1. Comparative Study of Various Techniques used for IoT System \n \n\
    III. \nArchitecture of IoT Networks \nIoT networks are made up of a variety of\
    \ parts that cooperate to make it possible to gather, process, and transmit \n\
    data. An IoT network's essential elements include: \nA. Definition and components\
    \ of IoT networks \ni. \nDevices: These are actual physical things with processors,\
    \ sensors, and network connectivity. Smart \nhousehold appliances, wearable fitness\
    \ trackers, commercial machinery, and environmental sensors are \na few examples\
    \ of IoT gadgets. \nii. \nSensors: Sensors are used to collect data from the physical\
    \ environment, such as temperature, \nhumidity, pressure, or position. A wide\
    \ range of sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, \nmicrophones, and cameras,\
    \ can be used by IoT networks. \niii. \nActuators: These parts are used to change\
    \ the environment in response to information gathered by \nsensors. For instance,\
    \ an IoT network may employ actuators to modify a room's temperature or turn on\
    \ \nand off lighting. \niv. \nNetwork Connectivity: IoT devices need to be connected\
    \ to a network to transmit data. Many network \ntechnologies, such as Wi-Fi, cellular\
    \ networks, and Bluetooth, can be used to do this. \nTurkish Journal of Computer\
    \ and Mathematics Education  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604\
    \ \n \n \n2070 \n \n \n \nResearch Article  \nv. \nData processing is necessary\
    \ in order to make use of the data that IoT devices collect. This can be \ndone\
    \ on the device itself, on a nearby edge device, or on the cloud. Data analysis,\
    \ aggregation, and \nfiltering are all examples of processing. \nvi. \nStorage:IoT\
    \ networks may store, process, and analyse data using cloud services. These can\
    \ include \nservices for data storage, data analytics, and machine learning. \n\
    vii. \nApplications: Software applications can be used by IoT networks to let\
    \ users interact with and manage \nthe network. These can include mobile or web\
    \ tools that let consumers access and keep tabs on data \ncoming from their Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) devices. \nviii. \nSecurity: IoT networks need to be secure\
    \ to avoid unauthorized access or modification of data. These \nmay include threat\
    \ detection technologies, access controls, and encryption. \nThese components\
    \ work together to enable IoT networks to collect, process, and send data from\
    \ the real world. \nIoT networks can offer a number of advantages by fusing these\
    \ elements, including increased operational \neffectiveness, lower costs, and\
    \ better user experiences. \nB. Four layers of IoT network architecture \nIoT\
    \ networks can be further divided into blocks or modules, each of which serves\
    \ a particular function. \nDepending on the particular use case of the IoT network,\
    \ these blocks can be organized in a variety of ways. \nSome of the typical building\
    \ blocks or modules for IoT network topologies include the following:All physical\
    \ \ncomponents of the IoT network, such as sensors, actuators, and gateways, are\
    \ included in the device layer. These \ngadgets gather information and talk to\
    \ other gadgets in the network.All network elements that permit \ncommunication\
    \ between devices, such as Wi-Fi routers, gateways, and switches, are included\
    \ in the network \nlayer. The network layer also comprises protocols and technologies,\
    \ such Bluetooth, Zigbee, and LoRa, that \nallow devices to connect with one another.\
    \ \ni. \nCloud Layer: This layer consists of cloud-based services that give the\
    \ IoT network access to storage, \ncompute, and analytics. These services can\
    \ be used to store data, handle data processing and analysis, \nand give end users\
    \ insights. \nii. \nApplication Layer: This layer consists of computer programs\
    \ that give end users access to the \ninformation gathered by the Internet of\
    \ Things network. These programs can be used to display data, \nstart processes,\
    \ and provide notifications. \niii. \nSecurity Layer:The security procedures in\
    \ this layer assure the availability, confidentiality, and \nintegrity of the\
    \ data gathered by the IoT network. Threat detection, access limits, and encryption\
    \ are \nexamples of security measures. \niv. \nDevice Layer:Device management,\
    \ network monitoring, and firmware updates are just a few of the \ntools and services\
    \ that help network administrators manage the IoT network. \nIoT networks can\
    \ be designed in a variety of ways depending on the network's needs and the individual\
    \ use \ncase. IoT networks often depend on a combination of physical objects,\
    \ network elements, cloud-based services, \nsoftware applications, security methods,\
    \ and management tools to operate, regardless of the architecture. \nC. Centralized\
    \ and decentralized networks \ni. \nCentralized Networks: All data gathered by\
    \ IoT devices is transmitted to a central server for \nprocessing and storage\
    \ in a centralized IoT network design. On-site or in the cloud are both viable\
    \ \nlocations for this server. The server is responsible for processing and analyzing\
    \ data, and may also \nserve as a gateway to other systems. As all the data is\
    \ in one place, centralized networks can be simpler \nto manage and maintain.\
    \ Yet, centralized networks may be less scalable and more subject to single \n\
    points of failure. \nii. \nDecentralized Networks: With a decentralized IoT network\
    \ architecture, data processing and storage \nis distributed among different devices\
    \ and systems. For instance, instead of being routed to a \ncentralized server,\
    \ data gathered by IoT devices may be processed and analyzed on the edge, in a\
    \ \nnearby gateway or device. While there are several nodes that can handle data\
    \ processing and storage, \nTurkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education\
    \  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604\
    \ \n \n \n2071 \n \n \n \nResearch Article  \ndecentralized networks can be more\
    \ scalable and resilient than centralized networks. Decentralized \nnetworks,\
    \ on the other hand, can be trickier to run and maintain because data is dispersed\
    \ throughout \nnumerous hardware and software platforms. \nNetwork topologies\
    \ that are centralized or decentralized each have benefits and drawbacks of their\
    \ own. The \nnetwork's size, the amount of data being collected, whether real-time\
    \ processing is needed, and the required \nlevel of security all play a role in\
    \ the architecture choice. To attain the appropriate level of scalability, \n\
    robustness, and security, certain IoT networks may employ a hybrid architecture,\
    \ which mixes centralized and \ndecentralized features. \nIV. \nApplications of\
    \ IoT Networks \nIoT networks are used in a wide range of fields and businesses,\
    \ including manufacturing, transportation, \nhealthcare, and smart cities. Below\
    \ is a summary of some of the major IoT network-using industries: \ni. \nHealthcare:\
    \ By enabling remote patient monitoring, streamlining hospital operations, and\
    \ giving real-\ntime patient data, IoT networks can improve patient outcomes and\
    \ lower expenses. IoT devices, for \ninstance, can be used to track patients with\
    \ long-term diseases like diabetes or heart disease and notify \nmedical professionals\
    \ of any changes in their state. \nii. \nManufacturing: By providing real-time\
    \ monitoring of production processes and equipment, IoT \nnetworks can assist\
    \ increase operational efficiency and decrease downtime. IoT sensors, for instance,\
    \ \ncan be used to monitor machine performance and anticipate maintenance requirements\
    \ prior to a \nbreakdown. \niii. \nTransportation: IoT networks can aid in enhancing\
    \ user experience, reducing congestion, and \nimproving safety in the transportation\
    \ sector. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to track traffic \npatterns and\
    \ modify traffic lights to improve flow. \nIoT networks have the potential to\
    \ enhance urban environments' sustainability, safety, and livability. IoT sensors,\
    \ \nfor instance, can be used to monitor air quality, control energy use, and\
    \ improve waste management. \nA. Examples of specific use cases \nThe following\
    \ are some particular use cases for IoT networks: \na) Smart Homes: IoT devices\
    \ can be utilised to build energy-efficient, safe, and simple to maintain smart\
    \ \nhouses. For instance, IoT-enabled security systems can send out real-time\
    \ notifications if there is any \nunexpected activity in the home, while IoT-enabled\
    \ thermostats can automatically adjust the \ntemperature based on user preferences\
    \ and occupancy. \nb) Asset tracking: IoT networks can be used to track assets\
    \ like inventory, equipment, and vehicles in real \ntime. For example, IoT sensors\
    \ can be used to monitor the location and condition of products in transit, \n\
    enabling organizations to optimize their supply chain operations. \nc) Environmental\
    \ Monitoring: IoT networks can be used to keep an eye on things like weather patterns,\
    \ \nwater quality, and air quality. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to\
    \ forecast weather patterns or \nidentify pollution levels in streams to assist\
    \ stop natural disasters. \nd) Agriculture: Agricultural operations including\
    \ irrigation, fertilizer, and pest control can be monitored \nand optimized via\
    \ IoT networks. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to enhance crop development\
    \ \nand output by monitoring soil moisture levels and adjusting irrigation systems.\
    \ \n \nV. \nIV. Future Directions of IoT Networks \nA. Emerging trends in IoT\
    \ networks \nDigital twins are virtual reproductions of actual systems or gadgets.\
    \ They can be used to imitate the behavior of \nsystems in the real world because\
    \ they are developed using sensor data. Design, testing, and maintenance of IoT\
    \ \nsystems and devices can be made better with the use of digital twins. \nTurkish\

    Research Article  \ni. \nFog Computing: A decentralized computing architecture\
    \ known as fog computing puts processing \npower closer to Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) devices. Although though it uses a more distributed \nmethodology, it\
    \ is comparable to edge computing. For real-time IoT applications, data processing\
    \ speed \nand latency reduction are essential, and fog computing can help. \n\
    ii. \nHybrid Cloud: A hybrid cloud is an infrastructure that combines public and\
    \ private clouds. IoT \nnetworks may balance their needs for affordability, scalability,\
    \ and security with the aid of hybrid \nclouds. For instance, private cloud infrastructure\
    \ can be used to store sensitive data whereas public \ncloud infrastructure can\
    \ be used to store less sensitive data. \niii. \nHuman-Machine Interfaces (HMIs):\
    \ HMIs allow users to communicate with IoT systems and devices. \nHMIs come in\
    \ tactile, aural, and visual forms. These could aid in enhancing IoT networks'\
    \ usability and \naccessibility. \niv. \nPredictive Maintenance: In order to forecast\
    \ when maintenance is necessary before equipment fails, \npredictive maintenance\
    \ uses data from IoT sensors. Reduced downtime, increased dependability, and \n\
    lower maintenance costs can all be a result of predictive maintenance. \nv. \n\
    Smart Energy: To maximize energy efficiency and minimize waste, smart energy utilises\
    \ IoT networks. \nIoT sensors, for instance, can be used to track energy use in\
    \ buildings and modify heating or lighting \nbased on occupancy levels. \nvi.\
    \ \nVoice Recognition: Voice-activated instructions and IoT device control are\
    \ made possible by speech \nrecognition technologies. Speech recognition can help\
    \ make IoT networks more convenient and \naccessible. \n \nB. Edge computing and\
    \ 5G networks \nThe adoption of edge computing and 5G networks is one of the most\
    \ important trends in IoT networks. Instead \nof transmitting data to a central\
    \ server for processing, edge computing uses devices at the network's edge to\
    \ \nprocess data. Many IoT applications depend on low latency and quick reaction\
    \ times, which can be achieved \nwith this method. Contrarily, 5G networks provide\
    \ greater bandwidth and lower latency than earlier wireless \nnetwork generations,\
    \ making them ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. \nC. Artificial\
    \ Intelligence and Machine Learning \nThe growing application of machine learning\
    \ (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology in IoT networks is \nanother\
    \ trend. IoT devices can benefit from AI and ML to improve decision-making and\
    \ automate processes like \nanomaly detection and predictive maintenance. Costs\
    \ can be cut, productivity can be increased, and the user \nexperience can be\
    \ improved. \nD. Blockchain technology \nIn IoT networks, blockchain technology\
    \ is another new development. Blockchain is a distributed ledger \ntechnology\
    \ that makes transactions safe, open, and impenetrable. Blockchain can be utilized\
    \ in IoT networks to \nbuild secure, decentralized systems that are impervious\
    \ to hackers or tampering. Blockchain technology, for \ninstance, can be applied\
    \ to develop a safe and open supply chain management system that can monitor the\
    \ flow \nof commodities from manufacture to delivery.IoT networks have a promising\
    \ future, filled with both exciting \nprospects and difficult obstacles. To ensure\
    \ that IoT networks can reach their full potential as the technology \ndevelops,\
    \ it will be crucial to solve challenges like privacy, security, and interoperability.\
    \ \nVI. \nChallenges & Limitations of IoT Network \nIoT networks provide many\
    \ benefits, but they also present a number of obstacles and constraints that need\
    \ to be \novercome. We will look at a few of these difficulties and their potential\
    \ effects in this section. \nA. Privacy and Security Issues \nTurkish Journal\
    \ of Computer and Mathematics Education  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI:\
    \ https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604 \n \n \n2073 \n \n \n \nResearch\
    \ Article  \nSecurity and privacy issues are one of the biggest problems facing\
    \ IoT networks. Given that there are billions of \ninternet-connected gadgets,\
    \ the possibility of cyberattacks and data breaches is a major worry. IoT devices\
    \ \nsometimes have poor security safeguards, which leaves them open to hacking\
    \ and other online dangers. \nFurthermore, IoT devices frequently gather and send\
    \ sensitive data, such private health information, \nnecessitating strong privacy\
    \ measures. \nB. Problems with Interoperability and Compatibility \nInteroperability\
    \ and compatibility problems are another difficulty facing IoT networks. IoT systems\
    \ and devices \nare frequently created by several manufacturers and may employ\
    \ various communication protocols or standards. \nAs a result, integrating equipment\
    \ from many manufacturers and developing a cohesive system may be difficult. \n\
    Additionally, the demand for interoperability and compatibility will only increase\
    \ as IoT networks develop. \nC. Congestion in the Network and Scalability \nScalability\
    \ and network congestion are additional issues that IoT networks must deal with.\
    \ The need for \nbandwidth and other network resources increases along with the\
    \ number of devices connected to the network. \nThis may cause network congestion,\
    \ which may have an effect on how well IoT applications work. Scaling the \nnetwork\
    \ infrastructure to meet the rising demand might be difficult as the number of\
    \ IoT devices keeps \nincreasing. \nD. Battery Life and Power Use \nFor IoT networks,\
    \ power consumption and battery life are major obstacles. Many Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) \ndevices run on batteries and can be found in far-off or challenging-to-reach\
    \ places. This makes it difficult to \nchange batteries or recharge devices, which\
    \ may affect the network's overall dependability and performance. In \naddition,\
    \ power consumption will become a more pressing issue as the number of IoT devices\
    \ increases.IoT \nnetworks provide many advantages, but there are also a number\
    \ of problems and restrictions that need to be \nworked around. IoT networks may\
    \ realize their full potential by creating strong security and privacy measures,\
    \ \naddressing interoperability and compatibility challenges, managing network\
    \ congestion, and minimizing power \nusage. \nVII. \nConclusion \nWe have covered\
    \ the architecture, applications, and anticipated future developments of IoT networks\
    \ in this \npaper. We have looked at an IoT network's four-tiered architecture\
    \ and all of its components, such as sensors, \ngateways, cloud platforms, and\
    \ apps. We have also discussed the various applications of IoT networks in a \n\
    variety of fields, including healthcare, industry, transportation, and even smart\
    \ cities.We have also looked into \nthe most recent advancements in the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), such as edge computing, 5G networks, AI, and \nblockchain.\
    \ The usefulness and value of IoT networks may rise as a result of these tendencies.IoT\

  explanation: The passage focuses on the use of edge computing in IoT applications
    within the context of automated irrigation management systems. Specifically, it
    highlights the benefits of using edge computing to reduce latency, enable real-time
    decision-making, and reduce reliance on cloud connectivity. The passage emphasizes
    that edge computing devices can be deployed in a topology and connected to a gateway
    using a communication protocol. Individual or aggregated measurements are received
    by a server where they can be queried, cleaned, and analyzed. Relevant insights
    are then fed back to an end-user or other IoT devices to inform decisions. This
    process can be more efficient and reliable than relying solely on cloud-based
    computing, especially in remote or resource-constrained environments.
  extract_1: Edge computing is becoming more common in commercial IoT products, in
    which onboard device memory and processing capacity is utilized to carry out some
    data reduction and analysis [80]. However, for insights that require a large quantity
    of measurements or computational power, transmitting data to the cloud for computing
    will be required. Table 2 summarizes common IoT data transmission protocols and
    their associated advantages and disadvantages.
  extract_2: The IoT for smallholder agriculture represents a challenge for data transmission
    due to remote locations, with devices distributed over large areas or multiple
    farms that have potentially limited access to electricity and cellular networks.
    Therefore, the range, data rate, and power consumption are important design considerations
    and are compared for the common communication protocols in Figure 5.

    \ projected to increase to 9 billion by 2050,\nfood production will need to increase\
    \ from its current level. The bulk of this growth will need to\ncome from smallholder\
    \ farmers who rely on generational knowledge in their farming practices and\n\
    who live in locations where weather patterns and seasons are becoming less predictable\
    \ due to\nclimate change. The expansion of internet-connected devices is increasing\
    \ opportunities to apply\ndigital tools and services on smallholder farms, including\
    \ monitoring soil and plants in horticulture,\nwater quality in aquaculture, and\
    \ ambient environments in greenhouses. In combination with other\nfood security\
    \ eﬀorts, internet of things (IoT)-enabled precision smallholder farming has the\
    \ potential\nto improve livelihoods and accelerate low- and middle-income countries’\
    \ journey to self-reliance.\nUsing a combination of interviews, surveys and site\
    \ visits to gather information, this research\npresents a review of the current\
    \ state of the IoT for on-farm measurement, cases of successful IoT\nimplementation\
    \ in low- and middle-income countries, challenges associated with implementing\
    \ the\nIoT on smallholder farms, and recommendations for practitioners.\nKeywords:\

    1. Introduction\nIn the 1930s, one farmer in the United States could grow enough\
    \ to feed four people. Today,\none farmer can feed 155 people [1]. Approximately\
    \ 1 billion people worldwide are involved in\nagriculture, and although the total\
    \ number of farmers are declining, the demand for agricultural\ncrops is expected\
    \ to double as the world population reaches 9 billion by 2050 [2]. This will require\n\
    an increase in agricultural productivity, especially from low- and middle-income\
    \ countries (LMICs).\nRecent technological advances have contributed to the rise\
    \ of precision agriculture, enabling farmers\nto make better decisions with more\
    \ information about their soil, water, crop, and local climate [3,4].\nHowever,\
    \ uptake of these advances has been limited to commercial-scale and cash-crop\
    \ cultivation [1].\nThere is a growing body of evidence, which indicates that\
    \ the implementation of precision\nagriculture tools and practices across diﬀerent\
    \ types of farming oﬀers beneﬁts. For example, a digital\ndecision support system\
    \ (DSS) that utilized crop information provided by growers, in combination\nwith\
    \ weather data, eﬀectively alerted growers when to apply fungicide to their potatoes,\
    \ resulting\nin the eﬀective mitigation of late blight disease and more eﬃcient\
    \ fungicide use, saving them up\nto 500 USD per acre cultivated [5–7]. Another\
    \ DSS platform integrated weather data and electrical\ncapacitance sensors for\
    \ real-time monitoring of soil water content along with soil water balance and\n\
    irrigation scheduling models to provide recommendations to durum wheat farmers\
    \ on timing and\nintensity of irrigation, resulting in water savings of at least\
    \ 25% compared to traditional scheduling\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750; doi:10.3390/su12093750\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n2 of 19\n\
    practices [8]. In another common application, optical sensors attached to fertilizer\
    \ equipment measure\nthe light reﬂectance at speciﬁc wavebands, which are related\
    \ to chlorophyll content, an indicator of\nplant nitrogen (N) content, and fertilizer\
    \ is applied in that location based on the estimated N deﬁciency.\nCompared to\
    \ the grower selected constant-rate, sensor-enabled variable-rate fertilization\
    \ has been\nshown to increase corn N uptake by more than 20% [9] and save 10–15\
    \ kg N per acre of corn and cotton,\nespecially when soil N content varies year-to-year\
    \ [10].\nSmallholder farms account for a large share of agricultural production\
    \ in LMICs and help\nmaintain the genetic diversity of food supply, and mitigate\
    \ the risks of nutritional deﬁciencies and\necosystem degradation [11]. However,\
    \ they face challenges including pressures on farmland from\npopulation growth\
    \ and urbanization, and an inability to rely on generational knowledge and practices\n\
    due to climate change. Technology advances made through precision agriculture\
    \ could address\nsome of these challenges [3,12–14]. The internet-of-things (IoT)\
    \ and the services that it enables has\ncontributed to the rise of precision agriculture,\
    \ and it is being applied in smallholder agriculture [4,15,16].\nHowever, limited\
    \ research exists that reports outcomes and challenges for implementation of the\
    \ IoT\nin smallholder agriculture [3,17]. Thus, this article aims to illustrate\
    \ the current landscape of the IoT in\nsmallholder farming, summarize speciﬁc\
    \ implementation cases, and describe some of the challenges\nand recommendations\
    \ in order to direct this sector.\nA typical IoT for agriculture system consists\
    \ of the following: (i) measurement device, (ii) data\ntransmission, (iii) data\
    \ storage and analytics, (iv) feedback and implementation, and (v) project\nstructure\
    \ and support (Figure 1). The device layer consists of a sensor to measure the\
    \ parameter of\ninterest (e.g., soil moisture) and the electronics necessary to\
    \ support its functions. Devices are arranged\nin a topology and connected to\
    \ a gateway using a communication protocol in the data transmission\nlayer. Broad\
    \ coverage of cellular networks allows for frequent, and in some cases near real-time,\n\
    data transmission. Individual or aggregated measurements are received by a server\
    \ where they can be\nqueried, cleaned, and analyzed. Relevant insights are fed\
    \ back to an end-user or other IoT devices to\ninform decisions and prompt actions.\
    \ A vast catalog of existing products and services that are tailored\nfor speciﬁc\
    \ applications make each of these operations increasingly easier and provide a\
    \ lower cost to\nimplement. More detailed introductions to IoT architecture design\
    \ and theory can be found in [18,19].\nThis review primarily focuses on categories\
    \ (i) and (ii), accompanied by discussion of the implications\non (v).\nFigure\
    \ 1. Internet of things (IoT) for agriculture architecture.\nAn important enabler\
    \ for IoT services in LMICs (and a sub-set of LMICs—global food security\nstrategy\
    \ (GFSS) countries [20]) is reliable cellular infrastructure [21]. Country level\
    \ data from the\nWorld Bank suggests that the GFSS country set average for cellular\
    \ connections and smartphone\npenetration is on par with India, a common benchmark\
    \ for digital services among developing countries\n(Figure 2). However, the linkage\
    \ has not yet been made to the agricultural sector. Internet usage in\nGFSS countries\
    \ ranges from 10%–50% of the population and correlates inversely with the population\n\
    Sustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n3 of 19\nemployed in agriculture (Figure 3a). Where\
    \ access to internet falls short, digital services often beneﬁt\nfrom cellular\
    \ connectivity. However, while agricultural productivity has increased in most\
    \ GFSS\ncountries, those gains show no correlation with mobile phone penetration\
    \ (Figure 3b). For example,\na recent study has shown that mobile phone ownership\
    \ in farming households is nearly universal;\nhowever, fewer than 25% use a phone\
    \ to access information about agriculture and livestock, or for\nbuying and selling\
    \ products [22]. These data, and more from the GFSS agriculture dataset, can be\n\
    accessed in the Supplementary Materials.\nFigure 2. Mobile phone subscriptions\
    \ and smartphone penetration across the global food security\nstrategy (GFSS)\
    \ country set, India, China, and the United States [23,24].\nFigure 3. (a) Agriculture\
    \ and internet usage across the GFSS country set, India, China, and the United\n\
    States [23] (b) Crop productivity and mobile connectivity [23]. Crop production\
    \ index (CPI) shows\nagricultural production for each year relative to the base\
    \ period 2004–2006 (CPI = 100). It includes all\ncrops except fodder crops.\n\
    2. Approach\nA mixed method approach consisting of a combination of literature\
    \ reviews, expert interviews,\nweb-based surveys, and site visits were used to\
    \ carry out this research [25–27]. The literature review\nincluded a review of\
    \ 87 relevant publications, which are catalogued in an open online repository\
    \ [25].\nThis review provided an overview of sensors and IoT for agriculture globally.\
    \ Next, 25 interviews with\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n4 of 19\nrelevant experts\
    \ worldwide were conducted. These expert interviews were used to identify the\
    \ gaps\nin understanding the value of the IoT to smallholder farmers and potential\
    \ directions for technology\ndevelopment in this sector. Seventy web-based surveys\
    \ were then distributed to stakeholders in the\nIoT and agricultural technology\
    \ communities from which we received 37 responses; these web-based\nsurveys served\
    \ to not only triangulate the expert interview data, but also to provide use case\
    \ proﬁles\nfor our site visits. Finally, ﬁve site visits and discussions with\
    \ farmers at IoT implementation sites in\nIndia and Kenya were conducted. The\
    \ site visits were used to validate ﬁndings from the literature\nreview, expert\
    \ interviews, and web-based surveys. Two countries were selected for the site\
    \ visits;\n(i) India, which was selected because of the large number of agricultural\
    \ technologies being piloted\nand implemented there on smallholder farms, and\
    \ (ii) Kenya, where we conducted a majority of our\nsite visits. Among the diﬀerent\
    \ GFSS countries, Kenya had the most active IoT for agriculture projects,\nand\
    \ this inﬂuenced our selection.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Current State\
    \ of IoT for Agriculture\nFor this overview of IoT for agriculture, sensor and\
    \ communication technology applications\nare classiﬁed into ﬁve categories of\
    \ (a) climate, (b) livestock, (c) plant, (d) soil, and (e) water.\nWithin each\
    \ category, there are many common, measurable parameters that can inﬂuence the\n\
    performance of the agricultural system (Figure 4). This categorization focuses\
    \ on “ground-based”\nmeasurements, while other methods exist including aerial-\
    \ and space-based earth observation or\nremote sensing, for example in [26,28].\
    \ In some cases, remote sensing and ground-based measurements\nare combined to\
    \ provide temporally (ground-based sensors) and spatially (remote sensing) dense\
    \ crop\nmeasurements [29].\nFigure 4. Measurement categories and related measurable\
    \ parameters.\nTable 1 summarizes common electronic sensors, their applications\
    \ in agriculture, and articles\nthat describe those in more detail. Wherever available,\
    \ articles that report on applications in LMICs\nare included, although relevant\
    \ precision agriculture research from across the globe is also included.\nSome\
    \ parameters can use diﬀerent technologies to estimate the same output. Methods\
    \ for measuring\nbasic agricultural parameters, including soil and atmospheric\
    \ conditions, are well-established,\nand commercial products are available for\
    \ IoT applications. New applications for optical sensors,\nin particular, are\
    \ evolving as the cost of semiconductor technology and data storage and transmission\n\
    decreases. A particular challenge with using low-cost sensors in agriculture is\
    \ the need to calibrate the\nsensor for the speciﬁc implementation conditions.\
    \ For applications where artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is\napplied to classify events\
    \ based on measurement patterns, complex training datasets are necessary to\n\
    teach the AI algorithm.\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n5 of 19\nTable 1. Sensor\

    in commercial IoT products, in which onboard device memory and processing capacity\
    \ is utilized to\ncarry out some data reduction and analysis [80]. However, for\
    \ insights that require a large quantity\nof measurements or computational power,\
    \ transmitting data to the cloud for computing will be\nrequired. Table 2 summarizes\
    \ common IoT data transmission protocols and their associated advantages\nand\
    \ disadvantages.\nThe IoT for smallholder agriculture represents a challenge for\
    \ data transmission due to remote\nlocations, with devices distributed over large\
    \ areas or multiple farms that have potentially limited\naccess to electricity\
    \ and cellular networks. Therefore, the range, data rate, and power consumption\
    \ are\nimportant design considerations and are compared for the common communication\
    \ protocols.\nIn Figure 5, communication protocols are grouped based on data rate\
    \ and range of transmission,\nwhich is divided into “Long range”, including low-power\
    \ wide area network (LPWAN), which includes\nLoRa and SigFox, “Short range”, including\
    \ Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Zigbee, and Z-Wave,\nand cellular communication\
    \ including GSM 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G. With respect to power consumption,\nsolutions\
    \ that are tailored to IoT applications oﬀer superior performance to more general\
    \ protocols\n(Figure 6). While the range and power consumption of protocols like\
    \ LoRa and SigFox are well suited\nfor IoT applications, their device compatibility\
    \ is more limited compared to generic wireless protocols\nlike Bluetooth and WiFi.\
    \ Additionally, cellular and satellite communication oﬀer the advantage of\nproviding\
    \ a direct link to a web server instead of passing through an intermediate gateway.\n\

    \ for common communication protocols [81,82]. Bubble size is\nproportional to\
    \ data rate.\nEven though many organizations in LMICs have developed IoT systems\
    \ for agriculture, few studies\nhave reported on the implementation in a smallholder\
    \ context and associated outcomes. Research in\nEmbu County, Kenya tested diﬀerent\
    \ proximal soil sensors to estimate soil properties and composition\non smallholder\
    \ plots and provided management recommendations to farmers [57]. The measurements\n\
    showed considerable variation, both within plots and regionally, indicating a\
    \ need for management\nrecommendations based on both local measurements and regional\
    \ soil maps. Another application\nimplemented a tracing system for smallholders\
    \ who raised live poultry that were traded in Vietnam to\nprevent the spread of\
    \ avian inﬂuenza [75]. Low-cost radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) tags on\n\
    transport cages and electronic tag readers at markets tracked birds from farm-to-market,\
    \ revealing\nthat birds passed through up to six intermediate traders, creating\
    \ a high risk of virus transmission.\nMany commercial entities serving smallholder\
    \ farmers use the IoT to track assets and interface digitally\nwith customers;\
    \ for example, tractors and implements for hire by Hello Tractor in West Africa\
    \ and\nEM3 AgriServices in India [83], and irrigation equipment by Agriworks,\
    \ Futurepump, and SunCulture\nin East Africa [84]. Enrollment in these services\
    \ is enabling more productive growing; however,\nlow digital literacy is a barrier\
    \ that requires a mix of traditional and technology-enabled engagement\nwith farmers.\
    \ A notable case is the use of sensors to monitor borehole pump reliability for\
    \ potable and\nirrigation water supply in East Africa, which is discussed later\
    \ in this article.\n3.2. Implementation Cases\nIn addition to reviewing the literature\
    \ and interviewing experts, we found it useful to study\non-the-ground implementations\
    \ of the IoT for smallholder agriculture. In particular, this research\naimed\
    \ to understand what helps to create an enabling environment at the country level,\
    \ and the keys to\nsuccess and the risks associated with active IoT in smallholder\
    \ agriculture projects in India and Kenya.\nIndia is home to over 130 million\
    \ smallholder farms [85] and is a common testbed and incubator for\ndigital services\
    \ for farmers. Site visits and discussions in India focused on identifying the\
    \ factors that\nenable innovations in the agricultural sector in order to promote\
    \ those in GFSS countries. The following\nis a summary of those factors.\n• Mobile\
    \ network connectivity and cost: Relatively cheap monthly mobile data plans of\n\
    0.21 USD/GB [38,39] have helped IoT companies explore opportunities to work with\
    \ sensors using\ncellular services for data transmission.\n• Market opportunity:\
    \ The large population size and density, and increasing incomes of the Indian\n\
    middle class, make India a lucrative market for IoT providers [41].\nSustainability\
    \ 2020, 12, 3750\n8 of 19\n• Policies to support farmers: Agriculture accounts\
    \ for 17.32% of India’s GDP and employs over\n50% of the population, and some\
    \ state governments are providing subsidies for new farm equipment\nthat could\
    \ be leveraged towards precision agriculture purchases [40].\n• Academic institutions:\
    \ Some of the highest ranking academic institutions in India are performing\n\
    research that beneﬁts Indian farmers and are raising the awareness of farming\
    \ challenges to students\nthrough hackathons.\nKenya represents a very diﬀerent\
    \ landscape compared to India. The population and total number\nof farm holdings\
    \ are vastly smaller, and many of the enabling factors discussed above are yet\
    \ to emerge.\nHowever, Kenya was selected because, among the diﬀerent GFSS countries,\
    \ the authors’ investigations\nand discussions revealed several active IoT for\
    \ agriculture cases across diﬀerent applications and\nlocations in Kenya. These\
    \ cases are summarized in this section along with some of the keys to the\nsuccess\
    \ and the associated risks with project sustainability.\nAs part of the Kenya\
    \ Resilient Arid Lands Partnership for Integrated Development (RAPID) project\n\
    to manage the recently discovered Lodwar Basin Aquifer in northern Kenya, electrical\
    \ current sensors\nwere installed on solar-electric borehole pumps to monitor\
    \ “water system functionality, the approximate\nnumber of pumping hours and volume\
    \ extracted per day, and the last report date for the sensor” [86].\nData from\
    \ the current sensors are transmitted via cellular or satellite network to a web\
    \ server and\ndashboard where county government staﬀ can monitor borehole use.\
    \ While the pumped water serves a\nvariety of community needs, some is used for\
    \ irrigating small farm plots on municipal land that would\notherwise be infertile\
    \ (Figure 7). One of the keys to the success of this IoT implementation was the\
    \ clear\nvalue and utility to the government oﬃcials responsible for the pumps,\
    \ who indicated that access to the\ndashboard signiﬁcantly reduced maintenance\
    \ costs and pump downtime. The Kenya RAPID project\nalso beneﬁts from having a\
    \ large, distributed, and well-coordinated team where each organization\nplays\
    \ a clear role, including the supplier of the IoT technology. The sensor measurements\
    \ have revealed\ndetailed pump usage patterns in relation to rainfall [74], and\
    \ this, coupled with a machine learning\nalgorithm to predict failures and reduce\
    \ detection time, has resulted in an increase in system-wide\npump uptime from\
    \ 70% to > 99% [87]. A risk for the project is the current reliance on grant funding,\n\
    although the IoT component has now been incorporated into the county government\
    \ budget.\nBorehole pump monitoring for small plot community farming in Turkana\n\

    \ in Lodwar, Kenya\n(left), and a SweetSense gateway mounted on solar PV panels\
    \ that transmits solar irrigation pump\nusage data to an online server via cellular\
    \ or satellite data (right).\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n9 of 19\nThe IoT\
    \ solution for the aquaponics system at Kikaboni Farm was developed by Upande,\
    \ and it\nmonitors water conditions (temperature and pH) in the ﬁsh tanks and\
    \ environmental conditions\n(ambient temperature and relative humidity) in the\
    \ hydroponic vegetable growing area (Figure 8).\nThe sensors are battery-powered,\
    \ charged by 3–10 W solar PV panels, and transmit measurements\nover a LoRa network\
    \ to a gateway with a mobile data connection. Data are stored and processed\n\
    on Upande servers and regularly fed back to the farm’s horticulture manager who\
    \ can perform\nnecessary adjustments. For example, the cover material for the\
    \ vegetable structure was changed after\nmeasurements showed that temperatures\
    \ were far above the recommended growing temperatures for\nleafy green vegetables\
    \ (Figure 8). One of the keys to success for this application is the ability of\
    \ the\nhorticulture manager to interpret the data, which has allowed them to make\
    \ signiﬁcant improvements\nto their product yield and quality. Kikaboni Farm has\
    \ also collaborated on product development by\nproviding a testbed for improvements\
    \ to Upande Vipimo IoT products.\nA risk for this project is the reliance on the\
    \ expertise and willingness of the horticulture manager.\nWater and greenhouse\

    \ and relative humidity sensor in the aquaponics greenhouse\nat Kikaboni Farm.\
    \ (bottom) Lettuce plants growing in the aquaponics beds before (left) and after\n\
    (right) improvements to the growing environment.\nWith little vegetation in the\
    \ Mara River watershed, rainy season precipitation causes rapid river\nlevel rise\
    \ and destructive ﬂooding (Figure 9). The IoT solution developed by Upande consists\
    \ of\nsolar-battery powered sound navigation and ranging (SONAR) level sensors\
    \ at several points along\nthe river, connected by LoRa to several grid-connected\
    \ gateways with cellular access. In the event\nthat the level sensors detect a\
    \ rapid river level rise, an SMS-based system is activated, which alerts\ndownstream\
    \ farmers to pump water out of the river in order to open capacity to receive\
    \ the upstream\nsurge. One of the keys to the success of this system is the dedication\
    \ of volunteers to coordinate\nactivities, maintain the IoT system, and host workshops\
    \ to engage the local communities. Some of\nthe risks to the sustainability of\
    \ this project are a lack of ﬁnancial support, the rugged and remote\nconditions\
    \ that the IoT must survive in, and the inconsistent support from the county government\
    \ to\nallow the system to operate.\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n10 of 19\n\

    \ to grow high-value vegetables throughout\nthe year in a controlled environment.\
    \ However, uncontrolled greenhouse conditions can be harsh and\ndamaging to plants.\
    \ Researchers at the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology developed an IoT\n\
    temperature, relative humidity, and soil moisture sensor coupled to an internet-connected\
    \ gateway to\nassist farmers on their research farm (Figure 10) [34]. In this\
    \ case, the system relies on the expertise of\nthe farmers to interpret data and\
    \ make the proper adjustments to the greenhouse. The farmers showed\na high level\
    \ of satisfaction with the system and reported that it had greatly improved productivity\
    \ of\ntomatoes in their greenhouses. A key to the success of this project is the\
    \ close connection and proximity\nbetween the IoT developers and the farmers,\
    \ and the ability of the farmers to interpret the sensor\nmeasurements. This project\
    \ is also equipping engineering students with the skills and experience\nneeded\
    \ to provide commercial IoT for agriculture solutions in Kenya [88]. A potential\
    \ risk to the\nsustainability of this project is that steady funding is needed\
    \ to build a pipeline of work given the\nexpertise, location, and access to research\
    \ agriculture facilities.\nGreenhouse monitoring in Nyeri\nFigure 10. Greenhouse\

    \ available to smallholder farmers, Arable has developed a\nmulti-parameter IoT\
    \ device with a suite of sensors for measurements including ambient temperature,\n\
    humidity, precipitation, Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation Index (NDVI), and photosynthetic\
    \ active\nradiation (Figure 11) [22,60]. During current pilots in central Kenya,\
    \ the devices are installed on\nsmallholder farms and data is transmitted through\
    \ cellular network to cloud servers where it is stored\nand analyzed. Reduced\
    \ data is fed back to Kenyan partner researchers and agriculture extension\nagents\
    \ who oﬀer advice to area farmers. Agriculture extension agents reported that\
    \ the local-scale\ninformation is a valuable supplement to regional forecasts\
    \ provided by the Kenyan government and\nhelp them to provide better advice to\
    \ farmers. A risk to this project is the challenge of determining an\neconomical\
    \ pathway to sustain and expand the IoT technology and staﬀ in the ecosystem.\n\

    \ of Challenges and Recommendations\nBased on our literature review, expert interviews,\
    \ surveys, and site visits, the team has synthesized\na list of the challenges\
    \ in IoT for smallholder agriculture in GFSS countries (summarized in Figure 12),\n\
    and proposed recommendations for some of the relevant players involved. The following\
    \ section is\na summary of challenges grouped into ﬁve categories, which correspond\
    \ to the IoT architecture in\nFigure 1: (i) measurement device, (ii) data transmission,\
    \ (iii) data storage and analytics, (iv) feedback\nand implementation, and (v)\
    \ project structure and support. A detailed discussion of the challenges,\nopportunities,\
    \ and recommendations for the IoT for smallholder agriculture can be found in\
    \ the full\nproject report [25]. We believe that this section will be appealing\
    \ to audiences beyond the academic\nand research community, and speciﬁc recommendations\
    \ are segmented towards Technologists, Project\nmanagers, and Funders.\n \nFigure\
    \ 12. Challenges in IoT for smallholder agriculture.\nSustainability 2020, 12,\
    \ 3750\n12 of 19\n3.3.1. Measurement Device Challenges\nAccess to components:\
    \ Oﬀ-the-shelf IoT products are often not available, suitable, or aﬀordable\n\
    for commercial technologies in developing countries. Therefore, custom made solutions\
    \ are designed\nin-house or by local IoT companies. During our site visit in Kenya,\
    \ a number of IoT implementation\nteams that we spoke to indicated that procuring\
    \ electronic and hardware components during the\nproduct development phase often\
    \ delayed the project and increased costs.\nTechnologists: A good starting point\
    \ for prototype circuit components is the local electronics and\nscrap market\
    \ (e.g., CBD in Nairobi, Kisenyi in Kampala, Suame Magazine in Kumasi). These\
    \ markets\nusually stock basic circuit and prototyping components that can be\
    \ used as a “good enough” solution\nto reach a proof-of-concept prototype.\nDevice\
    \ design: Smallholder farms are often in rugged and remote locations and require\
    \ special\nconsideration when designing a connected, electronic device for long-term\
    \ monitoring.\nTechnologists: As soon as possible in the design process, test\
    \ your device at a pilot site that is\nrepresentative of the actual implementation\
    \ site.\nProject managers: Involve the farmers, agriculture extension agents,\
    \ and farmer co-operatives in the\nproduct design phase to help your team identify\
    \ non-obvious challenges and improve the likelihood\nthat farmers will accept\
    \ the idea.\nSensor calibration: Correlating the raw sensor measurements to actual\
    \ physical values requires\nperforming controlled calibration tests that can be\
    \ expensive and time consuming.\nTechnologists: Aim to eventually provide calibration\
    \ documentation for your product so that it can\nbe benchmarked against other\
    \ products and measurement methods. Perform some simple tests to\ncheck factory-calibrated\
    \ sensors in conditions as close to the implementation conditions as possible\
    \ in\ncase there is a need to apply a correction factor.\nAccess to expertise:\n\
    Many teams we visited mentioned a lack of access to expertise and\nresources for\
    \ technical and business challenges. For example, several engineers reported spending\n\
    signiﬁcant amounts of time combing through websites to ﬁnd technical solutions\
    \ during their\nproduct development.\nTechnologists: Participate in online communities\
    \ focused on IoT for agriculture hardware, especially\nfor idea exchange, technical\
    \ support, and recruiting. For example, we found the Gathering of Open Ag\nTech\
    \ to be a good example of such a resource in the agriculture sector (forum.goatech.org).\n\
    3.3.2. Data Transmission Challenges:\nPoor connectivity: Due to the remote location\
    \ of some farming communities, poor mobile network\nconnectivity and reliability\
    \ is a common challenge.\nTechnologists: As a last resort, data can be collected\
    \ manually, i.e., from a central hub connected to\nindividual devices by a local\
    \ wireless network.\nProject managers: Check mobile network coverage in your implementation\
    \ area using GSMA maps\nand cross-check with non-industry sources, for example,\
    \ a compilation of user contributed Nperf data.\nTransmission cost: While data\
    \ costs have decreased signiﬁcantly, the recurring cost of providing\nIoT services\
    \ was frequently identiﬁed as a challenge for commercial applications.\nTechnologists:\
    \ For some applications, satellite and LPWAN-based service providers are increasingly\n\
    cost-competitive with conventional mobile data.\n3.3.3. Data Storage and Analytics\n\
    Measurement to feedback: Raw sensor measurements can be diﬃcult to reduce into\
    \ actionable\nrecommendations for farmers.\nProject managers: While measurements\
    \ are relatively easy to display on a dashboard, correlating\nthem with crop growth\
    \ and other eﬀects requires input from a topical expert. Accessing the right\n\
    Sustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n13 of 19\nexpertise can be a challenge in itself,\
    \ but resources at universities and agricultural extension agencies\ncan often\
    \ give some direction.\nTechnologists: Take a human centered approach by having\
    \ farmers and agriculture experts from\nthe area provide input on (a) what kind\
    \ of recommendations would be useful and actionable and (b)\nthe best means for\
    \ the farmer to receive the recommendation.\nEquity of access: The ownership of\
    \ data collected is often overlooked in IoT projects and can lead\nto disagreements\
    \ among stakeholders.\nProject managers: Negotiate data access with project partners\
    \ and funders. While it is important\nto maintain community access to data, service\
    \ providers and funders may have requirements for\ndata access.\nFunders: Communicate\
    \ early with the project implementers and have clear guidelines on data\naccess,\
    \ privacy, ownership, and sharing mechanisms of the data with the community.\n\
    3.3.4. Feedback and Implementation\nSmartphone penetration: Many agriculture advisory\
    \ mobile apps are designed for use on\na smartphones; however, smartphone penetration\
    \ is low among rural populations in GFSS\ncountries [89,90].\nProject managers:\
    \ Make sure the output is reaching the intended audience in a format that is\n\
    accessible to them. If smartphone penetration is low, then using another medium\
    \ such as radio,\ntelevision, local print media, or extension agents can be appropriate\
    \ to provide recommendations\nto farming communities [17]. Early discussions with\
    \ farmers, farmer co-operatives, and agriculture\nextension agents could help\
    \ to make sure that the output is reaching the audience through the right\ncommunication\
    \ channel.\nRemote location: Many smallholder farms are in remote, diﬃcult-to-access\
    \ locations, which can\nadd signiﬁcant cost to IoT services if technicians need\
    \ to regularly visit farms.\nTechnologists: Incorporate onboard diagnostics for\
    \ your device (e.g., battery voltage, microcontroller\ntemperature, accelerometer)\
    \ in order to minimize maintenance visits.\nProject managers: Identify a local\
    \ farmer or extension agent who can assist with basic sensor\nmaintenance and\
    \ troubleshooting, for example, the horticulture manager at Kikaboni Farm described\n\
    in Section 3.2.\nIoT revenue generation: Identifying the best customer for the\
    \ information collected is important.\nIn many cases, there is an opportunity\
    \ to provide a service along with the hardware, which can provide\nrecurring revenue.\n\
    Project managers: Many IoT for agriculture projects are initially grant funded,\
    \ and determining\napproaches to monetize data and analytics services will help\
    \ ensure project sustainability. Consider\nthis aspect when agreeing on the terms\
    \ of the funding.\n3.3.5. Project Structure and Support\nComplicated ecosystem:\n\
    Successfully implementing an agriculture-IoT project involves\ncoordination of\
    \ a large, and sometimes complicated, ecosystem of actors over a long timescale.\n\
    Project managers: Try to organize a team of collaborators that includes data scientists,\
    \ sensor\nexperts, and agriculture experts so that each is contributing to solving\
    \ a speciﬁc part of the problem in\nwhich he/she is an expert.\nIoT business model:\
    \ Most people we connected with during this project agreed that data from\non-farm\
    \ sensors is valuable. However, identifying a speciﬁc customer, or buyer, of the\
    \ device or\nservice is less straightforward, especially when the beneﬁciary is\
    \ unlikely to have the means to aﬀord\nthe technology.\nProject managers: Identifying\
    \ and understanding whom the end customer is and who will be\npaying for the data\
    \ is important. A good example is the Kenya RAPID project, described in Section\
    \ 3.2,\nin which the county government includes the IoT services in their annual\
    \ budget.\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n14 of 19\nShort funding timelines: Two-\
    \ and three-year grants from donor agencies are short timelines;\nwhen it comes\
    \ to farming seasons, this is a relatively short time period because you get data\
    \ from\nonly one or two cropping cycles, so collecting quality data and making\
    \ actionable recommendations is\na challenge.\nFunders: Increase funding timelines\
    \ to ﬁve to seven years to allow for data collection over multiple\ncropping periods.\
    \ A larger dataset also enables better pattern recognition and predictive analytics,\n\
    leading to suitable actionable recommendations.\nVertical integration: Many organizations\
    \ are providing an end-to-end solution in which a\nsingle organization takes on\
    \ the responsibility of farmer recruitment, IoT technology development,\nimplementation,\
    \ data analysis and recommendations, and monitoring and evaluation.\nProject managers:\
    \ Some of the key stakeholders the team spoke with indicated that, while they\n\
    were experts in a few aspects of the IoT and agriculture, trying to work on the\
    \ entire end-to-end process\nof an agriculture IoT ecosystem was stretching them\
    \ thin; thus, incorporating a horizontal structure in\nwhich each organization\
    \ oﬀers speciﬁc expertise to solve the overall problem in a piecemeal fashion\
    \ is\nfavorable for project success.\nFunders: Funding agencies can play a facilitation\
    \ role to connect diverse groups with speciﬁc\nexpertise to solve the overall\
    \ problem. Organizations forming new partnerships could particularly\nbeneﬁt from\
    \ guidance in negotiating agreements and contracts.\n4. Conclusions\nThis review\
    \ presents a perspective of the current state of the IoT in smallholder agriculture,\n\
    including summaries of state-of-the-art sensor and communication technologies\
    \ and real examples of\nIoT implementation on farms in Kenya, and the challenges\
    \ and recommendations associated with the\nimplementation of IoT on smallholder\
    \ farms in LMICs. The barriers and challenges are largely known\nand surmountable,\
    \ and viable implementation of the IoT is already occurring. Currently, applications\
    \ for\nscenarios with easily detectable and actionable parameters offer more immediate\
    \ promise and likelihood\nof uptake than those implementing measurements that\
    \ are more difficult to interpret. Additionally,\ntargeting measurements that\
    \ address a significant pain point (e.g., water supply reliability) can ensure\n\
    buy-in from and value to the communities involved. Major evolving challenges due\
    \ to climate change\nwill motivate implementation of the IoT to improve resilience\
    \ and secure safety nets for global food\nsupply. Greater resilience and agricultural\
    \ productivity have the potential to strengthen rural economies\nand help developing\
    \ countries along their journey to self-reliance. The IoT for agriculture objective\n\
    remains: To gather sufficient quantities of data of the right type, from the right\
    \ location, at a low cost,\nand with sufficiently well-informed analysis and understanding\
    \ for farmers to take action.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available\

    Received 09 Jul 2018 Accepted 30 Oct 2018 Published 18 Nov 2018 Abstract The Internet
    of Things (IoT) is a network of Internet-enabled devices that can sense, communicate,
    and react to changes in their environment. Billions of these computing devices
    are connected to the Internet to exchange data between themselves and/or their
    infrastructure. IoT promises to enable a plethora of smart services in almost
    every aspect of our daily interactions and improve the overall quality of life.
    However, with the increasing wide adoption of IoT, come significant privacy concerns
    to lose control of how our data is collected and shared with others. As such,
    privacy is a core requirement in any IoT ecosystem and is a major concern that
    inhibits its widespread user adoption. The ultimate source of user discomfort
    is the lack of control over personal raw data that is directly streamed from sensors
    to the outside world. In this survey, we review existing research and proposed
    solutions to rising privacy concerns from a multipoint of view to identify the
    risks and mitigations. First, we provide an evaluation of privacy issues and concerns
    in IoT systems due to resource constraints. Second, we describe the proposed IoT
    solutions that embrace a variety of privacy concerns such as identification, tracking,
    monitoring, and profiling. Lastly, we discuss the mechanisms and architectures
    for protecting IoT data in case of mobility at the device layer, infrastructure/platform
    layer, and application layer. 1. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) is
    a group of connected physical devices that exchange data about themselves and
    their environments and may take actions on it. The 2017 report of the International
    Data Corporation [ 1] forecasts that 50 billion devices will be connected by 2020
    with a $8.9 trillion market value. Gartner [ 2] published a similar study expecting
    that, in 2020, 50 Billion devices will have their own unique Identifier with a
    $19 trillion market share opportunity. Not only are IoT devices equipped with
    a varying level of computational power (e.g., microcontrollers) but also many
    run a full stack operating system (e.g., Contiki [ 3] and RIOT [ 4]) that enables
    these devices to perform high-level functionality. The main strength of IoT is
    the huge impact it will have on several aspects of the user’s everyday interactions
    and the surrounding environment (e.g., smart spaces). This will improve our quality
    of life in different domains [ 5] as shown in Figure 1 including Energy [ 6],
    Safety, Security, Industry [ 7], Environment, Entertainment, and Healthcare [
    8]. However, IoT devices are intrinsically resource-constrained in terms of computation,
    battery power, intermittent connectivity, and network protocols.    Figure 1  Internet
    of Things applications. These constraints directly impact the choice of technology
    applicable to maintain user privacy. Hence, promoting IoT adoption from the user
    perspective and mitigating potential risks of data misuse and security concerns.
    IoT devices do not commonly implement a standard security scheme [ 3, 4], which
    means there is a huge risk to connect this large number of unsecured devices to
    the Internet [ 9]. Proofpoint Inc. has uncovered the first proven cyberattack
    based on IoT household smart appliances between December 23, 2013, and January
    6, 2014. This attack involved more than 750,000 malicious email communications
    coming from more than 100,000 everyday consumer gadgets such as home routers,
    smart TVs, and smart refrigerators [ 10]. In 2015, two ethical hackers, Charlie
    Miller and Chris Valasek, gained control of a Jeep Cherokee remotely through vulnerability
    in its onboard entertainment system. According to the hackers, they were able
    to break the Uconnect system that the Chrysler’s line-up of cars and trucks use
    due to open vulnerability. Hundreds of thousands of vehicles could be affected.
    In October 2016, a major DDoS attack took down several giant servers such as Airbnb,
    Reddit, Etsy, Sound Cloud, New York Times, Amazon, Twitter, and Spotify. Though
    it is not clear yet that the blame is on IoT, it is quite likely. IoT devices
    are considered not only a security threat, but also a major privacy concern, as
    these devices collect much personal data such as user identity, location, energy
    consumption, and telephone numbers. This information can reveal a lot about the
    user’s daily life activities (e.g., using washing machines, watching TV, and leaving
    or returning home). The major concern yet is that these devices not only can collect
    users’ private data but also can control their environments. Thus, users are highly
    uncomfortable exposing personal data to public or private servers without a well-established
    trust model [ 11]. Therefore, the lack of well-designed IoT-oriented privacy and
    security techniques will inhibit the user adoption to any IoT technology [ 12].
    The following scenario embodies much of the semantic meaning of user privacy leakage
    and associated risks. Ahmed looks at his smartwatch while doing his usual workout
    and sees that his heart rate is a little high. Once he arrived home, he speaks
    to the smart speaker installed in his room to provide him a list of nearby cardiologists
    to check his heart and blood vessels. Next day after finishing his work, Ahmed
    visited a cardiologist, and he felt relieved when his doctor reassured everything
    is fine. “You just did more exercises than usual and nothing to worry about”,
    the doctor said. The next day, every time Ahmed uses his browser he finds too
    many advertisements related to heart medication, heart monitoring devices, and
    many tutorials about diagnosing a heart attack and how to handle it. Things got
    more serious when he received a phone call from his insurance company for check-up
    survey. “Goodbye privacy”, he whispers to himself as he speaks with the company
    representative. This is only one scenario of too many that shows high privacy
    risks associated with modern technology usage that has become an inevitable part
    of our everyday life. There exist many published surveys on IoT privacy and security
    issues, challenges, and solutions. Ziegeldorf et al. [ 13] analyze the privacy
    issues in IoT. Their focus is on classifying the various privacy threats and pointing
    out the challenges in IoT scenarios. Sadeghi et al. [ 14] introduce the security
    and privacy challenges of industrial IoT systems. They also discuss possible solutions
    towards a complete and secure framework for industrial IoT. Sicari et al. [ 15]
    focus on the main security challenges and the current solutions. They categorize
    the issues into authentication, access control, confidentiality, privacy, trust,
    secure middleware, mobile security, and policy enforcement. Suo et al. [ 16] review
    the security and privacy in IoT, where they analyze the security architecture
    and features. They also discuss ongoing research status and the challenges of
    secure technologies including encryption mechanism, communication security, protecting
    sensor data, and cryptographic algorithms to support privacy preservation in IoT.
    Although security and privacy are highly correlated, this paper primarily focuses
    on privacy challenges and discusses a broad range of privacy-related aspects in
    open IoT environments to provide better insights on the design principles and
    development of privacy preserving IoT environments. The remainder of this paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the unique characteristics of IoT
    posing significant challenges on resource-constrained IoT devices. We also discuss
    the notion of privacy in IoT by pointing out some scenarios related to privacy
    concerns. Section 3 describes major IoT privacy issues and concerns such as identification,
    tracking, monitoring, and profiling. Then, we discuss existing IoT privacy solutions
    in Section 5. Section 6 provides a comprehensive analysis of privacy issues and
    mechanisms at the different layers of the IoT stack, namely, Device Layer, Platform
    Layer, and application layer, respectively. Lastly, Section 7 concludes the paper
    and provides closing notes. 2. Privacy in the Internet of Things IoT provides
    consumers with a high degree of automation and control on how to carry out everyday
    tasks through saturating the environment with smart things. IoT smart things refer
    to a broad spectrum of nonstandard computing devices including microcontrollers,
    sensors, and actuators that can transmit and exchange data to enable smarter interactions
    and support informed decision making. Things are embedded in consumers'' devices
    and industrial machinery to collect and exchange data about the surroundings.
    Things can also cause physical changes to their environments and can be controlled
    directly from proximity or remotely via Internet. Although privacy concerns discussed
    in this paper are generally valid for any IoT deployments, we provide examples
    related to consumers'' connected devices such as smart appliances to make the
    point clear. In addition, the pace at which consumers'' smart devices are developed
    is much higher than the development of safeguard techniques that can protect these
    devices and their data collection from growing privacy threats. Given the high
    penetration of IoT devices and their impact on our everyday life, we need to fully
    understand the risks and challenges such devices pose on our privacy. More importantly,
    we need to answer the following question: Is it possible to support privacy preserving
    and safe environment for IoT users such those offered in traditional Internet?
    To precisely answer this question, we need first to discriminate between relevant
    terminologies such as privacy, trust, and security. Privacy means that information
    about individuals must be protected and should not be exposed without explicit
    consent under any circumstances. Every individual has the ultimate right to decide
    with whom to share their data. For example, in our previous scenario, Ahmed should
    be the only one to decide whether to share his heart conditions with the insurance
    company or not. Trust is defined as the product of attack probability and the
    damage it can cause. Trust is derived from two crucial terms: transparency and
    consistency. Transparency means that IoT devices collecting information inform
    the user about what data is collected, the purpose of collection, and how the
    collected data will be used. Consistency means that the behaviour of IoT devices
    consistently meets user expectation. For example, if a user asks his smart speaker
    to control the room light, it must do nothing unintended, but the specific requested
    task. Security refers to the protection of devices and connection from unauthorized
    access. Based on the aforementioned definitions, it is evident that privacy is
    more general than both security and trust. For instance, an IoT service could
    gain user trust and provide proper security but still violates the user’s privacy
    by exposing personal data without clear and explicit permissions. 2.1. Impact
    of Device Limitations on Privacy IoT smart things are typically resource-constrained
    with limited capabilities due to size and weight (e.g., memory, processing, and
    battery power) and network connectivity (e.g., IEEE 802.15.4). For example, IEEE
    802.15.4 specification is constrained with respect to (1) low data rates, which
    range from 20 Kbits/s (868 MHz) to 250 Kbits/s (2.45 GHz), (2) unreliable and
    lossy links compared to wired links, (3) small packet size (127 bytes), which
    means less room for payload when including other headers, and (4) aggressive power
    cycle, by which IoT smart things aim to save power by staying longer in low-power
    mode. Such constraints directly impact the type and complexity of functionality
    that IoT devices can run. Recently, significant efforts have been made towards
    standardizing the IoT protocol stack [ 17]. For example, to enable low-power connectivity
    among smart objects in IoT systems, the IEEE 802.15.4–2006 low-power physical
    (PHY) layer and the IEEE 802.15.4e link layer based on Time Synchronized Channel
    Hopping (TSCH) have been developed in 2006 [ 18]. Several scholars pointed out
    the technical challenges that face IoT environments due to various resource constraints.
    Yu et al. [ 19] consider IoT devices as weak access points to vital infrastructures
    (e.g., a medical or military facility) and can be misused to leak sensitive data.
    The authors have made two main observations regarding IoT systems: (1) network-based
    approaches are less vulnerable than host-based approaches due to inherent limitations
    and possible unpatched vulnerabilities on IoT devices; (2) traditional static
    perimeter defenses are unable to secure IoT devices, since these devices are deployed
    deep inside the network, with their physical and computational context constantly
    changing. Therefore, resource limitations make it challenging to secure IoT layers
    individually. Table 1 lists the top countries, in Sept 2017, with IoT devices
    (237,539 devices) vulnerable to Heartbleed [ 20] according to SHODAN [ 21] and
    other sources. Table 1  List of top countries with vulnerable IoT devices. 2.2.
    Impact of Complex Heterogeneity on IoT Privacy IoT has intrinsic complexity, since
    multiple diverse objects located in different contexts can exchange information
    among each other. This complicates the design and deployment of efficient, interoperable,
    and scalable mechanisms to preserve users’ privacy. Heterogeneity also has significant
    influence on the design of IoT protocols. Recourse-constrained devices will interact
    with one another/infrastructure (e.g., web servers and cloudlets) either directly
    or through gateways. In this case, it is essential to implement or create lightweight
    security protocols that support an end-to-end secure communication channel. These
    protocols require implementing distributing management system to distribute credentials
    and facilitate keys session establishment between peers. The data flooding caused
    by billions of IoT devices is a big threat, in a way that hurts and violates the
    user’s privacy. One of the main violations of the large volume of data exchange
    is linking this data to a certain user. So, the user’s anonymity is another dimension
    that must be taken into consideration to support privacy in connected environments.
    Further, creating mechanisms to provide data summarization and access policies
    related to private data will enable transparency and avoid IoT silently taking
    control of our lives. There exist several surveys focusing on the impact of IoT
    heterogeneity on users’ privacy. Heer, T. et al. [ 22] provide a number of requirements
    to secure IoT environments and preserve user privacy through overcoming specific
    technical limitations including (1) complex heterogeneity of IoT systems, which
    complicates protocol design and system operation; (2) scarce CPU and memory resources,
    which limit the use of resource-demanding cryptoprimitives, such as public-key
    cryptography as used in most Internet security standards; and (3) end-to-end security
    measures that are IoT-oriented, since traditional Internet-based approaches are
    typically inapplicable due to resource limitations. The lessons we learned so
    far suggests that resource limitations are a major inhibitor to the adoption of
    traditional techniques as is. IoT architectures must implement privacy by design
    from the ground up [ 23], to provide users with central control over their security
    and privacy. 3. Motivating Scenarios The vulnerabilities of IoT devices can lead
    to huge security breaks and threaten user privacy by exposing vital personal information.
    In this section, we provide some scenarios of IoT applications where personal
    data can be breached. 3.1. Smart Home Utility Monitoring According to a recent
    report published by US Energy Information Administration (EIA) in 2017 [ 24],
    64.7 million smart meters have been installed in electric utilities in 2015. Around
    88% of these installations were residential upgrades as shown in Table 2. These
    smart meters measure and log electricity usage at a minimum of 1-hour intervals
    but can report readings in real-time at a much higher sampling rate. This data
    is collected by utility companies at least once a day. Smart meters range from
    basic hourly interval meters to real-time meters equipped with two-way communication
    that is capable of recording and transmitting instantaneous data. Natural gas
    meters and water meters are also on the rise and likely count to similar numbers.
    However, EIA does not publish their data publicly. The extensive deployment of
    smart meters has serious privacy implications since they unintentionally leak
    detailed information about residents’ activities. Processing and analyzing this
    information can lead to serious privacy leakage such as profiling the behaviour
    of the residents. Furthermore, with existing sophisticated analytics such data
    may reveal when residents are home and what may be their heath conditions (e.g.,
    toilet flushing rate may indicate that the resident has diarrhoea). This does
    not stop at breaking the user privacy but may very much lead to life-threating
    situations. Table 2  Number of AMI installations by sector, 2015. Molina-Markham
    et al. [ 25] raise awareness around privacy issues related to the use of smart
    meters. They show that even without knowing any information about household activities,
    applying off-the-shelf statistical methods can easily extract complex usage patterns
    from smart meter data. Their work is based on data collected over a 2-month period
    from three homes. The data contains household power consumption aggregated at
    1-second rate. Even with this small-scale deployment, the authors managed to demonstrate
    the latent for power consumption patterns to reveal a range of personal information,
    such as how many people are in the house, sleeping routines, and eating routines.
    The proposed privacy-enhancing smart meter is based on 3 components: household
    smart meters, neighbourhood gateways, and a remote utility server. The server
    applies Zero-Knowledge (ZK) protocols [ 26] that allow a prover (smart meter)
    to demonstrate the knowledge of a secret (collected data) to a verifier (gateway/server),
    without revealing any information that help the verifier to infer the secret.
    This enables utility companies to accomplish their goals without compromising
    the customer’s privacy. Apthorpe et al. [ 27] discuss the same concern. However,
    they point out that an Internet Service provider (ISP) or other network observers
    can gather private and sensitive information about home activities by analyzing
    Internet traffic from smart homes containing IoT devices even if the devices use
    secure encryption. Several strategies have been investigated to avoid the privacy
    risks associated with smart home traffic monitoring such as traffic blocking,
    tunnelling, and rate-shaping. However, the user cannot block outgoing traffic
    from their home; otherwise their devices will be unusable. While traffic tunnelling
    via a VPN is more secure, it does not totally guarantee privacy preserving. Authors
    propose the use of traffic shaping using Independent Link Padding (ILP) to prevent
    the leak of rate information and thus render attacks impossible. 3.2. Crowdsourcing
    and Public Monitoring Crowdsourcing is the use of collective knowledge of a large
    crowd to help solving a specific problem. Crowdsourcing benefits from high penetration
    of smartphones, which becomes the common mobile platform for users worldwide.
    Developers and average users with limited programming experience can create feature-rich/personalized
    applications by simply requesting access to private information such as location,
    contact lists, media files, etc. However, this model raises serious privacy concerns
    with no trust mechanisms that govern how applications access and handle such private
    information. It is also technically possible that applications may gain unauthorized
    access to the device’s camera, networks, and system settings. Mobile Crowdsourcing
    Networks (MCN) include four basic types of entities as depicted in Figure 2: (i)
    The service provider is a crowdsourcing platform that offers crowdsourcing services
    to both end users and public crowds. (ii) End users are the clients who purchase
    or rent crowdsourcing services at a certain cost. (iii) Sensing crowd is a crowd
    of mobile users who accept and participate in crowdsourced sensing tasks. (iv)
    Computing crowd is a crowd of users who accept and participate in crowdsourced
    computing tasks (sensing-based computing tasks, or pure computing tasks).    Figure
    2  General architecture of mobile crowdsourcing networks (reproduced from [ 28]).
    Yang et al. [ 28] point out that the privacy may be leaked out from either data
    or tasks. Privacy threats resulting from data leakage can be divided into three
    categories. (1) privacy of sensed data contains personal information about participants,
    such as identities, location information, and biometric information. For example,
    the location information can be easily obtained either from GPS receivers embedded
    in mobile devices or triangulation-based approaches on Wi-Fi or cellular networks.
    Moreover, environmental context such as ambient temperature, light, noise level
    may also reveal the location information. The disclosure of the location information
    may leak the privacy of participants, such as home and workplace locations, routines,
    and habits. (2) Privacy of crowdsourced data may contain sensitive information,
    such as business and financial records, proprietary research data, or personal
    health information. (3) Privacy of crowdsourcing results can be analyzed to infer
    sensitive information not authorized/known by the service provider. 4. Evaluation
    of Privacy Threats in IoT IoT increasingly evolve with new emerging technologies
    and services. In this section, we discuss the various privacy threats and challenges
    associated with IoT environments. We provide a solid definition and a concrete
    example of privacy violation for each threat. Then, we discuss the impact of IoT
    evolution on this threat. Lastly, we point out the main challenges associated
    with these threats as well as any correlation when exists. 4.1. User Identification
    From privacy perspectives, user identification is the ability to distinguish a
    person (or an entity) or revealing their identity based on a piece of acquired
    data (e.g., name, address, or personal information). The risk of such a threat
    is that privacy-violating actions could be carried out after the customer is identified.
    This threat enables and aggravates other threats, e.g., profiling and tracking
    of individuals’ behaviour. It also allows for linking information from different
    sources for the same identified target. Analyzing this information can easily
    result in exposing the target’s life pattern. For example, developers that have
    access to user traces can utilize machine learning techniques to infer personal
    information about users’ interests, which can be exploited to flood user interfaces
    with ad-ware and targeted advertisements. The wide adoption of IoT facilitates
    the collection of a huge amount of data using IoT devices that can be stored and
    analyzed beyond the user’s control domain. Thus, user identification becomes the
    dominant threat regarding user’s privacy. Further, with the increasing number
    of IoT deployments, the user identification threat and associated risks will significantly
    scale up. Different IoT technologies bring their own benefits and challenges.
    Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID) is commonly used in IoT scenarios to recognize/identify
    things, record metadata, and control distinct targets through radio waves [ 29].
    The basic RFID system architecture contains tags and readers [ 30]. Tags are associated
    with objects for identification and readers read these tags using a close proximity
    communication technology. When connected to the Internet, RFID remote readers
    can automatically recognize, track, and monitor any object with a global tag,
    and in real time if needed [ 31]. Pateriya et al. [ 32] point out that vulnerable
    tags are subject to spying, spoofing, traffic analysis, and denial of service
    attacks. Unauthorized reader can access these vulnerable tags without proper access
    privileges. Although the tag information could potentially be protected using
    lightweight security mechanisms, tracking is easy to accomplish through tag replies.
    User identification is currently implemented in almost all mobile platforms, using
    a variety of mechanisms including face recognition, fingerprints, and/or voice
    recognition. Surveillance systems also implement face and voice recognition using
    embedded cameras and microphones, respectively. An unauthorized attacker could
    gain full access to a surveillance camera and tamper its firmware to send the
    data to the legitimate server and copy the attacker. Identifying customers by
    authorized controllers also remains a privacy threat that leads to other threats
    such as profiling and utility monitoring. Surveillance cameras deployed in public
    settings (e.g., for video analytics and customer profiling [ 33, 34]) utilize
    public facial databases (e.g., MIT-CBCL Face Recognition Database) to track users.
    Such systems have become available to the public use for free like marketing platforms
    [ 35]. User identification through facial recognition has indeed become an inevitable
    reality and significantly hurts user privacy. 4.2. User Tracking User tracking
    is primarily based on user identification, and it becomes a threat when the data
    collected about a certain user is maintained and used to track this user’s behaviour.
    The most famous type of user tracking is based on location. When a user is identified,
    binding the location history enables tracking. Location-based services require
    that users share their location information. Thus, user location can be tracked
    without users’ explicit consent and likely without their knowledge. Several technologies
    significantly affect user tracking such as positioning techniques, which has made
    great developments in recent years. Positioning techniques are typically based
    on Global Positioning Systems (GPS), GSM, RFID, and the Wireless LAN [ 36, 37].
    The work done in [ 38] shows that average Facebook users significantly underestimate
    the amount of data to which they allow third-party applications access. The evolution
    of such technologies provides service providers with a tool to learn about personal
    patterns (e.g., home location, work location, and visited places), which raises
    the concern of location privacy intrusion. Since the IoT market is open, user
    location information can be abused or sold to third parties for targeted advertisements
    purposes. More seriously, criminals could exploit such data to perform various
    types of criminal activities that risk individual’s life. For example, the use
    of GPS to stalk customers [ 39– 41] and, generally, the uncomfortable feeling
    of being observed are discussed in [ 42]. Even when fake identity is used, the
    system cannot overcome such a privacy threat with location-based services enabled
    [ 43]. 4.3. Profiling Profiling [ 44] refers to recording and analyzing data to
    characterize personal behaviour to assess or infer their personal interests in
    a certain domain or for discrimination purposes. Off-the-shelf data mining tools
    can draw a clear picture of the customer needs and easily provide a detailed customer
    profile. Following the rule “know your customer” [ 45, 46], in e-commerce, online
    profiling is a key tool for companies to better understand their customer needs.
    Profiling data is increasingly used for target advertisements, Web sites personalization,
    and service matching. However, profiling leads to privacy violation when used
    to learn a customer''s political and religious views, sexual orientation, and/or
    medical conditions [ 47– 49], valuable information that can be shared and sold
    without further consent [ 50– 54]. The rising of Internet-connected systems and
    the evolution of data mining algorithms and tools significantly contributed to
    the emergence of big data [ 55]. From IoT and big data perspectives, the argument
    is that limiting access to private/personal data negatively impacts the accuracy
    of the data mining exercise. Besides this conflict of interest between privacy
    and profiling, we noticed that identification and tracking threats further aggravate
    the possibilities for profiling and increase the risks of privacy leakage by data
    hunting black markets. 4.4. Utility Monitoring and Controlling This threat is
    directly relevant to gathering data related to customers’ utility usage. Such
    data could be used to infer user’s daily life patterns. This sensitive information
    represents major privacy threat if acquired through an unauthorized access. However,
    it becomes more serious when attackers gain privileged access to control utility
    usage without the user’s explicit permission or knowledge. Gubbi et al. [ 56]
    categorize IoT applications into four domains: (1) Personal and Home, (2) Enterprise,
    (3) Utilities, and (4) Mobile. In personal and home applications, Wi-Fi is typically
    used to provide high bandwidth for video streaming services and support high sampling
    rates for audio streaming as well as control of home appliances such as air conditioners,
    refrigerators, and washing machines. In Enterprise applications, IoT devices collect
    data from workplace environment. For example, environmental monitoring applications
    keep track of the number of occupants and manages the utilities within the building
    (e.g., HVAC, lighting). If attackers gain access to these devices, they can cause
    financial and personal harm to owners. Although utility companies claim that they
    collect data to optimize their service, the granularity at which such data is
    collected raise concerns. Fine granularity data may reveal private information
    that users do not want to share. For example, collecting water usage at high sampling
    rate can reveal whether customers are home or not. Data analytics tools also can
    show when customers take showers or use the bathroom. All these are private information
    that users would not feel comfortable sharing with others. For example, smart
    grid and smart metering [ 57], image processing, computer vision to support video
    based IoT [ 58], and irrigation monitoring in the agricultural industries [ 59].
    It is highly challenging to control the disclosure of all this information from
    these different applications. It is also readily viable that companies could store
    customers’ data and retain it indefinitely due to increasingly advancing storage
    technology with continuously decreasing prices. The increasing evolution and adoption
    of IoT continue to aggravate user privacy and present new challenges on supporting
    infrastructure to provide more robust privacy preserving techniques. Users need
    to be aware of entities collecting their private data, understand how this data
    is shared outside their control domain, evaluate the purpose of access, estimate
    potential data misuse, and assess associated risks and consequences. Such requirements
    pose additional challenges on IoT infrastructures to provide users with safe and
    privacy preserving environments. Parker Higgins [ 60] tweeted about the unsettling
    similarity of the Samsung Smart TV privacy policy, which warned consumers not
    to discuss sensitive topics near the device [ 61]. This incident led Samsung to
    edit its privacy policy and clarify the Smart TV’s data collection practices [
    62]. With IoT becoming an important part of everyday life, people must pay extra
    attention to their privacy and systems must implement ethical practices in dealing
    with private data. Users should always be aware of the exact purpose of data collection
    and understand the spectrum of potential misuse. There must be also continuous
    enforcing mechanisms for access policies. The control should ultimately be placed
    at the users’ hands to make informed decisions on how their private data is collected
    and shared beyond their control domain. 5. Classifications of IoT Privacy Solutions
    Privacy issues in traditional Internet mostly impact connected users surfing the
    Internet. However, in IoT scenarios, privacy concerns may affect people who are
    not even using any IoT service but happen to be present in the environment. In
    traditional Internet services, the W3C group has defined the Platform for Privacy
    Preferences (P3P) [ 63], which provides a standard language for the description
    of privacy preferences and policies. P3P allows for automatic negotiation of the
    privacy concerning parameters based on data needed to run the service and the
    privacy requirements set by the user. Internet applications can implement well-established
    authentication procedures to capture the data flow and determine whether there
    are any potential privacy violations and immediately notify the user. However,
    in IoT settings it is far complex to precisely capture privacy violations due
    to the lack of well-defined control domain boundaries. Therefore, IoT environments
    must respect the privacy of individuals and ensure that collected personal data
    must be used for absolutely nothing, but the intended purpose. Lastly, collected
    data must be stored only until it is strictly needed. This section discusses the
    proposed solutions, summarized in Table 3, to overcome privacy challenges and
    related security issues as follows. (i) Authentication and authorization (ii)
    Edge computing and plug-in architectures (iii) Data anonymization (iv) Digital
    forgetting and data summarization Table 3  Summary of privacy preserving proposed
    solutions in IoT environments. 5.1. Authentication and Authorization Authentication
    in IoT scenarios is challenging due to the limitations of IoT devices. However,
    many researchers have proposed lightweight solutions to address these limitations
    and support authentication in constrained environments. Lee et al. [ 64] proposed
    simple and secure key establishment to be used in IoT networks. The authors introduce
    an encryption method based on XOR operations to implement a lightweight cryptography
    protocol. The hardware implementation of this protocol is demonstrated and can
    be used to establish the mutual authentication procedure in a typical RFID system
    for IoT applications. Porambage et al. [ 65] propose PAuth Key protocol, an authentication
    scheme and keying mechanism suitable for resource-constrained WSNs (a.k.a. IoT),
    irrespective of their vendor or form factor. PAuth provides application-level
    end-to-end security through two phases: registration and authentication. In the
    registration phase, end users and edge devices obtain their cryptographic credentials.
    The authentication phase establishes key-based authentication using mutual communication.
    The protocol allows end users to authenticate with the sensing nodes directly
    and acquire sensor data and services. The protocol supports distributed IoT applications
    since the certificates are lightweight and can be handled by resource-constrained
    devices. Sharaf-Dabbagh et al. [ 66] propose a new authentication framework for
    IoT environments based on device fingerprinting techniques. According to their
    model, each IoT device has a unique fingerprint, which can be used to communicate
    with the cloud infrastructure. The model provides authentication of IoT devices
    through a twofold approach: (1) a generative model to verify that the received
    messages belong to a certain object; (2) validation of the sender legitimacy to
    ensure that it is not a malicious object. The authors adopted the infinite Gaussian
    mixture model (IGMM) as a generative model if the object fingerprint follows a
    multivariate Gaussian distribution. The second validation method is implemented
    using Bhattacharyya distance to compare the clustering results from IGMM with
    the expected cluster shape for the device. Then, the proposed framework uses transfer
    learning techniques to effectively detect emulation attacks, thus, differentiating
    between fingerprint abnormalities resulting from environments versus attacks.
    Bouij-Pasquier et al. [ 67] propose SmartOrBAC, a context-aware authorization
    model that accommodates IoT network requirements. SmartOrBAC leverages real-time
    context to make informed authorization decisions. The authors separate functionality
    into multiple layers and resource-constrained devices collaborate to perform tasks
    using distributed processing. Salman et al. [ 68] propose an authentication scheme
    for heterogeneous IoT environments based on Software Defined Network (SDN). SDN
    controllers are used to manage security parameters by implementing a trusted certificate
    authority. All SDN controllers rely on a central SDN controller that translates
    different technology-specific identities into a single shared identity scheme
    based on virtual IPv6 addresses. This shared identity is then used to authenticate
    devices and gateways. The SDN controller authenticates gateways and gateways authenticate
    their associated devices. The proposed scheme is performed in three steps: (1)
    the gateway obtains an authentication certificate from a controller, (2) things
    register with the gateway, and (3) IoT devices send authentication requests to
    the gateway. Their analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme
    is secure against replay attack, masquerade attack, and man-in-the-middle attack.
    5.2. Edge Computing and Plug-In Architectures There is a growing adoption of the
    edge computing paradigm [ 91] in the last few years. In edge computing data processing
    and storage occur partially at the network edge, rather than completely in the
    backed. Due to the increasing trend of generating data at the edge of the network,
    it makes more sense to leverage edge computing to resolve concerns such as latency,
    device limitations, security, and more importantly user privacy [ 92]. Davies
    et al. [ 69] discuss the concern of data privacy in IoT networks, following Geoffrey
    Moore’s warning [ 93] about the discontinuity awaiting every new technology. The
    authors introduce a plug-in mediator solution to overcome the privacy concerns
    stemming from overcentralization of IoT systems. The proposed architecture suggests
    deploying privacy mediators (i.e., trusted software modules) into the data distribution
    pipeline. A mediator runs on a cloudlet [ 94] to enforce the privacy policy specified
    by sensor/user. While developers can provide sensor drivers that convert data
    into common formats, customers can create privacy policies that control the mediator
    configuration and the sensor data routing to/from that mediator. This architecture
    enables the implementation of various types of data privacy controls such as deletion,
    denaturing, summarization, inference, anonymization, and mobility. Langheinrich
    [ 70] presents a privacy-aware system (pawS) to overcome the privacy concerns
    by guaranteeing that collected data remains private. It provides data collection
    and processing tools that notify users of what exactly is collected. Thus, the
    user decides what actions can be taken. The proposed architecture adopts privacy
    preserving principles in ubiquitous computing [ 71]. The architecture encompasses
    four components: (1) machine-readable privacy policies to provide choice and consent,
    (2) policy announcement mechanisms to give notice, (3) privacy proxies to support
    access control, and (4) policy-based data access for protected recourses. However,
    proximity, negotiation, and locality are not implemented in this system. This
    architecture presents to customers all available options upfront to choose from,
    rather than forcing them to negotiate with an automated process to get the best
    deal. Bagüés et al. [ 72] introduce a privacy preserving framework for smart homes
    (Sentry@HOME). The framework adopts a user-centric approach to control the dissemination
    of private data according to the privacy policies defined by the user. It consists
    of five essential components: Sentry Registry (SR), Sentry Implementation (SI),
    Context Handler (CH), Sentry Manager Interface (SMI), and the Noise Module (NM).
    The framework embeds privacy enforcements into existing smart home infrastructure.
    The authors demonstrate that the smart home is a safe harbour for privacy-sensitive
    data and that their framework acts as a guardian sentry. Seong et al. [ 73] present
    a decentralized architecture of PrPl, which proposes Personal-Cloud Butlers as
    a safe harbour for personal data indexing. A butler is configured for each user
    to provide fine-grain access control and storage. A similar work is presented
    in [ 74] that investigates on-device sensor abstractions for augmented reality
    applications to prevent private data from accidental leakage from applications
    having privileged access to raw sensor data. 5.3. Data Anonymization Data anonymization
    is the process of removing identifiable information that may lead to personal
    identification so that people/objects described by such data remain anonymous
    [ 75]. The purpose of data anonymization is generally to protect user privacy.
    Several attempts have been made to provide anonymization, image blurring, and
    denaturing mechanisms for IoT applications [ 77, 78], especially for images and
    videos. Denaturing is the process of using image processing techniques to blur
    or alter a specific part of the image to preserve personal privacy. Data anonymization
    not only protects user privacy but also enables service providers to use collected
    data to customize the services for users. Data anonymization has three main objectives
    [ 76]: protecting the privacy of involved users, hiding any information about
    the network internal structure, and maintaining the anonymized traffic traces
    as realistic as possible to the nonanonymized packet stream. Sliwa [ 79] presents
    a new framework for anonymized data exchange that integrates user privacy, system
    safety, and quality of service. The main challenge is how to design a data broker
    that takes only general knowledge about the required data communication and possibly
    unaware of the semantics, yet assures reliable and secure data exchange between
    partners. The author also points out the challenges of developing data separation
    algorithms that allow for certain flexibility to service providers, yet respect
    the predefined access rules (personal identity, granularity). Berrehili and Belmekki
    [ 80] present a deep risk analysis for IoT privacy threats. The authors propose
    several technical and nontechnical approaches to protect user privacy in IoT scenarios.
    They provide a recommendation for IoT app developers to inform users about potential
    privacy violations resulting from private data disclosure. The authors also propose
    that IoT devices implement an authentication algorithm to verify the source of
    updated files using a cryptographic mechanism. They also suggest using anonymization
    techniques to mask the personal information in the data before sharing. Shinzaki
    et al. [ 81] extend the identification-based key sharing scheme to TLS to implement
    mutual authentication, encrypt data communication, and provide anonymization technology
    for the safe disclosure of data using multiple layers of meshes on a map for the
    utilization of positional data. Similarly, Otgonbayar et al. [ 82] present a new
    anonymization algorithm based on the k−anonymity privacy model. The proposed algorithm
    uses the time-based sliding window technique to manipulate IoT streams by partitioning
    the stream tuples based on their description. Wang et al. [ 83] introduce a scalable
    privacy-aware IoT architecture that enables live video analytics across many cameras
    by combining OpenFace [ 95], a high accuracy open-source face recognizer, with
    face tracking to maintain high accuracy and achieve full frame rate speeds. Authors
    also use privacy mediators to enforce user-defined privacy policies (e.g., face
    denaturing), yet the system maintains the original videos for possible future
    needs (e.g., finding an evidence from a crime scene). Addo et al. [ 84] present
    a reference framework for protecting end user’s privacy throughout the emotion
    analytics lifecycle. They propose Affect-Driven Personalization Lifecycle (ADPL),
    a model to learn the privacy preferences of end users through implementing a set
    of privacy rules: personalized anonymity, secure multiparty privacy preservation,
    encrypted data provenance, image-melding and reshaping techniques, and result
    aggregation. 5.4. Digital Forgetting and Data Summarization Digital forgetting
    is the process of provably deleting all copies of a dataset [ 96], while data
    summarization provides a high-level data abstraction to hide details or reduce
    granularity. Digital forgetting and data summarization are important concepts
    to relieve people’s anxiety around data collection. Users would feel more comfortable
    sharing their data knowing that collected data will be wiped out once the purpose
    of collection is void [ 85]. Data summarization is classified into the following:
    (i) Temporal summarization: in which collected data is a function of time (e.g.,
    gather sensor reading per day rather than per minute) (ii) Spatial summarization:
    in which collected data is a function of location (e.g., releasing location data
    at the zip code level rather than raw GPS readings) As the cost of storage decreases,
    the ability to store a large amount of data at low cost dramatically increases.
    This makes it easy for entities collecting data to store it for longer time. Hence,
    the need for creating efficient mechanisms that periodically delete information
    that is no longer needed for which it was generated arises. Therefore, IoT environments
    must take into consideration applying either data forgetting or summarization
    to protect user privacy. A few experimental solutions have been recently developed
    that allow users to share private data over the Internet with assurance that such
    data will be entirely deleted after a certain period of time (e.g., drop.io and
    the Guest Pass features on Flickr [ 97]). However, porting such solutions to IoT
    environments is not straightforward. Therefore, several data forgetting techniques
    have been proposed using classical cryptography [ 86]. Most of these techniques
    assume that encrypted data is deleted when the required decryption key is deleted.
    Several other techniques have been developed based on distributed data storage
    so that data is deleted due to unavoidable social and technical processes [ 87].
    Despite digital forgetting is an effective tool to preserve user privacy, it becomes
    challenging when the data size grows very large due to processing and analytics
    overhead [ 98]. Therefore, efficient data analytics techniques are required to
    reduce such overhead and optimize the process. To address this problem, Baraniuk
    [ 88] proposes to enforce IoT devices to acquire only important data instead of
    everything. Also, effective knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining
    techniques [ 89, 90] are effective solutions to summarize data collected by IoT
    devices, which can enhance the overall system performance and improve quality
    of service yet preserve user privacy. These methods are essential in IoT scenarios,
    in which large amounts of collected data can seriously impact the privacy of individuals
    and compromise the security of economic entities and government institutions.
    6. Privacy Preserving IoT Environments Applying existing Internet standards to
    smart devices can simplify the integration of the envisioned scenarios in the
    IoT contexts. However, the security mechanisms in conventional Internet protocols
    need to be modified or extended to preserve user privacy in IoT applications.
    In this section, we discuss privacy preserving at different layers of the IoT
    stack. We build our discussions based on a three-layer IoT stack as shown in Figure
    3.    Figure 3  IoT three-layered architecture. 6.1. Privacy Preservation in IoT
    Device Layer The IoT device layer (also known as perception layer) contains all
    physical resources that collect/control data (sensors and actuators). However,
    these resources are highly heterogeneous and resource-constrained. Such constraints
    pose unique challenges on applying privacy preserving techniques. Thus, IoT devices
    are subject to several attacks discussed in [ 99] including node capture, fake
    node, malicious data, denial of service attack (DoS), timing attack, routing threats,
    replay attack, side channel attack (SCA), and mass node authentication problem.
    Therefore, several security measures must be considered when designing this layer
    as follows: (i) Access control and authentication: to prevent user privacy leaks
    from open and unauthorized access. Juels et al. [ 100] present a good solution
    to implement Selective RFID Jamming as an access control scheme on low-cost tags
    (ii) Data encryption: to secure data exchange and guarantee safe delivery. Wang
    [ 101] presents a nonlinear key algorithm based on displaced calculation to provide
    data encryption. This key algorithm requires low computational power to provide
    high security and good data transmission rate (iii) Secure channel using IPSec:
    the IPSec protocol [ 102] offers both authentication and encryption. Raza et al.
    [ 103] present a 6LoWPAN/IPsec extension to provide security for IoT devices.
    The authors demonstrate that IPSec outperforms the standard IEEE 802.15.4 link
    layer security in IoT environments (iv) Cryptography technology: to offer privacy
    protection, confidentiality, authenticity and data integrity. Secure communication
    protocols include digital signatures and hash values are used to ensure data integrity
    6.2. Privacy Preservation in Platform/Infrastructure Layer The platform layer
    represents the classical network layer in the OSI model [ 104]. This layer integrates
    intelligent data preprocessing to reduce resource requirements at the application
    layer. The network layer poses some general security problems related to data
    integrity and confidentiality such as unauthorized access to networks, eavesdropping,
    confidentiality and integrity damage, DDoS attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    Although existing network protocols implement highly secured measures, they are
    not robust enough for M2M communications in resource-constrained environments.
    As such, existing security mechanisms are weak/inapplicable on IoT devices and
    may lead to creating barriers rather than connections between different machines.
    Therefore, the heterogeneity of these networks makes security, interoperability,
    and coordination of networks becoming worse, leading to security vulnerabilities.
    New IoT-oriented security mechanisms must be designed from the ground up to fit
    IoT environments, taking into consideration the following security measures: (i)
    Set up an end-to-end authentication and key agreement mechanism, PKI (Public-Key
    Infrastructure), WPKI for wireless, Security routing, IDS, etc. (ii) Utilize network
    virtualization to reduce the network management complexity and the likelihood
    of improper operations. (iii) Adopt IPv6 as a standard network layer protocol
    to support inherited security mechanisms [ 105]. 6.3. Privacy Preservation in
    Application Layer The application layer encompasses 2 parts: the support layer
    where the edge computing and analytical services run and the application service
    layer that provides necessary support from the IoT infrastructure. IoT applications
    are also highly versatile and heterogonous with varying needs, which makes it
    a challenge to offer a standard support. Different applications target different
    domains with unique data collection requirements, which may require different
    security measures. Therefore, the application layer security considerations/requirements
    differ from the previous two layers in the following sense: (1) Nontechnical:
    (a) Privacy awareness: makes users aware of private data collection, potential
    risks, and how to safely use IoT services and avoid private information leakage.
    (b) Security management: strengthens resources, physical security information,
    password management, etc. (2) Technical: (a) Cryptography: fingerprint technology,
    digital watermarking, anonymous authentication, and homomorphic and threshold
    cryptography. (b) Key agreements: incorporate symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems
    and certification transfer technology. 7. Conclusion The Internet of Things has
    the potential to change the world, just as the Internet did two decades ago. Nevertheless,
    any new technology faces several technical and nontechnical challenges. The highly
    diverse IoT application domains, resource-constrained IoT devices, and heterogeneity
    of both devices and platforms hinder the development of a standard IoT framework.
    However, privacy stands out as a critical concern that inhibits the widespread
    adoption IoT. The vulnerabilities of IoT devices can lead to huge security breaks
    and significantly hurt user privacy by exposing personal data. To promote IoT
    adoption and relieve user concerns, platforms, applications, and infrastructures
    must seriously take privacy into consideration. In this survey paper, we outline
    the major privacy threats in IoT environments and discuss the impact of IoT evolution
    on each threat. Privacy concerns such as user identification lead to a much bigger
    threat such as profiling. We surveyed the proposed solutions that overcome various
    privacy concerns and security threats in IoT environments. Most of the proposed
    solutions fall into one of the following categories: (1) authentication and authorization,
    (2) edge computing mediators, (3) data anonymization, and (4) data summarization.
    Consequently, several efforts were focused on providing lightweight authentication
    and keying establishment mechanisms, implementing frameworks based on device fingerprinting
    techniques, and introducing context-aware access control models. Although the
    proposed solutions can relieve some of the privacy concerns in IoT scenarios,
    there is a clear lack of performance evaluation and assessment in real-life scenarios.
    Furthermore, there is a conflict between protecting user privacy and the granularity
    of data access needed to provide better services. This raises the challenge of
    how to support consumer-specific privacy preferences while maintaining the same
    level of service. Such a challenge could be addressed using data anonymization.
    The paper then points out the required measures to preserve privacy in the different
    layers of the IoT stack. Our recommendation for IoT-oriented privacy preservation
    in IoT environments is as follows. First, take security measures into consideration
    at the device layer including access control and authentication, data encryption,
    secure channel based on IPSec, and cryptography. Second, reduce network management
    complexity, set up cohesive authentication mechanism, and adoption of IPv6 must
    be considered in the platform layer. In conclusion, privacy preserving is a shared
    responsibility in which all parties much actively engage and cooperate to provide
    safe IoT environments yet enjoy what IoT may offer. Technology manufacturer must
    design IoT devices with integrated privacy and security measures. Infrastructures
    must implement IoT-oriented mechanisms to prevent privacy leaks and address security
    threats from the ground up. IoT applications must notify users of what data is
    collected and the purpose of collection. IoT users must take extra cautions when
    they authorize access to their private data and better understand the potential
    consequences of any associated risks resulting from any misuse of such data. Conflicts

    making in your literature review on automated systems for real-time irrigation
    management. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the privacy challenges
    and concerns associated with IoT systems, including edge computing and fog computing.
    The paper also discusses a variety of proposed solutions to these challenges,
    such as data anonymization.


    The paper''s findings are relevant to real-time irrigation management systems,
    as these systems rely on IoT devices to collect data from the field. This data
    can include information about soil moisture levels, plant health, and weather
    conditions. If this data is not properly secured, it could be used to compromise
    the privacy of the farm or its customers.


    The paper''s recommendations for mitigating privacy risks are also relevant to
    real-time irrigation management systems. For example, the paper recommends using
    edge computing to reduce latency and enable real-time decision-making. Edge computing
    can also help to reduce the risk of data breaches by storing data on local devices
    rather than in the cloud.


    Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the privacy challenges and
    concerns associated with IoT systems. The paper''s findings and recommendations
    are relevant to the design and implementation of real-time irrigation management
    systems.'

  explanation: 'The study by Aslanpour et al. discusses the benefits and challenges
    of edge computing, which brings computational resources closer to the data source,
    reducing latency and enhancing real-time decision-making. Edge computing aims
    to leverage the capabilities of IoT applications, which require minimal reliance
    on cloud connectivity.


    Edge computing offers several advantages, including:


    1. Reduced latency: By processing data closer to the source, edge computing minimizes
    transmission delays and improves responsiveness.


    2. Real-time decision-making: Edge computing enables real-time data analysis and
    decision-making at the edge devices, eliminating the need for communication with
    remote cloud servers.


    3. Reduced reliance on cloud connectivity: Edge computing reduces the dependency
    on cloud-based resources, making it suitable for scenarios with intermittent or
    limited connectivity.'

    Cited By Index Terms Recommendations Comments ABSTRACT Born from a need for a
    pure “pay-per-use” model and highly scalable platform, the “Serverless” paradigm
    emerged and has the potential to become a dominant way of building cloud applications.
    Although it was originally designed for cloud environments, Serverless is finding
    its position in the Edge Computing landscape, aiming to bring computational resources
    closer to the data source. That is, Serverless is crossing cloud borders to assess
    its merits in Edge computing, whose principal partner will be the Internet of
    Things (IoT) applications. This move sounds promising as Serverless brings particular
    benefits such as eliminating always-on services causing high electricity usage,
    for instance. However, the community is still hesitant to uptake Serverless Edge
    Computing because of the cloud-driven design of current Serverless platforms,
    and distinctive characteristics of edge landscape and IoT applications. In this
    paper, we evaluate both sides to shed light on the Serverless new territory. Our
    in-depth analysis promotes a broad vision for bringing Serverless to the Edge
    Computing. It also issues major challenges for Serverless to be met before entering
    Edge computing. References Paarijaat Aditya, Istemi Ekin Akkus, Andre Beck, Ruichuan

    With the deep combination of both modern information technology and traditional
    agriculture, the era of agriculture 4.0, which takes the form of smart agriculture,
    has come. Smart agriculture provides solutions for agricultural intelligence and
    automation. However, information security issues cannot be ignored with the development
    of agriculture brought by modern information technology. In this paper, three
    typical development modes of smart agriculture (precision agriculture, facility
    agriculture, and order agriculture) are presented. Then, 7 key technologies and
    11 key applications are derived from the above modes. Based on the above technologies
    and applications, 6 security and privacy countermeasures (authentication and access
    control, privacy-preserving, blockchain-based solutions for data integrity, cryptography
    and key management, physical countermeasures, and intrusion detection systems)
    are summarized and discussed. Moreover, the security challenges of smart agriculture
    are analyzed and organized into two aspects: 1) agricultural production, and 2)
    information technology. Most current research projects have not taken agricultural
    equipment as potential security threats. Therefore, we did some additional experiments
    based on solar insecticidal lamps Internet of Things, and the results indicate
    that agricultural equipment has an impact on agricultural security. Finally, more
    technologies (5 G communication, fog computing, Internet of Everything, renewable
    energy management system, software defined network, virtual reality, augmented
    reality, and cyber security datasets for smart agriculture) are described as the
    future research directions of smart agriculture. Published in: IEEE/CAA Journal

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: I. Introduction Agriculture is the primary industry
    in the world, and it plays an important role in social stability and economic
    development [1]. Overcoming the contradiction between the population explosion
    and the limited grain yield is a challenge that motivates an increasing number
    of studies on smart agriculture. The development of agriculture is based on both
    the improvement in productivity and the restrictions of the era, and the progress
    of science and technology drives the revolution of agriculture [2]. Fig. 1 is
    used to help readers understand the characteristics and confronted issues of agriculture
    development (from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture 4.0). • Agriculture 1.0: the
    traditional agricultural era (between 1784 and around 1870) dominated by human
    and animal resources, the main issue of agriculture was the low efficiency of
    operation. • Agriculture 2.0: the era of mechanized agriculture (in the 20th century),
    the main issue was the inefficient use of resources. • Agriculture 3.0: the era
    of high-speed development of automatic agriculture (between 1992 to 2017), the
    main issue was the low level of intelligence. • Agriculture 4.0: the era of smart
    agriculture (which is characterized by unmanned operations, begin at 2017) is
    mainly marked by the use of modern information technology to both serve agriculture
    and develop it intelligently. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References

    \ have been signiﬁcantly developed and have greatly expanded\ntheir potential.\
    \ In fact, novel advancements to the Internet of things (IoT) have paved the way\
    \ for\nnew possibilities, representing a set of key enabling technologies for\
    \ smart cities and allowing the\nproduction and automation of innovative services\
    \ and advanced applications for the different city\nstakeholders. This paper presents\
    \ a review of the research literature on IoT-enabled smart cities, with\nthe aim\
    \ of highlighting the main trends and open challenges of adopting IoT technologies\
    \ for the\ndevelopment of sustainable and efﬁcient smart cities. This work ﬁrst\
    \ provides a survey on the key\ntechnologies proposed in the literature for the\
    \ implementation of IoT frameworks, and then a review\nof the main smart city\
    \ approaches and frameworks, based on classiﬁcation into eight domains, which\n\
    extends the traditional six domain classiﬁcation that is typically adopted in\
    \ most of the related works.\nKeywords: smart cities; internet of things; big\
    \ data\n1. Introduction\nThe increasing development and dissemination of Internet\
    \ of things (IoT) and Internet\nof everything (IoE) technologies represent an\
    \ important enabler in the current smart cities\nlandscape, leading the smart\
    \ city paradigm to the big data scale. In fact, as noted in [1], a\ntechnical\
    \ report by Ericson estimated that 29 billion devices would be connected by 2022.\n\
    According to the report presented by Statista Research in 2019, it has been estimated\
    \ that\nthe total number of connected IoT devices worldwide will increase to about\
    \ 75 billion by\n2025 [2], creating a potential IoT economic impact that could\
    \ reach USD 11 trillion per\nyear by 2025 [3]. These numbers are revealing that\
    \ IoT is going to be one of the highest\nvalue disruptive technologies, opening\
    \ new frontiers, possibilities and challenges in the\nproduction of smart services\
    \ and applications. The importance of IoT is more and more\nclosely connected\
    \ to the evolution of smart cities, for which IoT represents one of the key\n\
    drivers for smarter innovation and sustainable development. Smart cities are complex\
    \ socio-\ntechnical infrastructures, composed of human actors (different stakeholders\
    \ and users, such\nas citizens, city operators, administrative institutions, public\
    \ and private companies, etc.)\nand digital devices (e.g.: city sensors and actuators\
    \ exploited in many domains, such as\nmobility and transportation, environment,\
    \ energy, healthcare, governance, industry 4.0 etc.;\nsmart home and smart buildings\
    \ devices; and personal devices, such as smartphones).\nThis complexity is reﬂected\
    \ in the large variety of heterogeneous approaches, contexts,\napplication domains\
    \ and technological solutions that have been proposed in the literature\nfor the\
    \ realization and management of smart cities. The main goal of implementing and\n\
    integrating IoT solutions is to allow smart cities to advance further, providing\
    \ new capabili-\nties and features while signiﬁcantly reducing human intervention\
    \ [4]. In addition, it is also\nimportant to focus on the social challenges addressed\
    \ and the societal beneﬁts achieved by\nthe adoption of these technologies, for\
    \ instance assessing how they can contribute to the\nSustainable Development Goals\
    \ (SDGs) developed by United Nations within the context\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12,\
    \ 1607. https://doi.org/10.3390/app12031607\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n2 of 21\nof the 2030 Agenda [5]. Some of the main technical\
    \ challenges for modern IoT-enabled\nsmart cities are represented by the requirements\
    \ of supporting a multitude of different data\nproviders, dealing with many different\
    \ protocols and data formats, as well as ensuring\ninteroperability and scalability\
    \ and supporting the sharing of components. This is crucial\nin order to avoid\
    \ the implementation of redundant solutions for data ingestion, storage\nand analysis,\
    \ thus lowering operative costs and enhancing the city’s sustainability. The\n\
    motivation and contributions of the present paper are the following:\n1.\nProvide\
    \ an updated and comprehensive (although not exhaustive) overview of re-\nsearch\
    \ literature about smart city domains, solutions and frameworks, as well as about\n\
    key IoT technologies and applications integrated in smart city components.\n2.\n\
    Provide insights into recent trends, open technical and social challenges (also\
    \ assessing\nthe contribution of IoT–smart city technologies and domains toward\
    \ the SDGs) and\nfuture directions to be addressed in the implementation of IoT\
    \ in smart cities.\nIn this paper, an effort has been made to integrate IoT and\
    \ smart city solutions follow-\ning a classiﬁcation approach that focuses on the\
    \ identiﬁcation of eight applicable domains:\ngovernance; living and infrastructures;\
    \ mobility and transportation; economy; industry\nand production; energy; environment;\
    \ and healthcare. The rest of the paper is organized\nas follows. In Section 2,\
    \ a review of the main technologies employed in IoT frameworks\nis presented.\
    \ Section 3 provides a survey focused on IoT-enabled smart city domains\nand components.\
    \ Section 4 illustrates some recent trends and open challenges, and also\nassesses\
    \ the societal challenges involved and investigates potential future directions\
    \ for\nIoT-powered smart cities. Section 5 is left for the conclusions.\n2. IoT\
    \ Technologies and Architecture\nThe Internet of things has introduced an important\
    \ paradigm innovation in the com-\nmunication among digital devices, as well as\
    \ in the way that they connect with the physical\nenvironment [1] and interact\
    \ with human users. IoT architectures integrate and unify all\nsteps of data sensing/actuating\
    \ from/to devices, transmitting/receiving messages, data\nstorage, processing,\
    \ analysis and ﬁnal exploitation through the use of cloud, fog and edge\ncomputation,\
    \ services and applications. Many different technologies are involved in the\n\
    development of IoT frameworks. However, general functional architectures have\
    \ been\nproposed in the literature that are based on a simpliﬁed version of the\
    \ Open Systems\nInterconnection (OSI) model, but with different approaches. Some\
    \ works [1,6] deﬁne a\ntypical IoT framework composed of three layers (from the\
    \ lowest physical level to the\nhigher levels of abstraction): the perception/sensing\
    \ layer; the network layer; and the\napplication layer. In other works [7–12]\
    \ the former approach is expanded into ﬁve layers of\narchitecture, including:\
    \ the perception/sensing layer; the transportation/network layer;\nthe middleware/processing\
    \ layer; the application layer; and the business layer. In Figure 1,\nthe three-layer\
    \ and ﬁve-layer IoT architectures are depicted.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, x FOR PEER\

    \ \nthe functionalities and involved technologies. The five-layer architecture\

    Different computing paradigms are deﬁned depending on which level of the stack\n\
    is being considered, from bottom to top: edge computing; fog computing; and cloud\n\
    computing [13]. In the following, a description of the different layers is provided\
    \ in terms\nof the functionalities and involved technologies. The ﬁve-layer architecture\
    \ was considered\nsince it can be viewed as a more detailed version of the three-layer\
    \ architecture.\n2.1. Perception/Sensing Layer\nThe perception or sensing layer\
    \ is related to the physical level that is made up of\ndevices, such as sensors\
    \ and actuators, which interact among themselves and with the\nphysical world\
    \ by sending and receiving data, exploiting wireless networks [8]. In this\ncontext,\
    \ sensors, actuators and mobile device technologies are involved. There is a wide\n\
    range of commercial devices that measure many kinds of physical quantities and\
    \ vari-\nables, i.e., sensors for measuring temperature, humidity, pressure, distance\
    \ and geospatial\ncoordinates, speed, acceleration, voltage, weight, pollutant\
    \ particles, luminance level, bio-\nmetrical signals, etc. Actuators are employed\
    \ to control/move other devices or systems\nphysically or virtually, and they\
    \ are typically classiﬁed into electrical, pneumatic and hy-\ndraulic categories\
    \ [14]. Several software tools and solutions are used to deploy low-level\nIoT\
    \ applications. Those described in the following are based on visual programming\
    \ lan-\nguages (VPLs): NetLab is an open source environment for developing embedded\
    \ systems;\nArdublock is an open source visual block programming tool for Arduino\
    \ systems; and\nScratch is a visual programming tool, developed at MIT, for IoT\
    \ code generation and\ncommunication with Arduino-based IoT products [15].\n2.2.\
    \ Transportation/Network Layer\nThe transportation or network layer provides the\
    \ function of data routing and trans-\nmission. Network gateways/brokers can be\
    \ used as mediators for integrating different\nIoT nodes, allowing them to transmit\
    \ and receive data to and from different sensors for\nM2M connectivity. Regarding\
    \ data transmission, different technologies and protocols\nare used. Proximity\
    \ communication protocols include Bluetooth, radio-frequency iden-\ntiﬁcation\
    \ (RFID) tag technology and near-ﬁeld communication (NFC). Larger coverage\nnetworks\
    \ exploit wireless technologies, such as Wi-Fi, Zigbee, long range wide-area net-\n\
    work (LoRaWAN), Sigfox and 5G.\nBluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy [16] are low-power\
    \ wireless communication\ntechnologies designed for personal area networks (PANs),\
    \ which are suitable for low-\nbandwidth data transmission among mobile devices\
    \ over a short range of up to 10 m. They\nare usually employed in smart contexts\
    \ for connecting personal devices.\nRFID exploits radio frequencies for data communication\
    \ and is usually used to\nuniquely identify objects, people, vehicles, etc. Communication\
    \ is established between\na reader device and a tag device, which can be passive\
    \ or active. NFC [17] is similar to\nRFID, but it has an even shorter range for\
    \ communication (up to few centimeters). Unlike\nRFID, NFC does not implement\
    \ a reader/tag hierarchy and can be used for two-way\ncommunication. It is typically\
    \ used for mobile payments and access control operations.\nWi-Fi is based on the\
    \ IEEE 802.11 standard and uses wireless frequencies (operating\nat 2.4, 5 and\
    \ 60 GHz bands) to provide high-speed internet connectivity (from 1 Mb/s to\n\
    6.75 Gb/s) within a limited distance (up to 100 m) [18]. It is designed for wireless\
    \ local area\nnetworks (WLAN).\nWiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave\
    \ Access) is based on the IEEE\n802.16 standard, operating at 2–66 GHz bands and\
    \ providing data rates from 1.5 Mb/s to\n1 Gb/s [18]. It can support broadband\
    \ wireless access for up to 50 km for ﬁxed stations and\nbetween 5–15 km for mobile\
    \ stations [19].\nZigbee is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. It is a low-power\
    \ and low cost protocol\nfor wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It usually supports\
    \ star, tree and mesh network\ntopologies. The Zigbee protocol operates at 2.4\
    \ GHz and provides a data rate of about\n250 kbit/s [20]. The data transmission\
    \ range is similar to that of Wi-Fi (from 10 to 100 m).\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12,\
    \ 1607\n4 of 21\nLoRaWAN is a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) that is capable\
    \ of transmit-\nting over long ranges (about 10 km) and also supports multitenancy\
    \ and multi-domain\nnetworks [14]. It consists of several gateways that can be\
    \ added when the network size\nincreases and a higher capacity is required.\n\
    Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is an LPWAN protocol that operates on LTE licensed\nfrequency\
    \ bands, with a data rate of about 200 Kb/s [3]. The bandwidth of NB-IoT is about\n\
    180 KHz, and this protocol allows the connection of the order of hundreds of thousands\
    \ of\ndevices [21]. The NB-IoT technology also optimizes energy consumption, providing\
    \ power\ncontrol and power saving modalities [22].\nLTE-M is another LPWAN protocol,\
    \ operating at a 1.4 MHz bandwidth [23]. It was\nintroduced with the aim of supporting\
    \ a massive number of devices, providing 10 year bat-\ntery life support [24]\
    \ and supporting data rates of up to 1 Mbit/s, which is enough to satisfy\nthe\
    \ higher data rate requirements for devices such as video cameras and wearables\
    \ [25].\nThe features supported in LTE-M include handover management, extended\
    \ discontinuous\nreception and the suspension/resumption of radio resource control\
    \ connection.\nZ-Wave is a low-power protocol typically used in wireless home\
    \ area networks,\noperating at 868 MHz and 900 MHz frequencies [7]. Z-Wave devices\
    \ cannot directly\nconnect to the Internet or other mobile devices. Therefore,\
    \ the Z-Wave network is based on\nthe use of a controller, which acts as a gateway,\
    \ in order to manage all connected devices\nand allow them to interact with other\
    \ mobile devices via the Internet or local networks [26].\nSigfox is a narrowband\
    \ communication system for transmitting data over long ranges\n(up to 40 km [27]).\
    \ Although it employs narrowband signals, Sigfox can be suitable for\nmany kinds\
    \ of applications, such as geolocation services and control messages.\nFinally,\
    \ 5G is the ﬁfth generation of cellular networks. It is a very low-latency (less\n\
    than 1 ms) and high-bandwidth (10 Gb/s) protocol [28], making it a strong enabler\
    \ for\nsmart cities and allowing the interconnectivity of a large number of IoT\
    \ devices, as well as\nbeing suitable for real-time processing.\nThe last part\
    \ of the network layer stack is in charge of suitably formatting data for\ntheir\
    \ presentation. The client/server architecture, represented by the subscription\
    \ mecha-\nnism between IoT devices and brokers, presents different modalities\
    \ for sending/receiving\nmessages/data, i.e., push and pull. Typically, pull protocols\
    \ are REST call, web services,\nFTP and HTTP/HTTPS. On the other hand, the most\
    \ common push protocols to receive\ndata via data-driven subscriptions are: WebSocket\
    \ (WS), Constrained Application Proto-\ncol (CoAP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport\
    \ (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing\nProtocol (AMQP) and FIWARE NGSI and NGSI-V2\
    \ [29]. Furthermore, in order to allow\ndata exchange among multiple devices and\
    \ applications, distributed publish–subscribe\nmessaging systems should be supported\
    \ (such as Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Orion Broker\nof FIWARE) for handling multiple\
    \ data streams in an efﬁcient and scalable way [13]. In this\ncontext, in order\
    \ to increase fault tolerance when handling data that should not be lost in\n\
    case of failure, the data persistence of queues is an important feature (e.g.,\
    \ Apache Kafka).\n2.3. Middleware/Processing Layer\nThe middleware or processing\
    \ layer can serve many different functionalities. For\ninstance, it can act as\
    \ a data aggregator module, since data may be collected from hetero-\ngeneous\
    \ devices with different protocols that may not have been originally designed\
    \ to\ncommunicate and interact with each other. Therefore, the middleware layer\
    \ has to enable\ninteroperability among connected devices, performing the necessary\
    \ programming and/or\nmodel abstractions. Interoperability should be ensured at\
    \ different levels:\n•\nTechnical level [30], in order to efﬁciently achieve and\
    \ ensure end-to-end connectivity\namong devices, gateways, brokers, servers, etc.;\n\
    •\nSyntactical level, for managing the variety of protocols and formats;\n•\n\
    Semantic level, for exploiting Semantic Web technologies, such as XML, RDF, OWL\n\
    Ontology and linked data (LD), to achieve unambiguous data representation and\
    \ data\nsemantic enrichment, thus improving the expressiveness level of the system\
    \ [31].\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n5 of 21\nIoT middleware is also typically\
    \ devoted to providing scalability and reliability, allow-\ning the system to\
    \ handle a growing number of IoT connections and communication loads at\nthe big\
    \ data scale as well as supplying stable and fault-tolerant services. Moreover,\
    \ in order\nto enable data processing over IoT, database-level data persistence\
    \ is needed to integrate\nthe data coming with different protocols in a shared\
    \ model, and this is performed in the\nmiddleware layer. Therefore, middleware\
    \ includes the different data storage modalities\nand eventually covers other\
    \ functionalities, such as context identiﬁcation, information\nextraction and\
    \ the reconciliation of collected data. For example, FIWARE provides different\n\
    generic enablers (Cygnus, QuantumLeap, STH-Comet) to store data coming from the\
    \ Orion\nContext Broker.\n2.4. Application Layer\nThe application layer provides\
    \ the output formats, applications and services requested\nby the ﬁnal users.\
    \ Usually, works in the literature that are based on the three-layer IoT\narchitecture\
    \ include the messaging protocols management in this layer, as described in the\n\
    network layer at the end of Section 2.2.\nThe growing dissemination of IoT devices\
    \ and systems has led to the increasing\nadoption of event-driven applications\
    \ (exploiting push protocols). This is a signiﬁcant\nparadigm shift from the older\
    \ generation of smart city applications that relied on vertical\napplications\
    \ and were often based on extract, transform, load/extract, load, transform\n\
    (ETL/ELT) processes and languages, which usually only support pull protocols.\
    \ On the\nother hand, different frameworks and ecosystems are used to design and\
    \ implement event-\ndriven IoT application, for example VPL tools [32]. One of\
    \ the most used is Node-RED,\nwhich is based on the Node.js engine and allows\
    \ the creation of application ﬂows in a\ngraphic environment through the composition\
    \ of visual nodes or blocks [33].\n2.5. Business Layer\nThe business layer was\
    \ introduced to classify all operations and front-end tools that\nconsume data\
    \ from the application layer for producing advanced big data analytics and\nvisualization\
    \ services, with the goal of building business models, supporting decision-\n\
    making processes and performing simulations and what-if analysis. This can be\
    \ achieved\nby implementing, for instance, predictive models based on machine\
    \ learning, deep learn-\ning and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) techniques [34],\
    \ as well as advanced and interactive\nvisual analysis tools [35]. Moreover, the\
    \ business layer includes all operations performed\nby system administrators,\
    \ which are needed to assess, control and maintain the overall\nfunctionality\
    \ of the platform/framework.\nIoT security aspects deserve a separate and speciﬁc\
    \ discussion. In fact, security\nrequirements and related issues have to be addressed\
    \ along the full IoT stack, including\nall functional architecture layers, from\
    \ the authentication of personal devices with IoT\nbrokers and ensuring secure\
    \ communication and secure encrypted storage for private data\nto the authentication\
    \ mechanisms for accessing and using IoT applications, data analytics\nand data\
    \ visualization tools. All of these requirements have to follow and cope with\
    \ strict\nregulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) standard\
    \ [36].\n3. Review of IoT-Enabled Smart City Components and Solutions\nThere is\
    \ a wide range of research literature regarding IoT application in smart city\n\
    contexts. A search of the Web of Science (WoS) database for papers containing\
    \ the key-\nwords “smart city” OR “smart cities” AND “IoT” OR “Internet of things”\
    \ in their topic\n(i.e., the union of the “title”, “abstract” and “keywords” search\
    \ ﬁelds) resulted in a total\nof 5285 articles, published from 2010 to 2021, which\
    \ is a very large number of resources to\nbe extensively and systematically reviewed,\
    \ or even to be ﬁltered in a supervised way to\nselect and consider the most relevant\
    \ papers. In order to provide an overview of the grow-\ning interest around these\
    \ topics, the temporal evolution of the above-mentioned papers\n(grouped by year\
    \ of publication) is reported in Figure 2. It is to be noted that the apparent\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n6 of 21\ndecrease in the number of published papers\
    \ over the last year (depicted with a dotted line\nin Figure 2) may be due to\
    \ the fact that the count for 2021 was incomplete (since the search\nwas performed\
    \ in October 2021).\ncontexts. A search of the Web of Science (WoS) database for\

    \ and “keywords” search fields) resulted in a total \nof 5285 articles, published\

    \ “smart city” OR “smart cities” AND “IoT” OR “Internet of things” in \nat least\
    \ one of the following fields: title; abstract; and paper keywords. Subsequently,\
    \ \na supervised overview and filter was performed in order to assure that each\
    \ paper \ntopic actually fit the subject of this review; \nFigure 2. The temporal\

    \ frameworks and solutions in a variety of application domains. For\nthis reason,\
    \ we focused on reviews and surveys as a starting point for our study. Therefore,\n\
    the literature research was conducted adopting the following criteria:\n1.\nThe\
    \ WoS database was used for searching for reviews and survey articles containing\n\
    the keywords “smart city” OR “smart cities” AND “IoT” OR “Internet of things”\
    \ in at\nleast one of the following ﬁelds: title; abstract; and paper keywords.\
    \ Subsequently,\na supervised overview and ﬁlter was performed in order to assure\
    \ that each paper\ntopic actually ﬁt the subject of this review;\n2.\nRecent literature\
    \ was the main object of the present review, i.e., papers published from\n2018\
    \ to the present (2021) were selected from the initial search;\n3.\nPapers from\
    \ Q1 and Q2 journals (as ranked in the SCImago index) were given priority\nover\
    \ those from Q3 and Q4.\nFollowing these criteria, a total of 52 surveys and reviews\
    \ on IoT-enabled smart cities\nwere considered as the baseline for the survey\
    \ presented in this paper. It is to be noted\nthat most of the 52 surveys reviewed\
    \ often aimed to review one or some speciﬁc IoT–smart\ncity domains and use cases\
    \ without providing a more general or comprehensive overview,\nwhich is one of\
    \ the aims of this paper. In addition, in our opinion, the few general surveys\n\
    that were retrieved lacked in addressing the relationships between each smart\
    \ city domain\n(with related sub-domains and scenarios) with the related IoT technologies\
    \ that have been\nemployed in each speciﬁc context.\nIn order to describe the\
    \ wide landscape that we found by reviewing the selected\nliterature in the most\
    \ comprehensive way, the following eight domains were identiﬁed\n(as depicted\
    \ in Figure 3), which are typically used to classify smart city components and\n\
    application areas: governance; living and infrastructures; mobility and transportation;\n\
    economy; industry and production; energy; environment; and healthcare. This approach\n\
    extends the six-domain classiﬁcation presented in [1,37]. The classiﬁcation proposed\
    \ in this\npaper is not meant to be exhaustive and, in some cases, these domains\
    \ may not necessarily\nbe orthogonal as they may overlap in several contexts and\
    \ applications.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n7 of 21\nerature in the most comprehensive\
    \ way, the following eight domains were identified (as \ndepicted in Figure 3),\
    \ which are typically used to classify smart city components and ap-\nplication\
    \ areas: governance; living and infrastructures; mobility and transportation;\
    \ econ-\nomy; industry and production; energy; environment; and healthcare. This\
    \ approach ex-\ntends the six-domain classification presented in [1,37]. The classification\
    \ proposed in this \npaper is not meant to be exhaustive and, in some cases, these\
    \ domains may not necessarily \nbe orthogonal as they may overlap in several contexts\
    \ and applications. \n \nFigure 3. The classification of smart city domains with\

    \ for that speciﬁc domain.\n3.1. Smart Governance\nSmart governance deals with\
    \ the adoption of ICT into city governance practices in\norder to improve the\
    \ decision-making process and speed up bureaucratic and administra-\ntive procedures\
    \ through a smarter collaboration among different stakeholders and social\nactors\
    \ [38], including public administrations, city ofﬁcers, private companies and\
    \ citizens.\nThis can be successfully accomplished by providing innovative city\
    \ services, dedicated\nchannels and network integration for citizens. For instance,\
    \ citizens can be engaged in par-\nticipating with city governance activities\
    \ and decisional processes through ICT-based tools\nand social media [39] as evidence\
    \ of the mobile crowdsourcing paradigm [40], according to\nwhich citizens can\
    \ act as “users as sensors” with their smartphones and mobile devices,\nparticipating\
    \ as individuals and in groups in the acquisition process of data of interest\
    \ for\nsmart communities.\nIoT technologies are transforming traditional city\
    \ governance transactions and pro-\ncesses into smart government resources on\
    \ the basis of the different participating ac-\ntors, i.e., government-to-citizen\
    \ (G2C), government-to-business (G2B) and government-to-\ngovernment (G2G) [41,42]:\n\
    •\nGovernment-to-citizen (G2C) refers to the set of software solutions (typically\
    \ web\nand mobile based) that support the relationships between public administrations\
    \ and\ncitizens, such as public administration web portals and/or mobile applications\
    \ and\nsocial media channels employed for communication and interaction between\
    \ local\ngovernments and citizens. In addition, IoT technologies, such as RFID\
    \ and biometric\nsensors, are widely and increasingly adopted in electronic ID\
    \ cards and mobile devices\nfor identity recognition, electronic authentication\
    \ and signature, according to different\ngovernmental standards, such as the European\
    \ Community’s electronic IDentiﬁcation,\nAuthentication and trust Services (eIDAS)\
    \ [43]. These features are typically required\nto access services that are provided\
    \ by public administrations and consult citizens’ per-\nsonal data related to\
    \ public services, etc., thus simplifying a lot of the communication\nand interaction\
    \ between governmental authorities and citizens;\n•\nGovernment-to-business (G2B)\
    \ regards the interactions between public administra-\ntions and businesses companies.\
    \ In this model, e-procurement solutions are adopted,\ni.e., digital tools (mainly\
    \ via the web), through which local governments publish ten-\nAppl. Sci. 2022,\

    \ of goods and other general\nservices for and from private companies. IoT technologies\
    \ are widely adopted in G2B\nactivities, facilitating and enhancing the relationship\
    \ between local governments and\ncompanies that provide public and private services\
    \ to citizens. For instance, trans-\nportation companies use location-based sensors\
    \ (usually exploiting GPS technology)\nand services, sharing them with local administrations\
    \ and allowing the easier and\nmore efﬁcient urban planning for mobility and transportation\
    \ [44]. In addition, it\nincludes similar aspects involved in many other domains\
    \ that provide public and\nfundamental services, such as waste management, water,\
    \ energy, etc. To this end,\nthe use of cloud computing is generally adopted to\
    \ store and share data and results\namong the different stakeholders (city operators,\
    \ companies and citizens);\n•\nGovernment-to-government (G2G) is related to the\
    \ software solutions that aim to\nimprove communications between the different\
    \ public administration entities and\ngroups, thereby speeding up all processes\
    \ that require the interaction of these actors.\nThis implies the use of IoT technologies\
    \ for data collection, storage and sharing, which\nexploits, for instance, cloud\
    \ computing and web/mobile-based services. A report of\nthe European JRC also\
    \ observed that governments may beneﬁt from the combination\nof various data sources\
    \ (e.g., from IoT and the web) with suitable analytical techniques\n(including\
    \ AI-based techniques) to better identify and design speciﬁc administrative\n\
    policies [45].\nIn Barcelona, ICT has represented a key driver for the evolution\
    \ of the city model,\nbased on ﬂexible and efﬁcient e-government initiatives and\
    \ services that aim to make\nthe city more innovative, inclusive and self-sufﬁcient\
    \ [46]. In the early 2000s, the city of\nBarcelona started implementing the 22@Barcelona\
    \ Project to enhance the technological,\nsocio-economical and sustainable impact\
    \ of the region in order to improve citizens’ quality\nof life (QoL) [47]. In\
    \ Amsterdam, a consortium consisting of the municipalities, research\ncenters\
    \ and private companies of the metropolitan area developed and launched the\n\
    Amsterdam Smart City Platform (ASCP) in 2014: an online board where the aforementioned\n\
    stakeholders can discuss urban issues, propose solutions and foster city innovation\
    \ [48]. The\nlocal government in Rio de Janeiro has promoted city data sharing\
    \ initiatives, hosting them\nin the so-called Intelligent Operations Centre (IOC)\
    \ premises with the aim of increasing\nthe efﬁciency of city services [49]. Moreover,\
    \ the Rio Agora social platform has been\nimplemented to allow citizens to propose\
    \ and discuss public policies with municipal\nauthorities [3]. Singapore has adopted\
    \ several smart governance projects through the\nSmart Nation and Digital Governance\
    \ Group (SNDGG) [50], including a digital identity\nsystem for Singapore residents\
    \ that allows them to perform easier transactions with public\nadministration\
    \ and the Core Operations Development and eXchange (CODEX), which\nis a digital\
    \ platform delivering smart services to citizens. In Toronto, the Sidewalk Labs\n\
    smart city project was proposed. The project promotes data sharing standards and\
    \ data\ngovernance models to proﬁtably exploit the data gathered from citizens\
    \ [51] through the\nurban data trust model. This allows for the collection, management\
    \ and aggregation of\nurban non-personal data, de-identiﬁed data and personal\
    \ information (according to data\nprivacy regulations and laws) and then extracts\
    \ value from them [52]. Songdo in South\nKorea is considered one of most advanced\
    \ large-scale greenﬁeld-based smart city projects\nin the world [53]. In fact,\
    \ Songdo is deﬁned as a ubiquitous U-city, in which data are\ncontinuously collected\
    \ through a capillary network of sensors and equipment. Data are\nshared and interconnected\
    \ with information from public institutions, such as the Incheon\nCity Trafﬁc\
    \ Information Center, the Korean Meteorological Administration, the Institute\n\
    of Health and Environment, Police Agency, etc. Data are analyzed by the U-Integrated\n\
    Operation Center and provided to citizens through media broadcasts and control\
    \ servers\nin order to help them to ﬁnd the necessary information [54].\nAppl.\

    \ living domain includes all components related to developing smarter city\ninfrastructures\
    \ (e.g., smart homes, smart buildings, etc.) as well the management and\nimprovement\
    \ of public services, such as cultural activities, tourism and education, which\n\
    are involved in enhancing the general quality of life of citizens:\n•\nSmart Buildings:\
    \ IoT allows the rapidly growing implementation of many kinds of\nfacilities for\
    \ smart buildings, for instance, air conditioning management, rainwater\ndrainage,\
    \ security systems for managing authenticated access to buildings, video\nsurveillance\
    \ and human activity monitoring [55], alerts for events such as ﬁres and gas\n\
    leaks, tools for monitoring the structural integrity of buildings [56], etc. Many\
    \ different\nIoT technologies are involved in the living and infrastructures domain,\
    \ depending on\nthe speciﬁc use case or scenario. As for smart buildings, IoT\
    \ integration with Building\nInformation Modeling (BIM) tools provides a high-ﬁdelity\
    \ representation of buildings\nand spatial properties as a set of virtual assets\
    \ [57], i.e., a digital twin of the building;\n•\nSmart Homes: In these environments,\
    \ different kinds of sensors, actuators and per-\nsonal devices are connected\
    \ through wireless networks and are often powered by\nhuman–machine interfaces\
    \ that are based on artiﬁcial intelligence to provide smart\nand automated services\
    \ for the users, with the goal of assisting them in daily tasks,\nsuch as lighting\
    \ control, surveillance, managing home appliances and home resources,\nenergy\
    \ consumption, etc. [58]. In addition, smart home applications can be useful to\n\
    detect and track the actions of the house’s residents in order to monitor their\
    \ health\nconditions [12], thereby especially helping the elderly and disabled\
    \ people. Several\nkinds of sensors are applied to smart home and indoor sensing\
    \ contexts. For in-\nstance, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are employed\
    \ for the detection of gas\nleaks [59]. Devices based on triboelectric nanogenerators\
    \ (TENG) are used for smart\nwindows [60] and smart indoor lighting systems [61].\
    \ Video cameras and Closed-\ncircuit television (CCTV) systems are used for smart\
    \ surveillance. Digital humidity\nand temperature (DHT) sensors are largely adopted\
    \ in ﬁre alerting systems [62]. The\nmost recent generation of domestic appliances\
    \ and entertainment devices is often\npowered by AI and assistive services, so\
    \ that they can interact while interconnected\nthrough wireless networks (the\
    \ most used network communication protocols are\nBluetooth, Zigbee, infrared and\
    \ Wi-Fi [63]), thus providing users with a better, more\nefﬁcient and enjoyable\
    \ home life and experience;\n•\nSmart Living Services: IoT devices have a large\
    \ application in a variety of areas and\nactivities that contribute toward improving\
    \ the general quality of life for smart citizens.\nCultural activities, for instance,\
    \ smart tourism management, are taking advantage of\nexploiting mobile applications,\
    \ GIS-aware and location-based services, multimedia\nstreams, virtual and augmented\
    \ reality and social media to manage and offer a better\nexperience for tourism\
    \ stakeholders [64]. Examples of these applications include\ntourist experience\
    \ enhancement, destination competitiveness and sustainability im-\nprovement by\
    \ tracking users’ ﬂows and behaviors [65]. Education is experiencing an\nincreasing\
    \ decentralization process with the inclusion of ICT and IoT elements, and\nthis\
    \ allows the production of new education services that can enhance interaction\
    \ in\nremote and real-world learning activities [66].\nNumerous smart living and\
    \ infrastructures applications can be found in real-world\ncases. In [67], it\
    \ is reported that 840 million units of smart home products were supplied in\n\
    China in 2019. Los Angeles has implemented smart strategies for tourism management.\n\
    Tourist trafﬁc is measured through sensors embedded in the pavements and this\
    \ informa-\ntion is used to adjust site visitor lights [68]. In Dubai, tourists\
    \ can discover places of interest\nand events by exploiting NFC tags from their\
    \ personal devices. There are many dedi-\ncated mobile apps that take advantage\
    \ of cloud computing and allow visitors to connect\nseamlessly, without the need\
    \ to download the app [69].\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n10 of 21\n3.3. Smart Mobility\
    \ and Transportation\nThe smart mobility and transportation concept implies the\
    \ shift from traditional\ntransportation systems to Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS),\
    \ where a smart IoT infrastructure\nconnects different actors (citizens, public\
    \ administrations, private companies) and entities\n(vehicles, personal devices,\
    \ city sensors, actuators, etc.) [70]. IoT and intelligent transporta-\ntion systems\
    \ (ITSs) [71] allow the provision of smart applications and services to manage,\n\
    for instance, private and public trafﬁc ﬂows, dynamic trafﬁc routing, smart parking,\
    \ vehicle\nsharing and sustainable mobility, connected driving, etc. Intelligent\
    \ trafﬁc solutions often\nrely on the application of predictive models for early\
    \ warnings, accident prevention and\nreal-time trafﬁc congestion management.\n\
    In this context, many IoT network technologies have been proposed and used. City\n\
    sensors and actuators (e.g., for the management of trafﬁc lights, digital signage,\
    \ road\nbarriers, etc.), location-based GPS services and mobile-to-mobile communication\
    \ are the\nbasis for the implementation of vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V)\
    \ and vehicle-to-\ninfrastructure communication (V2I). Additionally, 5G networks\
    \ and LTE-based systems\nhave been employed for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services\
    \ [72]. Vehicular ad hoc net-\nworks (VANETs) [73] have been designed to handle\
    \ a large number of nodes (including\nvehicles, roadside units (RSU) and on-board\
    \ units (OBU) [74]) and present a good adapt-\nability to the frequent topology\
    \ changes and the data exchange rate [75]. The adoption of\nITSs is at the basis\
    \ of smart parking and car sharing [76] services. The most disseminated\ndevices\
    \ are RFID tags, infrared and ultrasonic sensors, smartphone-based sensors, video\n\
    cameras for smart parking [77] and on-board diagnostic systems (OBD tools) [78].\n\
    In Berlin, the smart mobility service Jelbi was introduced in 2019, based on a\
    \ mobile\napplication that is connected to all services provided locally (e.g.,\
    \ car-sharing companies\nsuch as MILES and DB Flinkster and e-vehicle hire companies\
    \ such as TIER), to foster the\npassage toward a more sustainable mobility [79].\
    \ In Florence, the Snap4City platform has\nbeen developed in the context of the\
    \ Sii-Mobility project for sustainable mobility, providing\na ﬂexible IoT smart\
    \ city platform and several applications to manage heterogeneous and\ncomplex\
    \ urban mobility scenarios by integrating city sensors/actuators and IoT/IoE [34].\n\
    Atlanta has powered its transportation infrastructure with many smart technologies.\
    \ For\ninstance, a system of adaptive trafﬁc signals that adjust to trafﬁc conditions\
    \ in real time\nare installed on the North Avenue Smart Corridor (a critical longitudinal\
    \ communication\nroadway) [3]. London has a cycle rental system, currently offering\
    \ more than 11,500 bikes\nand over 750 docking stations. As for car-sharing solutions,\
    \ London has six active operators\nin the city, covering the whole Greater London\
    \ area [80]. In addition, London’s public\ntransportation system provides the\
    \ use of Oyster cards, which are smart electronic cards\nthat exploit RFID technology\
    \ and can be used for paying and buying electronic tickets for\npublic transportation,\
    \ thereby reducing queues and eventually tracking users’ ﬂows. In\nSantander,\
    \ smart mobility services are applied to the management of public transportation,\n\
    outdoor parking management and trafﬁc routing [81]. The city of Bilbao has enhanced\
    \ the\nsustainability of local mobility by deploying a network of e-bikes with\
    \ 40 pick-up points\nand e-buses that are supported by mobile applications: GeoBilbao\
    \ (reporting real-time\ninformation about parking and trafﬁc status) and iBilbobus\
    \ (information about bus stops\nand schedules) [66]. In Seoul, the Gangnam ubiquitous\
    \ district has a centralized control\nframework, including the Transport Operation\
    \ and Information Service (TOPIS) app and\nthe “Owl Bus”, which is an innovative\
    \ bus service performing analytics on the big data\nthat is collected on-board\
    \ [82].\n3.4. Smart Economy\nA smart economy is based on the innovative interconnection\
    \ of local and global mar-\nkets through ICT, providing e-business and e-commerce\
    \ services to increase productivity\nand delivery [83]. In addition, the concept\
    \ of a sharing economy is also included in this\ndomain, where individuals or\
    \ private companies offer services exploiting their own assets\nas well as through\
    \ peer-to-peer marketplaces. There are also peer-to-peer labor services,\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n11 of 21\nin which citizens and stakeholders offer their\
    \ work and experience for speciﬁc tasks [84].\nArtiﬁcial intelligence and machine\
    \ learning techniques have been implemented for building\npredictive models and\
    \ improving recommendation systems for e-commerce and retail shop-\nping [85].\
    \ The use of NFC and wireless sensor technologies has facilitated payment and\n\
    transaction processes. In Shenzen, the use of mobiles and smartphones in daily\
    \ transactions\nand information access is making cash and bankcards obsolete [86].\n\
    3.5. Smart Industry and Production\nSmart industry and industry 4.0 deﬁne a transformation\
    \ process in which IoT tech-\nnologies, cyber-physical systems (CPS), M2M communication\
    \ systems and cloud-based\nmanufacturing [87] allow an innovative and less human-dependent\
    \ productive environ-\nment [88]. Regarding the automation of goods supply chains,\
    \ they can be easily tracked\nfrom the manufacturing process to ﬁnal distribution\
    \ using sensor technologies, such as\nRFID and NFC. Real-time information can\
    \ be collected and analyzed for shipment tracking,\nas well as for the assessment\
    \ of the quality and usability of products [14]. The smart indus-\ntry and production\
    \ domain includes all ﬁelds in which ICT leads to the automatization\nof the productive\
    \ workﬂow, therefore also includes smart agriculture and farming, which\naddresses\
    \ the challenge of sustainable food production. Smart agriculture systems often\n\
    employ IoT devices to improve irrigation efﬁciency [89] and AI solutions are often\
    \ deployed\nin IoT for agriculture, e.g., for crop monitoring, disease detection\
    \ and data-driven crop\nsupply management [7].\nDublin Airport has employed smart\
    \ industry 4.0 solutions to replace its baggage-\nhandling systems in Terminal\
    \ 2 [90]. In Shenzen, a smart industrial complex includes a\nseries of smart factories\
    \ that share technologies and provide efﬁcient services (exploiting\nan ultra-high-speed\
    \ Internet connection, next-generation wireless network, free Wi-Fi\ninfrastructures\
    \ and IoT devices connected via a common cloud platform) [3].\n3.6. Smart Energy\n\
    Smart energy systems involve the intelligent integration of decentralized renewable\n\
    and sustainable energy sources and their efﬁcient distribution [91] and aim to\
    \ optimize\npower consumption [92]. Smart grids take advantage of ICT and IoT\
    \ technologies for\nthe better management of power generation and distribution,\
    \ exploiting, for instance,\nprediction models (developed from collected consumption\
    \ data) and often ensuring the\nself-healing of the energy network supply [93].\
    \ Smart grids help energy load balancing\non the basis of usage and availability.\
    \ In this way, it is possible to switch automatically to\nalternative sources\
    \ of energy, as well as predicting future energy demand and estimating\nthe power\
    \ availability and price [14].\nNew generations of smart energy IoT devices have\
    \ been designed for alternative\nenergy harvesting, such as triboelectric nanogenerators\
    \ (TENG) and electrostatic energy\nharvesters (EEH) [59]. A multiplicity of IoT\
    \ sensors is involved in the smart energy context,\nsuch as light dependent resistors\
    \ (LDRs), sensors for measuring light luminosity [94] and\nthe consumption of\
    \ solar radiation and electricity [95].\nNice, France, has made efforts to improve\
    \ smart energy management by scheduling\nelectricity consumption in residential\
    \ and business locations. The smart grid in Nice\nwas created through a smart\
    \ solar neighborhood in city areas by supplying and storing\ndistributed electricity\
    \ [58]. The city of Padova has performed several initiatives in intelligent\n\
    energy management, such as a smart lighting system in which each smart light device\
    \ is\ngeolocated in the city and is powered by photometer sensors that monitor\
    \ the intensity\nof the light emitted by the lamps and check that the correct\
    \ operation of the bulbs is\nperformed [96]. Atlanta has implemented a smart neighborhood\
    \ project to reduce the\nHome Energy Rating System (HERS) score. Energy optimization\
    \ platforms manage home\nappliances, switching to solar power and batteries if\
    \ available [3]. In Helsinki, smart grids\nhelp to reduce energy usage by 15%\
    \ [97]. The Masdar City project aimed to be one of\nthe most efﬁcient and environment-friendly\
    \ systems in the UAE by exploiting renewable\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n12 of\
    \ 21\nenergy technologies. The city has planned a solar power array and rooftop\
    \ solar panels that\ncan provide more than 10 MW. This, combined with wind energy\
    \ harvesting technologies,\ncan supply energy for a target population of about\
    \ 40,000 citizens [98].\n3.7. Smart Environment\nThe smart environment domain\
    \ includes environmental data collection, monitoring\nand analysis for pollution\
    \ reduction, water quality and supply monitoring and weather\nand climate events\
    \ management [67]. In this regard, air quality monitoring is a crucial\nfactor\
    \ for tracking levels of air pollutants (e.g., NOx, O3, CO2, N2O, PM10, PM2.5,\
    \ etc.),\nwhich represent a serious issue for human health (caused by transportation,\
    \ heating and\nindustrial emissions). Smart waste management is also included\
    \ in this area since it has\nnumerous impacts on the environment. Control policies\
    \ for waste production are handled\nwith smart waste bins that are installed with\
    \ sensors and are capable of providing the\nreal-time analysis of the capacity\
    \ that is currently available [92].\nAs for smart water, sensing devices that\
    \ are devoted to the assessment of water\nquantity and quality typically measure\
    \ parameters such as pH, conductivity, turbidity, total\ndissolved solids, etc.\
    \ [99]. Electromagnetic and ultrasonic sensors are employed to measure\nthe pressure\
    \ for water consumption rate analysis [100]. The application of WSNs for water\n\
    quantity and quality monitoring systems has opened up a new generation of smart\
    \ water\nmonitoring systems, providing a more advanced context awareness and near\
    \ real-time\ninteraction [101].\nSmart environment applications and services are\
    \ typically based on ambient and\nchemical sensors, which are used to measure\
    \ physical quantities expressing environmental\nparameters and conditions, such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, pressure [7] and different kinds\nof pollutants. Smart\
    \ sensing and visualization technologies (satellites, LiDAR) are applied\nto greenhouse\
    \ gas emissions (GHG) and land usage [99]. Location-based services and GIS\ndata\
    \ are also employed.\nIn Singapore, solid waste is managed by the Integrated Waste\
    \ Management Facility\n(IWMF), which includes innovative IoT technology that allows\
    \ for an increase in the process\nefﬁciency and a reduction in GHG emissions [102].\
    \ In Amsterdam, the Green City Watch is\na geo-spatial AI platform that monitors\
    \ urban green infrastructures in near real time using\nAI algorithms and satellite\
    \ images [103]. In Stockholm, solar-powered smart waste bins are\ninstalled, which\
    \ automatically report when they are fully charged and also perform waste\npackaging\
    \ [66]. The Busan smart city, South Korea, employs smart water management\nsystems\
    \ in the whole urban water cycle [3]. In the context of the European TRAFAIR\n\
    project, six European cities (Florence, Pisa, Livorno and Modena in Italy and\
    \ Santiago de\nCompostela and Zaragoza in Spain) have adopted the Snap4City platform\
    \ for monitoring\nurban air quality (using sensors that collect data in the six\
    \ cities) and providing urban air\nquality predictions using simulation models\
    \ [104].\n3.8. Smart Healthcare\nIoT technologies and ubiquitous computing have\
    \ been widely applied to mobile\nhealthcare for remote monitoring, telemedicine\
    \ and telenursing, adverse drugs reactions,\ncommunity healthcare, etc., and these\
    \ aspects are even more relevant in this recent period\nof the COVID-19 pandemic.\
    \ Remote patient monitoring (RPM) can be performed through\nthe use of wearable\
    \ or implanted devices (e.g., cardiac devices, airﬂow monitors, blood glu-\ncometers,\
    \ etc.) that are connected in the cloud using WSN technologies [20]. This has\
    \ led to\nthe development of body sensor networks (BSNs) or wireless body area\
    \ networks (WBANs),\nin which the integration of multiple heterogeneous data sources\
    \ allows the acquisition of\nthe biometric and physiological data of the patients\
    \ for IoT healthcare applications [105].\nSmart hospitals also rely on IoT technologies\
    \ to provide services for medical staff and pa-\ntients (the identiﬁcation and\
    \ monitoring of patients in hospitals and the smart management\nof medical instruments\
    \ supporting decision-making processes in hospitals) [106]. All of\nthese application\
    \ ﬁelds and the related requirements impose well-deﬁned standards, such\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n13 of 21\nas Health Level Seven (HL7), PACS-DICOM in biomedical\
    \ image processing [107], etc.\nRecent advances propose the use of AI techniques\
    \ to deﬁne innovative applications, e.g.,\nmachine learning prognostics and the\
    \ measurement of biometric parameters or symptoms\nfrom multimedia (using mobile\
    \ videos or voice messages, through deep learning- and\nspeech recognition-based\
    \ methods) [108] and disease prediction and prevention [109].\nSingapore has developed\
    \ the HealthHub platform, which integrates personal health\nrecord management\
    \ and the clinical data of patients and citizens [3]. In Stockholm, the\nNew Karolinska\
    \ Solna Hospital integrated smart energy and BIM technologies to provide\nuser-focused\
    \ services (for patients, visitors and medical staff) [110]. The hospital of Hefei,\n\
    China, is one of the ﬁrst of China’s smart hospitals [111] where all aspects of\
    \ the patients\nare managed via IoT and connected healthcare, also providing smart\
    \ building services\nand sustainable energy management. The Helsinki University\
    \ Hospital has implemented\na real-time locating system (RTLS) to collect and\

    \ Future Directions\nIoT smart city technologies and applications are spreading\
    \ rapidly, and this is reported\nin more and more real-world cases. However, on\
    \ the basis of the analysis and review\nperformed in the previous sections, this\
    \ integration process is not complete since it is still\nfacing some open challenges,\
    \ which may be resolved in future developments.\nFor instance, there are interoperability\
    \ problems due to the presence of many different\nIoT protocols, formats and frameworks\
    \ [3,29,92,105,113], and this aspect is enhanced\nby the fact that many smart\
    \ city applications have been initially developed as vertical\nsilos applications\
    \ [3,18] with each of them using its own solutions for data ingestion,\nstorage\
    \ and exploitation. Resolving the interoperability issues could bring economic\n\
    beneﬁts. In fact, achieving a higher level of interoperability among devices,\
    \ applications\nand services involves the reduction in costs for producing completely\
    \ new and different\ndeployments of the solutions [113], thereby allowing backward\
    \ compatibility through\nthe exploitation of older systems as well as an incremental\
    \ deployment and integration.\nOn the other hand, the development of the IoT/IoE\
    \ paradigm has led to the adoption\nof event-driven and push protocols [32], which\
    \ has paved the way not only to sense the\ncity but also to act through actuators\
    \ and to create event-driven applications. However,\nmost of the solutions proposed\
    \ in the literature still focus on limited domains, addressing\nspeciﬁc problems\
    \ with little or no software reuse [3]. In order to handle the high variety\n\
    of IoT devices and applications, the paradigm of microservice-oriented architecture\
    \ is\nincreasingly adopted in recent IoT-based solutions for smart cities [13,29,32,109].\
    \ This\nenhances the scalability and availability of IoT frameworks and simpliﬁes\
    \ the complexity\nof the traditional service-oriented architectures (SOA) [32].\
    \ For IoT-based solutions, the\nachievement of a higher scalability represents\
    \ the possibility to efﬁciently collect and\nprocess increasingly larger amounts\
    \ of data, which often leads to a higher accuracy in\ndata analysis and often\
    \ enables real-time or near real-time processing [114]. These aspects\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 1607\n15 of 21\nimply important social involvement, for instance,\
    \ in security and resilience, since they\nallow the building of more resilient\
    \ tools that are able to perform real-time analysis and\nsimulations, e.g., those\
    \ used by local public authorities for early warnings and alerts in\ncritical\
    \ events, such as disaster management [99] and resilience planning. Moreover,\
    \ many\nIoT solutions are still oriented toward traditional programming environments,\
    \ while the\nmost recent trends show an advancement in the exploitation of visual\
    \ paradigm languages\n(VPL) [15,32], including Node-RED, for implementing workﬂows\
    \ for IoT applications.\nThe adoption of microservice-oriented architectures leads\
    \ toward the overcoming of\nthe monolithic platform approach [3] since the microservice\
    \ paradigm allows the reuse of\nsoftware components and blocks. Moreover, microservice\
    \ architectures are open to exten-\nsions and they can also exploit external services\
    \ more easily (when necessary for delegating\npart of the computation as well\
    \ as accessing additional services or applications) [29]. For\ninstance, they\
    \ can be easily adapted to support almost all kinds of IoT and communication\n\
    protocols and also support data-driven and event-driven push modalities. This\
    \ is moving\nin the direction of the implementation of smarter frameworks for\
    \ business intelligence and\ndata analytics, as well as more interactive visual\
    \ analysis tools [32]. This deeper level of\nintegration and complexity of IoT-enabled\
    \ smart city platforms should bring advancements\nin performing real-time simulations,\
    \ what-if analysis and supporting decision-making\nprocesses, which is the basis\
    \ of the production of smarter and more efﬁcient services and\napplications for\
    \ all involved stakeholders.\nFurthermore, IoT-enabled smart city platforms are\
    \ evolving toward cross-organization\nand multitenancy IoT platforms and applications.\
    \ This allows the development of large\ninfrastructures that can support multiple\
    \ organizations, enhance scalability and reduce the\ninfrastructures’ costs since\
    \ they are shared between multiple operators [36]. This aspect\nis closely connected\
    \ with the reuse of components in smart city frameworks and tries to\nharmonize\
    \ and overcome the efforts needed in building custom-made platforms for each\n\
    city or each speciﬁc context, which is economically inefﬁcient [3]. Other potential\
    \ future di-\nrections include the introduction and dissemination of novel network\
    \ technologies, such as\n5G [28,59,72,102]. Technological advances in networks\
    \ and device solutions are important.\nIn fact, the adoption of the most recent\
    \ network technologies, such as 5G, combined with\nhigher efﬁciency in building\
    \ techniques and technologies following the paradigm of net\nzero energy infrastructure\
    \ can lead to building solutions that are aiming for net zero carbon\nemissions\
    \ [102]. Furthermore, the introduction of innovative computing paradigms, such\n\
    as the introduction and integration of deep learning and AI solutions [109,115],\
    \ semantic\ntechnologies and natural language processing (NLP) would improve the\
    \ interaction level\nbetween smart devices and all smart city actors, as well\
    \ as enabling the production of\nsmarter services for a better quality of life.\n\
    Finally, in order to also discuss the societal challenges addressed by IoT and\
    \ smart city\ntechnologies, we focused on assessing each application area and\
    \ domain, as discussed in\nSection 3, in terms of their contribution to the SDGs.\
    \ To this end, we will brieﬂy introduce\nthe 17 indicators representing the SDGs:\
    \ (1) no poverty; (2) zero hunger; (3) good health\nand well-being; (4) quality\
    \ education; (5) gender equality; (6) clean water and sanitation;\n(7) affordable\
    \ and clean energy; (8) decent work and economic growth; (9) industry, innova-\n\
    tion and infrastructure; (10) reduced inequalities; (11) sustainable cities and\
    \ communities;\n(12) responsible consumption and production; (13) climate action;\
    \ (14) life below water;\n(15) life on land; (16) peace, justice and strong institutions;\
    \ and (17) partnerships for the\ngoals. On the basis of our ﬁndings while reviewing\
    \ the literature, relevant contributions\nand relations among the presented IoT–smart\
    \ city application areas and the following SDGs\nwere retrieved:\n•\nZero Hunger:\
    \ Smart agriculture [7] solutions contribute to improving efﬁciency in ac-\ncessing\
    \ fundamental resources, such as food, and also allow precision agriculture [89];\n\
    •\nGood Health and Well-being: Smart healthcare solutions [106,108] contribute\
    \ to im-\nproving efﬁciency in healthcare services that are provided in hospitals\
    \ and medical\nstructures, as well as at home. Big data collection and analysis\
    \ in healthcare contexts\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n16 of 21\ncan be useful for\
    \ monitoring critical cases, conditions and events [109], especially in\nthe period\
    \ of COVID-19 pandemic;\n•\nQuality Education: Smart education solutions contribute\
    \ to creating innovative educa-\ntion services, as well as to enhancing the interaction\
    \ between remote and real-world\nlearning activities [66];\n•\nClean Water and\
    \ Sanitation: Smart water solutions [100] are employed to monitor\nthe quantity\
    \ and quality of water distribution and aim to minimize consumption and\nmanage\
    \ wastewater treatments [101]. This represents an important step in the proper\n\
    design and maintenance of quality water systems;\n•\nAffordable and Clean Energy:\
    \ Smart energy solutions and energy grids [3,58,93,96,97]\ncontribute to a more\
    \ efﬁcient energy distribution and usage [92], helping to minimize\npower consumption\
    \ and consider innovative sustainable energy sources [91];\n•\nDecent Work and\
    \ Economic Growth: Smart governance solutions [3,38,39,46–54]\ncontribute to economic\
    \ growth [38] since they are expected to provoke a strong push\nin the direction\
    \ of smart and digital public administrations [39]. Moreover, smart\neconomy solutions\
    \ [83,84] can also contribute to allowing citizens, companies and\nsmart city\
    \ stakeholders to follow the market for smart applications and data economy,\n\
    rethinking the ﬂexibility of jobs and labors [84] and, thus, redeﬁning the economic\n\
    value associated with them;\n•\nIndustry, Innovation and Infrastructure: Smart\
    \ industry solutions [3,14,33,90] are\nestablishing new and relevant digital infrastructures\
    \ for sustainable industrial produc-\ntion [88] and data economy;\n•\nSustainable\
    \ Cities and Communities: Several IoT-enabled smart city components\ncontribute\
    \ to improving the sustainability of smart city communities. For instance,\nsmart\
    \ mobility solutions [3,66,79–82] are aiming to establish near-to-zero emissions\n\
    and reduced trafﬁc ﬂows and to also enhance the adoption of smart transportation\n\
    and IoT paradigms. These aspects will bring relevant inﬂuences and improvements\n\
    for the quality of life in smart cities [92];\n•\nClimate Action: Smart environment\
    \ technologies [3,66,102,103] that are focused on\nmonitoring air quality and\
    \ pollutant levels [99,104] contribute to analyzing and con-\ntrolling air quality\
    \ and fossil combustion, as well as their environmental impact in\nterms of CO2,\
    \ NO, NO2, etc. (which are the main effects of fossil combustion);\n•\nPeace,\
    \ Justice and Strong Institutions: Smart governance solutions [3,38,39,46–54]\n\
    contribute to providing institutions with data-driven decision-making processes\
    \ [39],\nwhich makes citizens’ participation more inclusive and deliberative,\
    \ thus creating a\nconsensus for the public good and enhancing equality and social\
    \ justice [38].\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper, a review of the recent research\
    \ literature on IoT-enabled smart cities\nframework was performed. The rationale\
    \ behind this study was the requirement to un-\nderstand and classify the most\
    \ recent trends in the adoption of IoT technologies as a key\ndriver for the efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable development of smart cities. The purpose was also\nto highlight\
    \ the main open challenges that need to be addressed and resolved in the future.\n\
    The review was conducted both for key IoT technologies, which were analyzed following\n\
    an architectural perspective, and for smart city approaches and frameworks, which\
    \ were\nbased on classiﬁcation into eight domains describing the main application\
    \ areas. From this\nanalysis, it emerged that in recent years, the integration\
    \ of IoT solutions and smart city\nframeworks is achieving increasingly higher\
    \ levels of complexity and wider application\nranges, which go beyond the past\
    \ generation of vertical silo applications that were based\non speciﬁc domains.\
    \ In fact, the necessity to overcome vertical silos (i.e., where data are\ncollected\
    \ and “siloed” in a unique system and closed to the rest of IoT [114]) has provoked\n\
    several initiatives. For instance, the EU developed speciﬁc initiatives and IoT\
    \ programs,\nsuch as the open API standard Open Messaging Interface (O-MI) and\
    \ Open Data Format\n(O-DF) [116]. This produces new added-value across multiple\
    \ platforms, providing the\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n17 of 21\npossibility to\
    \ share protocols, data and results and allowing the better and more efﬁcient\n\
    cooperation between all involved actors and stakeholders (users, software and\
    \ network\nproviders, institutions, companies, etc.) [114]. To this end, the new\
    \ generation of smart\napplications will manage and optimize more complex sets\
    \ of heterogeneous information,\ndata, systems, sensors, devices, etc. However,\
    \ this process is still not complete since it\nhas to cope with several open technical\
    \ and social challenges (regarding the efforts to\nharmonize the many different\
    \ standards for IoT formats and protocols, interoperability\nand scalability issues\
    \ and the achievement of sustainability goals) in order to move toward\nmicroservice-oriented\
    \ architectures, event-driven/data-driven applications and more sus-\ntainable\
    \ solutions. Finally, another important driver could be represented by all involved\n\
    stakeholders and actors, who are raising their awareness and becoming more actively\n\
    engaged in the smart city environment, not only as service consumers but also\
    \ as the\nproducers of valuable contents and information.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    take advantage of industry advanced technologies, including the internet of things
    (IoT), cloud/fog/edge computing, artificial intelligence, and agricultural robots
    to monitor, track, analyze and process various functions and services in real-time.
    Additionally, these technologies can make the agricultural processes smarter and
    more cost-efficient by using automated systems and eliminating any human interventions,
    hence enhancing agricultural production to meet future expectations. Although
    the current agriculture systems that adopt the traditional cloud-based architecture
    have provided powerful computing infrastructure to distributed IoT sensors. However,
    the cost of energy consumption associated with transferring heterogeneous data
    over the multiple network tiers to process, analyze and store the sensor''s information
    in the cloud has created a huge load on information and communication infrastructure.
    Besides, the energy consumed by cloud data centers has an environmental impact
    associated with using non-clean fuels, which usually release carbon emissions
    (CO 2 ) to produce electricity. Thus, to tackle these issues, we propose a new
    integrated edge-fog-cloud architectural paradigm that promises to enhance the
    energy-efficient of smart agriculture systems and corresponding carbon emissions.
    This architecture allows data collection from several sensors to process and analyze
    the agriculture data that require real-time operation (e.g., weather temperature,
    soil moisture, soil acidity, irrigation, etc.) in several layers (edge, fog, and
    cloud). Thus, the real-time processing could be held by the edge and fog layers
    to reduce the load on the cloud layer, which will help to enhance the overall
    energy consumption and process the agriculture applications/services efficiently.

    I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the emerging technologies
    that promise to transform the way on how people work and live. The term IoT refers
    to a network of physical objects “things” that contain embedded systems with connectivity
    and computing power to exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet.
    By 2025, the number of IoT devices connected to the Internet is projected to be
    100 billion, with an economic impact of more than \$ 11 trillion [1]. The recent
    development of IoT devices presents a new dimension in the agriculture field,
    where the IoT has become an ideal choice for smart agriculture due to its highly
    scalable and ubiquitous architecture. Moreover, the IoT-based smart agriculture
    value is estimated to reach \$ 18.45 billion in 2022, and 75 million IoT devices
    are used for the agricultural sector in 2020 [2]. Furthermore, smart farms are
    projected to have 12 million IoT points by 2023 [3]. Smart agriculture has started
    incorporating IoT solutions to improve operational efficiency, maximize yield,
    and minimize wastage through real-time field data collection, data analysis, and
    deployment of control mechanisms. Also, the diverse of IoT-based applications
    such as precision farming and smart irrigation is very helpful to the enhancement
    of agricultural processes. Thus, the IoT is considered as one of the promising
    solutions for embracing connected farms to address agriculture-based issues and
    increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production. IoT solutions are
    highly associated with cloud computing to process the huge amount of heterogeneous
    data sent or received by agriculture sensors/actuators [4]. Although cloud computing
    can handle smart agriculture applications, some of the applications and services
    produce a large amount of data and need to be processed in a real-time manner,
    which may cause a heavy load on the network, long response time, and poor quality
    of service, due to limited bandwidth [5]. Therefore, using the traditional cloud-based
    architecture may not be efficient to support these applications, which may also
    result in high energy consumption due to the transfer of agriculture data to and
    from the cloud. The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry is
    projected to account for 20% of the global electricity demand by 2025 [5]–[8],
    [9]. Usually, consuming electricity is accompanied by carbon emissions (CO2).
    fossil fuel usage is the primary source of CO2 [10]. Consequently, this causes
    the growth of carbon dioxide emissions. According to [11], ICT uses 730 Million
    ton (Mt) CO2 equivalents (CO2e) or 1.4% of worldwide carbon emissions. To overcome
    the above shortcomings, edge and fog computing architecture are introduced to
    process the real-time IoT applications and services at the proximity of data sources
    in an efficient way, which have several benefits (e.g., reduce energy consumption,
    network traffic and improve quality of service) compared to traditional cloud-based
    architecture, that does not exploit the latest paradigms such as fog and edge
    in the agriculture system [4], [6]. However, edge and fog computing are not a
    replacement for cloud computing, as cloud computing will still be preferable and
    suitable for analyzing and processing heavy tasks, as well as storing data in
    a long term. The collaboration between edge, fog, and cloud computing is the best
    practice to achieve smart agriculture solutions. Several related works in the
    literature, (e.g. in [12], [13]), have discussed various architectures, techniques,
    and methods applied for smart agriculture systems considering different technologies
    such as IoT, big data analytics, and cloud computing. However, none of the existing
    works focused on the edge-fog-cloud architecture intending to reduce the energy
    consumption, CO2 emission, and network traffic as considering the three computing
    layers (edge, fog, and cloud). Therefore, this paper presents a new approach for
    smart agriculture systems to develop an energy-efficient offloading of IoT agriculture
    applications over an edge-fog-cloud computing architecture, according to the resource
    requirements of each agriculture task. Also, this approach could help to enhance
    the solutions of many traditional agriculture issues by taking the advantage of
    edge and fog computing, which will improve the overall energy efficiency and reduce
    CO2 emission, network traffic of smart agriculture systems. The major contributions
    of this paper are summarized as follows: \bullet Develop an energy-efficient architecture
    based on mathematical modeling and heuristic algorithm to study the offloading
    of IoT applications from agriculture sensors to edge, fog, and geo-distributed
    cloud, while considering minimization of the overall power consumption of networking
    and processing of the IoT agriculture services. \bullet Optimize the offloading
    of IoT agriculture applications over an edge-fog-cloud architecture, which connected
    to the access network, metro area network, and wide area network, respectively,
    thus eliminating the associated power consumption and telecommunication network
    traffic. \bullet Evaluate the usability and the capability of the proposed architecture
    and its models, using the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, and compared
    the results to the traditional approach. The remainder of this paper is organized
    as follows: Section II introduces the edge-fog-cloud system architecture and its
    interaction layers. Section III presents the mixed-integer linear programming
    (MILP) model for optimizing the offloading of IoT agriculture applications in
    the edge-fog-cloud architecture. The model’s design, scenarios, and the input
    parameters of the models are presented in Section IV. This is followed by discussing
    the optimization model results and analysis in Section V. In Section VI, we introduce
    energy-efficient agriculture IoT applications distribution heuristic over the
    edge-fog-cloud architecture (EEAIOT-EFC). Finally, Section VII concludes the paper
    and discusses future work. SECTION II. Proposed Architecture for Smart Agriculture
    System Today, the traditional cloud-based architecture for agriculture systems
    is inefficient to satisfy all the requirements of the current scenarios [4], [5],
    [7], [8], as it lacks the essential efficiency prerequisites such as energy consumption,
    CO2 emission, network traffic, and so on [6]. Consequently, there is a need to
    develop an energy-efficient architecture for a smart agriculture system to fulfill
    these requirements. This section provides an outline of the proposed edge-fog-cloud
    architecture and its role in providing dynamicity and efficiency based on different
    IoT agriculture applications. The proposed architecture of the smart agriculture
    system is shown in Fig. 1; and it consists of four essential layers, namely, IoT
    sensor layer, edge layer, fog layer, and cloud layer. The description of each
    layer of the proposed architecture is presented as follow: FIGURE 1. An IoT-based
    edge-fog-cloud architecture for smart agriculture system. Show All A. IoT Sensor
    Layer IoT sensors generate massive heterogeneous data to the gateways by using
    various sensors deployed in different areas of the agriculture field. Also, this
    layer can receive decisions from to control actuators (e.g., turning on/off irrigation
    system) [14]. In smart agriculture, there is a range of IoT sensor nodes used
    to identify several phenomena over the urban areas including but not limited to
    soil pH, soil temperature, soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, and ambient
    temperature [15]. In the IoT agriculture system, low power wide area (LPWA) technologies
    have paved the way due to their low power consumption and wide area coverage.
    Long range (LoRa) is proved its efficiency, as a transmission protocol for IoT
    sensors. Besides its low power consumption, it ensures an extent of 10 kilometers
    coverage or more. In addition to LoRa, multiple wireless technologies can be used
    for smart agriculture urban areas such as narrowband (NB)-IoT, WiFi, Zigbee, and
    the 5G. The Zigbee technology has been successfully used in the field of agriculture
    at a low power cost. However, the limited distance coverage for wireless data
    transferring (about 20 meters) is reducing its efficiency. A comprehensive comparison
    of different IoT wireless network technologies (Zigbee, LoRa, NB-IoT, and 5G),
    is presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 IoT Wireless Network Technologies Comparison
    B. Edge Layer Edge computing refers to a new computing model that implements the
    computation of sensors/actuators data at the edge of the network. With this concept,
    some applications and services that do not require a lot of computing resources
    can be processed in the edge layer (close to the data source) and no longer need
    to traverse the network to be processed by the fog or the cloud. Thus, edge computing
    can improve data transmission performance, ensure real-time processing, and reduce
    the computational load as well as the amount of data transmitted to and from the
    fog or cloud data centers [8]. However, in case of unavailability/unsuitability
    of the resources in the edge layer, the sensors will automatically request to
    process their data in the fog or the cloud, and this will be done hierarchically.
    C. Fog Layer The fog computing concept was initially proposed by Cisco in 2014
    to expand the resources of cloud computing to the edge of the telecommunications
    network. In this context, the fog layer has the responsibility to process and
    analyze data sent from IoT sensors, which helps to minimize the latency for agriculture
    applications and services. Also, the fog layer has the ability to process and
    analyze complex data more than the edge layer. Both fog and edge can provide computation,
    networking, and storage services in between the sensor layer and the cloud layer.
    It means that instead of executing all processing at the cloud layer, the fog
    and edge layers can process and analyze agricultural data locally and close to
    the sensor layer (based on their ability) to reduce latency and cost [5], [7].
    D. Cloud Layer At the same level of importance as edge and fog, cloud computing
    is a vital enabler for the growth of IoT agriculture applications. It offers on-demand
    computing resources and services (e.g., storage, networking, and processing) in
    a scalable way. The cloud layer handles the agriculture data received from the
    sensor layer or the fog layer to process, analyze and store them into the cloud.
    Cloud computing can process and analyze heavy data, that requires more complex
    operations (e.g., big data processing and predictive analysis like weather forecasting,
    fire warning, and soil droughting), which exceeds the fog computing capability
    [6]. Also, it could provide a large-scale secure platform and cheap data storage
    services for the IoT agriculture applications [5], [8]. E. Telecommunication Networks
    The traditional telecommunication network architecture consists of three layers
    [16]: the core layer, the metro layer, and the access network layer. The wide
    area network (WAN) is the key network infrastructure that provides interconnection
    between different regions and cities. The Internet protocol (IP) over wavelength
    division multiplexing (WDM) is widely implemented in the core network as it can
    provide high scalability, large capacity, and fast communication network transfer
    speeds. Based on the reference hierarchy in Fig. 1, every core network has a direct
    connection with a metro area network (MAN), which covers a metropolitan area.
    Metro Ethernet is the technology commonly used in the metro network. It offers
    connectivity between the core network and users located in the access network.
    The local area network (LAN) supports Internet access to numerous user premises.
    We adopted the passive optical networks (PONs) which considered as the leading
    networking in the LAN network. SECTION III. MILP Model In this section, a new
    approach is developed based on mathematical mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
    optimization model to study the energy-efficiency of offloading IoT agriculture
    applications over an edge-fog-cloud architecture, considering the three telecom
    network layers: LAN equipped with an edge layer, MAN equipped with a fog layer
    and the WAN equipped with a cloud layer. In the following, we introduce the parameters
    and variables of our proposed architecture. The architecture consists of the IoT
    sensor, edge, fog, and cloud layers. Then, we provide the mathematical model to
    find the optimum distribution of IoT agriculture applications to serve the offloaded
    requests from the IoT sensor layer based on their energy consumption over an edge-fog-cloud
    architecture. A. IoT Sensor Layer The parameters and variables that represent
    the IoT sensor layer, are shown in Tables 2 and 3. TABLE 2 IoT Parameters TABLE

    emissions [18] can be defined as the carbon emission intensity per an energy consumption
    and the unit of carbon emission intensity is kgCO2e / kWh. The research found
    that using solar, wind or nuclear plants creates a low carbon footprint compared
    with fossil fuels [19]. However, there are multiple limitations to the usage of
    low carbon sources including but not limited to the cost of installing these clean
    plants. Thus, in this work, we assume that only the IoT sensor layer and edge
    layer are powered by low carbon sources (i.e., solar plants panels) to reduce
    the power consumption of the proposed architecture. In the following Tables 12
    and 13, we define parameters and variables related to carbon emissions. TABLE
    12 Emission Parameters TABLE 13 Emission Variables Total carbon emission (CO)
    is composed of:\begin{align*}&\left ({\text {WAN O} }\right)+\left ({\text {MAN

    are powered by solar energy sources. While others are powered by oil energy sources.
    SECTION IV. MILP Model Design In this section we explain the scenarios and the
    design of the model conducted in order to evaluate the proposed architecture.
    A. Scenarios As shown in Fig. 1, different scenarios can be implemented with this
    proposed architecture to show its effectiveness. In this work, the following scenarios
    are considered in a hierarchical order based on the edge, fog, and cloud ability.
    Edge/fog layers can be deployed in the proposed architecture according to the
    resources required by the agriculture tasks. Essentially, all tasks from heterogeneous
    IoT devices/sensors in the agriculture field, using different IoT wireless network
    technologies will be offloaded to the network gateways and then directed to edge/fog
    or cloud layer. Each layer has pros and cons. For example, processing the tasks
    within the edge layer will save the power and traffic cost of request transmission
    from/to the fog or cloud layer. However, handling all types of tasks within the
    edge layer is not possible, as it has limited capacity. Therefore, fog and cloud
    layers can be the choice for processing heavy tasks (e.g., resource-intensive
    applications). In our model, we assume that a scheduler in the gateway of the
    IoT layer checks if the edge node has available resources and can handle the request
    of IoT applications (e.g., CPU capability - the number of million instructions
    per second (MIPS)), the tasks will then pass to the edge layer to process them.
    In case of insufficient/unavailability of processing the tasks in the edge layer,
    the request will be transferred to the fog layer and check if there is enough
    capacity. Otherwise, the tasks will be forwarded to the cloud layer for processing,
    which supports resource-intensive applications. Also, we have assumed that the
    cloud has enough resources and capability to handle all kinds of tasks. B. Input
    Parameters of the Models In the MILP model, we have configured four layers in
    a smart agriculture system, which is composed of the IoT sensor layer, edge layer,
    fog layer, and cloud layer. The configuration of edge, fog, and cloud layers depend
    on the type of tasks (e.g., number of MIPS) requested by each IoT sensor/device
    at the IoT sensor layer. The model input parameters of different layers (IoT sensor,
    edge, fog, and cloud layers), in addition to networks and carbon emissions parameters,
    are shown in Tables 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18, respectively. TABLE 14 IoT Sensor
    Layer Input Parameters TABLE 15 Cloud, Fog, and Edge Input Parameters TABLE 16
    LAN, MAN, WAN Network Input Parameters TABLE 17 Carbon Emission Inputs for Each
    Fuel Type [17], [22] In our model, we assume that there are 100,000 sensors distributed
    in each farm The sensors task requirements are divided into three types (sensing
    60%, processing 30%, heavy processing 10%). The sensing processing task is usually
    limited to handling offloaded reading data sent by the sensors (e.g., temperature
    reading or send control commands for the irrigation system). The processing task
    is the requirement of light processing (e.g., soil analytics and event detection).
    The heavy processing task is the requisite of higher processing power and resources
    (e.g., weather prediction and analysis). SECTION V. Results and Discussion In
    this section, we discuss the proposed energy-efficient edge-fog-cloud architecture.
    In addition to its energy efficiency, we evaluate our model to find the consequence
    CO2 emission, and network traffic compared to the traditional cloud-based architecture.
    We have evaluated the proposed architecture and models using MILP optimizer based
    on the AT&T network topology, as shown in Fig. 2. To solve the MILP model, we
    use the CPLEX solver over a laptop with an Intel Core i7–7660U CPU, running at
    2.50 GHz, with 16 GB RAM. FIGURE 2. AT&T WAN network topology. Show All As shown
    in Table 1, we have categorized all IoT wireless network technologies used in
    this work based on their data rate, range, number of devices, power consumption
    of both gateway/base-station, and sensors. This work has identified that the power
    consumption of different IoT wireless network technologies almost the same, as
    shown in Fig. 3. The Zigbee technology delivers connectivity with low power consumption
    compared to other technologies. However, using Zigbee in the urban area is not
    the best choice as it only covers 20 meters, thus, hundreds or thousands of gateways
    are required to cover a large area. FIGURE 3. Comparison of different IoT wireless
    network technologies based on their energy consumption. Show All Since we aim
    to use a technology that covers a large area with the least amount of energy consumption.
    Therefore, LoRa has been chosen as an IoT wireless communication technology between
    the IoT sensors and the gateway, that covers long-distance communication, with
    low power consumption, and considers one of the most suitable technology for IoT
    agriculture applications, as shown in Fig. 3. A. Energy Consumption Fig. 4 illustrates
    the power consumptions of different tasks in the proposed edge-fog-cloud architecture
    versus the traditional cloud-based architecture. Also, it shows the placement
    location of each task/application in edge-fog-cloud architecture, as well as the
    power consumption values of each task individually. FIGURE 4. The energy consumption
    of the proposed architecture vs. the traditional cloud-based architecture, considering
    the IoT LoRa technology. Show All The results showed that the sensing tasks are
    offloaded to the edge layer, as it has enough capacity (i.e., sensing requires
    500 MIPS, and the edge layer has the capability to process up to 1800 MIPS). The
    normal processing tasks are offloaded to the fog respectively, as the fog layer
    has sufficient resources (i.e., 4000 MIPS) to process the tasks (i.e., 2000 MIPS).
    All remaining requests are offloaded to the cloud layer as there is no capacity
    in edge neither fog layers to accommodate heavy processing tasks. Fig. 5 shows
    the power consumption of our proposed architecture compared to the traditional
    cloud-based architecture, considering different IoT wireless technologies. Also,
    the figure displays power saving achieved by the proposed architecture. It is
    clearly shown that our proposed architecture outperforms the traditional cloud-based
    architecture by up to 36% of the total power consumption. However, the power savings
    have slightly ranged between 33.6% and 35.6% based on the different IoT wireless
    technologies. The Zigbee shows a higher power saving as it capable of offloading
    sensor data with lower power consumption. FIGURE 5. The energy saving of the proposed
    architecture vs. the traditional cloud-based architecture, using different IoT
    wireless technologies. Show All B. CO2 Emission Fig. 6 illustrates the total carbon
    emissions of the proposed edge-fog-cloud architecture versus the traditional cloud-based
    architecture, considering powering the IoT sensor layer and edge layer by a solar
    power source. FIGURE 6. The total carbon footprint emission of the proposed architecture
    vs. the traditional cloud-based architecture. Show All It shows that our proposed
    architecture can reduce up to 42% of CO2 emission, for real-time IoT applications
    in agriculture systems. The results also show a comparable carbon emission using
    different IoT wireless technologies. The power consumption of these technologies
    has been eliminated, as all IoT sensors and gateways are power by a solar plant,
    that emits very low carbon footprints (solar plants emit only 0.048 kgCO2/kWh).
    C. Network Traffic Fig. 7 shows the total traffic in each network tier in our
    proposed architecture versus the traditional cloud-based architecture. The results
    showed that our proposed architecture is capable to reduce the total traffic by
    14% and 86% in MAN and WAN tiers, respectively, compared to a cloud-based approach.
    FIGURE 7. The network traffic of the proposed architecture vs. the traditional
    cloud-based architecture. Show All In the traditional cloud-based architecture,
    the process of sending/retrieving the data to/from the cloud in real-time requires
    high-capacity bandwidth, which may cause a burden on the three network tiers.
    Thus, employing edge and fog computing has allowed processing most requests locally
    in edge or fog layers, which significantly decreases the flow of data traverse
    to the cloud and reduces network traffic, as shown in Fig. 7. SECTION VI. Energy
    Efficient Agriculture IoT Edge/Fog/Cloud Architecture Heuristic The problem over
    energy-efficient offloading of IoT applications in edge-fog-cloud architecture
    for smart agriculture environment is a non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-hard
    problem. For instance, if i is IoT applications count and n is the count of locations
    in edge-fog-cloud architecture, then we will have \left ({\sum \limits _{z=1}^{n}
    \frac {n!}{\left ({n-z }\right)!} }\right) combinations of possible applications
    locations to find the optimum locations that result in optimal power consumption.
    Thus, applying MILP to large-size problems is not feasible. Therefore, heuristic
    provides a simple and fast real-time implementation. Also, the optimal solution
    provided by the heuristic can provide validation to results obtained from MILP.
    To provide that, a heuristic algorithm was developed, referred to as energy-efficient
    agriculture IoT applications distribution heuristic over the edge-fog-cloud architecture
    (EEAIOT-EFC). In the EEAIOT-EFC heuristic, IoT application i is checked based
    on their total MIPS processing requirements. Firstly, the algorithm tries to place
    and run the application on the edge layer. If there is not enough MIPS capacity
    at the edge layer, then, agriculture IoT application is placed in the fog layer,
    if it has enough capacity. In case of unavailability resources in both edge and
    fog layers, the cloud layer will host the IoT application, as it has enough processing
    capability to handle all types IoT applications. After distributing all IoT applications,
    the power consumption of EEAIOT-EFC is determined. The heuristic flowchart process
    is shown in Fig. 8. FIGURE 8. Flowchart of EEAIOT-EFC heuristic. Show All The
    heuristic is assessed using a PC with an Intel Core i7–7660U CPU, running at 2.50
    GHz, with 16 GB RAM. Similar to MILP, the AT&T network is considered a WAN network
    example. The heuristic took 5 seconds to evaluate the EEAIOT-EFC, and the MILP
    and EEAIOT-EFC show a comparable result, as shown in Fig. 9. The gaps between
    them are limited to 0.7% and 4.7% of the total power consumption under the proposed
    and the traditional cloud-based, respectively. FIGURE 9. Difference between the
    MILP model vs. EEAIOT-EFC heuristic. Show All SECTION VII. Conclusion and Future
    Works In this paper, the concept of an edge-fog-cloud architecture is introduced
    in the smart agriculture system, which solved existing real-time processing issues
    in terms of reducing energy consumption, CO2 emission, and network traffic, compared
    to the traditional cloud-based architecture. The proposed architecture employed
    the edge and fog layers, which are placed close to the agriculture fields to collect
    heterogeneous data from various kinds of IoT agriculture sensors and process them
    at these layers. Although the proposed architecture was significantly reduced
    the computational load and the amount of transmitted data to and from the cloud
    due to the use of edge and fog layers, however, the cloud layer is inevitably
    used to process the heavy and complex data/task requested by IoT agriculture devices/sensors.
    Most of the processing tasks are completed on the edge and fog layers, while few
    tasks are offloaded to the cloud layer for processing. In the paper, different
    metrics have been taken into consideration, including energy consumption, CO2
    emission, and network traffic to study the performance and the outcomes of the
    proposed architecture. Using mathematical modeling, the proposed architecture
    is compared with the traditional cloud-based architecture. The model results showed
    that our proposed architecture can reduce the overall power consumption, carbon
    footprints, and network traffic by up to 43%, 36%, 86%, respectively. Moreover,
    we developed energy-efficient agriculture IoT applications distribution heuristic
    over the edge-fog-cloud architecture (EEAIOT-EFC) algorithm, which showed comparable
    results to the MILP model. Though this proposed solution is based on the idea
    of smart agriculture, it also can be suitable for other IoT applications and sectors,
    such as e-healthcare, smart city, and smart home. In the future, we intend to
    extend the proposed approach in a distributed real agricultural environment, considering
    machine-learning and decision-making algorithms to further understand the capability
    of the proposed work. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to acknowledge the

    \ of national Gross Domestic Product\n(GDP) in developed countries [3]. All these\

    This review aims to give the reader a comprehensive view of maintenance and in-\n\
    telligent sensors in Smart Factory. As can be seen from the following, current\
    \ literature\nreviews [4–10] have shown that the literature is focusing on speciﬁc\
    \ topics only separately.\nThe literature specializes in different types of sensors\
    \ but does not consider them in relation\nto those technologies, and industry\
    \ 4.0. Professional texts lack a summary of literature and\ntexts that would bring\
    \ the usability and potential of sensors closer to common practice,\nso that these\
    \ ﬁndings can be clearly used for business management in the implementation\n\
    of maintenance system planning. This would be beneﬁcial for operational managers\
    \ and\nengineers for the design of new maintenance systems. This article provides\
    \ a comprehen-\nsive overview of current trends to help structure and guide future\

    \ trends in maintenance processes in\nsmart factories. We deﬁne which Industry\

    \ and organisational changes\nand desirable competencies is further addressed\
    \ by Sousa [16], as well as Lee et al. [17].\nThey pay attention to the gap between\
    \ recent researches on the actual level of deployment.\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n\
    3 of 40\nIn the ﬁeld of maintenance of intelligent factories, we ﬁnd several literature\
    \ reviews\nwith the resonant notion of predictive maintenance. In their overview,\
    \ Carvalho [18]\nfocuses on machine learning methods, which they consider a promising\
    \ tool for predictive\nmaintenance. Sakib [19] observes the shift from service\
    \ activities to proactive, predictive\nmaintenance and places [20] in the context\
    \ of Industry 4.0. Olesen and Shaker [21] deals\nwith practical use in thermal\
    \ power plants, and Fei [22] in the ﬁeld of aircraft systems.\n2.1. Intelligent\
    \ Sensors\nWe ﬁnd a critical area in the concept of smart factories, and that\
    \ is intelligent logistics—\ntransport and warehousing. These operations include\
    \ identiﬁcation and detection of the\nlocation of resources across the company.\
    \ We understand sensors as a technical reproduc-\ntion of natural processes because\
    \ human nerves transform external stimuli into electrical\nsignals transmitted\
    \ to the central nervous system—the brain. Smart sensors process ag-\ngregated\
    \ data from production processes in real-time and enable self-determination of\n\
    machines and other smart devices [23,24]. Data on production resources are used\
    \ to mon-\nitor, collect, and evaluate the data obtained. The most common type\
    \ of wireless sensors\nwork on radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), ZigBee, and\
    \ Bluetooth technology [25].\nEifert [26] deﬁnes intelligent sensors as a multi-component\
    \ measuring device that is self-\ncalibrating, self-optimised, and easy to integrate\
    \ into the environment for high connectivity.\nBesides, intelligent sensors also\
    \ have process intelligence and can generate multidimen-\nsional data information.\
    \ The literature of the most inﬂected RFID technology is also one of\nthe key\
    \ technologies for implementing the Internet of Things (IoT). In RFID technology,\n\
    it is an active and passive tag, where the active sensor sends information for\
    \ hundreds\nof meters, and the passive tag receives it. The integrated sensor\
    \ in production enables\na ﬂexible and targeted strategy of predictive maintenance\
    \ and control [27]. Sensors that\nare part of the IoT can proactively monitor\
    \ the device and issue alerts when the device\ndeviates from the speciﬁed parameters,\
    \ we speak of so-called facility management [28].\nKarabegovic [29] adds that\
    \ the sensors convert physical parameters (temperature, speed,\nhumidity) into\
    \ signals that can be measured electronically. The use of smart sensors in\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0 is characterised by Schmitt [30]. The key element is knowledge of the current\n\
    state of the system. Sensor data with other parameters of the given process in\
    \ the sense\nof self-diagnostics and machine learning can be evaluated in real-time.\
    \ The traceability of\nindividual components is also essential—from screws to\
    \ the uniformity of seals, this knowl-\nedge enables the measurement of tolerance\
    \ and comprehensive monitoring of the condition\nof machines and other equipment.\n\
    2.2. Predictive Maintenance\nPredictive maintenance (PdM) is the latest maintenance\
    \ policy adopted by many\nindustries. Above all, these are areas that require\
    \ absolute reliability, such as power\nplants, public services, transport systems,\
    \ and emergency services. Forecasted information\nis usually necessary for the\
    \ long term and for planning various operational activities\n(maintenance, production,\
    \ inventory, etc.). In addition, due to technological and logistical\nlimitations,\
    \ maintenance cannot always be performed everywhere [31]. Maintenance is\na critical\
    \ activity that takes place in production. Machine failures during production\n\
    can lead to adverse effects on the production schedule, delivery delays, or employee\n\
    overtime to compensate for the loss. PdM predicts system failures to optimize\
    \ maintenance\nefforts [32,33]. According to Carvalho [18,34], PdM is a set of\
    \ tools used to determine\nwhen speciﬁc maintenance is required. The tool is based\
    \ on continuous monitoring of\nthe machine or process, and this allows maintenance\
    \ to be performed only when needed.\nA secondary, no less important function of\
    \ PdM is the possibility of early detection of\nfaults, thanks to tools based\
    \ on historical data—machine learning—as well as visual aspects\nof faults—colour\
    \ and wear. As a possible part of the Industry 4.0 concept, PdM aims to\nminimise\
    \ maintenance costs, implement zero-waste production, and reduce the number of\n\
    major failures [35]. Despite PdM’s beneﬁts, Herrmann [36] highlights the potential\
    \ risks\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n4 of 40\nof remote access to maintenance processes\
    \ and cites Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)\nattacks, for example. According\
    \ to Zonta [20], we distinguish three approaches to PdM,\nnamely: Based on a physical\
    \ model, where the main feature is mathematical modelling\nrequiring the timeliness\
    \ of the state and statistical methods of evaluation. The second\napproach is\
    \ the knowledge-based approach, which reduces the complexity of the physical\n\
    model, and the last approach is the data-driven approach, which we ﬁnd most often\n\
    in the current development of PdM. This approach is based on artiﬁcial intelligence,\n\
    i.e., machine learning and statistical modelling, and is a satisfactory approach\
    \ in the\nconditions of Industry 4.0 [37]. Farooq et al. distinguish experience-driven\
    \ and data-\ndriven maintenance [38]. Experience-driven preventive maintenance\
    \ is based on gathering\nknowledge about production equipment, which is then used\
    \ to plan future maintenance.\nOn the contrary, data-driven preventive maintenance\
    \ is based on analysing a large volume\nof data (Figure 2).\nSensors 2021, 21,\

    \ maintenance is based on analysing a large volume of data \n(Figure 2). \n \n\

    \ Factory \nOne of the key components of Industry 4.0 is a smart factory, otherwise\
    \ also a smart \nor digital factory. A smart factory represents the future state\
    \ of fully interconnected pro-\nduction systems, without a significant amount\
    \ of manpower [13]. According to Chen [25], \na smart factory is a manufacturing\
    \ solution that provides adaptive and flexible manufac-\nturing processes that\
    \ reflect the rapidly and dynamically changing conditions in the world. \nOn the\
    \ one hand, this solution can be understood as a combination of software and hard-\n\
    ware, which should lead to the optimisation of production and the reduction of\
    \ waste of \nscarce resources. On the other hand, the concept can be perceived\
    \ as a space for perspec-\ntive cooperation with business partners based on the\
    \ formation of a dynamic organisation. \nThe smart factory architecture itself\
    \ includes a physical resource layer, a data and network \nlayer, as well as an\
    \ end layer. All elements of the intelligent factory are interconnected, \nexchanging\
    \ information, and recognising and evaluating situations. Thus, physical and \n\

    \ Factory\nOne of the key components of Industry 4.0 is a smart factory, otherwise\
    \ also a smart or\ndigital factory. A smart factory represents the future state\
    \ of fully interconnected produc-\ntion systems, without a signiﬁcant amount of\
    \ manpower [13]. According to Chen [25], a\nsmart factory is a manufacturing solution\
    \ that provides adaptive and ﬂexible manufactur-\ning processes that reﬂect the\
    \ rapidly and dynamically changing conditions in the world. On\nthe one hand,\
    \ this solution can be understood as a combination of software and hardware,\n\
    which should lead to the optimisation of production and the reduction of waste\
    \ of scarce\nresources. On the other hand, the concept can be perceived as a space\
    \ for perspective\ncooperation with business partners based on the formation of\
    \ a dynamic organisation. The\nsmart factory architecture itself includes a physical\
    \ resource layer, a data and network\nlayer, as well as an end layer. All elements\
    \ of the intelligent factory are interconnected,\nexchanging information, and\
    \ recognising and evaluating situations. Thus, physical and\ncyber technology\
    \ is integrated, which results in improved controllability, control, trans-\n\
    parency of production processes, maximises value for the customer, and in addition,\
    \ there is\ncommunication between the factory and the market itself [39,40]. The\
    \ core technologies of\nIndustry 4.0 include IoT, cloud computing, and high-volume\
    \ data analysis. IoT represents\nthe integration of sensors and computer technology\
    \ in the ﬁeld of wireless communication,\nand cloud services allow access to the\
    \ network respectively, as a shared pool of computing\nresources. The combination\
    \ of these technologies allows the involvement of all devices\nin the concept\
    \ of a smart factory, but the collection of huge amounts of data requires\nanother\
    \ technology, which is the analysis of high-volume data. With the help of analytical\n\
    tools—data mining or machine learning—this technology is one of the most important\n\
    elements of the entire concept of Industry 4.0 [41]. Other technologies related\
    \ to the vision\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n5 of 40\nof a smart factory include autonomous\
    \ robots, additive manufacturing, augmented reality,\nand cybersecurity. Drastic\
    \ changes in technology are changing the concept of production.\nIn the modern\
    \ concept, traditional centrally controlled processes are replaced by decen-\n\
    tralised control, which builds on the ability of individual elements of a smart\
    \ factory to\ncommunicate with each other. In self-regulatory production, people,\
    \ machines, equipment,\nand products communicate with each other [42].\n3. Materials\

    3.6. Content Analysis and Synthesis\nThe results of search query publications\
    \ were further subject to analysis and synthesis.\nWe performed the analysis in\
    \ the Endnote software database and Microsoft Excel software,\nwhich were used\
    \ to evaluate various aspects of the monitored topics. Our research team\nconsisted\
    \ of three members who participated in the evaluation and analysis of search\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 1470\n9 of 40\nresults. This phase included evaluating the full\
    \ texts of individual publications based on\nthe set research goals.\nWe focused\
    \ mainly on:\n•\nThe research method (case study, experiment, simulation)\n•\n\
    Objectives of the articles\n•\nUsed intelligent sensors and data\n•\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0 technologies for smart factories\n•\nPredictive maintenance processes characteristics\n\
    •\nSmart and intelligent keywords domain\nWe used the clustering method during\
    \ the analysis, which is part of the VOSviewer\nsoftware [45] and allows classiﬁcation\
    \ using keywords. Using VOSviewer, we performed a\nco-occurrence analysis of keywords,\
    \ which is based on clustering methods. Cluster analysis\nenabled to ﬁnd a number\
    \ of paired keywords cited in the same publications. The results\nof the cluster\
    \ analysis clearly capture the knowledge structure of the research frontiers.\n\
    We evaluated the quality of publications included for the synthesis (ﬁnal selection)\
    \ thorough\nreview of individual team members. In particular, the ranking of journals,\
    \ citations of\npublications, and their possible biases were considered.\n3.7.\
    \ Excluded Studies\nTo avoid possible effects of bias, it is necessary to mention\
    \ the most important publica-\ntions, which were eliminated from the sample for\
    \ qualitative synthesis reasons. Aheleroff\net al. [50] examined the application\
    \ of smart IoT sensors in the fridge (smart homes focus).\nSeveral publications\
    \ are mainly focused on the logistic area [51], i.e., from the automotive in-\n\
    dustry [52–54] or the aviation industry [55,56]. We excluded from the analysis\
    \ publications\nfocused on agriculture, which do not deal with smart factories’\
    \ production processes. These\nare publications using intelligent sensors in milling\
    \ [57] and aquaponics [58]. The review\npapers were eliminated from the ﬁnal selection.\n\
    4. Results\nThe results are divided into three parts according to the research\
    \ question: an overview\nof the main topics, smart and intelligent predictive\
    \ maintenance, and Industry 4.0 Tech-\nnologies and Sensors for Smart Factory.\n\
    4.1. Main Topics and Trends Overview\nFirst, we identiﬁed occurrences of the primary\
    \ topics “smart factory/production,”\n“intelligent/smart sensors,” and “predictive/smart\
    \ maintenance” in the Web of Science\nand Scopus databases. This part of the research\
    \ related to the research question 1. All three\nconcepts are connected in the\
    \ research area by engineering, supplemented by telecommuni-\ncations and predictive\
    \ maintenance by medicine, or intelligent sensors in computer science.\nThe total\
    \ number of publications in the databases is shown in Figure 4.\nThe results shown\
    \ in Figure 5 show an increase in the number of publications over time.\nThis\
    \ increase has been apparent for smart factory publications since 2015 and intelligent\n\
    sensors since 2012. Further, we performed burst detection analysis in the researched\
    \ areas\nfor Web of Science publications.\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n10 of 40\n\

    \ that the oldest wave in smart factories is associated with classical\nstudies\
    \ dealing with intelligent, ﬂexible, and automation planning and scheduling of\n\
    manufacturing systems. This wave is the period 1970–1990, characterised by the\
    \ burst\nterms intelligent, system, knowledge, plan, and schedule. The second\
    \ wave in 1990–2010\nwith the primary burst terms: agent, manufacturing, control,\
    \ expert, and process, refers to\npapers using holon, RFID, or web technologies\
    \ in factories. Publications on manufacturing\ncontrol systems [62,63] were highly\
    \ cited in this period. The current trend in smart factory\nis related to implementing\
    \ intelligent manufacturing [64]. In this contemporary wave,\nburst terms Industry\
    \ 4.0, digital twin, IoT, deep learning, digitalisation, smart grid, cyber,\n\
    and sustain dominate. These terms are well-known Industry 4.0 technologies and\
    \ processes.\nTop cited papers focused on operational planning of a smart grid\
    \ [65], deep learning\nin agriculture [66], and big data for the self-organised\
    \ multiagent system in the smart\nfactory [67].\nTop cited papers from smart/intelligent\
    \ sensors were in areas related to the Internet of\nThings [68], wireless sensor\
    \ networks [69], and nanotechnology applications [70]. We found\nthat the important\
    \ paper title terms are IoT, structure, and sensor in the burst analysis.\nFigure\
    \ 5 shows that the early history of intelligent sensors, 1970–1990, emphasised\
    \ the\nﬁrst application of sensors (burst terms sensor, intelligent, process).\
    \ Later, in 1990–2010\ncame articles focused on the structure [71], optic, and\
    \ control of sensors, and their usage\nfor robots. Some essential publications\
    \ in this period focused on structural health monitor-\ning [72], piezoelectric\
    \ laminate beam [73], and free vibration behaviour of the beam [74].\nThe most\
    \ contemporary period from 2010 to 2020, similar to the smart factory/production,\n\
    covered the area of Industry 4.0 new technologies. In addition to the mentioned\
    \ Internet\nof Things [75], there is a signiﬁcant representation of publications\
    \ focused on wearable\nsensor-based systems [76], deep learning [77], edge technology\
    \ [78], graphene-based smart\nmaterials, blockchain, smart city, and grid.\nThe\
    \ last area focused on smart/predictive maintenance. After omitting medical and\n\
    ecological articles, the most cited publications focused on proportional-integral-derivative\n\
    (PID) control [79], monitoring, and fault diagnosis in production [80]. Based\
    \ on the burst\nanalysis results, we found that the most important terms are maintenance,\
    \ learning, and pre-\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n12 of 40\ndict. We identiﬁed three\
    \ trend waves in area maintenance (Figure 5). In the ﬁrst wave from\n1970 to 1990,\
    \ the publications dealt with predictive maintenance. In engineering and pro-\n\
    duction, maintenance is associated with predicting machines’ status [81] or deterioration\n\
    of processes [82]. In the second wave in 1990 to 2010, we found that the publications\
    \ dealt\nwith burst terms program, diagnostics, intelligence, knowledge, and database.\
    \ These pub-\nlications focus, for example, on diagnostics, monitoring, or maintenance\
    \ of intelligent\ncomputer numerical control (CNC) machine tools [83] or power\
    \ transformers [84]. The cur-\nrent trend wave is characterised by Industry 4.0\
    \ technologies such as digital twins, deep\nmachine learning, IoT, big data analytics,\
    \ blockchain, and digitisation for maintenance.\nThe most signiﬁcant publications\
    \ of this period focused on big data analytics in logistics\nand supply chain\
    \ management [85], maintenance strategy selection [86], vibration analy-\nsis\
    \ of rotating machinery, or cloud-enabled prognosis [87] for predictive maintenance\
    \ in\nproduction.\nBased on the burst analysis detection, we conclude that in\
    \ all three areas in the\nlast 10 years, the focus has been on the concept of\
    \ Industry 4.0 and related technologies.\nWe arranged the keywords with the highest\
    \ burst weights into three research areas in\nFigure 7. The results show that\
    \ the terms Internet of Things and deep learning have the\nhighest weight for\
    \ all topics. The terms Big Data, grid, and intelligent are also common to\nthe\
    \ area. From this ﬁnding, we can conclude that the current trend in the monitored\
    \ areas\nis related to the collecting of big data through intelligent sensors\
    \ on IoT devices and their\nevaluation using learning algorithms.\nThe internet,\
    \ smart grid, and blockchain technology are important for sensors used\nin maintenance.\
    \ The use of sensors in smart factories lies mainly in the area of control,\n\
    with a focus on processes. The sensors, together with actuators, are used to collect\
    \ data to\ncontrol and optimise conditions. Piezoelectric, optics, wearable, beam,\
    \ graphene, and other\nsensors’ features are used. A special area of sensors lies\
    \ in robotics, which has experienced\nrapid development in recent years. In the\
    \ world’s most industrialised countries, such\nas South Korea, Japan, Germany,\
    \ and Sweden, there is the largest share of robots per\n10,000 employees in factories\
    \ [88]. Automation in smart factories requires new types\nof sensors that have\
    \ the ability to automatically calibrate and improve the functions of\nIoT devices.\
    \ The IoT is not aiming only at connect two machines with pre-programmed\nfunctions.\
    \ For IoT communication, it is important to connect embedded devices to the\n\
    Internet and communicate with each other [89]. It is an intelligent connection\
    \ of various\nproducts, devices, and facilities that provide a wide range of functions\
    \ that evaluate certain\nconditions. The interaction between systems brings new\
    \ possibilities. The key elements are\nminiature intelligent sensors [90]. Even\
    \ though devices and systems were not originally\ndesigned to share data, the\
    \ Internet of Things can. Connecting smart sensors and gateways\nto existing devices\
    \ leads to data collection and analysis, understanding, and better decision\n\
    making [91].\nPublications about smart factory/production are related to cyber-physical\
    \ systems,\nplanning, scheduling, and sustaining them. Maintenance in smart factories\
    \ relies on\nIndustry 4.0 technologies, digitisation, data-driven manufacturing,\
    \ agent-based systems,\nand digital twins. Predictive maintenance consists of\
    \ programs for predicting, diagnosing,\nand analysing future maintenance needs.\
    \ Based on the rules, features, and conditions,\nthere are machines and devices\
    \ controlled and repaired to maintain their life and future\nsustainability. Information\
    \ and data are collected and shared through databases.\n4.2. Smart and Intelligent\
    \ Predictive Maintenance\nWe performed a co-occurrence analysis based on original\
    \ papers’ keywords using\nVOSviewer. This part of the analysis related to research\
    \ question 2. The results show that\nthe keywords maintenance, optimisation, predictive\
    \ maintenance, system, and big data\nwere most often used in publications. Publications\
    \ were grouped based on keywords into\nfour clusters (Figure 8).\nSensors 2021,\

    \ grouped based on keywords into \nfour clusters (Figure 8). \n \nFigure 8. Keywords\
    \ of co-occurrence analysis. \nFigure 8. Keywords of co-occurrence analysis.\n\
    •\nI4: Industry 4.0 for predictive maintenance in general (keywords: Industry\

    condition monitoring, fault diagnosis).\n•\nRUL: Prognostics and health management\
    \ for RUL (keywords: prognostics and health\nmanagement, signal processing, remaining\
    \ useful lives).\nThe ﬁrst cluster consists of publications that focus on intelligent\
    \ sensors in smart\nmaintenance factories without preferring speciﬁc methods.\
    \ This cluster is represented, for\nexample, by publications focused on data-driven\
    \ simulation [92], big data in an Industry 4.0\nenvironment [93], or performing\
    \ predictive maintenance in a bottling plant [94]. The sec-\nond cluster consists\
    \ mainly of publications that emphasise the use of condition-based\nmaintenance.\
    \ The intelligent condition-based maintenance uses data fusion [95] and the\n\
    Internet of Things in connection to learning techniques [96]. The third cluster\
    \ related to\npublications mainly emphasised fault diagnosis’ importance for monitoring\
    \ and mainte-\nnance. The fault diagnosis is used for prognosis in signal processing\
    \ [97] and maintenance\nmanagement systems [98]. The last cluster is characterised\
    \ by a focus on determining the\ncurrent health and the remaining life of devices\
    \ and machines. This concept is described\nconcerning edge-cloud platforms [99].\n\
    While the concept of condition monitoring has been around for some time, the market\n\
    for more sophisticated predictive maintenance products is still very young. There\
    \ are four\ntypes of maintenance classiﬁed in the literature: corrective, scheduled,\
    \ condition-based,\nand statistical-based maintenance [100,101]. Predictive maintenance\
    \ has evolved from\ncorrective maintenance using new technologies and procedures\
    \ for predicting and prevent-\ning failure. Corrective maintenance is based on\
    \ the reactive strategy to the maintenance\nprocess—however, with a proactive\
    \ strategy related to the preventive or opportunistic\napproach. Preventive maintenance\
    \ is then seen as condition-based, dynamic predictive,\nor scheduled (periodic)\
    \ maintenance. The corrective maintenance is based on the repair or\nreplacement\
    \ of assets ex-post. Condition-based maintenance means the decision-making\nprocess,\
    \ usually in real-time, based on selected indicators computed from the gathered\n\
    data.\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n14 of 40\nTable 6 depicts maintenance process characteristics\
    \ from analysed papers. The condition-\nbased preventive maintenance is discussed\
    \ in Farooq et al. [38], Kumar et al. [102], Li et al. [96],\nLin et al. [103],\
    \ Musselman and Djurdjanovic [104], Yan et al. [93], and Sadiki et al. [105].\n\
    Preventive maintenance is regular maintenance of machines, devices, and equipment\
    \ to\nprevent their downtime concerning failure state. The preventive maintenance\
    \ actions were\nclassified by Doostparast et al. [106] as inspection, low-level\
    \ repair, and replacement. These\nactions are based on fault prediction time statistically,\
    \ upon failure accident, time-based (at the\nage for old machines), or cycle-based\
    \ (periodically).\n4.3. Industry 4.0 Technologies and Sensors for Smart Factory\n\
    Furthermore, full texts of articles concerning Industry 4.0 technologies were\
    \ analysed.\nWe performed a cluster analysis of the obtained keywords of Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies. The\nresults of the analysis are shown in Figure 9. The most\
    \ common keywords in the articles\nwere sensor, big data, Internet of Things,\

    4.3.1. Motion, Position, Proximity, and Speed Sensors\nThe ﬁrst type of sensors\
    \ are motion-based probes. Position and movement sensors\nare mounted for monitoring\
    \ the machine or product position on the production lines.\nInductive, photoelectric,\
    \ potentiometric (resistance-based), capacitive, optical, magnetic,\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 1470\n23 of 40\nand other sensing methods are used for detection of position.\
    \ Sensors based on motion\ndetection must meet the requirements in the areas of\
    \ durability, weight, energy consump-\ntion, and at the same time, suitability\
    \ for mass production regarding to the end user—\ncustomer [123,124]. Shoabid\
    \ [125] describes motion-based sensors as a combination of\nan accelerometer,\
    \ gyroscope, magnetometer, and linear acceleration. The application of\nthese\
    \ sensors can be found primarily in the ﬁeld of healthcare systems, with various\
    \ com-\nbinations of the above-mentioned sensors. A gyroscope is used mainly for\
    \ gait analysis,\nfall detection, or gesture recognition, or in combination with\
    \ an accelerometer. Proximity\nsensors detect the presence of an object without\
    \ contact. These sensors are based on the\noptical, ultrasonic, inductive, and\
    \ capacitive nature. Wearable sensors are able to monitor,\nfor example, physiological\
    \ parameters in real time.\nSpeed sensors have an opportunity for detecting object\
    \ speed (usually for wheels,\nmotor, or rotating particles). Enterprises use speedometers,\
    \ accelerometers, light detec-\ntion and ranging (LIDAR) sensors, tachometers,\
    \ Doppler radars, etc. Farooq et al. [38]\ndiscussed genetic-algorithm-based prediction\
    \ process for intelligent maintenance of textile\nspinning systems. They used\
    \ vibration and speed data in a multiagent system for tracking\ndiscrepancies\
    \ and error distribution of machine processing. Integrated Electronics Piezo-\n\
    Electric accelerometers have been frequently used for machine vibration measurement.\n\
    Peng et al. [113] use them for an automatic health condition diagnosis without\
    \ ﬁeld worker\nmaintenance effort. The results show that dynamic response signals\
    \ from the accelerometer\nincreased the completeness and performance of the vibration\
    \ diagnosis function. Further,\nPeng and Tsan [98] developed a sensor diagnosis\
    \ and monitoring system to classify the\nhealth condition of the online integrated\
    \ IEPE accelerometer. The solution was integrated\ninto a production line.\nGoodall\
    \ et al. [92] developed, based on the RFID, a data-driven simulation for con-\n\
    trolling work-in-process parts in a remanufacturing process and determining the\
    \ time for\noperators to process them [104]. Park et al. [112] performed experiments\
    \ on servo motor\nlifespan using an accelerated degradation testing method based\
    \ on thermal stresses. The ex-\nperimental data are used sensors for monitoring\
    \ the torque, position, electrical resistance,\nand moment of inertia of rotor.\
    \ Shan et al. [114] presented the system architecture and\nhardware for the welding\
    \ line, which provides the real-time ﬁne-grained visualisation of\nthe welding\
    \ robot operation status. The electrocardiogram of intelligent manufacturing\n\
    equipment technology provides the maintenance of intelligent manufacturing equipment.\n\
    4.3.2. Vibration and Torque Sensors\nVibration sensors are used for monitoring\
    \ the acceleration machine vibration, indicat-\ning a potential machine issue.\
    \ Some sensors have modern fast Fourier transform signal\nprocessing to detect\
    \ failures in machine components. Vibration sensors are the core of\npreventive\
    \ maintenance and provide the condition of the device determination.\nBarbieri\
    \ et al. [99] proposed autonomous health management prognostics for smart\nmanufacturing\
    \ via on-board sensors. Kiangala and Wang [94] integrated a practical use of\n\
    intelligent sensors in a small bottling plant. Predictive maintenance is used\
    \ for detecting\nearly faults and failures in conveyor motors. Uhlmann et al.\
    \ [117] developed a smart sensor\nnetwork for condition monitoring in factories.\
    \ Collected data from MEMS sensors are\nprocessed in the cloud services and visualised\
    \ on the mobile platform.\nTorsion (torque, rotational) sensors convert a torque\
    \ reaction and rotary into electrical\nsignal. These sensors measure stationary\
    \ or dynamic variables, usually in motors, turbines,\nor generators. Kozlowski\
    \ et al. [110] used a torque sensor for designing a classiﬁer for\ncutting tool\
    \ condition assessment in RUL prediction. Kumar et al. [102] evaluated and\nestimated\
    \ RUL for particular failures in distinct health states and faults. Vlasov et\
    \ al. [119]\nused wireless vibration sensor networks that allow real-time analysis\
    \ of the state of the\nelectronic equipment (motor). The purpose of their approach\
    \ is to minimize the cost of\nmaintenance and develop a system of predictive maintenance\
    \ for optimisation predictive\nrepair. Zhang et al. [121] used vibration sensors\
    \ for accurate prediction of the remaining\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n24 of 40\n\
    useful life of the rotatory machines. Deep learning model combined a long short-term\n\
    memory neural network with an attention mechanism for maintenance in mechanical\n\
    manufacturing.\n4.3.3. Acoustical, Sound, and Ultrasonic Sensors\nAnother group\
    \ of sensors are sensors focused on sound detection, usually via mi-\ncrophone\
    \ devices. When a signal is detected by a sound sensor, the level of voltage is\n\
    translated to the appropriate sound level. Kaptan [126] describes the location\
    \ of city buses\nusing sound sensors and an accelerometer instead of the standard\
    \ global positioning system\n(GPS) location. In such a scenario, the accelerometers\
    \ detect the movement of the vehicle\nand the microphone sensing distinguishes\
    \ the sound level inside and outside the vehicle.\nCompared to GPS location, energy\
    \ savings of up to 46% occur. Another possible usage of\nacoustic sensors is described\
    \ by Ryu [127] in the ﬁeld of material detection. Using machine\nlearning techniques,\
    \ sound sensors are able to estimate relevant information such as the\ncharacter\
    \ of an object and its location. Ultrasonic sensors are non-contact devices using\n\
    the ﬂight of the sound wave greater than that of the human audible range. Similarly,\
    \ as\nwith sonar, the measurement is based on the Doppler Shift principle. Yan\
    \ et al. [120] con-\nducted fusion data mining to predict the remaining life of\
    \ a key component of machining\nequipment by multisource sensors (acoustical,\
    \ vibration, optical, or power).\n4.3.4. Pressure, Force, Touch, and Tension Sensors\n\
    Pressure sensors identify the pressure deviations in the measurement objects or\
    \ envi-\nronment. The change detection is usually based on barometric, piezoelectric,\
    \ capacitive,\noptical, or resonant sensing principles. Examples of these types\
    \ of sensors are Bourdon\ntubes, diaphragms, pressure gauge, or manometers. Tension\
    \ sensors help with the defor-\nmation and movement of the belt automated material\
    \ handling system monitoring for\nintelligent condition-based maintenance [104].\n\
    Force sensors monitor tensile compressive force signal and translate it into an\
    \ output\nelectric signal. Their application includes lead cells, strain gauges,\
    \ or sensing resistors.\nVery popular are piezoelectric and magnetostrictive technologies.\
    \ Another way of sensing\nis based on induction, pneumatic, and hydraulic forces.\n\
    4.3.5. Optical, Light, and Machine Vision Sensors\nAnother type of sensors are\
    \ sensors with a machine vision function. Machine vision\ntechnology has grown\
    \ signiﬁcantly in recent years and is becoming part of autonomous\nvehicles, intelligent\
    \ systems, and robotics. Optical sensor input into the systems makes\nthese systems\
    \ intelligent. Visual data are captured in the form of a series of images and\n\
    after the digitisation process are processed using a machine learning algorithm\
    \ [128,129].\nIn the ﬁeld of material wear detection, three-dimensional (3D) sensors\
    \ are also used, which\nrepresent new technical means for obtaining information.\
    \ Three-dimensional data provides\nmore information and at the same time, reduces\
    \ the deviation of the measured data [130].\nA large group of sensors consists\
    \ of chemical character sensors. Advances in chemical,\nsensing, and wireless\
    \ technologies have accelerated the development of wireless chemical\nsensors.\
    \ These devices allow the collection and distribution of biochemical information.\n\
    The use of these types of sensors can be found in the areas of environmental or\
    \ health\nmonitoring [131,132].\nTarashioon et al. [115] described the design\
    \ of solid-state lighting products based\non the reliability system diagnostics\
    \ (self-maintenance). The light sensor design using\nlight-emitting diode technology\
    \ is used to monitor system ambient light.\n4.3.6. Temperature Sensors\nTemperature\
    \ sensors usually detect changes in machine condition or critical state\nin the\
    \ factory (especially in hazardous environments.). The sensors obtain temperature\n\
    information directly (resistive temperature detectors, thermistors, and thermocouples)\
    \ or\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n25 of 40\nindirectly (infrared sensors). Some of\
    \ these sensors have a temperature display. Infrared\n(IR) sensors work on the\
    \ basis of the optical principle using light. We distinguish reﬂective\nand transmissive\
    \ IR sensors. Reﬂective IR sensors’ transmitter and detector are positioned\n\
    adjacent to each other facing the object. Transmissive sensors use LED and photo\
    \ diodes to\ndetect the object passing between them.\nAnother group of sensors\
    \ consists of probes measuring temperature and humidity.\nAdvances in biomaterials\
    \ offer opportunities to design electronics with unique mechanical\nstability\
    \ capabilities, i.e., sensors whose material composition offers the possibility\
    \ of\napplication in medical implants and disposable wearable devices. Suitable\
    \ applications\ncan be found in the accurate scanning of biological tissues, internal\
    \ organs, but also in the\ntextile and food industry [133].\nBekar et al. [108]\
    \ analysed the real-world industrial data to implement the PdM\nstrategy for the\
    \ manufacturing enterprise. They evaluated the quality of the process,\nvibration\
    \ and temperature data by understanding outliers, and developed maintenance\n\
    solutions. Sadiki et al. [105] show the advantages of condition-based maintenance\
    \ for real-\ntime intelligent monitoring for the industrial machine. Tmote sky\
    \ sensors network and Z1\nmote operate through the edge router and enhance the\
    \ maintenance simulation’s purpose.\nVillalobos et al. [118] introduced a ﬂexible\
    \ forecaster analyser system for anticipation of\nalarms’ activation based on\
    \ the temperature sensor data. The deep learning techniques\nbased on the short-term\
    \ memory recurrent neural network contribute to the predictive\nmaintenance approach.\n\
    4.3.7. Liquid, Flow, Gas, and Chemical Sensors\nFlow sensors enable the possibility\
    \ to analyse the cooling water and lubrication ﬂow\nrate. These sensors use magnetic,\
    \ ultrasonic, or thermal detectors to monitor the current\nintensity in the pipeline.\
    \ Chien and Chen [109] used mass ﬂow controllers for monitoring\nmode and position\
    \ of silane reactant ﬂow. Their research is related to a data-driven\nframework\
    \ for monitoring equipment’s health condition (RUL).\nOil particle sensors enable\
    \ the possibility of monitoring contamination levels in lu-\nbrication systems\
    \ (for example, gear boxes). These sensors target to change the level of\npollution\
    \ based on the presence of the number of substances processed. They analysed the\n\
    light intensity via a laser beam and photo detector.\nHumidity (moisture) sensors\
    \ focused diagnostics on water content in oils to prevent\ncorrosion of machines.\
    \ These sensors are usually installed in a lubrication or hydraulic tank.\nHumidity\
    \ sensors play an essential role in the selected automated manufacturing processes.\n\
    To achieve the desired atmosphere, it is necessary to detect, monitor, and regulate\
    \ humidity\nin conditions of low and high temperatures. The use of sensors for\
    \ moisture detection can\nbe found, for example, in monitoring systems and networks,\
    \ as a monitoring device in\nagriculture, and as a tool for determining soil moisture\
    \ during irrigation. Furthermore,\nalso in the ﬁeld of corrosion diagnostics in\
    \ the areas of infrastructure and construction.\nThe key element in this type\
    \ of sensor is the materials used and the associated availability\nof suitable\
    \ production technologies [134].\n4.3.8. Electronic, Current, Energy, and Magnetic\
    \ Sensors\nEnergy and current measurement sensors ensure the density of electrical\
    \ cable isola-\ntion. Their purpose is to measure the current draw of machines.\
    \ These sensors have been\nused in many industrial areas but have had shortcomings\
    \ regarding demands in the areas\nof miniaturisation, energy consumption, and\
    \ insufﬁcient stability. At present, optical ﬁbres\nand magnetic ﬂuids are widely\
    \ used, due to their versatility of application [135]. In the case\nof electronic\
    \ sensors, these can be, for example, gas sensors that are capable of performing\n\
    sensitive analysis in real time, thanks to their ﬂexibility and the possibility\
    \ of integration\nwith intelligent electronics and mechanical resistance in relation\
    \ to energy consumption,\nand respectively, the performance of electronic components.\
    \ However, balancing these\nvariables offers applications not only in the above\
    \ areas, but also in aviation, aerospace,\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n26 of 40\n\
    and nuclear industry [136] display devices, and there is considerable potential\
    \ in the area\nof environmental monitoring [137]. Zhang et al. [122] described\
    \ a data-driven smart pro-\nduction line with installed energy consumption sensors\
    \ for forecast and fault diagnosis of\nmaintenance.\n4.3.9. Virtual Sensors\n\
    Virtual sensors are advanced applications in the software layer of the machine\
    \ that\nenhance the knowledge of the devices. These state-of-the-art sensors obtained\
    \ data not\nonly from physical machines (for example robots), but also the knowledge\
    \ bases [138].\nAl-Jlibawi et al. [107] call them adaptive soft sensors due to\
    \ their low cost, parallel work,\nrobust characteristics, easy implementation,\
    \ and real-time estimation features. They used\nPLC and SCADA for collecting data\
    \ in the reﬁnery via a distribution control system.\n4.3.10. Nuclear, Chemical,\
    \ Microparticles, and Nanoparticles Sensors\nThe last category consists of sensors\
    \ that are based on modern technologies using\nchemical processes. These are sensors\
    \ based on nanoparticles and microparticles, which\nenable monitoring directly\
    \ inside the monitored object. Lao et al. [111] present a robust\nmoving horizon\
    \ estimation of sensor maintenance based on the observation and monitoring\nof\
    \ chemical processes. Comparison of four simulations demonstrates the economic\
    \ perfor-\nmance advantages of sensor-predictive maintenance. Jia et al. [139]\
    \ described the design\nof the nanosensors for detection of antibiotics to prevent\
    \ the production of resistance to\nantibiotics. Nanomaterial chemistry is used\
    \ for developing current arsenic detection nanos-\ntructures [140]. The main advantages\
    \ of nanomaterials are the high ﬂexibility, sensitivity,\ncompatibility, and stretchability\
    \ of sensors in electronics devices [141].\n5. Discussion\nThe discussion is divided\
    \ into two parts. First, we discuss the sensor-based smart\nfactory to imagine\
    \ the factories of the future. Then, in the second part, we focus on insights\n\
    and future research issues related to intelligent sensors.\n5.1. Sensor-Based\
    \ Smart Factory Discussion\nThe essence of the use of intelligent sensors based\
    \ on IoT lies in smart factories,\nwhich have modern sensor technology, intelligent\
    \ analytical programs, and networking\ncomponents of production (machines, supplies,\
    \ components, ﬁnal products, equipment,\netc.). Smart factories are a new way\
    \ of organizing production. Their goal is to better serve\ncustomers through greater\
    \ production ﬂexibility and resource optimisation. The factories of\nthe future\
    \ combine the efﬁciency of mass production with custom production and optimize\n\
    the supply chain in real-time thanks to the Internet connection [142]. These factories\
    \ handle\nﬂuctuations in demand, which are fully automated and fault-durable.\
    \ The smart factory\nis connected to the Internet, however it has advanced security\
    \ against cyberattacks that\nwould jeopardize production.\nWe summarised the intelligent\
    \ sensor advantages in Figure 10 based on Reference [143].\nSensitivity is deﬁned\
    \ as the relation unit change between output and input. Smart sensors\nsuch as\
    \ IoT devices are wireless, using the internet and usually cloud. Intelligent\
    \ sensors\nhave low power consumption, automatic diagnostics, calibration, and\
    \ the ability to process\nand share data in real-time. Robust means good durable\
    \ material, solid welds, seals, pot-\nting, chemical compatibility, secured wires,\
    \ and other situational protection. Automatic\ndiagnostics are related to the\
    \ possibility for making decisions or proceeding action-based\nactions for control.\
    \ Some authors emphasise low cost as a feature for smart sensors, but we\nthink\
    \ that it depends on user experience and sensor value added.\nSensors 2021, 21,\

    In smart factories, thanks to intelligent sensors, each product actively participates\
    \ in\nthe production process. The components to be processed contain digital information\
    \ on\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n28 of 40\nhow to process them. They, therefore,\
    \ communicate directly with robots and production\nmachines. With the help of\
    \ a chip with radio frequency identiﬁcation or other sensor\ntechnology, it can\
    \ control its production ﬂow. A smart product has access to knowledge\nrelated\
    \ to its structure, composition, or purpose [149]. On the other hand, thanks to\
    \ this\nconnection, the customer uses the user interface and intervenes in production\
    \ in real-time.\nThe sensors allow the customer to obtain information for creating\
    \ the product speciﬁcation,\nand its adjustment according to needs and requirements\
    \ [150]. Autonomous vehicles\npowered by electricity are also connected to the\
    \ system, ensuring the transport of stock and\nﬁnal products around the factory.\
    \ Vehicle control is provided by a sophisticated system of\nsensors. Parts, materials,\
    \ and components needed for production are transported to the\nfactory when they\
    \ are really needed for production (Just-in-Time system). Sensors and\npossibly\
    \ drones constantly check stock in a smart factory [151].\nWe performed profound\
    \ words’ analysis of full-text papers to ﬁnd phrases containing\nthe terms “smart”\
    \ or “intelligent”. Figure 11 shows that the obtained keywords form vari-\nous\
    \ clusters and subclusters related to the predictive maintenance process. We identiﬁed\n\
    four main components of the Smart and Intelligent Predictive Maintenance (SIPM)\
    \ system\nfor smart factories based on cluster analysis. These are the production\
    \ system, the moni-\ntoring system, the factory planning system, and the maintenance\
    \ system. The production\nsystem of SIPM is based on energy saving control, transportation,\
    \ and economics costs,\nwith use of controllers for predictive maintenance based\

    We discussed the results and interpreted them in the perspective of previous studies\n\
    and research. Predictive maintenances in Cavalieri-Salaﬁa’s model [153] includes\
    \ data\nacquisition from sensors, data manipulation (ﬁltering, transforming, removing\
    \ noise),\naggregation, prediction, decision-making, scheduling, and further monitoring\
    \ of status and\nconﬁguration. Similarly, it describes the process of data acquisition,\
    \ data processing, and\nmachine decision-making [154]. Possible application of\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) for pre-\nventive maintenance is discussed by Carlson\
    \ and Sakao [155]. Modern systems are based\non the Internet of Things that enable\
    \ real-time prediction and data sharing [96]. Uhlmann\net al. [117] described\
    \ the solution of sensor network enhanced by cloud. The edge technolo-\ngies [156]\
    \ allow integration between PLC and cloud for modern sensors. Miniaturisation\n\
    of current sensors and nanotechnology [157] provides higher ﬂexibility of maintenance\n\
    systems. Fernandes et al. [158] emphasise the role of data visualisation, data\
    \ mining, and\ndata storage. These models have a standard data ﬂow process which\
    \ is a part of the possible\nprediction preparation. It is necessary to set a\
    \ reliability model to analyse the dataset [159].\nRuhi and Karim [160] show that\
    \ a suitable statistical model can be applied to estimate the\noptimum maintenance\
    \ period at a minimum cost. Stodola and Stodola [161] pointed out\nthat a useful\
    \ model needs to consider human factors and related issues such as labour\nintensity,\
    \ administrative, and human errors.\n5.2. Discussion on Insights and Future Research\
    \ Issues\nWe discussed practical considerations and potential avenues for future\
    \ research.\nThe following directions have been identiﬁed for potential further\
    \ work.\n5.2.1. Wireless Network of Sensors\nOne of the current trends is the\
    \ use of a wireless network of sensors (WSN), which\naccording to Vlasov et al.\
    \ [119] consists of intelligent sensors for sensing physical parame-\nters. The\
    \ individual sensors act as network elements (nodes) that can read, process, and\n\
    transmit wireless data in smart factories. They consist of processing, communication,\n\
    and the sensor unit. WSN is a network of Micro-Electro-Mechanical systems (MEMS)\
    \ of\nsensor devices [162]. MEMS offers a high potential for condition monitoring\
    \ applications.\nThese sensors are, in comparison to industrial sensors, cost-effective,\
    \ wireless, and highly\nintegrable and conﬁgurable [117]. Part of these networks\
    \ could be process controllers (ac-\ntuators) that communicate data and operate\
    \ some units [163]. The cyber-physical systems\nintegrate these sensors and actuator\
    \ networks into a coherent form. Vlasov et al. [119] show\nthat the use of wireless\
    \ communication channels in the monitoring system is driven by the\nsensor network\
    \ in the shortest possible time. Uhlmann et al. [117] pointed out their main\n\
    advantage—low cost. Sadiki et al. [105] recommend to check the viability of these\
    \ network\napplications before their implementation in factories to save operation\
    \ costs and improve\nreal-time monitoring performance. Main advantages of industrial\
    \ WSN, summarising\nKumar et al. [163], are: minimal cost and compactness, interoperability,\
    \ resistance to noise\n(and co-existence), self-organizing, robustness (fault-tolerance),\
    \ link-reliability, energy con-\nsumption, low-delay, service differentiation\
    \ and quality, scalability, predictable behaviour,\nmultiple sources, data aggregation,\
    \ and speciﬁc protocols. However, the limitations of\nwireless sensors are the\
    \ spatial arrangement in the environment, deployment time, mainte-\nnance cost\
    \ of communication channels [119], scalability, and lack of protocols. Flammini\n\
    et al. [164] emphasised that fault assumption and transmission errors are more\
    \ frequent\nin wired communication than on wired links. Thus, data quality (in\
    \ terms of validity,\nintegrity, accuracy, and reliability) is an important factor\
    \ of wired networks connected to\nthe internet [165].\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n\
    30 of 40\n5.2.2. Dominance of Vibration and Temperature Sensors for Maintenance\n\
    The analysis of the types of sensors used for predictive maintenance in Section\
    \ 4.3 showed\nthat vibration and temperature sensors are most often used. According\
    \ to Uhlmann [117],\nthe number of powerful MEMS sensors such as vibration and\
    \ temperature sensors has in-\ncreased. Vibration can identify problems before\
    \ other symptoms, such as temperature, sound,\npower consumption, and contaminated\
    \ lubricants. When the first signs of a malfunction\nappear, there is usually\
    \ only a few months left until a complete machine downtime. Vibration\nmonitoring\
    \ enables to determine which phase of the fault curve the machine is currently\
    \ in.\nExcessive vibration is usually the first symptom of internal problems,\
    \ such as defective bear-\nings, imbalances, misalignments, and loose components,\
    \ that shorten the life of the equipment.\nOnly after detectable changes in vibration\
    \ is it possible to detect possible errors using power,\nparticle, or infrared\
    \ sensors. Finally, errors also appear on the temperature sensors. According\n\
    to Barbieri et al. [99], vibrational signals are a starting point of the component\
    \ degradation\nmodel. Crucial decision lies in the selection of adequate signals\
    \ for failure estimation and main-\ntenance prediction. The further research challenge\
    \ in infrared thermography is the signal and\nimage processing to enhance the\
    \ detection and simplify the interpretation of the results [166].\nAkerberg et\
    \ al. [167] pointed out that the requirements for vibration sensors, battery lifetime,\n\
    update frequency, and security are lower than for flow, torque, or proximity sensors.\
    \ The\nmain benefits of vibration sensors are predictability of impending failures,\
    \ machine safety, cost,\nextended maintenance intervals, machine reliability,\
    \ and confidence in scheduled maintenance.\nIn the future, these advantages resulting\
    \ from the use of vibration sensors can be obtained by\nusing new types of sensors,\
    \ for example, virtual sensors or nanosensors, etc. For this reason,\ncurrent\
    \ research is focused on minimizing the costs and flexibility of vibration and\
    \ temperature\nsensor solutions.\n5.2.3. Challenges of the Deep Learning and Big\
    \ Data Analytics\nComponents connected to the network generate a large amount\
    \ of heterogeneous\ndata that smart industry systems must process. Large industrial\
    \ data is collected from\nmultiple sources, such as devices, products, and customers,\
    \ in heterogeneous forms [108].\nTheir analysis is crucial for companies in almost\
    \ all market sectors. Advanced analysis of\nbig data is a way to get to know customers\
    \ and devices (machine state) in detail. Companies\nthat use it will be able to\
    \ provide customers with literally “tailor-made” services, lower\nmoods, and increase\
    \ efﬁciency in production, including maintenance. Thanks to the current\ncapacity\
    \ of computer technology, even large volumes of data can be processed faster,\
    \ which\nallows smart industry systems to move information in real-time. Farooq\
    \ et al. [38] consider\nindustrial prognosis and applying predictive analytics\
    \ using machine learning techniques\nas new challenges to identify failure modes\
    \ and reduce downtime. The application of the\nsimulation enhances more possibilities\
    \ for after-market services, such as maintenance [92].\nLearning and intelligent\
    \ techniques such as deep learning to analyse industrial big data\nare proposed\
    \ as future directions in maintenance [103,120]. We consider the main problem\n\
    in the ﬁeld of data analysis to be the inability to translate and create a business\
    \ case for\nanalysts with a comprehensive view. This means that there is no concept\
    \ of how to evaluate\nthe analytical results and translate them into actions (for\
    \ example, maintenance schedules).\nCompanies often make the mistake of supplementing\
    \ random ﬁndings instead of a selective\nand targeted approach such as predictive\
    \ maintenance. Results of the analysis must lead to\nconclusions, which requires\
    \ a properly chosen tool for data visualisation. Other possible\nresearch directions\
    \ are related to virtual metrology [109].\n5.2.4. Challenge of Interoperability\n\
    Interconnectivity is a prerequisite for the existence of a smart industry. It\
    \ is not just\na peripheral connection of one device to another or a centralised\
    \ connection of the ma-\nchine to the control system, but a complex network. In\
    \ a corporate environment, this\nmeans connecting machines, people, materials,\
    \ products, information and communica-\ntion technologies and systems, and, ﬁnally,\
    \ data in the form of documents. Scalability\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n31 of 40\n\
    enables possible network size enhancing or reduction based on the industrial require-\n\
    ments. This needs appropriate protocols, standards, and robust integration of\
    \ hundreds\nof network nodes. Interoperability is linked to their compatibility,\
    \ i.e., all elements of the\nindustrial Internet of Things should be able to communicate\
    \ with each other (exchange\ndata) and interact. Through standardisation, disparate\
    \ systems that work together can be\nsoldered into a single process. Today’s factories\
    \ already use sensor systems for various\nmeasurements and operations. The use\
    \ of new solutions must work with these old systems.\nThis problem is caused by\
    \ a lack of robustness, time constraints, and service-differentiated\nprotocols.\
    \ One of the future solutions is, for example, the oneM2M [168] or OPC Uniﬁed\n\
    Architecture [169] industry communication standards, which are platform-independent\n\
    and support semantic interoperability [170]. On these platforms, data objects\
    \ and each\ndevice have well-deﬁned behaviour on the network, and the capability\
    \ of horizontal com-\nmunication between individual devices processing in real-time.\
    \ There is a possibility to\nconnect other components (such as plug and produce),\
    \ which then have their image in the\ncloud.\n5.2.5. Challenges of Control and\
    \ Maintenance Systems Decentralisation\nMany of the wireless sensor networks still\
    \ have centralised control (so-called “network\nmanager”). Centralised server-client\
    \ systems had one central database, which leads to data\nconsistency, easy administration,\
    \ and a high level of security. However, centralisation can\nresult in the failure\
    \ of a single point. High trafﬁc can overload the bottleneck. A centralised\n\
    “network management” system can be slow and take a vest to lose data packets.\
    \ It is\nessential to use decentralised solutions within complex digital ecosystems,\
    \ such as pro-\nduction factories. The responsibility and need to make operational\
    \ decisions is performed\nat lower levels. A distributed architecture based on\
    \ decentralisation is suitable for their\ncoordination and management [171]. Coordination\
    \ between the individual nodes involved\nin cyber-physical systems requires communication\
    \ between the elements. The beneﬁt of the\ndistributed architecture of components\
    \ connected to the network and decentralised smart\nindustry systems is the expandability\
    \ (scalability) of the network, as well as the increased\nresistance to failures\
    \ of the network itself, individual connected systems, as well as their\ncomponents.\
    \ For example, Kiangala and Wang [94] proposed a decentralised monitoring\nsystem\
    \ with a cloud-based dashboard displaying real-time reports for every maintenance\n\
    schedule generated. Zhang et al. [122] consider as a future trend services in\
    \ cyberspace\nthat control, plan, and schedule production line items in a timely\
    \ way. Smart Industry\nsystems already use intelligent algorithms to monitor,\
    \ control, manage, and plan complex\nprocesses and operations throughout the production\
    \ process and supply chain. Advanced\ncognitive technologies will be gradually\
    \ implemented in production systems to increase\nthe autonomy of individual components\
    \ of the network. These systems use the principles\nof collective intelligence\
    \ in industrial processes, especially solutions based on multiagent\nsystems.\
    \ The future of these systems lies in achieving a high level of artiﬁcial intelligence\n\
    that will use the collective knowledge of all parts of the network.\n5.2.6. High\
    \ Potential of Virtual- and Nano-Sensors\nSensor technology, the elements informing\
    \ about the state and activity of the object, is\ncurrently unprecedented and\
    \ developed in various industries due to its reliability. Sensors\nas sources\
    \ of primary information about the real environment are the input element of\n\
    practically all control, measuring, and automation systems today, and together\
    \ with mi-\ncrosystems, they accompany human activity (via biometric sensors)\
    \ at almost every step.\nAn interesting trend can be traced in the development\
    \ of electronics and microelectronics\nin sensor systems, which include circuits\
    \ for signal processing, analysis, and uniﬁcation\nin a single compact design\
    \ with a sensor element. In optimizing this process, a tighter\nsystem connection\
    \ of electronics and microelectronics with related elements of optics or\nﬁne\
    \ mechanics within mechatronics is increasingly being applied. The intention of\
    \ such an\ninterconnection is to achieve the development and production integration\
    \ of entire systems\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n32 of 40\non a single chip, from\
    \ input sensors to various types of actuators. From another point of\nview, it\
    \ is possible to see the inﬂuence of miniaturisation and new sensor types such\
    \ as\nnanosensors. The higher resistance of the sensors to mechanical inﬂuences,\
    \ acceleration,\nand vibrations also leads to their placement directly in the\
    \ parts of the system, which in\nmany cases gives the function of the sensor a\
    \ wider range. Nanosensors have, due to\nminiaturisation, good preconditions for\
    \ massive use in smart factories. These trends are\ncurrently aided by the search\
    \ for ways to create wireless sensor networks with remote\ndata transmission.\
    \ Al-Jlibawi et al. [107] described the properties of soft (virtual) sen-\nsors\
    \ and their function in parallel work with physical sensors and industrial processes.\n\
    Virtual sensors are used for damage detection [172], industrial robot interaction\
    \ [173],\nidentiﬁcation, and approximation tasks, or for digital twin applications.\
    \ On-line evaluation\nof input effects directly in the actuator can then lead\
    \ to a “sensor-less” system, whose other\nadvantage, in addition to lower one-time\
    \ investment costs, should be the greater reliability\nof the system with protection\
    \ against possible outages. Li et al. [165] described automatic\ncontrol systems\
    \ without sensors based on wireless nodes, RIFID, and programmable logic\ncontroller\
    \ (PLC). Automated devices perform their tasks based on industrial wireless nodes\n\
    fully responsible for communication. Controllers have the automation control function\n\
    based on the received commands from other devices in the network.\n5.2.7. Challenges\
    \ of Availability and Reconﬁgurability of Sensors\nThe development of industry\
    \ systems is progressing towards their maximum modular-\nity and capability of\
    \ autonomous reconﬁguration based on automatic situation recognition.\nThe self-organisation\
    \ of production processes therefore also includes reconﬁgurability, char-\nacterised\
    \ as independent adaptability to internal and external conditions. Condition-based\n\
    systems are being developed in the ﬁeld of maintenance. The main problem in the\
    \ future\nmay be the use of old sensors (installed on older devices in production),\
    \ which will lead\nto unacceptably high manufacturing and maintenance costs in\
    \ the long term. Kozlowski\net al. [110] mentioned the unavailability of devices\
    \ (CNC machines) on the market to struc-\nturally optimally distributed sensors\
    \ on machine parts. Related to this issue is the problem\nof today’s industrial\
    \ practice—the lack of appropriate measurement signals. The result is\nthe need\
    \ for additional installation of sensors on the device. A problem with the weak\
    \ sig-\nnal from the sensors can lead to injury, product losses, and production\
    \ outages. Even small\nand temporary communication errors can cause signiﬁcant\
    \ production interruptions [167].\nThis production issue can be caused by signal\
    \ inference from devices that operate on the\nsame frequency. It means that at\
    \ the same time, waves and signals coexist in a given\nenvironment, which disrupt\
    \ the function of the sensors. This problem can be described as\na real-time availability\
    \ issue. Lao et al. [111] show that preventive maintenance of sensors\nand actuators\
    \ in real-time can signiﬁcantly mitigate the damage from production losses,\n\
    process upsets, and downtime based on speciﬁc routine regulations.\n5.2.8. Security\
    \ and Safety Challenge\nThe severity of cyber security issues is growing, along\
    \ with our growing dependence\non technology, both personally and socially. In\
    \ production, important data is collected by\nincreasingly connecting production\
    \ systems or even the robots themselves to computer\nnetworks, sometimes with\
    \ communication to the cloud, and new security risks arise. Ba-\nsic cyber security\
    \ principles can signiﬁcantly improve the security of connected devices.\nThe\
    \ contemporary challenge of safety is the security of the stored data from sensors.\
    \ In ad-\ndition to the sensors that collect data, which is a physical prerequisite\
    \ for the Industry 4.0\nconcept, the sovereignty of the data is important [174],\
    \ especially from a psychological\npoint of view. Only enterprises that trust\
    \ the security of their networks are also willing\nto store and share their data.\
    \ Sensor security does not require high demands on battery\ncapacity. However,\
    \ security is considered too complicated, especially for IoT, due to the\nuse\
    \ of various techniques such as keying to protect authentication, cryptographic\
    \ code\nveriﬁcation, security gateways [175], safety protocols, remote wireless\
    \ security manage-\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n33 of 40\nment [176], or security\
    \ analysis to detect attacks. Almost all interconnected systems have\ntheir weaknesses\
    \ that their creators are unaware of. For this reason, prevention is particu-\n\
    larly important [167]. An important factor due to the number of interconnected\
    \ devices is\nthe cost of security. Gungor and Hancke [177] point out that security\
    \ is a crucial feature in\ndesigning wireless sensor networks. Safe communication\
    \ protects against external attacks\nand intrusion.\n6. Conclusions\nThe fourth\
    \ industrial revolution is permeating the industry, enabling an increasing\nnumber\
    \ of enterprises to have an incomparably greater overview of their production\n\
    and maintenance activities than ever before. The deployment of highly reliable\
    \ and\nlow-maintenance devices contributes to the precise planning of production\
    \ capacity and\nequipment’s associated maintenance.\nThe ﬁrst research question\
    \ relates to the contemporary trends in the maintenance\nprocesses of smart factories.\
    \ The number of papers discussing the key terms sensors,\nsmart factories, and\
    \ preventive maintenance increased over time, mostly in the last years.\nWe found\
    \ that the contemporary burst trend is related to Industry 4.0 technology. Predic-\n\
    tive maintenance, smart factories, and intelligent sensors publications, together\
    \ concerned\ntopics mainly related to deep machine learning, Internet of Things,\
    \ and big data analytics.\nThe maintenance process in smart factories is based\
    \ on digitisation, data-driven manufac-\nturing, agent-based systems, and digital\
    \ twins. Intelligent sensors in such factories use\nedge, fog, and deep learning\
    \ methods for control of manufacturing processes. In the future,\nInternet and\
    \ blockchain will be important for predictive maintenance.\nSmart and intelligent\
    \ predictive maintenance is characterised to answer a second\nresearch question.\
    \ Here, the results show four different types of maintenance used in smart\nfactories—Industry\
    \ 4.0 for predictive maintenance, smart manufacturing for condition-\nbased maintenance,\
    \ fault diagnosis for maintenance and prognostics, and remaining useful\nlife\
    \ analysis. The importance of predictive maintenance is also growing due to the\
    \ growing\nnumber of robots, digitisation, and artiﬁcial intelligence introduced\
    \ into production lines\nto automate routine activities.\nFollowing the third\
    \ question’s answer, we can state that the three types of sensors are\nmainly\
    \ used for predictive maintenance in smart factories. Firstly, intelligent sensors\
    \ which\nhave the potential to connect to higher-level systems. Furthermore, there\
    \ is a possibility to\nconnect these intelligent sensors to the internet—to build\
    \ up the IoT devices. Finally, we can\nuse the gathered data in cloud-related\
    \ technologies. The most prevalent methods used\nfor collecting and monitoring\
    \ machines and devices are vibration analysis [120], SCADA\nsystems, CNC machine\
    \ sensors, and PLCs. Based on the deep analysis, we conclude that\nthe current\
    \ trend, insights, and future research issues are characterised by:\n•\nUsage\
    \ of multisource wireless networks of sensors in predictive maintenance.\n•\n\
    Dominance of vibration and temperature sensors for predictive maintenance.\n•\n\
    Challenges of the big data analytics and deep learning techniques.\n•\nChallenges\
    \ of interoperability of multiple sensors and maintenance systems.\n•\nDecentralisation\
    \ of maintenance control systems.\n•\nHigh potential of virtual sensors and nanosensors\
    \ for the future.\n•\nChallenge of availability and reconﬁgurability of sensors.\n\
    •\nSecurity and safety of sensor data.\nBased on the results synthesis, we proposed\
    \ the Smart and Intelligent Predictive Main-\ntenance (SIPM) system for smart\
    \ factory concerning four major subsystems: production,\nmonitoring, planning,\
    \ and maintenance. These subsystems communicate and collaborate\nthrough modern\
    \ IoT and cloud-based technologies. Their main advantage is real-time\nmanagement\
    \ and planning to reduce the economic costs caused by production downtime.\nFrom\
    \ a managerial point of view, the predictive maintenance system in smart factories\n\
    is an early warning, especially in high-risk industries. The ability to detect\
    \ weak signals\nof potentially signiﬁcant strategic impact is a welcome positive\
    \ in a turbulent business\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n34 of 40\nenvironment. The\
    \ system of predictive maintenance does not reduce the responsibility\nor the\
    \ possibility of personal development of employees, but it must be stimulated\
    \ by\nresponsible managers. It offers the possibility to reduce the number of\
    \ hierarchical levels\nbetween managers and ordinary employees, so that you can\
    \ bring about higher employee\nautonomy and help other innovation processes to\
    \ be implemented effectively. The challenge\nfor managers today is to select criteria\
    \ based on which they will be able to select intelligent\nsensors for smart factories.\
    \ There is a wide range of sensors on the market and the\nauthors most often state\
    \ the criteria of sensor sensitivity, sensor cost, ﬂexibility, and size\n(miniaturity).\n\
    Further research may comprise the advanced machine learning methods as deep\n\
    learning, data-driven algorithms. The new concept called “Machine as a Service”\
    \ (MaaS)\ntakes over the software as a service (SaaS) model and is another trend\
    \ suitable for future\nresearch. An interesting direction of future research concerns\
    \ building performance model\nevaluation related to the reasonable cost. The cost/beneﬁt\
    \ analysis of using preventive\ntools in contrast to sustainability requirements\
    \ is challenging for research.\nThis work suffers from several limitations, notably\
    \ related to publication collections,\nﬁltering, and analysis. The search strategy\
    \ is biased by the problematic synonym of the\nterm “factory”. Primarily, the\
    \ term “plant” is not interchangeable in the same meaning.\nThe study is limited\
    \ because we omitted highly cited publications related to medicine in\nburst analysis.\
    \ Our goal was to bring the reader closer manufacturing- and production-\nrelated\
    \ publications. Investigated trends in burst detection analysis have weights based\
    \ on\noccurrence in publication titles. Results do not show the quality of publication\
    \ based on\nthe times cited. Thus, we instead present examples of highly cited\
    \ publications of most\nimportant burst terms. The lack of a comprehensive review\
    \ due to a steadily increasing\nnumber of related works is another notable limitation\
    \ of this study.\nSupplementary Materials: The PRISMA Checklist (Table S1) and\

    Get rights and content Highlights • First literature review paper of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. • Four applications of blockchain
    technology are identified. • Six challenges for applying blockchain technology
    are identified. • Research gaps and future research directions are proposed. Abstract
    Agri-food value chain is an area of significant importance because of providing
    sustainable, affordable, safety and sufficient food, feed, fibre and fuel to consumers,
    it is critical to ensure these value chains running smoothly and successfully
    by applying advanced internet technologies. Blockchain technology is a new digital
    technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0 to ensuring data integrity
    and preventing tampering and single point failure through offering fault-tolerance,
    immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction
    records to all agri-food value chain partners. This paper used systematic literature
    network analysis to review the state-of-the-art blockchain technology including
    its recent advances, main applications in agri-food value chain and challenges
    from a holistic perspective. The findings suggest that blockchain technology together
    with advanced information and communication technology and internet of things
    have been adopted for the improvement of agri-food value chain management in four
    main aspects: traceability, information security, manufacturing and sustainable
    water management. Six challenges have been identified including storage capacity
    and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost and regulation problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. Based on the critical analysis of literature,
    research gaps and future research directions are proposed in this paper regarding
    the applications and challenges of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management. This study makes contributions to the extant literature in the field
    of agri-food value chain management by discovering the potential of blockchain
    technology and its implications for agri-food value chain performance improvements
    such as food safety, food quality and food traceability. Previous article in issue

    1. Introduction The agri-food value chain is a complex system responsible for
    the circulation of agri-food products from the initial stage of production to
    the final stage of consumption. In the circulation process, value chain members
    play a critical role in meeting the consumers’ demand for agri-food products and
    maintaining the quality and safety of products [1]. Simultaneously, with the rapid
    development of internet technologies in the value chain area, a large number of
    emerging technologies such as advanced information and communication technology
    (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been applied to the agri-food value
    chain [46]. However, almost all the systems applied to the agri-food value chain
    are centralised, monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque, and may result in serious
    trust problem. Therefore, consumers’ confidence towards food safety has been broken
    after a series of food safety risk incidents and scandals over the last decades
    [46], such as mad cow disease, horsemeat scandal [2], toxic milk powder, genetically
    modified food and trench oil [3]. Consequently, detailed information of agri-food
    products from farm to fork is increasingly requested by consumers. Furthermore,
    how to build fault-tolerance, immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability
    of agri-food value chain [4], regulations and customers’ expectations towards
    food quality and food safety [5], the complexity of agri-food value chain [6],
    and the current applications of technologies and their potential issues/pitfalls
    [7] have attracted increasing attention from academics and practitioners. A potential
    solution to alleviate the above issues and concerns is usage of blockchain technology,
    which is a new digital technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0
    to ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering and any single point failure.
    Four special elements - decentralised, immutable, consensus, and democratic that
    are unique to blockchain networks that make the technology more attractive in
    promoting trust and transparency in the agri-food value chain fraught with errors,
    duplication and redundancies [68]. Crosby et al. [8] underlines that blockchain
    is essentially a distributed database system that records transactional data or
    other digital events that have been executed and shared among value chain participants.
    It enables agri-food value chain participants to establish a decentralized consensus
    on the sequence of events and the current status of the transaction [9]. Blockchain
    technology uses a combination of different technologies that have been applied
    in computer science such as public/private key cryptography, cryptographic hash
    functions and database technologies [10], which provides an innovative solution
    to achieve food traceability, transparency, safety and security [11]. Two prominent
    benefits of blockchain technology are that it provides a permanent transaction
    records which are grouped into individual blocks and cannot be tampered with;
    and it can replace those traditional paper tracking systems and manual monitoring
    systems, so as to prevent the traditional way of the value chain from suffering
    the inaccurate impact [39]. The academic interest in investigating the application
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management has been progressively
    expanded, with a rapid increase in the contributions of academic experts covering
    this aspect [[11], [12], [13],38]. Moreover, blockchain technology used in the
    agri-food value chain seems to be a promising research stream for future research,
    especially in the era of Industry 4.0 [14,83]. However, only a limited number
    of studies analyse the current applications and future research directions of
    blockchain technology in different industries. We found three reviews concerned
    with the blockchain technology and its impact on the social and economy, drawn
    up, respectively, by Anascavage and Davis [15], who identified 16 areas that blockchain
    technology could be applied to, including food security; Tama et al. [16] acknowledge
    four areas that blockchain technology has been applied to and considers that blockchain
    technology plays an important role in guaranteeing the traceability of the agri-food
    value chain; and finally Yli-Huumo et al. [17] conducted a systematic literature
    review (SLR) on current research of blockchain technology including security,
    wasted resources, usability and privacy. These reviews are, however, relatively
    general, and given the current research and applications of blockchain technology,
    none of the reviews addresses the application of the blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management. Therefore, there is a lack of up-to-date
    reviews that offer a comprehensive overview of the main issues related to current
    applications, challenges and future research directions of the blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain management. Considering the above arguments, the
    main objective of this study is to fill this gap by offering a systematic literature
    network analysis (SLNA) of the recent contributions of blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management, highlighting the research that has been
    developed over time, and identifying the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    to the agri-food value chain management, and proposing the most promising research
    directions for the future. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.
    The methodology adopted in this paper is described in Section 2, while the application
    of the research methodology to the context under study is provided in Section
    3. Then, the current applications of blockchain technology in the agri-food value
    chain management are presented in Section 4 followed by the challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain that are presented in Section
    5. The research gaps and proposed future research directions are presented in
    Section 6. Finally, conclusions and research limitations are drawn in Section
    7. 2. Research methodology: systematic literature network analysis Systematic
    literature network analysis (SLNA) is constituted with two methods: systematic
    literature review (SLR) and citation network analysis (CNA). The purpose of integrating
    these two existing methodologies (SLR and CNA) is to maximize the advantages related
    to each of them: SLR provides a reproducible and rigorous method that is applied
    in this study to select the most relevant and high-quality studies from previous
    literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through
    synthesising of the literatures, the state-of-the-art of applications and the
    challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    will be revealed. Simultaneously, why blockchain technology matters in agri-food
    value chain management is also disclosed. CNA offers an evidence-based approach
    to identifying the most-cited studies from the selected databases, revealing the
    contributions on blockchain technology theory building in the agri-food value
    chain management as well as suggesting future research directions that can facilitate
    the application of the blockchain technology to the agri-food value chain management
    [18]. The process of SLNA from the combination of SLR and CNA is shown in Fig.
    A1. 3. Applying the SLNA to the area under study The process of how to apply SLNA
    to the area of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management is described
    in the following five sub-sections. 3.1. Formulating the research questions The
    first stage of conducting SLNA is to formulate research questions. It is important
    to have well-specified, informative and clearly formulated research questions
    to avoid bias, error and ambiguity [19]. Therefore, the research questions were
    formulated based on the following process: (1) Brainstorming all types of applications
    of blockchain technology that can be used in agri-food value chain management;
    (2) Consulting with three experts in academia and agri-food industry to evaluate
    whether it is possible to apply the blockchain technology in these areas; (3)
    Examining possible applications of blockchain technology that can be applied to
    the agri-food value chain management. Based on the above processes and principles,
    the following research questions were formulated: RQ1. What are the main applications
    of blockchain technology that have been developed in agri-food value chain management?
    RQ2. What are the key challenges for applying blockchain technology to agri-food
    value chain management? RQ3. What are the research gaps and future research directions
    for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain management? 3.2. Locating
    study Denyer and Tranfield [20] proposed that a comprehensive list of core contributions
    is necessary to answer the review questions by searching the most relevant and
    high-quality studies. Eight databases were selected for literature search, including
    ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, Taylor & Francis Online, Wiley Online Library,
    Emerald, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore. The rationale for selecting these databases
    is that they include the top science and technology journals, conference proceedings
    and business research journals. Consistent with other SLR papers in blockchain
    technology (e.g. [17,21,22]), the identified keywords were used as the search
    criteria in our review. Since the aim of this research is to identify the main
    issues relating to the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management, a combination of “blockchain” and “agri-food value chain management”,
    with all the related terms were used for searching the title, keywords and abstract
    in the selected electronic academic databases. These keywords were combined later
    through Boolean connectors to constitute different search strings to be applied
    in the databases. Furthermore, consultation with various practitioners and academics
    in the relevant field was conducted to confirm whether search strings were also
    necessary. Finally, a total of 45 search strings were identified by the authors
    to be included in the search process. A full list of search strings is shown in
    Table 1. Table 1. Search strings for databases search. Keywords “blockchain”,
    “information security”, “information transparency”, “agriculture”, “agricultural”,
    “agribusiness”, “agriculture safety”, “agriculture security”, “agriculture traceability”,

    “food value chain management”, “agriculture value chain management”, “agri-food
    value chain management”, “agricultural trade” Databases ScienceDirect, Web of

    value chain management” OR “agriculture trade”) 3.3. Study selection and evaluation
    As a very recent and new research area, as discussed earlier, the term of blockchain
    technology was first coined in 2008 [16]. In fact, the idea of blockchain technology
    was hardly discussed before 2008. Therefore, we use the year 2008 as the starting
    point to search relevant publications. Further, to find more relevant and important
    studies to be included in the analysis, various reference types such as journal
    papers, conference papers and book chapters were included in the systematic review.
    Simultaneously, the identification of key articles and book chapters that provide
    background information on blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    were found from different sources, including colleagues working in the same field.
    The initial search with the specified keywords and open access in the selected
    eight databases from 2008 to 2018 resulted in a preliminary sample of 632 contributions.
    Afterwards, each study was checked by three authors by carefully analysing the
    abstracts, introductions and conclusions to reduce any subjective bias and enhance
    validity. Moreover, relevant book chapters and other publications that were not
    covered by the databases were then identified through carefully searching the
    references used in the previous literature (e.g. [17,21,22]). The review of the
    work of influential authors in the field of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain management was also carried out by the same three authors. A series
    of inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to include/exclude papers (Table
    2), which were built through a brainstorming session among these three authors.
    Studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria or duplicates or non-relevant
    studies were eliminated. As a result, 62 studies were finally selected. Table
    2. Criteria for inclusion or exclusion studies. Inclusion criteria Rationale Articles
    were published in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings and book chapters
    in English Peer-reviewed journals, conference papers and book chapters are considered
    to have better quality than non-peer-reviewed articles Articles were published
    between 2008 and 2018 The year 2008 was selected as the starting point as the
    term blockchain was coined in 2008 [16] The selected articles contain at least
    one keyword in their title or abstract Abstract or title focusing on the applications
    of blockchain technology was selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining
    abstract, introduction and conclusion The remaining abstract, introduction and
    conclusion focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain were selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining articles
    Articles focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain were selected All selected 62 studies were read entirely by the three authors
    independently. By cross-referencing all the citations and references and talking
    with experts in the experts from academia and the agri-food industry, nine additional
    studies were identified and added, resulting in a total of 71 academic peer-reviewed
    journal papers, conference papers and book chapters to be included in the analysis.
    The search and selection process is presented in Fig. A2. 3.4. Citation network
    analysis (CNA) CNA is an effective and efficient way to reveal the articles that
    represent the basis of the field and to identify which articles were used by many
    other authors for the development of their contributions [18]. The citation data
    (author, title, year, cited reference, source, time cited etc.) were collected
    from the Web of Science Core collection. Then, the software Gephi was used to
    build a citation network among the selected studies. Gephi is the leading visualization
    and exploration software for all graphs and networks, which can be applied to
    six main areas such as exploratory data analysis, link analysis, social network
    analysis, biological network analysis, and poster creation [23]. The rationale
    for this choice is that Gephi can provide large information handling capacity,
    friendly graphical user interface and high-quality output formats [24]. As shown
    in Fig. 1, a network consisting of 71 nodes was constructed. It comprises 47 connected
    components and 24 isolated components. Download : Download high-res image (822KB)

    studies. Note: Node size depends on the quantity of connected components. From
    the Fig. 1, we can see that the connected components were divided into seven clusters
    according to their citation information. For example, the orange cluster summarized
    the opportunities that blockchain technology could be applied in agri-food value
    chain management such as blockchain combined with IoT to be used in agri-food
    value chain, as well as used in agri-food value chain traceability. It is important
    to note that most of the papers included in this cluster were literature review
    papers [17,25,26]. A detailed analysis of benefits, opportunities and challenges
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT were discussed in the cluster of
    black. There were four clusters (Light green, purple, red and blue) mainly discussed
    how to use blockchain technology to increase the agri-food value chain traceability
    and manufacturing conceptually and empirically. Simultaneously, different traceability
    models were proposed and tested. Finally, the green cluster represents how blockchain
    along with other technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
    Internet of Things served as an engine of the 4th industrial revolution, and how
    these technologies can revolutionize the current agri-food value chain management
    [27,28]. The detailed information of each cluster is shown in Table 3. Table 3.

    A review [45]; How blockchain technology along with other technologies such as

    has gained increasing attention from researchers and practitioners, in 2016 Yli-Huumo
    et al. [17] proposed an SLR on blockchain technology by highlighting current research
    topics, challenges and future research directions from a technological perspective.
    Their research results indicate four research gaps existing in the current study:
    (1) Lack of high-quality journal papers, most of the papers are published in conferences,
    symposiums and workshops; (2) The majority of current research is conducted in
    Bitcoin environment, rather than in other blockchain environments; (3) Lack of
    research on usability; (4) No research on the challenges for applying blockchain
    technology, such as latency, throughput and bandwidth. Following Yli-Huumo et
    al. [17], a series of research articles attempt to fill the research gaps. Tian
    [38] and Faye [39] have explored the field of blockchain technology in the context
    of the agri-food value chain from a traceability perspective. The issue addressed
    is how to embed blockchain technology in the current traceability system to increase
    the transparency and security of the agri-food value chain. With the evolution
    of research in the blockchain-based traceability system, some researchers tried
    to examine some generic models for facilitating the development of blockchain-based
    traceability system, such as the “TRADE” model proposed by Maouchi et al. [36].
    Concerns about integrating blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain
    need to be addressed from a single company perspective firstly, therefore, Hamida
    et al. [40] provided a detailed analysis on enterprise blockchains of its applications,
    challenges and opportunities. It is interesting to note that within these studies,
    the paper An agri-food supply chain traceability system for China based on RFID
    & blockchain technology proposed by Tian [38] is the most frequently cited paper,
    which has been cited 16 times by other authors among the selected papers (Table
    4). At the current stage of research in blockchain technology for traceability,
    most researchers (e.g. [[38], [39], [40]]) considered blockchain technology as
    a competitive advantage for agriculture value chain participants to gain trust
    from customers. Finally, most of these articles focus on addressing blockchain-based
    traceability system from the perspective of conceptual development. Table 4. Most

    of research examines how to combine blockchain technology with the IoT that can
    be applied in agri-food value chain management. Christidis and Devetsikiotis [41]
    noted that the combination of blockchain technology with IoT would allow agri-food
    value chain participants to get automated time-consuming workflows in a new and
    unique way, as well as to reduce significant costs in the process. Following Christidis
    and Devetsikiotis [41], many researchers have tried to contribute the theory-building
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT from different perspectives. Hammi
    et al. [49] explored how to improve trust relationship among agri-food value chain
    members by designing a blockchain-IoT application. Reyna et al. [50] investigated
    how blockchain technology could potentially improve the IoT. Finally, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed a blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT to
    enable grape value chain. The research trends on blockchain-based IoT has been
    from generally discussing the challenges and opportunities for combining blockchain
    technology with IoT to how to design a blockchain-based IoT system for solving
    the trust issues among agri-food value chain members, which facilitate to build
    a distributed peer-to-peer systems to interact with agri-food value chain participants
    in a trust and auditable manner. The trends towards stricter rules on food safety
    and food quality leads some researchers to explore potential applications of blockchain
    technology in other fields of agri-food value chain management, such as how to
    apply blockchain technology in food manufacturing [43] and how to use blockchain
    technology to increase the water sustainability [59]. Regarding the performance
    of applying blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain management, just
    a few papers measure the performance from the perspective of reducing tracking
    time to improve the traceability [4] and increasing the efficiency of the traceability
    in the agri-food value chain [13]. Simultaneously, several literature review papers
    investigated how blockchain technology has been applied in different industries
    such as agri-food industry, financial service and healthcare [8,16]. They provide
    insights on the development of blockchain technology in different industries and
    facilitate researchers to investigate how to transfer the knowledge from theory
    to practice. 3.5. Thematic analysis Braun and Clarke [51] stated that “thematic
    analysis is a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes)
    within data, which provides core skills that will be useful for conducting many
    other forms of qualitative analysis”. Holloway and Todres [52] underlined that
    thematic analysis can be seen as a foundational approach for qualitative analysis.
    In this paper, thematic analysis was used to allow blockchain themes being generated
    by six phases of analysis: reading the whole paper collected from SLR, generating
    initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes,
    and finally presenting the results. Following the process of thematic analysis,
    we divided the literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    based on the following themes: (1) current applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management; (2) the challenges for applying the blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. The detailed results from thematic
    analysis are presented in Section 4. Tama et al. [16] conducted a literature review
    on the blockchain technology and its current applications, where the majority
    of literature was concerned with the blockchain technology theory building and
    conceptual development. However, the findings in our study show that the trend
    has been gradually shifted from theory building trying to use blockchain technology
    in practice. Although the number of studies on how blockchain technology can be
    used in agri-food value chain management is increasing, there are a limited number
    of studies on how blockchain technology can be executed. 4. Current applications
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management The first application
    of the blockchain technology was Bitcoin – a peer-to-peer electronic cash system
    [53]. Then, blockchain technology evolved towards smart contracts with the ability
    to provide transparency and trust to the system [41]. A smart contract is a kind
    of computer program that stores on the blockchain and executes by all consensus
    nodes in the network. It can translate contractual clauses into code and store
    them into the storage file, and operate them automatically and independently in
    a prescribed manner based on the data that was included in the triggering transaction
    [54]. Through operating the smart contracts, the need for trusted intermediaries
    between partners can be minimized and the occurrence of malicious or accidental
    exceptions can be reduced. Thus, blockchain technology has been generalized and
    applied in different domains such as finance [55], smart city [56], healthcare
    [57] and agri-food value chain [43]. However, as reviewed by Yli-Huumo et al.
    [17], more than 80% of the academic papers on blockchain technology focused on
    the Bitcoin system, while less than 20% deal with other blockchain applications.
    Although it is a relatively new technology, blockchain is rapidly advancing and
    developing. Lucena et al. [58] stated that there was a huge opportunity for blockchain
    applications to global trade. Blockchain market is estimated to grow from 210.2
    million USD to 2312.5 million USD in the period from 2016 to 2021 based on the
    Global Opportunity Report [90]. Due to its potential increase in the global market,
    it is expected that blockchain technology will play a critical role in facilitating
    future industry development and revolution. However, Poberezhna [59] argued that
    the key challenge for blockchain was to be considered as a simply disruptive technology,
    rather than as an innovative integrative solution that could provide a value proposition
    across a number of business process. In the following four sub-sections, we analyse
    the literature of the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management by classifying them in four distinctive themes: traceability,
    information security, manufacturing and sustainable water management. 4.1. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability According to Murki
    [60], different value chains need to embed blockchain technology in the current
    traceability system to create more agile value chains and closer customer relationship.
    Tse et al. [11] hold a similar view that the application of blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain may have been the optimal choice to fulfil the requirements
    of supervision and adaption of the fast-growing food market. More specifically,
    Kumar and Mallick [61] construe that blockchain technology has wider applications
    in agri-food value chain such as food delivery and shipping data records, food
    online ordering and transaction data, and food quality assurance data. To integrate
    blockchain technology in the existing traceability system of agri-food value chain,
    many researchers have tried to explore the options from different perspectives.
    Tian [38] proposed an agri-food value chain traceability system based on RFID
    (Radio-Frequency IDentification) and blockchain technology for helping Chinese
    agri-food markets to enhance their food safety and food quality during the logistics
    process. In their proposed traceability system, RFID was used for acquiring and
    sharing data in the agri-food value chain, meanwhile, blockchain technology was
    used for guaranteeing the data shared and published in this traceability system
    is reliable and authentic. However, some researchers argue that RFID technology
    and blockchain based traceability system has some defects in solving the counterfeit
    issues. For example, RFID tags can be cloned which can cause counterfeit parts
    to be circulated in the agri-food value chain [62]. To overcome the drawbacks
    of RFID, Boehm et al. [37] proposed an updated traceability system using blockchain
    technology combined with Near Field Communication (NFC) and verified users. In
    their proposed traceability system, users must provide valid user credentials
    if they want to update a product’s history on the blockchain. Thus, various changes
    of an agri-food product can be reported, and the capabilities of other members
    can be restricted at the same time. Therefore, holistic tracking agri-food products
    with higher transparency and security can be achieved. Faye [39] underlined that
    the application of blockchain technology in agri-food industry would foster more
    transparency and thus customers’ confidence towards agri-food products would be
    re-established. Although blockchain technology has great potential for revolutionizing
    current agri-food value chain traceability systems, it still has some inherent
    defects such as scalability that needs to be tackled, especially when we face
    mass data in the real world. Recent innovations in blockchain, such as scaling
    would change this working manner that requires every computer in the blockchain
    to process every transaction [63]. Croman et al. [64] argued that a scaled blockchain
    could accelerate the transaction process, without sacrificing high security, by
    determining the optimal number of computers to validate each transaction and divide
    work efficiently. Therefore, Tian [46] investigated a value chain traceability
    system based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point), blockchain
    technology and IoT. In their proposed new decentralized traceability system, HACCP
    was used to prevent food risk occurrences, and IoT combined with blockchain technology
    was used to continuously deliver massive real-time food-related information to
    all value chain partners in an effective, safe and efficient manner. Then, a case
    testing experiment was used to check whether the system was feasible or not. The
    research results indicate that food safety, value chain efficiency and transparency
    have been effectively improved. Badzar [65] emphasizes that openness and unchangeable
    attributes of blockchain ensure high transparency, stability and reliability of
    agri-food value chain, as well as provide liquidity, more accurate record-keeping
    and high transparency of ownership [66]. To have deep understanding of knowledge
    on how blockchain technology can be used to enhance agri-food business, Rabah
    [28] conducted a review on the applications of big data and blockchain technology
    in the agri-food industry. Their research results reveal that blockchain technology
    played a critical role in creating secure and transparent ledger that was available
    to all the involved participants within the agri-food value chain including the
    producers, manufacturers, logistics service providers, wholesalers, retailers
    and regulators. They provide insights into the effects of blockchain technology
    on the current traceability system, and facilitate the development of blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain management. Finally, Biswas et al. [67]
    propose a blockchain based wine value chain traceability system where every transaction
    is recorded as a block in the chain and is visible to relevant value chain members
    such as the grape grower, wine producer, bulk distributor, transit cellar, filler/packer,
    finished goods distributor, wholesaler and retailer entity. One of the most important
    features of their proposed system is that anyone can trace the purchase history
    of the wine by inputting the product ID in the system. However, their work just
    examines an example, rather than a practical application of blockchain technology
    in the wine value chain. Maouchi et al. [36] argue that although various approaches
    have been proposed to create a decentralized traceability system for agri-food
    value chain, these works do not state the feasibility of their work and their
    application for the agri-food value chain. Due to the great potential benefits
    of applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain traceability system,
    several agricultural industry enterprises around the world have evaluated the
    effect of blockchain technology. For example, Walmart plans to invest $25 million
    over five years from 2017 to establish one food safety collaboration centre in
    Beijing to build a completely new food traceability system with blockchain technology.
    Their mango blockchain solution pilots reduced the time for tracking mango origins
    from seven days to 2.2 s, thus, more transparency and greater efficiency have
    been achieved in Walmart’s food value chain. Then, a pork value chain traceability
    system combined with barcode has been built based on the mango blockchain solutions
    [13]. Yiannas [68] states that the biggest advantage of this system is that it
    allows any trusted users to verify the traceability and authenticity of the product
    at any point of the pork value chain. Despite the increasing emphasis on applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability system, recent studies
    conducted by Kshetri [69] show that just a few researchers have begun to systematically
    assess the effects of blockchain technology on current agri-food value chain traceability
    system. Caro et al. [4] introduced an AgriBlockIoT traceability system for agri-food
    value chain management. It was constituted with three main components, a REST
    Application Interface with the responsibilities to integrate with the existing
    software system, a controller equipped with the abilities to query and convert
    the data records stored in the blockchain, and blockchain involved with smart
    contracts as a gateway to the blockchain itself. It is important to note that
    smart contracts can fire autonomously; hence creating records whenever anomalies
    are detected. Then, two different implementations, namely Ethereum and Hyperledger
    Sawtooth were used to do the performance analysis of traceability. Their research
    results indicate that Hyperledger Sawtooth has better performances than the Ethereum
    counterpart and may be more suitable for IoT devices, because Etherum is quite
    CPU-intensive. Based on the case study for grain quality assurance tracking, Lucena
    [58] finds out that quality measurement throughout the transportation for grains
    along the value chain is always accompanied with fraud, poor monitoring and delay
    to final destinations. Their findings indicate that using blockchain technology
    in the grain value chain traceability system is the best way at present to reduce
    disputes among business partners and information asymmetries. Finally, Kumar and
    Iyengar [70] demonstrated a blockchain based traceability framework for rice value
    chain management. In their proposed framework, blockchain was used to record all
    related issues happening within the rice value chain and monitor the security
    and quality of rice in the transportation process. It is important to note that
    all members in the rice value chain should register themselves and match their
    unique identities and digital profiles in the blockchain system. The research
    result indicates that the security of rice in the transportation process and the
    efficiency of the rice value chain have been greatly improved. 4.2. Applying blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain information security Under the background
    of Industry 4.0 and distributed computing, the characteristics of information
    system in agri-food industry have experienced substantial changes. Blockchain
    technology has inherent benefits such as recording transactions in real-time,
    no intermediary, immutability and distributed ledger, which becomes the first
    choice for agri-food value chain managers to enhance information security [60].
    Tse et al. [11] construed that blockchain was a well worthy technology for helping
    agri-food value chain participants to record and transfer transactions authentically.
    Leng et al. [1] proposed a public blockchain for agricultural value chain system
    along with double-chain architecture. The research results reveal that the proposed
    agricultural business resource blockchain not only can increase the security of
    transaction information and privacy of enterprise information, but also can enhance
    the credibility of the public service platform and facilitate overall increase
    of efficiency across the whole value chain system. Neisse et al. [71] explored
    a blockchain-based approach to achieve data accountability and provenance tracking.
    Their findings indicate that for the dynamic data frequently shared among value
    chain members such as the transaction record in agri-food value chain, which have
    strict scalability and performance requirements, controllers or processors should
    manage a contract that registers all subjects accepting all or part of usage conditions.
    Recently, with the advancement of IoT, machine-to-machine (M2M) connections is
    estimated to increase to 3.9 billion to 2022 [72]. More and more agri-food value
    chain participants are being equipped with interconnected electronic devices and
    protocol suites to increase the connectivity and sophisticated data gathering
    and analytics capabilities [50]. However, most of the IoT solutions are dependent
    on the centralized server-client paradigm, connecting to the cloud servers through
    the Internet [26]. Decentralised architectures such as building a large Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) may cause privacy and security issues to the
    users [73]. Thus, effective tools to ensure information security need to be supported
    by agri-food value chain participants to meet the requested security requirements.
    Currently, around 50% of agri-food practitioners have been experimenting blockchain
    technology with creating proof-of-concept, and 17% of agri-food practitioners
    have been preparing to deploy and use it in their business [74]. Hammi et al.
    [49] proposed a public blockchain-based approach in which devices can communicate
    with each other in a completely secure and efficient way by creating a secure
    virtual zone. After a series of tests, the research results indicate that the
    blockchain-based system demonstrated high resilience towards attacks. Iansiti
    and Lakhani [42] underlined that blockchain technology could provide secure, irreversible,
    distributed, transparent and accurate information sharing service. After conducting
    research on blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed that holistically using these blockchain-based ICT technologies
    has a positive effect in increasing the quality of agri-food products. 4.3. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food manufacturing In today’s highly competitive
    and knowledge-based economy, managing massive amount of information and services
    is the basic requirement for successful food manufacturers. As the information
    and services are diversified, growing in an accelerating velocity, and highly
    complex, an increase number of food manufacturers have difficulties in acquiring
    and managing them alone. Wang et al. [75] state that it is necessary for food
    manufacturers to work together and sustain their competitiveness. To address this
    issue, some researchers have started integrating blockchain concept into manufacturing
    practices. Li et al. [35] proposed a decentralized framework to manage the knowledge
    and services shared between different enterprises based on the blockchain application
    involved smart contracts and edge computing. In their proposed framework, edge
    computing acted as a foundation for providing distributed network, storage and
    computing capabilities in the manufacturing environment. The smart contracts played
    as interfaces between enterprise and its partners for successfully interact. Thus,
    a signed secure and controllable connection between the enterprise and the partner
    could be built with the transaction record and the status were updated on the
    blockchain. A case study was used to examine the effectiveness of the decentralized
    framework. The case study results indicate that manufacturers can develop scalable
    and flexible businesses at a lower cost, and ultimately the overall quality, efficiency,
    and effectiveness of manufacturing services can be improved. Furthermore, Zhao
    et al. [76], built a model of manufacturing service information based on blockchain
    principle and cloud computing, which theoretically solves the problems of sharing
    and securing the manufacturing resources, recalling the product data and guaranteeing
    the quality of the processing. Finally, Kumar and Mallic [61] reported that blockchain
    technology could be used in various perspectives of manufacturing, such as manufacturing
    management, production data, product warranty information and product assurance.
    Although blockchain technology has been seen as a critical element in the manufacturing
    sector in recent years, the role of blockchain technology for promoting resilience,
    scalability, security and autonomy of manufacturing service has been relatively
    overlooked [14]. 4.4. Applying blockchain technology in sustainable water management
    The agriculture productivity is highly dependent on water resource management.
    How to use water resources effectively and efficiently is crucial for agriculture
    development. To drive the sustainable development of water, it is critical to
    address water scarcity aspects that are deeply interrelated with agri-food development.
    Therefore, Civic Ledger [77] considered to develop a blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer
    trading platform (Water Ledger) that would allow more irrigators to participate
    in the platform that entitles and allocates water securely and transparently,
    further boosting the overall efficiency of water resources. Though creating new
    digital identity for irrigators and digitizing the water assets in agri-food value
    chain will cost a lot of money, Poberezhna [59] argues that blockchain combined
    with smart contracts can potentially help water companies and government bodies
    to access real-time data regarding market shares, consumption patterns and management
    of utility bills of consumers, thus, greater transparency to regulators and auditors
    can be achieved. Their research also indicates that recordkeeping will be significantly
    reduced when the blockchain platform is applied in water trading. 5. The challenges
    for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain Blockchain technology
    is still in testing phase and its implementation in agri-food value chain management
    has some issues that need to be tackled. Therefore, in this section, we will scrutinize
    the challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    A review of the literature indicates that there are six main challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management: storage capacity and
    scalability issue, privacy leakage, regulation problem, high cost problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. 5.1. Storage capacity and scalability Storage
    capacity along with scalability issues have been deeply questioned in the blockchain.
    Koteska et al. [25] stated that one of the main challenges for blockchain implementation
    is scalability. To provide theoretically proven security, it is necessary to have
    a large number of full nodes (a node that can fully validate transactions and
    blocks) in the blockchain implementation. The nodes in the blockchain network
    are expected to validate each transaction of each block [50]. Otherwise, blockchain
    implementation in agri-food value chain management might result in a less decentralized
    system. Koteska et al. [25] proposed that scalability negatively affected three
    dimensions of the blockchain, the size of the data on the blockchain, the transaction
    processing rate and the latency of data transmission on the blockchain. Although
    only full nodes store the full chain, storage requirements are also significant
    [50]. For example of the Bitcoin, the blockchain is always growing with a rate
    of 1MB per block every ten minutes and store a large amount of data in every node
    that no interest for them [26]. As the number of transactions increase in the
    agri-food value chains, the amount of data becomes larger, and the loading of
    store and computing accompanied with data becomes harder, which results in the
    blockchain becoming bulky [78]. Simultaneously, every participant in the agri-food
    value chain needs to constantly store all transaction data to validate them on
    the blockchain because they need to check if the source of the current transaction
    is unspent or not [83]. Thus, with the node size increasing, additional resources
    are required by the nodes. Finally the system’s capacity scale is reduced and
    synchronization time for the new user is increased [50]. 5.2. Privacy leakage
    In the blockchain, each transaction can be traced, checked and audited and every
    user can be identified by their public key or its hash. Undoubtedly, blockchain
    technology provides a new level of transparency and helps to build trust. However,
    it also has negative effect on protecting users’ privacy [50]. Kosba et al. [79]
    stated that blockchain could not guarantee the transactional privacy even with
    the permission management because the information on blockchain was available
    to all participants who belonged to the blockchain network. Lu and Xu [80] underlined
    that every member could access all information on the blockchain because there
    were no privileged users. Maouchi et al. [36] argued that some agri-food value
    chain members might be competitors with each other and they did not enjoy the
    transparent traceability system. Therefore, many efforts for protecting privacy
    in blockchain has been done such as obfuscation on the transaction relationships
    to prevent linking or tracing analysis, hiding the identifies of the sender and
    the receiver through complicated cryptographic schemes, and blinding the transaction
    content whilst retaining the verifiability and computability [81]. In order to
    ensure transactions are not easily to be traced to any given person or computer,
    Monero [82] applies ring of signatures scheme to guarantee transactions untraceable.
    Other schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring Signature,
    Homomorphic Encryption, Zero-knowledge-proof have been used in blockchains to
    improve privacy, but no schemes can hide the sender, the receiver and the amount
    at the same time [40]. Kosba et al. [79] tackled these privacy issues differently
    through using encrypted transactions. The Hawk – a decentralized smart contract
    is responsible for translating the generic code written by programmers into cryptographic
    primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs that retaining transactional privacy.
    After researching in the wine value chain traceability system, Biswas et al. [67]
    stated that there were two drawbacks of the blockchain technology: one is the
    transaction speed; the other one is privacy as neither companies nor individuals
    would like to publish all information onto a public database. 5.3. High cost problem
    Lin and Liao [83] proposed that agri-food value chain participants would need
    a lot of money and time to embed blockchain technology in the current agri-food
    value chain traceability system. Yli-Huumo et al. [17] noted that when blockchain
    became more complex, the computational power would be another critical issue,
    as it required more computational power to confirm more blocks. Simultaneously,
    energy consumption also needs to be taken into consideration [39]. After conducting
    a case study on blockchain-based traceability system, Lu and Xu [80] pointed out
    some public blockchains inherent with a proof-of-work consensus mechanism wasted
    a lot of electricity. Most of the electricity is consumed in two different ways:
    (1) a large amount of electricity is used for the mining process, which involves
    a consensus algorithm that consists in a sort of brute force search for a hash;
    (2) another amount of electricity is consumed in peer-to-peer communications because
    it requires an edge device to be powered [26]. 5.4. Regulation problem Agri-food
    value chains are extended across the globe. Hence, applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management needs to be considered from a global perspective.
    However, blockchain is a new technology that involves different people from various
    countries without any legal or regulation to follow. Additionally, the absence
    of a central authority and the non-existent of censorship in the current blockchain
    system, this situation creates many uncertainties [50]. Atlam et al. [29] stated
    that this was a serious problem for both agri-food manufacturers and service providers.
    Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new laws or regulations to monitor and
    regulate blockchain applications in the agri-food industry for compliance [8].
    After conducting a case study on grain quality assurance tracking-based on blockchain
    technology, Lucena et al. [58] found a controversial issue when using blockchain
    technology regarding its legal value. Their research also indicates that complex
    agri-food value chain scenarios involving international trade and arbitration
    laws are yet to be proven. 5.5. Throughput and latency issue In the context of
    agri-food value chain management, due to the original restriction of block size
    and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current processing capacity
    of blokchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing millions of transactions
    in real-time. Aste et al. [84] (p.26) stated that “a system that could handle
    large transaction volumes would require large blocks or mechanisms in which multiple
    blocks are validated simultaneously”. All the above issues will cause a big problem
    for clients when running a blockchain-based system. After investigating an RFID
    and blockchain based traceability system for agri-food value chain, Tian [38]
    stated that there were two obstacles for applying blockchain technology: (1) the
    transaction capacity of blockchain is restricted to seven transactions per second
    due to the restricted size of block; (2) how to deal with storage and synchronization
    issues with the growing size of the blockchain. Regarding latency, it is critical
    to note that current blockchain system needs some time to process transactions.
    For example, in the case of Bitcoin, block creation times follow a Poisson distribution
    with an average of ten minutes (10-minute block interval with 6-block confirmation)
    [26]. As for Ethereum, it is estimated around 3 min for 14-second block interval
    with 12-block confirmation [85]. Jindal et al. [86] construed that the time required
    for generating blocks and validating transactions is increases with an increase
    in the number of transactions. Sharma et al. [87] evaluated the performance of
    a blockchain-based distributed framework involved with Proof-of-Work algorithm
    and found that additional cost in computing sources and more processing time is
    required in case of network delays. 5.6. Lack of skills Given that blockchain
    is a new technology, a limited number of people have in-depth knowledge and skills
    about how blockchain can be used in agri-food value chain management [29]. To
    obtain general knowhow in blockchain technology and expectations of the technology
    in the context of agri-food value chain, Ge et al. [10] conducted numerous interviews
    and meetings with agri-food value chain stakeholders. They found that a considerable
    level of scepticism existed among stakeholders with low know-how of blockchain
    technology, partly due to the way blockchain was portrayed as panacea to all information
    problems, partly due to a series of technical issues that remained to be resolved.
    Therefore, Iansiti and Lakhani [42] proposed that applying blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain was likely to be a long process. Simultaneously,
    a widespread lack of understanding on how blockchain works in other areas also
    exists [88]. 6. Discussion: research gaps and future research directions Below,
    we summarized the research gaps and future research directions on blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management based on our systematic review of the literature.
    6.1. Future research directions for the applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management The analysis of the applications of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management allows us to better understand
    how blockchain technology has been applied and evolved in agri-food value chain
    management. Several directions for future research about implementing blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are suggested and summarized in
    the following. • In the context of applying blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain traceability, various researchers proposed different blockchain-based
    traceability system that involved different technologies such as RFID, IoT, NFC,
    cloud computing, and big data, as well took different agri-food value chain entities
    into consideration (see Table 5). It is interesting to note that the traceability
    system proposed by Davcev et al. [30] could provide a comprehensive function for
    monitoring the land status, vegetable status, as well as to help to achieve the
    transparent and secure agri-food value chain. Therefore, should be implemented
    in reality. However, most of the proposed traceability systems are staying in
    conceptual phase and there is little empirical research to suggest which one is
    most applicable to the reality. Additionally, just few researchers considered
    third-party regulators/authority organizations in their proposed traceability
    framework. Therefore, one of the priorities for researching the blockchain-based
    traceability system is to conduct empirical research involving third-party regulators/authority
    organizations on different context of agri-food value chains to assess the performance
    of the blockchain-based traceability system. Thus, future studies can evaluate
    the proposed blockchain-based traceability framework effects from different perspectives,
    such as computation costs, transaction processing speed, storage capability, and
    the overall efficiency of agri-food value chains. Table 5. Blockchain technology

    in the agri-food supply chain can share the same business rules and transaction

    if involved in the international trade. • There are two main areas in the literature
    for using blockchain technology to improve agri-food value chain information security:
    one is using blockchain technology alone; the other one is using blockchain technology
    combined with other technologies such as IoT (see Table 6). Obviously, double
    blockchain architecture has it unique advantages such as efficiency, transparency
    and privacy can be achieved with more data can be stored in the blockchain. Key
    technical components such as decentralized storage, mining hardware, and consensus
    mechanisms are easily to be achieved. However, it needs more effective consensus
    mechanism to deal with large amount of nodes and resources that stored in public
    service platform. Therefore, future research should investigate which consensus
    algorithm is more effective compared with others (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake,
    etc) in the same context. IoT applications have its own drawbacks such as they
    generate large volume of data and require connectivity and power for long periods.
    Besides, there are other limitations in memory, computer capacity, networks and
    limited power supply. In order to alleviate above issues, one important future
    research direction is to decide where the interactions will take place when combining
    blockchain technology with IoT, for example, inside the IoT, or blockchain, or
    a hybrid approach involving blockahin and IoT. It will need to discuss the advantages
    and disadvantages of these blockchain-IoT based applications through comparative
    analysis. This area is open for future researchers to investigate the impact and
    relative importance, and identify which one is the optimal choice to enhance agri-food
    information security. Table 6. Blockchain technology used for agri-food value
    chain information security. Authors Involved technologies Architecture Advantages
    Disadvantages Leng et al. [1] Blockchain Double chain architecture based on public

    and data would be increased Hybrid approach (1) Part of the data are stored in
    the blockchain, and the rest are direct shared with other partners (1) High cost
    because involved more devices • Another finding of this study is a new trend of
    focusing on blockchain technology to achieve a higher level of sharing knowledge
    and services among agri-food manufacturers. Current agri-food manufacturing ecosystem
    is changing from integrated and centralized systems to shared and distributed
    systems. Most of the proposed framework for achieving higher performance were
    based on the blockchain technology and cloud computing, which aimed to provide
    a secure, low energy consumption and high efficiency systems to agri-food manufacturers.
    However, it still has some drawbacks. For example, unstable data transmission,
    lack of uniformed technology standard and low internet speed, etc. Blockchain
    technology integrated with edge computing provide a new way to achieve a higher
    level knowledge sharing performance through developing a distributed, sharing,
    standardized, and secured framework. Key technological components such as communication
    protocol, decentralized storage, smart contracts, edge cloud are all needed to
    build this system. However, there are questions remaining about the combination
    of blockchain and edge computing in enhancing overall efficiency and effectiveness
    of agri-food manufacturers. Thus, future studies should apply the blokchain technology
    and edge computing in different agri-food manufacturers using empirical and analytical
    tools to assess its effect on agri-food manufacturing. • A new trend emerging
    in the literature is the application of blockchain technology in sustainable water
    management. A few studies discussed how to apply blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability. However, these studies just considered how to enhance water
    sustainability from irrigator’s perspective and water company’s perspective, rather
    than taking the whole agri-food value chain stakeholders into consideration. Therefore,
    future work should holistically consider how to use blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability from the whole agri-food value chain perspective. 6.2. Future
    research directions for addressing the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management From our systematic literature review, six
    key challenges emerged for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management, they are storage capacity and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost
    problem, regulation problem, throughput and latency issue, and lack of skills.
    Although a growing body of literature is available on discussing these challenges,
    a number of challenges still exist. The purpose of this section is to highlight
    the main challenges identified in the literature and propose future research directions
    for unsolved problems. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are summarized in Table 7. • One
    of key challenges for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    is the storage capacity. Although some researchers broadly investigated several
    methods that could enhance the storage capacity, for example, store part of the
    data on-chain and part of the data off-chain [85], build a multi-layers blockchain
    architecture with different purposes [40], and develop a new algorithm involved
    deep learning concept [12] (see Table 7). It is easily to find that more computational
    power is required when implementing these solution methods. Therefore, future
    work should investigate how to appropriate solve the data storage problem without
    increasing the computational power. Specifically, integrating the deep learning
    concept or artificially intelligence concept with current algorithms such as ant
    colony algorithm to achieve computational power efficiency and systematically
    eliminate the irrelevance data of blockchain provide a new route for solving the
    storage problem. Furthermore, comparative analysis of implementing these possible
    solutions in the context of agri-food value chain should be conducted empirically
    and analytically. • Most of the researchers investigated how to solve privacy
    leakage issues from single blockchain architecture perspective, and have applied
    different schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring signature,
    Homomorphic encryption, Zero-Knowledge-Proof to protect privacy of users. Few
    researchers investigated how to protect privacy from a double blockchain architecture
    perspective, that is, one for public, one for agri-food value chain participants.
    Therefore, future work should investigate how to design and evaluate double chain
    structures for blockchain. Further, conduct experiments to check how to combine
    the above-listed data privacy schemes to maximum the performance of data privacy
    mechanisms. • As for the high cost problem, different consensus algorithms have
    been proposed by various authors such as Proof-of-Stake and delegated Proof-of-Stake
    algorithm. Though these two algorithms have various advantages such as reducing
    the computing time, less nodes will be involved in the block validation, etc.
    However, no one have conducted comparative analysis using these two algorithms
    in empirical study in the context of agri-food value chain. This area is open
    for future researchers to systematically investigate the impact and relative importance
    of different mechanisms using empirical and analytical tools. • As discussed earlier,
    blockchain is a new technology which neither has any legislations or regulations
    to follow, nor has a defined way of how to insert the implications arising from
    blockchain technology into a norm setting. Although the application of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain is currently still in its infancy, it can
    be expected that more initiatives will be taken by various agri-food organizations
    [10]. Therefore, more work should be taken from theory and empirical perspectives
    to check the effects of blockchain technology on the agri-food value chain, especially
    to check its effect in the international agri-food trade, and then formulate corresponding
    standards based on the research results. • As for the throughput and latency issue,
    some researchers proposed different methods to solve this problem such as implementing
    Bitcoin-NG algorithm and increase the size of each block [17,89]. However, both
    of methods are not perfect enough which will have side effects such as larger
    blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate, and the latency is limited by
    the propagation time of the network, etc. Therefore, how to choose appropriate
    algorithm and block size without side effects become very important in solving
    the throughput and latency issue of blockchain. It is necessary to holistically
    consider this problem with continually experiments and get an optimal solution.
    • Finally, concerned with the lack of skills, we did not find many publications
    that gave us clear answers on this challenge. Only Ge et al. [10] proposed two
    learning objectives for solving the challenge of lacking skills: (1) learn general
    knowledge of blockchain technology; (2) identify how to benefit from blockchain
    technology. Table 7. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. Main challenges Possible solutions

    2. More computation power is required. Novel approach Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy cognitive
    maps ANN [12] 1. Eliminate of irrelevance data within mining process. 1. More
    computation power is required; 2. High cost problem. Privacy leakage Double Chain
    architecture [1] 1. Can guarantee the authenticity, integrity, and non-tampering
    of transaction data, and ensure the privacy of user information. 2. Improve the
    throughput rate and consensus speed of the system; 3. Business extension can be
    implemented. 1. The consensus of public blockchain is low. 1. Conduct more empirical
    studies on the performance of the agri-food value chain with double chain architecture;
    2. Conduct experiments to check how to combine these data privacy schemes to maximum
    the performance. Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring signature, Homomorphic
    encryption, Zero-Knowledge-Proof [40]; 1. Desired level of privacy can be achieved
    through implementing mixed techniques. 1. No scheme can hide the sender, the receiver
    and the amount at the same time; 2. More computation time is required. High cost
    problem Perform Proof-of-Stake algorithm [80] 1. Only require a small amount of
    computing time and the ability to ensure the normal operation of the blockchain;
    2. Latency is shorter. 1. The consensus speed is low; 2. Node is accumulated even
    when the node is not connected to the network in the stake stage. 1. Conduct comparative
    analysis of these two algorithms using empirical study in the context of agri-food
    value chain. Perform delegated Proof-of-Stake algorithm [78] 1. Less nodes involved
    in block validation; 2. Block size and intervals can be adjusted by delegates.
    1. Transactions are performed faster; 2. Dishonest delegates can cause financial
    loss. Regulation problem 1. Design and implementation of a clear regulatory framework
    for blockchain implementation in the agri-food domain and develop the evidence
    for the added value of the blockchain technology [10]; 2. Government should set
    up blockchain infrastructure to support policy formulation [26]. 1. Accelerate
    the process of formulating policies and regulations related to the blockchain
    implementation. 2. Make blockchain technology is easily accepted by agri-food
    value chain participants. 1. Government need to invest a lot of money and human
    resources, and may not get the suitable results. 1. Investigate the effects of
    blockchain technology on agri-food value chain, especially on the international
    agri-food trade, and then formulate standards and regulations. Throughput and
    latency issue 1. Implement Bitcoin-NG consensus algorithm [89]; 2. Increase the
    size of each block [17]. 1. Improve the latency and bandwidth without sacrificing
    other properties such as security; 2. More transactions speed per second. 1. Bandwidth
    is limited by the bandwidth of nodes and the latency limited by the propagation
    time of the network. 2. More expensive for managing larger blocks. 1. Holistically
    consider this problem to find the optimal solution for integrating Bitcoin-NG
    consensus algorithm and appropriate size of each block. Lack of skills Not addressed
    7. Conclusions In this study, we conducted an SLNA to review existing work on
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through question formulation,
    locating studies, study selection and evaluation, we identified 71 publications,
    including journal papers, conference proceedings and book chapters. Then, we used
    software Gephi to build a citation network based on the citation data collected
    from Web of Science, which helped us to identify current trends and future research
    directions of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. The target
    publications of this study covered a broad spectrum of themes such as blockchain-based
    information security and traceability system, and blockchain-based water sustainability
    and food manufacturing. By synthesising the literature of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management within a 10-year timeframe (2008–2018), this
    paper makes contributions to existing knowledge in three aspects: (1) The paper
    provides an overall picture of the evolution of blockchain technology and its
    application in agri-food value chains. (2) The paper elicited key challenges and
    proposed initial solutions for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value
    chain. (3) Research gaps have been identified and future research directions were
    suggested for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    The findings of this study provide a solid foundation for future studies in the
    area of blockchain technology and agri-food value chain management. Acknowledgment

    Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next era of communication. Using
    the IoT, physical objects can be empowered to create, receive, and exchange data
    in a seamless manner. Various IoT applications focus on automating different tasks
    and are trying to empower the inanimate physical objects to act without any human
    intervention. The existing and upcoming IoT applications are highly promising
    to increase the level of comfort, efficiency, and automation for the users. To
    be able to implement such a world in an ever-growing fashion requires high security,
    privacy, authentication, and recovery from attacks. In this regard, it is imperative
    to make the required changes in the architecture of the IoT applications for achieving
    end-to-end secure IoT environments. In this paper, a detailed review of the security-related
    challenges and sources of threat in the IoT applications is presented. After discussing
    the security issues, various emerging and existing technologies focused on achieving
    a high degree of trust in the IoT applications are discussed. Four different technologies,
    blockchain, fog computing, edge computing, and machine learning, to increase the
    level of security in IoT are discussed. This paper presents a detailed survey
    of IoT security. First of all the security critical IoT applications are discussed.
    Next, the security threats at different layers i...View more Published in: IEEE

    connecting physical devices around us to the Internet is increasing rapidly. According
    to a recent Gartner report, there will be around 8.4 billion connected things
    worldwide in 2020. This number is expected to grow to 20.4 billion by 2022 [1].
    The use of IoT applications is increasing in all parts of the world. The major
    driving countries in this include western Europe, North America, and China [1].
    The number of machine to machine (M2M) connections is expected to grow from 5.6
    billion in 2016 to 27 billion in 2024 [1]. This leap in numbers itself declares
    IoT to be one of the major upcoming markets that could form a cornerstone of the
    expanding digital economy. The IoT industry is expected to grow in terms of revenue
    from 892billionin2018to 4 trillion by 2025 [2]. M2M connections cover a broad
    range of applications like smart cities, smart environment, smart grids, smart
    retail, smart farming, etc. [3]. Figure 1 shows the past, present and future architecture
    of IoT. In future, the devices are not only expected to be connected to the Internet
    and other local devices but are also expected to communicate with other devices
    on the Internet directly. Apart from the devices or things being connected, the
    concept of social IoT (SIoT) is also emerging. SIoT will enable different social
    networking users to be connected to the devices and users can share the devices
    over the Internet [4]. FIGURE 1. Present and future architecture of IoT. Show
    All With all this vast spectrum of IoT applications comes the issue of security
    and privacy. Without a trusted and interoperable IoT ecosystem, emerging IoT applications
    cannot reach high demand and may lose all their potential. Along with the security
    issues faced generally by the Internet, cellular networks, and WSNs, IoT also
    has its special security challenges such as privacy issues, authentication issues,
    management issues, information storage and so on. Table 1 summarizes various factors
    due to which securing IoT environment is much more challenging than securing normal
    information technology (IT) devices. Due to all these issues and vulnerabilities,
    the IoT applications create a fertile ground for different kinds of cyber threats.
    There have been various security and privacy attacks on the already deployed IoT
    applications worldwide. Mirai attack in the last quarter of 2016 was estimated
    to infect around 2.5 million devices connected to the Internet and launch distributed
    denial of service (DDoS) attack [5]. After Mirai, Hajime and Reaper are the other
    big botnet attacks launched against a large number of IoT devices [5]. IoT devices,
    being low powered and less secure, provide a gateway to the adversaries for entering
    into home and corporate networks, thereby giving easy access to the user’s data.
    Also, the domain of IoT is expanding beyond mere things or objects. There have
    been various successful attempts to implant IoT devices into the human body to
    monitor the live condition of various organs [6]. Attackers can target such devices
    to track the location of a particular individual or falsify data. Such an attack
    has not taken place yet in real life but can be highly dangerous, if such devices
    are compromised. TABLE 1 Comparison of Security of IT Devices and IoT Devices
    Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) is another area benefitting from the growth of IoT.
    In CPS physical objects in the environment are monitored, and actions are taken
    based on the physical changes. Since CPS encompass assets of critical importance
    (e.g., power grids, transportation systems), security vulnerabilities in such
    systems have serious consequences. However, security challenges for CPS have their
    unique characteristics and are outside the scope of this paper. In any IoT ecosystem
    or environment, there are four important layers. The first layer includes the
    use of various sensors and actuators to perceive the data or information to perform
    various functionalities. Based on that, in the second layer, a communication network
    is used to transmit the collected data. Most of the evolving IoT applications
    deploy the third layer, called a middleware layer, to act as a bridge between
    the network and application layer. Finally, on the fourth layer, there are various
    IoT based end-to-end applications like smart grids, smart transport, smart factories,
    etc. All of these four layers have security problems specific to them. Apart from
    these layers, various gateways connect these layers and help in the data movement.
    There are certain security threats specific to these gateways as well. In this
    paper, a detailed survey of IoT security solutions in the existing literature
    is presented. First of all, the fundamental constraints to achieve high levels
    for security in IoT applications are presented. The goal of this paper is to highlight
    the major existing and upcoming solutions for IoT security. Specifically, the
    four major classes of IoT security solutions namely: (1) blockchain based solutions;
    (2) fog computing based solutions; (3) machine learning based solutions and (4)
    edge computing based solutions are highlighted. Table 3 gives a list of acronyms
    related to IoT used in this paper. TABLE 2 Related Surveys on IoT Security TABLE
    3 List of Acronyms A. Related Surveys and Our Contributions There are various
    existing surveys on IoT security and privacy issues. Yuchen et al. [10] have summarized
    various security issues in IoT applications. Authors of [11] have discussed the
    security issues specific to location-based services in IoT. The authors target
    the particular problems related to localization and positioning of the IoT devices.
    Anne et al. in [12] focus mainly on the security issues related to IoT middleware
    and provide a detailed survey of related existing protocols and their security
    issues. M. Guizani et al. in [14] have surveyed various trust management techniques
    for IoT along with their pros and cons. Security mechanisms for IoT security such
    as software defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV)
    are discussed in [13]. In [8] the authors have compared edge computing with traditional
    cloud systems to secure IoT systems. Jie Lin et al. in [9] have discussed the
    relationship between IoT and fog computing. Some of the security issues related
    to fog computing have also been discussed. Authors of [7] have discussed vulnerabilities
    faced by IoT in brief. Table 2 summarizes the main contributions of the previous
    comprehensive surveys on IoT security. Although there are several works in this
    direction, they are specific to certain limited aspects of IoT. This calls the
    need for a detailed survey on all the existing and upcoming security challenges
    in IoT applications. This paper will help the reader to get a detailed idea of
    the state-of-the-art in IoT security and will give them a general understanding
    of the area. The main contributions of this work are as follows: A classification
    of different IoT applications and specific security and privacy issues related
    to those applications. A detailed explanation of different threat sources in different
    layers of IoT. Detailed and realistic recommendations to improve the IoT infrastructure
    to facilitate secure communications. Review on the proposed countermeasures to
    the security issues in IoT. An assessment of the open issues, challenges and future
    research directions for developing secure IoT applications. B. Organization The
    organization of the rest of the paper is as follows: Section II describes various
    application areas of IoT where high security is required. Section III discusses
    various sources of threats in an IoT environment. In section IV various constraints
    and requirements to be considered while developing a secure IoT application are
    reviewed. Four major IoT security approaches, i.e., blockchain, fog computing,
    machine learning, and edge computing are presented in Section V, VI, VII, and
    VIII, respectively. Section IX describes various open issues, challenges and upcoming
    research opportunities in IoT security and finally, Section X concludes the paper.
    SECTION II. Security Critical Application Areas of IoT Security is highly critical
    in almost all IoT applications that have already been deployed or are in the process
    of deployment. The applications of IoT are increasing very rapidly and penetrating
    most of the existing industries. Although operators support these IoT applications
    through existing networking technologies, several of these applications need more
    stringent security support from technologies they use. In this section various
    security critical IoT applications are discussed. Smart Cities: Smart cities involve
    extensive use of emerging computation and communication resources for increasing
    the overall quality of life of the people [15]. It includes smart homes, smart
    traffic management, smart disaster management, smart utilities, etc. There is
    a push to make cities smarter, and governments worldwide are encouraging their
    development through various incentives [16]. Although the use of smart applications
    is intended to improve the overall quality of life of the citizens, it comes with
    a threat to the privacy of the citizens. Smart card services tend to put the card
    details and purchase behavior of the citizens at risk. Smart mobility applications
    may leak the location traces of the users. There are applications using which
    parents can keep track of their child. However, if such applications are hacked,
    then the safety of the child can come to risk. Smart Environment: Smart environment
    includes various IoT applications such as fire detection in forests, monitoring
    the level of snow in high altitude regions, preventing landslides, early detection
    of earthquakes, pollution monitoring, etc. All these IoT applications are closely
    related to the life of human beings and animals in those areas. The government
    agencies involved in such fields will also be relying on the information from
    these IoT applications. Security breaches and vulnerability in any area related
    to such IoT applications can have serious consequences. In this context, both
    false negatives and false positives can lead to disastrous results for such IoT
    applications. For example, if the application starts detecting earthquakes falsely,
    then it will lead to monetary losses for the government and businesses. On the
    other hand, if the application is not able to predict the earthquake, then it
    will lead to the loss of both property and life. Therefore, smart environment
    applications have to be highly precise, and security breaches and data tampering
    must be avoided. Smart Metering and Smart Grids: Smart metering includes applications
    related to various measurements, monitoring, and management. The most common application
    of smart metering is smart grids, where the electricity consumption is measured
    and monitored. Smart metering may also be used to address the problem of electricity
    theft [17]. Other applications of smart metering include monitoring of water,
    oil and gas levels in storage tanks and cisterns. Smart meters are also used to
    monitor and optimize the performance of solar energy plants by dynamically changing
    the angle of solar panels to harvest the maximum possible solar energy. There
    also exist some IoT applications that use smart meters to measure the water pressure
    in water transport systems or to measure the weight of goods. However, smart metering
    systems are vulnerable to both physical and cyber-attacks as compared to analog
    meters that can be tampered only by physical attacks. Also, smart meters or advanced
    metering infrastructure (AMI) are intended to perform functions beyond generic
    energy usage recording. In a smart home area network (HAN) all electric equipment
    at home are connected to smart meters and the information collected from these
    equipments can be used for load and cost management. Intentional intrusion in
    such communication systems by the consumer or an adversary may modify the collected
    information, leading to monetary loss for the service providers or consumers [18].
    Security and Emergencies: Security and emergencies is another important area where
    various IoT applications are being deployed. It includes applications such as
    allowing only authorized people in restricted areas etc. Another application in
    this domain is the detection of leakage of hazardous gases in industrial areas
    or areas around chemical factories. Radiation levels can also be measured in the
    areas around nuclear power reactors or cellular base stations and alerts can be
    generated when the radiation level is high. There are various buildings whose
    systems have sensitive data or that house sensitive goods. Security applications
    can be deployed to protect sensitive data and goods. IoT applications that detect
    various liquids can also be used to prevent corrosion and break downs in such
    sensitive buildings. Security breaches in such applications can also have various
    serious consequences. For example, the criminals may try to enter the restricted
    areas by attacking the vulnerabilities in such applications. Also, false radiation
    level alarms can have serious immediate and long term impacts. For example, if
    infants are exposed to high levels of radiation, then it may lead to serious life
    threatening diseases in long term. Smart Retail: IoT applications are being extensively
    used in the retail sector. Various applications have been developed to monitor
    the storage conditions of the goods as they move along the supply chain. IoT is
    also being used to control the tracking of products in the warehouses so that
    restocking can be done optimally. Various intelligent shopping applications are
    also being developed for assisting the customers based on their preferences, habits,
    allergies to certain components, etc. Mechanisms to provide the experience of
    online shopping to offline retailers using augmented reality techniques have also
    been developed. Various companies in retail have faced security issues in deploying
    and using various IoT applications. Some of these companies include Apple, Home
    Depot, JP Morgan Chase and Sony [19]. Adversaries may try to compromise the IoT
    applications associated with storage conditions of the goods and may try to send
    wrong information about the products to the users in order to increase the sale.
    If security features are not implemented in smart retail, attackers may steal
    debit and credit card information, phone numbers, email-addresses, etc. of the
    customers which can lead to monetary losses for the customers and retailers. Smart
    Agriculture and Animal Farming: Smart agriculture includes monitoring soil moisture,
    controlling micro-climate conditions, selective irrigation in dry zones, and controlling
    humidity and temperature. Usage of such advanced features in agriculture can help
    in achieving high yields and can save farmers from monetary losses. Control of
    temperature and humidity levels in various grain and vegetable production can
    help in preventing fungus and other microbial contaminants. Controlling the climate
    conditions can also help in increasing the vegetable and crop yield and quality.
    Just like crop monitoring, there are IoT applications to monitor the activities
    and the health condition of farm animals by attaching sensors to the animals.
    If such applications are compromised, then it may lead to the theft of animals
    from the farm and adversaries may also damage the crops. Home Automation: Home
    automation is one of the most widely used and deployed IoT applications. This
    includes applications such as those for remotely controlling electrical appliances
    to save energy, systems deployed on windows and doors to detect intruders, etc.
    Monitoring systems are being applied to track energy and water supply consumption,
    and users are being advised to save cost and resources. Authors in [20] have proposed
    the use of logic based security algorithms to enhance security level in homes.
    Intrusions are detected by comparing the user actions at key locations of the
    home with normal behavior of the user in these locations. However, attackers may
    gain unauthorized access of the IoT devices in the home and try to harm the users.
    For instance, cases of home burglaries have increased rapidly after the deployment
    of various home automation systems [20]. There have also been various cases in
    the past where the adversaries try to analyze the type and volume of Internet
    traffic to/from the smart home for judging the behavior and presence of the residents.
    SECTION III. Sources of Security Threats in IoT Applications As discussed in Section
    I, any IoT application can be divided into four layers: (1) sensing layer; (2)
    network layer; (3) middleware layer; and (4) application layer. Each of these
    layers in an IoT application uses diverse technologies that bring a number of
    issues and security threats. Figure 2 shows various technologies, devices, and
    applications at these four layers. This section discusses various possible security
    threats in IoT applications for these four layers. Figure 3 shows the possible
    attacks on these four layers. The special security issues associated with the
    gateways that connect these layers are also discussed in this section. FIGURE
    2. Layers in IoT system. Show All FIGURE 3. Types of attacks on IoT. Show All
    A. Security Issues at Sensing Layer The sensing layer mainly deals with physical
    IoT sensors and actuators. Sensors sense the physical phenomenon happening around
    them [21]–[23]. Actuators, on the other hand, perform a certain action on the
    physical environment, based on the sensed data. There are various kinds of sensors
    for sensing different kinds of data, e.g., ultrasonic sensors, camera sensors,
    smoke detection sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, etc. There can be mechanical,
    electrical, electronic or chemical sensors used to sense the physical environment.
    Various sensing layer technologies are used in different IoT applications like
    RFID, GPS, WSNs, RSNs, etc. Major security threats that can be encountered at
    the sensing layer are as follows: Node Capturing: IoT applications comprise of
    several low power nodes such as sensors and actuators. These nodes are vulnerable
    to a variety of attacks by the adversaries. The attackers may try to capture or
    replace the node in the IoT system with a malicious node. The new node may appear
    to be the part of the system but is controlled by the attacker. This may lead
    to compromising the security of the complete IoT application [24]. Malicious Code
    Injection Attack: The attack involves the attacker injecting some malicious code
    in the memory of the node. Generally, the firmware or software of IoT nodes are
    upgraded on the air, and this gives a gateway to the attackers to inject malicious
    code. Using such malicious code, the attackers may force the nodes to perform
    some unintended functions or may even try to access the complete IoT system. False
    Data Injection Attack: Once the node is captured, the attacker may use it to inject
    erroneous data onto the IoT system. This may lead to false results and may result
    in malfunctioning of the IoT application. The attacker may also use this method
    to cause a DDoS attack. Side-Channel Attacks (SCA): Apart from direct attacks
    on the nodes, various side-channel attacks may lead to leaking of sensitive data.
    The microarchitectures of processors, electromagnetic emanation and their power
    consumption reveal sensitive information to adversaries. Side channel attacks
    may be based on power consumption, laser-based attacks, timing attacks or electromagnetic
    attacks. Modern chips take care of various countermeasures to prevent these side-channel
    attacks while implementing the cryptographic modules. Eavesdropping and Interference:
    IoT applications often consist of various nodes deployed in open environments
    [25]. As a result, such IoT applications are exposed to eavesdroppers. The attackers
    may eavesdrop and capture the data during different phases like data transmission
    or authentication. Sleep Deprivation Attacks: In such type of attacks the adversaries
    try to drain the battery of the low-powered IoT edge devices. This leads to a
    denial of service from the nodes in the IoT application due to a dead battery.
    This can be done by running infinite loops in the edge devices using malicious
    code or by artificially increasing the power consumption of the edge devices.
    Booting Attacks: The edge devices are vulnerable to various attacks during the
    boot process. This is because the inbuilt security processes are not enabled at
    that point. The attackers may take advantage of this vulnerability and try to
    attack the node devices when they are being restarted. As edge devices are typically
    low powered and at times go through sleep-wake cycles, it is thus essential to
    secure the boot process in these devices. B. Security Issues at Network Layer
    The key function of the network layer is transmitting the information received
    from the sensing layer to the computational unit for processing. The major security
    issues that are encountered at the network layer are as follows. Phishing Site
    Attack: Phishing attacks often refer to attacks where several IoT devices can
    be targeted by a minimal effort put by the attacker. The attackers expect that
    at least few of the devices will become a victim of the attack. There is a possibility
    of encountering phishing sites in the course of users visiting web pages on the
    Internet. Once the user’s account and password are compromised, the whole IoT
    environment being used by the user becomes vulnerable to cyber attacks. The network
    layer in IoT is highly vulnerable to phishing sites attacks [26]. Access Attack:
    Access attack is also referred to as advanced persistent threat (APT). This is
    a type of attack in which an unauthorized person or an adversary gains access
    to the IoT network. The attacker can continue to stay in the network undetected
    for a long duration. The purpose or intention of this kind of attack is to steal
    valuable data or information, rather than to cause damage to the network. IoT
    applications continuously receive and transfer valuable data and are therefore
    highly vulnerable to such attacks [27]. DDoS/DoS Attack: In this kind of attacks,
    the attacker floods the target servers with a large number of unwanted requests.
    This incapacitates the target server, thereby disrupting services to genuine users.
    If there are multiple sources used by the attacker to flood the target server,
    then such an attack is termed as DDoS or distributed denial of service attack.
    Such attacks are not specific to IoT applications, but due to the heterogeneity
    and complexity of IoT networks, the network layer of the IoT is prone to such
    attacks. Many IoT devices in IoT applications are not strongly configured, and
    thus become easy gateways for attackers to launch DDoS attacks on the target servers.
    The Mirai botnet attack as discussed in Section I used this vulnerability and
    blocked various servers by constantly propagating requests to the weakly configured
    IoT devices [28]. Data Transit Attacks: IoT applications deal with a lot of data
    storage and exchange. Data is valuable, and therefore it is always the target
    of hackers and other adversaries. Data that is stored in the local servers or
    the cloud has a security risk, but the data that is in transit or is moving from
    one location to another is even more vulnerable to cyber attacks. In IoT applications,
    there is a lot of data movement between sensors, actuators, cloud, etc. Different
    connection technologies are used in such data movements, and therefore IoT applications
    are susceptible to data breaches. Routing Attacks: In such attacks, malicious
    nodes in an IoT application may try to redirect the routing paths during data
    transit. Sinkhole attacks are a specific kind of routing attack in which an adversary
    advertises an artificial shortest routing path and attracts nodes to route traffic
    through it. A worm-hole attack is another attack which can become serious security
    threat if combined with other attacks such as sinkhole attacks. A warm-hole is
    an out of band connection between two nodes for fast packet transfer. An attacker
    can create a warm-hole between a compromised node and a device on the internet
    and try to bypass the basic security protocols in an IoT application. C. Security
    Issues at Middleware Layer The role of the middleware in IoT is to create an abstraction
    layer between the network layer and the application layer. Middleware can also
    provide powerful computing and storage capabilities [29]. This layer provides
    APIs to fulfill the demands of the application layer. Middleware layer includes
    brokers, persistent data stores, queuing systems, machine learning, etc. Although
    the middleware layer is useful to provide a reliable and robust IoT application,
    it is also susceptible to various attacks. These attacks can take control of the
    entire IoT application by infecting the middleware. Database security and cloud
    security are other main security challenges in the middleware layer. Various possible
    attacks in the middleware layer are discussed as follows. Man-in-the-Middle Attack:
    The MQTT protocol uses publish-subscribe model of communication between clients
    and subscribers using the MQTT broker, which effectively acts as a proxy. This
    helps in decoupling the publishing and the subscribing clients from each other
    and messages can be sent without the knowledge of the destination. If the attacker
    can control the broker and become a man-in-the-middle, then he/she can get complete
    control of all communication without any knowledge of the clients. SQL Injection
    Attack: MIddleware is also susceptible to SQL Injection (SQLi) attacks. In such
    attacks, attacker can embed malicious SQL statements in a program [30], [31].
    Then, the attackers can obtain private data of any user and can even alter records
    in the database [32]. Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has listed
    SQLi as a top threat to web security in their OWASP top 10 2018 document [33].
    Signature Wrapping Attack: In the web services used in the middleware, XML signatures
    are used [34]. In a signature wrapping attack, the attacker breaks the signature
    algorithm and can execute operations or modify eavesdropped message by exploiting
    vulnerabilities in SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) [35]. Cloud Malware Injection:
    In cloud malware injection, the attacker can obtain control, inject malicious
    code or can inject a virtual machine into the cloud. The attacker pretends to
    be a valid service by trying to create a virtual machine instance or a malicious
    service module. In this way, the attacker can obtain access to service requests
    of the victim’s service and can capture sensitive data which can be modified as
    per the instance. Flooding Attack in Cloud: This attack works almost the same
    as DoS attack in the cloud and affects the quality of service (QoS). For depleting
    cloud resources, the attackers continuously send multiple requests to a service.
    These attacks can have a big impact on cloud systems by increasing the load on
    the cloud servers. D. Security Issues at Gateways Gateway is a broad layer that
    has an important role in connecting multiple devices, people, things and cloud
    services. Gateways also help in providing hardware and software solutions for
    IoT devices. Gateways are used for decrypting and encrypting IoT data and translating
    protocols for communication between different layers [36]. IoT systems today are
    heterogeneous including LoraWan, ZigBee, Z-Wave and TCP/IP stacks with many gateways
    in between. Some of the security challenges for IoT gateway are discussed below.
    Secure On-boarding: When a new device or sensor is installed in an IoT system,
    it is imperative to protect encryption keys. Gateways act as an intermediary between
    the new devices and the managing services, and all the keys pass through the gateways.
    The gateways are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping to
    capture the encryption keys, especially during the on-boarding process. Extra
    Interfaces: Minimizing the attack surface is an important strategy that needs
    to be kept in mind while installing the IoT devices [37]. Only the necessary interfaces
    and protocols should be implemented by an IoT gateway manufacturer. Some of the
    services and functionalities should be restricted for end-users to avoid backdoor
    authentication or information breach. End-to-End Encryption: True end-to-end application
    layer security is required to ensure the confidentiality of the data [38]. The
    application should not let anyone other than the unique recipient to decrypt the
    encrypted messages. Although Zigbee and Zwave protocols support encryption, this
    is not end-to-end encryption, because, in order to translate the information from
    one protocol to another, the gateways are required to decrypt and re-encrypt the
    messages. This decryption at the gateway level makes the data susceptible to data
    breaches. Firmware updates: Most IoT devices are resource constrained, and therefore
    they do not have an user interface or the computation power to download and install
    the firmware updates. Generally, gateways are used to download and apply the firmware
    updates. The current and new version of the firmware should be recorded, and validity
    of the signatures should be checked for secure firmware updates. E. Security Issues
    at Application Layer The application layer directly deals with and provides services
    to the end users. IoT applications like smart homes, smart meters, smart cities,
    smart grids, etc. lie in this layer. This layer has specific security issues that
    are not present in other layers, such as data theft and privacy issues. The security
    issues in this layer are also specific to different applications. Many IoT applications
    also consist of a sub-layer between the network layer and application layer, usually
    termed as an application support layer or middleware layer. The support layer
    supports various business services and helps in intelligent resource allocation
    and computation. Major security issues encountered by the application layer are
    discussed below. Data Thefts: IoT applications deal with lot of critical and private
    data. The data in transit is even more vulnerable to attacks than data at rest,
    and in IoT applications, there is a lot of data movement. The users will be reluctant
    to register their private data on IoT applications if these applications are vulnerable
    to data theft attacks. Data encryption, data isolation, user and network authentication,
    privacy management, etc. are some of the techniques and protocols being used to
    secure IoT applications against data thefts. Access Control Attacks: Access control
    is authorization mechanism that allows only legitimate users or processes to access
    the data or account. Access control attack is a critical attack in IoT applications
    because once the access is compromised, then the complete IoT application becomes
    vulnerable to attacks. Service Interruption Attacks: These attacks are also referred
    to as illegal interruption attacks or DDoS attacks in existing literature. There
    have been various instances of such attacks on IoT applications. Such attacks
    deprive legitimate users from using the services of IoT applications by artificially
    making the servers or network too busy to respond. Malicious Code Injection Attacks:
    Attackers generally go for the easiest or simplest method they can use to break
    into a system or network. If the system is vulnerable to malicious scripts and
    misdirections due to insufficient code checks, then that would be the first entry
    point that an attacker would choose. Generally, attackers use XSS (cross-site
    scripting) to inject some malicious script into an otherwise trusted website.
    A successful XSS attack can result in the hijacking of an IoT account and can
    paralyze the IoT system. Sniffing Attacks: The attackers may use sniffer applications
    to monitor the network traffic in IoT applications. This may allow the attacker
    to gain access to confidential user data if there are not enough security protocols
    implemented to prevent it [39]. Reprogram Attacks: If the programming process
    is not protected, then the attackers can try to reprogram the IoT objects remotely.
    This may lead to the hijacking of the IoT network [40]. SECTION IV. Improvements
    and Enhancements Required for Upcoming IoT Applications Personal computers (PC)
    and smartphones have a number of security features built into them, e.g., firewalls,
    anti-virus softwares, address space randomization, etc. These safety shields are,
    in general, missing in various IoT devices that are already in the market. There
    are various security challenges that the IoT applications are facing currently.
    A well-defined framework and standard for an end-to-end IoT application is not
    yet available. An IoT application is not a standalone application, and it is an
    assembled product which includes work from many individuals and industries. At
    every layer starting from sensing to the application, several diverse products
    and technologies are being used. These include a large number of sensors and actuators
    at the edge nodes. There are multiple communication standards like cellular network,
    WiFi, IEEE 802.15.4, Insteon, dash7, Bluetooth, etc. A handshake mechanism is
    required between all these standards. Apart from this, various connectivity technologies
    are being used at different levels in the same IoT application like Zigbee, 6LOWPAN,
    wireless HART, Z-Wave, ISA100, Bluetooth, NFC, RFID, etc. Over and above this,
    the generic HTTP protocol cannot be used in the application layer. HTTP is not
    suitable for resource-constrained environments because it is heavy-weight and
    thus incurs a large parsing overhead. Therefore, at the application layer also
    there are many alternate protocols that have been deployed for IoT environments.
    Some of them are MQTT, SMQTT, CoAP, XMPP, AMQP, M3DA, JavascriptIoT, etc. Due
    to the intense diversity of protocols, technologies, and devices in an IoT application,
    the significant trade-offs are between cost effectiveness, security, reliability,
    privacy, coverage, latency, etc. If one metric for improvement is optimized, it
    may result in the degradation of other metric. For example, imposing too many
    security checks and protocols in all data transactions in IoT applications may
    end up increasing the cost and latency of the application, thereby, making it
    unsuitable for the users. A typical IoT application consists of a big chain of
    connected devices, technologies, domains, and geographies. Even if one of the
    device or technology or their combination is left weak, then that may be the cause
    of a security threat for the entire application. The chain is considered to be
    as strong as the weakest link. There has been a large increase in the number of
    weak links in IoT applications recently. For example, even basic IoT applications
    such as smart bulbs and smart door locks can be used as a weak link in a smart
    home IoT application to extract the user’s WiFi password [41] and [42]. The large
    number of IoT devices being deployed around the world to make it smart generates
    a large amount of environment and user-related data. A lot of private information
    can be inferred from this data, and that can be another cause of threat for an
    individual and society at large [7]. As a result, significant improvements and
    enhancements in the current IoT application structure and framework are required
    to make it reliable, secure and robust. In this regard: Rigorous penetration testing
    for IoT devices is necessary to quantify the level of risk involved in deploying
    these devices in different applications. Based on the risk involved, a priority
    list can be made and the devices can be deployed appropriately in different applications.
    Encryption techniques are being used in IoT system at different layers and protocols.
    However, there are various levels of encrypt, decrypt, and re-encrypt cycles in
    the complete system. These cycles make the system vulnerable to attacks. End to
    end encryption would be a promising solution to prevent different attacks. Authenticate-always
    protocols need to be implemented. Whenever a device wants to interact with another
    device, an authentication process should be implemented. Digital certificates
    can be a promising solution to provide seamless authentication with bound identities
    that are tied to cryptographic protocols. Any IoT security framework being implemented
    should be tested and confirmed for scalability. The security protocols should
    not be working only for a limited set of users. The real threats start coming
    only when the application becomes public and starts being used widely in the public
    domain. Therefore, proper strategy and planning are required. A mechanism based
    on encryption techniques like RSA, SHA256, or hash chains is required to secure
    the user and environment data from being captured. IoT devices need to be designed
    in a way that they can transmit the sensed data in a secure and encrypted way.
    This will help in gaining the trust of the individuals, government agencies and
    industries in IoT applications. Since the IoT devices and applications are growing
    rapidly, an approach needs to be designed to handle the cost and capacity constraints
    that are expected to be encountered shortly. A paradigm shift from a centralized
    approach to some decentralized approach might be needed, where devices can automatically
    and securely communicate with each other. This can help in reducing the cost of
    managing the applications and can reduce the issues of capacity constraints [43].
    Since most of the IoT applications use cloud services for data storage and retrieval,
    the risks caused by the cloud should also be considered. Cloud is a public platform
    used by multiple users and there may be malicious users on the cloud who can be
    the cause of threat for IoT related data. The data should be stored as ciphertext
    in the cloud and the cloud should not be allowed to decrypt any ciphertext. This
    can further enhance data security and can save us from the generic risks of using
    cloud services [44]. Apart from the challenges from outside entities, there are
    various scenarios where the sensors in an IoT application start collecting or
    sending erroneous data. These errors might be easy to handle in case of a centralized
    architecture but can become a bottleneck in case of an autonomous decentralized
    architecture. Faulty reading or transmitting of data can lead to undesirable results.
    Thus, mechanism needs to be identified to validate the data flow, especially in
    case of a distributed architecture [45]. Since the ultimate goal of all IoT applications
    is to create an autonomous system that needs minimum human interventions, the
    use of some artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques or algorithms to secure
    IoT devices might be useful. This can help in reducing the analysis and communication
    load on IoT environment [46]. There are various techniques and approaches in the
    existing literature for securing IoT environments and applications. These solutions
    may be divided into four categories: (1) blockchain based solutions; (2) fog computing
    based solutions; (3) machine learning based solutions and (4) edge computing based
    solutions. Figure 4 shows various works in different domains that have used the
    above-mentioned solutions for securing the IoT environments [47]–[97]. In the
    following sections, these solutions are described in detail. FIGURE 4. Research
    papers addressing IoT security using various security techniques. Show All SECTION
    V. IoT Security Using Blockchain Blockchain and IoT are important technologies
    that will have a high impact on the IT and communication industry. These two technologies
    focus on improving the overall transparency, visibility, level of comfort and
    level of trust for the users. The IoT devices provide real-time data from sensors
    and blockchain provides the key for data security using a distributed, decentralized
    and shared ledger [108]. The basic idea behind the blockchain is simple: it is
    a distributed ledger (also called replicated log files). The entries in the blockchain
    are chronological and time-stamped. Each entry in the ledger is tightly coupled
    with the previous entry using cryptographic hash keys. A Merkle tree is used to
    store the individual transactions and the root hash of the tree is stored in the
    blockchain. In the figure, T1,T2,T3,⋯,Tn represent the individual transactions.
    The transactions are cryptographically hashed and stored on the leaf nodes of
    the tree as Ha,Hb,Hc and so on. The hash of the child nodes are concatenated and
    a new root hash is generated. The final root hash (e.g., H1 and H2 ) is stored
    on the blockchain. Just the root hash can be verified in order to make sure that
    all the transactions associated with that root hash are secure and have not been
    tampered with. Even if a single transaction is changed, all the hash values on
    that particular side of the tree will change. The ledger maintainer or the miner
    verifies the logs or transactions and generates a key that enables the latest
    transaction to become the part of complete ledger. This process makes the latest
    entries available to all the nodes in the network. Due to the presence of cryptographic
    hash keys in each block, it is too time-consuming and difficult for the adversaries
    to tamper with the blocks [109]. The miners do not have any personal interest
    in the transactions, and they are mining just to earn their incentives. The miners
    do not know the identity of the owners of the transactions. Over and above, there
    are multiple miners working on the same set of transactions, and there is a strong
    competition between them to add the transactions to the blockchain. All these
    unique features empower the blockchain to be a strong, tamper-proof, distributed
    and open data structure for IoT data [110]. Figure 5 shows the complete flow of
    a transaction from being initialized to being committed to the distributed chain.
    There are various platforms and frameworks being developed in academia and industry
    that support the creation and maintenance of blockchain. Some examples of such
    platforms are Ethereum, Hyperledger fabric, Ripple, etc. [111]. FIGURE 5. Working
    process of blockchain. Show All A. Permissioned and Permission-Less Blockchain
    There are two types of blockchain architectures based on the type of data being
    added and the nature of application using blockchain. In permission-less blockchain,
    there is no specific permission required for a user to become the part of the
    blockchain network or to become a miner. Anyone can join or leave this network
    of permission-less blockchain. The best example of permission-less blockchains
    is Bitcoin. Although the throughput of transactions is not very high, the permission-less
    blockchains can support a large number of nodes in the network. On the other hand,
    the permissioned blockchains have a defined set of rules to participate in the
    blockchain network. The miners are also the authorized persons and the blocks
    are allowed to be added to the chain only after their validation. The blockchain
    of Ripple and Hyperledger are two prime examples of permissioned blockchain. The
    permissioned concept of blockchain improves the overall throughput of transactions
    as compared to permission-less blockchains. Figure 6 shows the sample architecture
    of a blockchain and the way every block is connected to all the previous blocks
    based on cryptographic hashing. FIGURE 6. Basic blockchain architecture. Show
    All B. Benefits of Blockchain in IoT The usage of blockchain has many advantages
    in IoT applications. Table 4 gives a summary of some specific challenges in IoT
    security and their possible solutions using blockchain. Various security issues
    faced by IoT applications have already been discussed in Section III. The key
    benefits of using blockchain in IoT applications are discussed below. Data coming
    from IoT devices can be stored in Blockchain: The IoT applications include a large
    variety of devices connected to each other. These devices are further connected
    and controlled by other devices. This setup is further connected to the cloud
    to enable IoT applications to be used from any location. Due to this large space
    for data movement, blockchain is a promising solution to store the data and prevent
    it from being misused. Irrespective of the layer in an IoT application, blockchain
    can act as a suitable solution to store and transmit data. Distributed nature
    of blockchain allowing secure data storage: Since the blockchain architecture
    is distributed in nature, it can avoid the risk of being a single point of failure
    as is faced by various IoT applications based on the cloud. Irrespective of the
    distance between the devices, the data generated by them can be easily stored
    on the blockchain in a secure manner [112]. Data encryption using the hash key
    and verified by miners: In blockchain, only the 256-bit hash key for the data
    can be stored, rather than storing the actual data. The actual data can be stored
    on the cloud and the hash key can be mapped with the original data. If there is
    any change in the data, the hash of the data will change. This makes the data
    secure and private. The size of blockchain will also not get affected by the size
    of the data as only the hash values are stored in the chain. Only the intended
    parties, who are authorized to use that data can access the data from the cloud
    using the hash of the data. Every set of data being stored on blockchain is properly
    verified by different miners in the network, and therefore the probability of
    storing corrupt data from the devices reduces by using blockchain as a solution.
    Prevention from data loss and spoofing attacks: In spoofing attacks on IoT applications,
    a new adversary node enters into the IoT network and starts imitating to be the
    part of the original network. By spoofing, the adversary can easily capture, observe
    or inject data in the network. Blockchain acts as a promising solution to prevent
    such attacks. Each legitimate user or device is registered on blockchain, and
    devices can easily identify and authenticate each other without the need for central
    brokers or certification authorities [113]. Being low powered in nature, IoT devices
    inherit the risk of losing data. There might be cases where due to some external
    environmental issues the data is lost by both the sender and the receiver. Use
    of blockchain can prevent such losses as once the block is added in the chain
    there is no way to remove it [114]. Blockchain to prevent unauthorized access:
    Many IoT applications involve a lot of frequent communication between various
    nodes. The communication in blockchain takes place using the public and private
    keys, and therefore only the intended party or node can access the data. Even
    if the unintended party is able to access the data, the contents of the data will
    be incomprehensible as the data is encrypted with keys. Therefore, the blockchain
    data structure tries to handle various security issues faced by IoT applications.
    Proxy-based architecture in blockchain for resource-constrained devices: Although
    blockchain provides various security features for a distributed environment, IoT
    has a specific challenge of resource constraints. Being highly resource-constrained,
    IoT devices cannot store large ledgers. There have been various works in this
    direction to facilitate the use of blockchain in IoT. Proxy-based architecture
    is one of the promising solutions that can help IoT devices to use blockchain.
    Proxy servers can be deployed in the network, to store the resources in an encrypted
    form. The encrypted resources can be downloaded by the client from the proxy servers
    [115]. Elimination of centralized cloud servers: Blockchain can enhance the security
    of IoT systems because it ultimately eliminates the centralized cloud servers
    and makes the network peer-to-peer. Centralized cloud servers are the prime target
    of the data thieves. Using blockchain, the data will be distributed among all
    the nodes of the network and will be encrypted using a cryptographic hash function.
    TABLE 4 Challenges in IoT and Possible Blockchain Solution C. Merkle Tree Merkle
    tree is an add-on that can be added to the blockchain data structure to enhance
    the security of IoT devices. This can also help in reducing the overall number
    of blocks being added in the chain. A Merkle tree is like a binary tree where
    every node contains two child nodes except the leaf nodes. The leaf nodes contain
    the data or transactions, and the roots are the hash values of the data on the
    leaf nodes [116]. Based on the size of the tree, multiple transactions can be
    combined to generate a single root hash. Rather than treating each transaction
    as a block, each root hash can be considered as a block in the chain. This can
    help us in reducing the number of blocks. Also, due to multiple levels of hashing,
    at every level in the tree, the security of the data is enhanced [117]. IoT devices
    involve a lot of small communications among each other and therefore using Merkle
    tree along with blockchain can be a promising solution [118]. D. IOTA IOTA is
    another upcoming and highly promising solution to secure IoT. IOTA is also a DLT
    (Distributed Ledger Technology) as blockchain. IOTA is specially designed for
    resource-constrained IoT devices. Every incoming request in the network is required
    to validate the previous two requests. Using this process of cumulative validations,
    IOTA can provide a high level of security at the device or edge level. The tip
    selection algorithm is used for request verification. A cumulative weight is created
    for all requests. Higher the weight of a device in the network, more secure the
    device is. IOTA uses a tangle data structure as compared to the chain data structure
    in blockchain [119]. SECTION VI. IoT Security Using Fog Computing A. Evolution
    of Fog From Cloud IoT and cloud computing are two independent technologies which
    have many applications. IoT has provided users with a large number of smart devices
    and applications. Similarly, a cloud provides a very effective solution to store
    and manage data which can be accessed from anywhere and is widely used by many
    organizations. IoT is generating an unprecedented amount of data, which puts a
    lot of strain on the Internet infrastructure. The integration of cloud and IoT
    has introduced an era of new opportunities and challenges for processing, storing,
    managing and securing data more effectively. Industry and research groups have
    tried to solve some issues faced by the IoT by integrating it with the cloud.
    The benefits of this integration are not enough to address all the issues faced
    by IoT. Therefore, the concept of fog computing was introduced by Cisco in 2012.
    Fog computing complements cloud computing rather than replacing it. B. Fog Computing
    Architecture The main task of fog computing is to handle the data generated by
    IoT devices locally for better management and thus requires an architecture consisting
    of different layers. It has two frameworks that are Fog-Device framework and Fog-Cloud-Device
    framework [120]. The former framework consists of device and fog layer and the
    latter framework consists of device, fog and cloud layer. The arrangement of layers
    is done based on their storing and computational powers. The communication between
    different layers is done using wired (e.g., optical fiber, Ethernet) or wireless
    communication (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.). In Fog-Device framework, the fog
    nodes provide various services to a user without involving cloud servers. However,
    in Fog-Cloud-Device framework the simple decisions are taken at the fog layer,
    whereas, the complex decisions are taken on cloud [121]. The architecture of Fog-Cloud-Device
    framework is shown in Figure 7. The authors of [122] have considered the fog computing
    architecture theoretically and mathematically while comparing the performance
    of fog computing paradigm with traditional cloud computing framework based on
    service latency and energy consumption. Fog computing reduces the data traffic
    between cloud and network edge by 90% and average response time for a user by
    20% when compared with cloud-only model [123]. Authors in [124] have discussed
    the definition and concept of fog computing in-depth, comparing it with similar
    concepts such as mobile-edge computing (MEC) and mobile cloud computing (MCC).
    Authors in [124] have also introduced some applications like real-time video analytics
    and augmented reality (AR), mobile big data analytics, and content delivery and
    caching for fog computing. FIGURE 7. Fog computing architecture. Show All C. Advantages
    of Fog Over Cloud IoT devices generate large volumes of data every day. Moving
    this data to the cloud in real-time for analysis is not feasible. Therefore, the
    concept of fog computing has been developed. Figure 7 shows the placement and
    functionality of fog layer in an IoT application. Fog computing refers to extending
    cloud computing and its services to the edge of the network. Fog computing is
    a decentralized infrastructure for analysis of data and computing and can be used
    to store and process time-sensitive data efficiently and quickly. Its main goal
    is to enhance security, prevent data thefts, minimize the data stored on the cloud
    and to increase the overall efficiency of IoT applications. The latency in fog
    computation is less than cloud computation because the fog layer is placed much
    closer to the devices than the cloud. Only the selected and important data is
    sent to the cloud for long-term storage. Fog computing applications include smart
    vehicles, smart homes, smart agriculture, health-care, smart traffic lights, smart
    retail, software-defined networks, etc. Sending the immense amount of data generated
    by IoT devices to the cloud for processing and analyzing would be costly and time-consuming.
    Along with minimizing network bandwidth requirements, fog computing also reduces
    the frequency of two-way communication between IoT devices and the cloud [125].
    In fog architecture, the data is collected at devices called fog nodes which can
    analyze 40 percent of it [126]. It offloads traffic from the core network minimizing
    the latency of IoT devices. A fog node can be any device like a router, switch,
    or a video surveillance camera which has computing, storage, and network connectivity.
    These fog nodes can be installed anywhere like on a factory floor or in a vehicle,
    provided it has a network connection. Data is directed to the fog node, aggregation
    node or cloud based on its time-sensitivity. Fog nodes make the communication
    in IoT application secure by providing cryptographic computations. Mere sensors
    and IoT devices do not always have the necessary inbuilt resources for that purpose
    [127]. D. Solutions Provided by Fog Computing to Overcome IoT Security Threats
    In regard to the attacks discussed in Section III, the solution that fog computing
    provides or can provide to overcome those security threats are discussed below.
    Man-in-the-middle attack: Fog acts as a security layer between end-user and cloud
    or IoT system. All threats or attacks on the IoT systems need to pass through
    the fog layer in between, and this layer can identify and mitigate unusual activities
    before they are passed to the system. Data transit attacks: Data storage and management
    is much better if performed on the secure fog nodes, as compared to the IoT devices.
    Data will be better protected if it is stored on the fog nodes as compared to
    storing the data on the end-user devices. Fog nodes also help in making the user
    data more available. Eavesdropping: Using fog nodes, the communication takes place
    between the end-user and the fog node only, rather than routing the information
    through the entire network. The chances of an adversary trying to eavesdrop reduces
    a lot because the traffic on the network is reduced. Resource-constraint issues:
    Most of the IoT devices are resource constrained and the attackers take advantage
    of this fact. They try to damage the edge devices and use them as the weak links
    to enter the system. Fog nodes can support the edge devices and can prevent them
    from being affected by such attacks. A nearby fog node can perform the more sophisticated
    security functions necessary for protection. Incident response services: Fog nodes
    can be programmed to provide real-time incident response services. Fog nodes can
    generate a flag to the IoT system or the end users as soon as they encounter a
    suspicious data or request. Fog computing allows for malware detection and problem
    resolution in transit. In many critical applications, it might not be possible
    to stop the entire system to resolve malware incidences. Fog nodes can help in
    such resolutions while the system is up and running. E. Security Challenges and
    Solutions in Fog Layer Although fog layer provides various features and security
    aspects for IoT applications, the movement of data and computation to fog layer
    creates new vulnerabilities [120]. Therefore, before implementing fog-assisted
    IoT applications, these security and privacy goals of fog computing are required
    to be studied. In this section, various features provided by fog layer, privacy
    and security challenges faced, and proposed solutions to overcome them are discussed.
    Table 5 summarizes these issues and proposed solutions. Real-Time Services: Fog
    computing tends to provide a near real-time service in the IoT systems by performing
    computation near the data generation points. Intrusion detection: Policy violations
    and malicious activities on fog nodes and IoT devices will not be discovered if
    no proper intrusion detection mechanism is implemented. The attacks might not
    impact the whole architecture of fog computing, but the attacker can control the
    local services. Attacks targeting local services can be detected by fog nodes
    by collaborating with their adjacent nodes. By observing program behavior and
    host file systems, the attack on the cloud can be detected [163]. Identity authentication:
    There are various entities involved in the process of offering and accessing real-time
    services like fog nodes, service providers and users. Trusting all the entities
    involved is an arduous task, and creates security challenges for IoT services
    and user’s data. Accessibility of services should be given only to authentic and
    credible users; otherwise, attackers may compromise the server and exploit services
    and user privacy. Therefore, to prevent attackers from illegitimately accessing
    services, identity authentication mechanisms are needed. To provide secure services,
    some efficient identity authentication mechanisms have been proposed in the past
    [146]–[149], [164], [165]. Transient Storage: Users can store and maintain their
    data on fog nodes temporarily with the help of transient storage. On the one hand,
    it helps in managing data easily on local storage, but on the other hand, it creates
    new challenges and security issues, especially for maintaining data privacy. Identifying
    and protecting sensitive data: Data stored in IoT devices may include social events,
    traffic conditions, personal activities, temperature and so on. Some of the data
    might be personal or sensitive while some data may be made public. Furthermore,
    for different users, the same data has different security levels. Therefore, it
    is important to identify and protect the sensitive data from the large volume
    of information. Sharing data securely: To provide security, data uploaded on fog
    nodes is first encrypted. No one other than its owner can read that data once
    it is encrypted. This creates a problem for data sharing. To overcome this challenge,
    some cryptographic techniques such as key-aggregate encryption, proxy re-encryption,
    and attribute-sharing, have been proposed in [166]. Data Dissemination: The data
    cannot be transferred to the fog node without encryption, due to security issues.
    Due to this movement of encrypted data to the fog node, many desirable features
    are sacrificed such as sharing, searching, and aggregation. Searching data securely:
    As discussed in transient storage, data is encrypted before uploading. However,
    once it is encrypted, searching or retrieving on the ciphertext becomes difficult
    for owners as well as other entities. In order to retrieve the information from
    encrypted text, search-able encryption and its privacy levels are defined in [145].
    A dynamic symmetric search-able scheme is introduced in [167]. Data aggregation:
    Fog nodes might need to aggregate the data in certain cases to prevent data leakage
    and reduce communication overhead. It is important to develop secure aggregation
    algorithms to prevent data thefts. Various homomorphic encryption schemes, such
    as BGN encryption [168] and Paillier encryption [169], have been proposed to achieve
    secure data aggregation. Decentralized Computation: The data stored on the fog
    nodes can be processed and analyzed for better results. However, such computations
    have several threats and risks associated with them. For example, attackers can
    not only control the analyzed results, but can also expose processed data. Server-aided
    computation: Tasks which cannot be executed by IoT devices themselves are computed
    with the help of fog nodes. However, this can lead to exposure of data to attackers,
    if the fog nodes which received data from IoT are already compromised. Server-aided
    computation is one such method whose aim is to provide secure computation [131].
    Verifiable computation: Users rely on the fog nodes to compute their data. There
    must be a secure mechanism to verify the computation results coming from the fog
    node. Authors in [170], [171] have proposed certain multi-user mechanisms that
    help with verifiable computation. TABLE 5 Characteristics and Solutions Provided
    by Fog Computing SECTION VII. IoT Security Using Machine Learning The area of
    machine learning (ML) has attracted significant interest over recent years. Many
    domains are using ML for their development, and it is being used for IoT security
    as well. ML appears to be a promising solution to protect IoT devices against
    cyber attacks by providing a different approach for defending against attacks
    as compared to other traditional methods. A. Solutions Provided by ML to Overcome
    Security Threats In regard to the attacks discussed in Section III, the solutions
    provided by ML to overcome these security threats are discussed below. DoS Attack:
    DoS attacks on IoT devices or originating from IoT devices are a serious concern.
    One approach to prevent such attacks is to use a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
    based protocol that secures networks against DoS attacks [172]. The authors of
    [173] have proposed a particle swarm optimization and back propagation algorithm
    to train a MLP that helps in enhancing the security of wireless networks. ML techniques
    help in increasing the deduction accuracy and securing IoT devices vulnerable
    to DoS attacks. Eavesdropping: Attackers may eavesdrop on messages during data
    transmission. To provide protection from such attacks, ML techniques such as Q-learning
    based offloading strategy [174] or non-parametric Bayesian techniques [175] can
    be used. Schemes such as Q-learning and Dyna-Q are ML techniques that may also
    be used to protect devices from eavesdropping. Evaluation of these schemes via
    experiments and reinforcement learning is presented in [176]. Spoofing: Attacks
    from spoofers can be avoided by using Q-learning [176], Dyna-Q [176], Support
    Vector Machines (SVM) [177], Deep Neural Network (DNN) model [178], incremental
    aggregated gradient (IAG) [46], and distributed FrankWolfe (dFW) [179] techniques.
    These techniques not only increase the detection accuracy and classification accuracy
    but also help in reducing the average error rate and false alarm rate. Privacy
    Leakage: Collection of personal information such as health data, location, or
    photos puts the user’s privacy at stake. Privacy-preserving scientific computations
    (PPSC) [180] should be employed for preventing privacy leakage. A commodity integrity
    detection algorithm (CIDA) which is based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT)
    is another technique that has been proposed to develop IoT application trust [181].
    Digital Fingerprinting: Digital fingerprinting is one of the upcoming and promising
    solutions to secure IoT systems and to help the end users gain sufficient trust
    in the applications. Fingerprints are being widely used to unlock smartphones,
    approve payments, unlock the car and home doors, etc. Due to its low cost, reliability,
    acceptability and high-security level, digital fingerprinting is emerging as a
    dominant bio-metric identification method [182]. Apart from the benefits of digital
    fingerprinting, there are various challenges to efficiently use this technique
    in IoT, such as fingerprint classification, image enhancement, feature matching,
    etc. Various machine learning based algorithms have been developed to provide
    some non-traditional solutions to overcome these challenges [183], some of which
    are discussed below. Support Vector Machine: SVM is a training algorithm for non-linear
    and linear classifications, principal component analysis, text categorization,
    speaker identification, and regression. It maximizes the gap between the decision
    boundary and training patterns. Authors of [184] have discussed the use of SVM
    in digital fingerprinting in detail. They have also compared it with other traditional
    models. A feature vector is built based on pixel values of the fingerprint, and
    it is used to train the SVM. Various patterns behind the fingerprint are analyzed,
    and then the matching of a fingerprint is done based on patterns identified. Artificial
    Neural Networks: ANN is one of the most commonly used algorithms in the machine
    learning. It offers many advantages like fault tolerance, adaptive learning, and
    generalization. In [185] a framework has been proposed for using ANN to identify
    fingerprints digitally. The digital values of various features in the fingerprint
    like minutiae, ridge ending, and bifurcation is applied as the input to the neural
    network for training purpose using back propagation algorithm of ANN. The verification
    of the fingerprint is done based on the previous experiential values stored in
    the database. The fundamental need in IoT is to secure all the systems and devices
    that are connected to the network. The role of ML is to use and train algorithms
    to detect anomalies in IoT devices or to detect any unwanted activity taking place
    in IoT system to prevent data loss or other issues. Therefore, ML provides a promising
    platform to overcome the difficulties faced in securing IoT devices. Further contributions
    in this field are required to maintain the growth of IoT. SECTION VIII. IoT Security
    Using Edge Computing Edge and fog computing are both extensions of cloud computing
    which is widely used by various organizations. Cloud, fog and edge may appear
    similar but they constitute different layers of IoT applications. The main difference
    between cloud, fog and edge computing is the location of intelligence and power
    computation. The cloud is deployed at a much larger scale that needs to process
    huge amount of data and is situated at comparatively more distance from its users
    [186]. To overcome the problems faced by cloud computing, edge computing is used
    as a solution where a small edge server is placed between the user and the cloud/fog.
    Some processing activity is performed at the edge server, rather than the cloud.
    Edge computing architecture consists of edge devices, cloud server and fog nodes
    as shown in Figure 8 [187]. FIGURE 8. Edge computing architecture. Show All In
    an edge computing framework the computation and analysis power is provided at
    the edge itself. The devices in an application can create a network among themselves
    and can cooperate among each other to compute the data [63]. Consequently, a lot
    of data can be saved from going outside the device, either to cloud or to fog
    nodes, and this can enhance the security of the IoT application. Edge computing
    also helps in providing low communication cost by preventing the need of moving
    all the data to the cloud [66]. A. Using Edge Computing to Secure and Improve
    IoT In regard to the attacks discussed in Section III, the solutions that edge
    computing provides or can provide to overcome these security threats are discussed
    below. Data Breaches: In edge computing, all the data is stored and processed
    within the device or local network. There is no movement of the data from the
    data originator to the processor. This prevents the data from being in transit
    and thereby prevents the risk of data thefts and data breaches. In fog computing
    there is some movement of data from a device to fog layer and adversaries can
    take advantage of this movement [188]. Data Compliance Issues: Many countries
    have strict regulatory acts to prevent data movement outside their boundaries,
    e.g., European Union’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Using edge computing,
    organizations can keep the data within their borders and ensure compliance with
    data sovereignity laws [189]. Safety Issues: With the increase in the deployment
    of cyber-physical systems, security and safety are considered as integral issues.
    If there is even a little delay in responses, then that may lead to physical safety
    issues. For example, if the sensors in a car predict that a crash is about to
    happen, then the airbags have to be deployed immediately. If the sensors completely
    rely on sending all the data to the cloud and waiting for the response from the
    cloud to perform any action, then that may be too late to prevent injuries or
    loss of life. Surveillance cameras can also be empowered using edge computing
    and they can themselves analyze the anomalies and can send the summarized and
    suspected data to the data centers to achieve faster response times. Bandwidth
    Issues: IoT application generate a lot of data at very high rate. Most of this
    data is raw and of relatively low-value. Sending all the data to the cloud involves
    a lot of bandwidth cost as well, along with the security challenges of data movement.
    If edge computing is used, then a lot of data cleaning and aggregation can be
    done at the edge nodes and only the summarized data, if required, needs to be
    sent to the cloud [190]. B. Challenges in Edge Layer Although edge computing provides
    various features to increase the security and performance of IoT applications,
    there are various challenges associate with completely relying on the edge layer
    for all computation. Edge devices include sensors, RFID devices, actuators, tags,
    and embedded devices. The edge layer is highly susceptible to attacks in an IoT
    system. If the edge layer is compromised, then the entire system may be compromised.
    MQTT and COAP are the most popular protocols for the edge layer. Both these protocols
    do not use any security layer by default. Although the option to add an optional
    security layer in the form of TLS for MQTT and DTLS for COAP is present, it creates
    additional overhead in terms of processing and bandwidth. Issues specific to edge
    devices include sleep deprivation attacks, battery draining attacks, and outage
    attacks. Edge devices are typically resource constrained, and the most important
    resource they rely upon is the battery backup. The foremost and easiest way to
    attack the edge devices is to somehow deplete the battery of an edge device. For
    example, an attacker might force the edge device to do some power hungry or infinite
    loop computation [191]. The process of striking a balance between storing and
    processing data on edge or cloud is very important. Keeping too much data on edge
    may also lead to overwhelming of the edge devices and may impact the entire application.
    SECTION IX. Open Issues, Challenges, and Future Research Directions There are
    some performance and security issues in the use of blockchain, fog computing,
    edge computing and machine learning for IoT security that are yet to be solved.
    This section discusses some of these issues. The security of blockchain depends
    on its method of implementation and the use of software and hardware in that implementation.
    Since all the transactions made by users in blockchain are public, there is a
    possibility that private information of users can be revealed. Also, as the number
    of miners increases, the size of blockchain also increases continuously. This
    increases the cost of storage and reduces the speed of distribution over the whole
    network, giving rise to issues like scalability and availability of blockchain
    [192]. Since fog computing is a nontrivial extension of cloud computing, some
    of the issues such as security and privacy will continue to persist [120]. Therefore,
    before implementing fog-assisted IoT applications, these security and privacy
    goals of fog computing are required to be studied. Some of the challenges and
    research issues on security and privacy in IoT environments and the solutions
    provided by fog computing are discussed in [127]. There are many machine learning
    algorithms in existence. Therefore, it is imperative to select a proper algorithm
    suitable for the application. Selecting a wrong algorithm would result in producing
    “garbage” output and will lead to loss of effort, effectiveness and accuracy.
    Similarly, choosing the wrong data set will lead to “garbage” input producing
    incorrect results. The success of a machine learning solution depends on these
    factors as well as diversity in selecting data. If the data is not clustered and
    classified, the prediction accuracy will be lower. Also, the historical data may
    contain many ambiguous values, outliers, missing values, and meaningless data.
    IoT applications are creating a huge amount of data, and therefore it is a difficult
    task to clean and preprocess that data accurately. Various features like attribute
    creation, linear regression, multiple regression, removing redundancies and compressing
    data are required to effectively use machine learning for securing the IoT. In
    case of edge computing, data security and user privacy are the main concerns.
    An user’s private data can be leaked and misused if a house that is deployed with
    IoT devices is subjected to cyber attacks. For example, a person’s presence or
    absence at home can be revealed simply by observing the electricity or water usage
    data. Since the data is computed at the edge of data resource (e.g., home), therefore,
    the user has to be aware of some of the measures like securing WiFi connections.
    Secondly, data at edge should be owned fully by the user, and he/she should have
    control on which data to be shared. Some of the future research directions in
    this field are: The edge devices are most resource constrained devices in the
    IoT and are therefore uniquely vulnerable to attacks. Penetration studies show
    that while it takes very little power to implement best practice security for
    the edge nodes, they are still highly vulnerable to a variety of malicious attacks.
    The gateways between different layers in the IoT system need to be secured. Gateways
    provide an easy entry point for the attackers into the IoT system. End to end
    encryption, rather than specific encryption techniques for specific protocols
    would be a promising solution to secure the data passing through the gateways.
    The data should be decrypted only at the intended destination and not at the gateways
    for protocol translation. Inter-fog sharing of resources is one of the areas where
    further work needs to be done. As of now, when the fog layer is unable to process
    the requests due to heavy load, the requests are forwarded to the cloud. There
    can be resource sharing between neighboring fog layers to prevent unwanted requests
    to be transferred to the cloud. The current blockchain architecture is highly
    limited in terms of the number of nodes in permissioned networks and in terms
    of throughput in permissionless networks. Various consensus algorithms are being
    designed to support high throughput along with a large number of nodes or users.
    Fog layer can be made more intelligent using various ML and AI techniques. Fog
    layer must be able to decide the duration for which the data in the fog should
    be retained and when the data should be discarded or shifted to the cloud for
    prolonged storage. More efficient and reliable consensus mechanisms can be designed
    to reach consensus among the nodes along with preventing rampant use of computation
    power. The current consensus algorithms are highly resource hungry and less efficient.
    The tamper-proof feature of blockchain is ending up into a collection of a lot
    of garbage data and addresses. There is a lot of invalid data that is never deleted
    like the addresses of the destructed smart contracts. This affects the performance
    of the overall application and better ways need to be designed to efficiently
    handle the garbage data in the blockchain. Data analysis in near real-time and
    in the proximity of the IoT node is crucial for successful deployment of IoT applications.
    Various ML-based algorithms can be designed to analyze the data in the node itself
    to prevent the data transit for analysis. This can further enhance the security
    of the application by preventing data movement. SECTION X. Conclusion In this
    survey, we have presented various security threats at different layers of an IoT
    application. We have covered the issues related to the sensing layer, network
    layer, middleware layer, gateways, and application layer. We have also discussed

    decision-making, and reduce reliance on cloud connectivity in automated irrigation
    management systems because they reduce the computational burden of cloud. The
    main goal of fog computing is to conserve energy and bandwidth, which helps to
    increase the quality of service to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture
    of the Fog of Everything was presented, which was comprised of six layers.

    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the most common\
    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\
    \ 3 explains the spectral\nimage-based remote sensing techniques, platforms and\
    \ vegetation indices; Section 4 describes remote\nsensing applications in the\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    Camera\n3.2. Vegetation Indices\nUsing multi-spectral images from the remote sensors\
    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    N\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n16 of 25\n5. A Case Study on UAV-Based and IoT-Based\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n19 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\nFigure 6. (A) Correlation b/wair temperature\
    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    \ (A.R.O.)\nAbstract: With the implementation of the Internet of Things, the agricultural\
    \ domain has become\ndata-driven, allowing for well-timed and cost-effective farm\
    \ management while remaining envi-\nronmentally sustainable. Thus, the incorporation\
    \ of Internet of Things in the agricultural domain\nis the need of the hour for\
    \ developing countries whose gross domestic product primarily depends\non the\
    \ farming sector. It is worth highlighting that developing nations lack the infrastructure\
    \ for\nprecision agriculture; therefore, it has become necessary to come up with\
    \ a methodological paradigm\nwhich can accommodate a complete model to connect\
    \ ground sensors to the compute nodes in a\ncost-effective way by keeping the\
    \ data processing limitations and constraints in consideration. In\nthis regard,\
    \ this review puts forward an overview of the state-of-the-art technologies deployed\
    \ in\nprecision agriculture for soil assessment and pollutant monitoring with\
    \ respect to heavy metal in\nagricultural soil using various sensors. Secondly,\
    \ this manuscript illustrates the processing of data\ngenerated from the sensors.\
    \ In this regard, an optimized method of data processing derived from\ncloud computing\
    \ has been shown, which is called edge computing. In addition to this, a new model\n\
    of high-performance-based edge computing is also shown for efﬁcient ofﬂoading\
    \ of data with smooth\nworkﬂow optimization. In a nutshell, this manuscript aims\
    \ to open a new corridor for the farming\nsector in developing nations by tackling\
    \ challenges and providing substantial consideration.\nKeywords: food security;\
    \ precision agriculture; Internet of Things; soil moisture; heavy metal;\nwireless\
    \ sensors; edge computing\n1. Introduction\nThe agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries has multiple challenges, i.e., if we\nlook at the production side,\
    \ the ﬁrst challenge which the farmer faces is the productivity\nchallenge, as\
    \ it becomes evident that developing countries are very low in productivity,\n\
    i.e., for any crop, the particular developing country could be the highest producer\
    \ but\nat the same time its productivity could be very low. Therefore, crop productivity\
    \ is a\nsigniﬁcant factor which has to be looked at. The second challenge which\
    \ the farmer faces is\nwith respect to climate change, industrial pollution, and\
    \ pest attacks, as they can damage\ncrops substantially. It is deemed necessary\
    \ for the farmer to mitigate those challenges by\nadapting to the latest technologies\
    \ and insurance schemes. The third challenge is related to\nmarket connectivity,\
    \ whereby the farmer produces crops and thus needs to be connected\nto distant\
    \ markets as per the crop production analysis and its subsequent data insights.\n\
    It is essential for the farmers to have all the information on a digital platform\
    \ and there\nshould be seamless trade between different markets and different\
    \ places. However, this\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11060475\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n2 of 37\n\
    connection between farmers and the distant market is nowhere to be seen in developing\n\
    countries. On the other hand, the industry is looking up for exports, which in\
    \ turn need to\nbe streamlined substantially. From the economic perspective of\
    \ the developing country, it is\na boon if more facility in nature and regulatory\
    \ support has to be given for people who are\nlooking to export outside their\
    \ country or who are looking to have a value-added product\nacross the globe.\
    \ Now, this mismanagement in the agricultural sector can potentially lead\nto\
    \ food security risk.\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is intended to help and maximize\
    \ the development of the\nfarming sector and will also help to ensure food security\
    \ [1]. It is to be highlighted that\nPA is a high-tech farming technology that\
    \ observes, measures, and analyzes farming ﬁelds\nand crops. With the advent of\
    \ PA, on-ﬁeld sensors can provide detailed levels of data\nfor problems of soil\
    \ and weather conditions pertaining to heavy metal toxics and climate\nchange.\
    \ Big data obtained from sensor networks and farm inputs tracking have a signiﬁcant\n\
    role to play to increase farm productivity, reduce environmental impacts, and\
    \ improve\nhuman welfare [2]. By combining artiﬁcial intelligence-based big data\
    \ analytics with sensor\nand image data, an integrated system could be developed\
    \ for the agricultural domain.\nImplementing intensive, high-value, personalized\
    \ management of crops would increase\nboth production and economic performance.\
    \ The aim of this paper is to highlight the\nimportance of smart sensors and high-performance\
    \ computing in protecting stakeholders\nin the agrifood value chain and providing\
    \ them with unlimited access to a large dataset of\nvarious categories in order\
    \ to track their farms. The challenges and consideration for the\nfarming sector\
    \ in developing countries are also highlighted. Figure 1 shows the number of\n\
    articles reviewed in various domains in the proposed manuscript.\nFigure 1. Distribution\
    \ of reviewed articles.\nThe structure of the paper is arranged as follows: The\
    \ ﬁrst section of the paper explains\nthe paper’s scope and the reasoning for\
    \ the proposed study. Section 2 gives an overview of\nfood security by taking\
    \ into consideration the pollution caused by persistent toxics and\nheavy metal.\
    \ In addition to this, Section 2 also highlights the importance of smart farming\n\
    based on IoT. Section 3 gives a detailed overview of the wireless communication\
    \ protocols\nand sensors used in the agricultural domain. Furthermore, Section\
    \ 3 also emphasizes\nthe importance of edge computing and also highlights the\
    \ model of High Performance\nComputing (HPC) on Edge. In addition, Section 3 also\
    \ details the various edge computing\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n3 of 37\nmethodologies\
    \ used by previous researchers in precision agriculture. Section 4 highlights\n\
    the current challenges and considerations for the agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries.\nFinally, Section 5 presents the conclusion of the proposed review.\n\
    2. Food Security: A Global Challenge in View of Soil Pollutants and Heavy\nMetal\
    \ Toxicants\nOver the next 35 years, the world’s growing population will demand\
    \ more food\nthan mankind has ever produced. However, food security faces a variety\
    \ of issues on\nboth the development and consumption sides, which would necessitate\
    \ further study\nin order to formulate a solution. The food system, on its current\
    \ course, would likely\nabsorb much of the remaining carbon budget if the temperature\
    \ rises by 2 ◦C by the year\n2050 [3]. As a result, it would leave no room for\
    \ other industries, making reaching the\nParis Agreement virtually impossible.\
    \ Due to severe weather conditions, climate change of\nthis magnitude would alter\
    \ what can be grown and worn, as well as the dynamics of pest\nand disease spread.\
    \ Food production shocks will occur, eventually leading to higher food\nprices\
    \ and civil unrest. Agriculture is important, but it consumes 70% of all freshwater,\n\
    resulting in one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity\
    \ and soil\ndepletion [4,5]. Finding new ways to sustainably produce more food\
    \ on available land will\nbe crucial as agricultural land becomes scarce. This\
    \ necessitates substantial assessment of\nagricultural soil monitoring and mitigating\
    \ the heavy metal pollutants and other toxics\nfrom the soil.\nHeavy metal contamination\
    \ is widely spread across the world, disrupting the at-\nmosphere and thereby\
    \ showing signiﬁcant threats to human health. The reason behind\nheavy metal contamination,\
    \ in general, is the rapid speed of urbanization along with\nindustrialization\
    \ and noticeable land use change in fast-moving developing nations such\nas China\
    \ and India. Post-Industrial Revolution and economic globalization, there has\n\
    been an unprecedented rise in the variety of environmental pollutants, with innumerable\n\
    anthropogenic sources. Therefore, this continuously evolving issue pertaining\
    \ to food\nsecurity has become a serious concern for the world, speciﬁcally its\
    \ inextricable relation to\nthe health of human beings [6,7].\nSeveral dangerous\
    \ heavy metals and metalloids comprising arsenic, cadmium, lead,\nand mercury\
    \ are categorized as non-essential for metabolism. These metals are considered\n\
    to be deleterious in different ways [8,9] and have thus been listed in the top\
    \ 20 list of\nhazardous substances by the United States Environmental Protection\
    \ Agency and the\nRadioactive Substances and Disease Registry Agency (ATSDR) [9,10].\
    \ With respect to\nmetabolic process, heavy metals, like Fe, Zn, Cr (III), and\
    \ Cu are considered to be essential\ncomponents along with enzymes and cytochromes,\
    \ which are inextricably connected to\nthe biota metabolic functioning [9,11].\
    \ With regard to urease, nickel is considered to be an\nimportant component; however,\
    \ it may pose an unnecessary risk to human health [12,13].\nTherefore, with respect\
    \ to the above context, soil–food crops and vegetation ecosystem is a\nwell-laid-out\
    \ example of abiotic–biotic interactions.\nHeavy metal pollution generated from\
    \ energy intensive industries poses a serious\nthreat to the sustenance of soil.\
    \ Apart from the ill effects on human health, heavy metal\nalso puts an adverse\
    \ impact on soil biota through soil microbe interaction and microbial\nprocesses\
    \ [9,14,15]. It also hampers the ecosystem when it comes to beneﬁcial soil in-\n\
    sects [16–18]. It is worth noting that medicinal plants can be used for bioaccumulation\
    \ of\nheavy metals. A prominent example of such a case is the “Paeonia Ostii”\
    \ Chinese medicinal\nplant [19]. Numerous medicinal plants are demonstrated to\
    \ bioaccumulate various heavy\nmetals, i.e., As, Cd, Fe, Pb, Cr, and Cu when grown\
    \ near industrial zones [9,20–23]. It is also\nessential to note that, even in\
    \ the greenhouse ecosystem, vegetation is susceptible to heavy\nmetal such as\
    \ Zn, Pb, Mn, Cu, and Cd due to decreased exposure to illumination [24].\nFor\
    \ a successful technological remedy, it is essential to understand the soil–food\
    \ crop\ntransfer mechanisms. In order to achieve this purpose, this analysis ﬁrst\
    \ discusses the\ndifferent causes of heavy metal contamination in the soil ecosystem\
    \ and its relevance to the\nhealth of human beings. In general, this type of analysis\
    \ gives an overall layout pertaining\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n4 of 37\nto heavy\
    \ metal sources within the agricultural domain which in turn is correlated to\n\
    anthropogenic inﬂuences. It also helps us to provide state-of-the-art information\
    \ regarding\nthe global scenario of heavy metal pollution spanning across different\
    \ continents in the\nagricultural domain. In this regard, the next subsection\
    \ elaborates on the heavy metal\nsources in the soil–crop ecosystem.\n2.1. Heavy\
    \ Metal Sources in Soil–Crop Ecosystems\nIt is evident from numerous studies that\
    \ the source of heavy metals in the agricultural\necosystem is due to industrial\
    \ pollution, sewage sludge, phosphate-based fertilizers, metal\npesticides, and\
    \ contaminated water [9,25–29]. In addition to the mentioned sources of heavy\n\
    metal pollution, it is also essential to understand the impact of anthropogenic\
    \ pollutants, as\nthey pose a risk to the health of human beings through dietary\
    \ intake of contaminated food\ncrops which become polluted either through soil\
    \ or direct atmospheric deposition over the\nsurface of plant leaves [17,30].\
    \ Waste efﬂuents discharged from industries and automobiles\naccumulate in soil,\
    \ thereby causing contamination in the food chains [9,31,32]. It is also\nworth\
    \ noting that coal-based power plants pose a signiﬁcant threat with respect to\
    \ Hg soil\npollution. In this regard, Li et al. [24,33] stated the adverse effect\
    \ on human health caused\nby consuming lettuce and water spinach grown in Hg-contaminated\
    \ soil area. Likewise,\nmany strong sources present a grim outlook for global\
    \ food safety. Figure 2 shows the\necosystem of heavy metal contamination. Heavy\
    \ metals emitted from automobile and\nindustrial smelters are transported to distant\
    \ locations, i.e., up to several kilometers away\nfrom their sources by wet or\
    \ dry deposition [34]. These metals accumulate in plant leaves\nthrough foliar\
    \ transmission after the deposition of atmospheric particles above the surface\n\
    of the leaf [34]. Fernandez and Eichert [35] proposed that particles can penetrate\
    \ the\nleaf tissue through the pores present on the leaf cuticle and inside stomata.\
    \ Similar to\nroot uptake, foliar uptake of heavy metals may also arise in a dose-dependent\
    \ manner.\nNonetheless, one of the leading contributors of heavy metal penetration\
    \ in agricultural soil\nalso comes from sewage and sludge pollution.\nFigure 2.\
    \ Ecosystem of heavy metal contamination.\nTo address the concern of rising wastewater\
    \ produced from domestic and industrial\nprocesses as a result of the growing\
    \ human population, a reliable strategy and stable\ntreatment systems are urgently\
    \ needed. With the rapid growth of agriculture in the past\ndecade, overuse of\
    \ water resources, especially for agriculture, has become a problematic\nissue\
    \ which threatens to intensify the effects of climate change. Agriculture constitutes\
    \ by\nfar the largest use of water in all countries [36]. In order to solve this\
    \ problem, it has been\nfound that wastewater reuse is a feasible option to minimize\
    \ anthropogenic impact [37].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n5 of 37\nFurthermore,\
    \ raw wastewater reuse in agriculture is a valuable tool for developing coun-\n\
    tries to minimize usage of freshwater while also addressing the challenge of rising\
    \ food\nproduction in water-scarce areas. The beneﬁts of reusing water in agriculture\
    \ are numerous\nand unquestionable, i.e., it saves signiﬁcant quantities of freshwater\
    \ which may be assigned\nfor other essential purposes; it provides nutrients that\
    \ may replace chemical fertilizers,\nthus helping to increase soil fertility and\
    \ crop yield and reduce production costs; it allows\nfor the expansion of agricultural\
    \ land in dry areas; it is a relatively cheap disposal method\nfor raw wastewater;\
    \ and it can help to prevent contamination of surface water. In addition,\nit\
    \ has been demonstrated that the health risks associated with raw wastewater usage\
    \ in\nagriculture are satisfactory if its biological content meets speciﬁed standards\
    \ [38,39].\nHaving elaborated on the positive side of raw wastewater, there are\
    \ also possible nega-\ntive effects, such as soil salinization and groundwater\
    \ contamination of metals and organic\ncompounds. It should be noted that these\
    \ are only theoretical at this point. Furthermore,\nthe use of untreated water\
    \ for agricultural production is potentially dangerous due to its\nmicrobial substance,\
    \ especially bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which can cause a number\nof diseases\
    \ because many of them can be sustained for longer periods in the environment.\n\
    This in turn tends to affect the quality of the soil.\nIt is crucial that farmers\
    \ aim to keep the quality of their soil high in order to pre-\nserve the health\
    \ of their soil species. Soil microbes are an important component of the\necosystem\
    \ [40]. Soil fertility depends in part on the breakdown of organic matter and\n\
    the ﬂow of nutrients through the ecosystem. When they are subjected to stresses\
    \ like\nextreme temperature, pH, salinity, and chemical pollution, they are able\
    \ to negatively affect\nproductivity [41–43]. Owing to the variety of anthropogenic\
    \ activities, soil may become\npolluted with a variety of heavy metals from manufacturing\
    \ and mining. Many forms of\ncontaminants, i.e., from mine waste, sewage sludge,\
    \ chemical fertilizer, and pesticides can\nend up in the soil system and adversely\
    \ affect soil microbes [43]. As another alternative,\nvegetables produced in greenhouses\
    \ also become polluted by heavy metals, often from\nanthropogenic sources. Within\
    \ the source, detection of heavy metals can be performed\nusing sophisticated\
    \ statistical and geospatial methods [9,44–47]. Greenhouse vegetables\nin China\
    \ were more susceptible to Cd pollution than crops in open farmland [48,49]. The\n\
    results of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that As, Ni, and\
    \ Cr are\nprimarily discharged from weathered rocks, while metallic pollutants\
    \ such as Hg and Pb\nare generated by industry, vehicle fumes, and reuse of wastewater\
    \ for irrigation [48,49].\nNonetheless, it is worth noting that PCA has been used\
    \ by several researchers in various\nagricultural domains for the assessment of\
    \ soil heavy metal pollutants [50–53].\nIdentifying soil pollutants and their\
    \ origins is important to research due to their close\nties to human health [54–56].\
    \ In this regard, it has become deemed necessary to come up\nwith tools and techniques\
    \ which can monitor heavy metal composition in the soil which can\nbe incorporated\
    \ into the smart farming ecosystem. Smart farming is considered to be the\nnext\
    \ key segment in the agriculture sector as it has changed the methodological paradigm\n\
    of how farmers operate on ﬁelds. The following subsection highlights the overview\
    \ of\nsmart farming and its beneﬁts.\n2.2. Smart Farming Initiatives Is the Need\
    \ of the Hour\nWith the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), smart devices have\
    \ reached into all facets\nof our day-to-day life, i.e., healthcare and wellness,\
    \ smart homes, automobile and logistics,\nintelligent cities and industries. In\
    \ recent decades, agriculture has seen a series of techno-\nlogical changes, increasingly\
    \ industrialized and technologically driven. Through different\nagriculture-based\
    \ smart devices, farmers today now have greater control over animal\nhusbandry\
    \ and cultivation processes, making them more predictable and productive. This,\n\
    along with the rising market demand for agricultural products, has helped to increase\
    \ the\nworldwide proliferation of intelligent agriculture technologies. It is\
    \ worth noting that for\nthe year 2020, IoT’s agricultural market share reached\
    \ $5.6 billion [57].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n6 of 37\nModern agriculture can\
    \ be addressed in several respects. For instance, AgriTech\nrefers to the use\
    \ of technology in the domain of agriculture [58]. In addition, intelligent\n\
    agriculture is primarily used to describe the use of IoT-based agricultural solutions.\
    \ With\nIoT sensors, farmers can make informed decisions and develop various parameters\
    \ of their\nwork, i.e., cattle to crop production, in order to collect environmental\
    \ and machine metrics.\nFor example, farmers can decide exactly how much pesticide\
    \ and fertilizer is to be utilized\nto optimize productivity by using smart agriculture\
    \ sensors for monitoring crop status. The\nsame applies to the concept of intelligent\
    \ farming. Figure 3 shows a broader perspective\non a modern-day agricultural\
    \ model, which incorporates various wireless sensor nodes to\nenable IoT-based\
    \ farming with satellite communication, where different ground sensors\nare deployed\
    \ which communicate with the cloud computing node for data processing and\nanalysis,\
    \ so that farmers can make correct decisions.\nFigure 3. Modern day agriculture.\n\
    Although smart IoT and industrial IoT are not as common as consumer-connected\n\
    devices, the market continues to be very competitive. IoT technologies are increasingly\n\
    being implemented for agriculture. COVID-19 has had a positive impact on IoT market\n\
    share in agriculture. Indeed, the smart framing market share is expected to hit\
    \ $6.2 billion\nby the end of 2021, as reported recently [57].\nIt is evident\
    \ that COVID-19 has made a signiﬁcant impact on the farming sector\nacross the\
    \ world. However, the agricultural sector is showing potential to make a strong\n\
    comeback by leveraging positive government policies which indicate adoption of\
    \ advanced\ntechnologies by making substantial investment in the agricultural\
    \ sector. This initiative\nwill make room for IoT-based agricultural solutions\
    \ as a prominent business strategy, thus\ncausing a reasonable increment in crop\
    \ production. However, in the current situation, the\nmarket is expected to show\
    \ a decline up to 0.8% for the ﬁrst two quarters of year 2021\ncompared to 2020\
    \ and this trend will show a positive growth from 2022 onwards [59].\nIn addition\
    \ to this, the smart world agriculture market is projected to triple to 15.3 bil-\n\
    lion dollars by 2025, compared to just over 5 billion dollars back in 2016 [60].\
    \ If the sector\ncontinues to expand, there will still be plenty of opportunities\
    \ for companies. In the coming\nyears, creating IoT products for agriculture will\
    \ distinguish companies as early adopters,\nthus helping to pave the way for success.\n\
    Today, the innovations on our immediate horizon include autonomous machines\n\
    which have the capacity to pluck and pick fruits and vegetables from the respective\
    \ plan-\ntation. A highly sophisticated sensing system includes microscopic sensors\
    \ and cameras\nthat help farmers track the growth of crops and warn them when\
    \ something is wrong\nor inform them of the optimum time to harvest. The Bonirob\
    \ developed by Deepﬁeld\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n7 of 37\nLabs [61] can take\
    \ a soil sample, liquidize it, and then analyze its pH and phosphorus\nlevels\
    \ in real time. Researchers expect to grow and harvest an entire hectare of land\
    \ barley\nwithout humans ever entering the ﬁeld as a proof of concept for autonomous\
    \ farming\ntechnology. Companies like Aerobotics [62] already have commercialized\
    \ software that an-\nalyzes infrared photos taken by drones to detect unhealthy\
    \ vegetation, similar to a real-life\ngame of SIM farming in which the farmer\
    \ receives a warning on their computer when a\ndisturbed area is detected. Machine\
    \ learning is constantly improving the system’s ability to\ndistinguish between\
    \ crop varieties and weeds that pose a threat to the farmer. Furthermore,\nvarious\
    \ pilots are hired by Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)-based companies to ﬂy light aircraft\n\
    equipped with multispectral cameras on data-gathering missions over vast farms\
    \ around\nthe country [63]. Planet Labs has a ﬂeet of CubSat satellites that take\
    \ weekly photographs\nof entire farms from space to aid in crop monitoring [64].\
    \ To cope with this new wave of\ndata, other companies are developing analytics\
    \ tools to act as farm management systems,\nenabling farmers to work on a variety\
    \ of land sizes. Farmers’ business networks can now\nintegrate data from several\
    \ farms into one large pool, giving their members access to\nmacro-level insights\
    \ that were previously only accessible to corporate mega farms.\n2.3. Beneﬁts\
    \ of Smart Farming\nIn certain ways, technology and IoT have the ability to change\
    \ agriculture. There are\nﬁve ways in which IoT can boost agriculture:\n•\nData:\n\
    •\nLoads of data gathered by sensors from the ﬁelds, i.e., temperature, soil quality,\
    \ crop\ngrowth progress, and animal health can be used to monitor the condition\
    \ of the farm\nalong with the performance of ﬁeld workers and efﬁciency of equipment.\n\
    •\nImproved internal process management and therefore lower output risks:\n•\n\
    The ability to forecast the production performance enables farmers to become prepared\n\
    for a better delivery of goods. Wise decisions can be made if the estimated production\n\
    of the crop is known.\n•\nCost savings and waste reduction by improved quality\
    \ control:\n•\nIf any irregularities in crop growth and animal health are seen,\
    \ then the risk of losing\nthe yield can be minimized.\n•\nImproved business productivity\
    \ through process automation:\n•\nSmart farming can automate several processes\
    \ during the development cycle, i.e.,\nirrigation, fertilization, or pest control\
    \ with intelligent devices.\n•\nImproved consistency and volume of the commodity:\n\
    •\nGreater control over production processes and retaining higher crop quality\
    \ levels\nand growth potential by automation can be achieved.\n•\nHelps to mitigate\
    \ soil toxicity and monitor signiﬁcant parameters, thereby providing\nsustainable\
    \ agriculture:\nWith the advent of low-cost sensors for monitoring agriculture,\
    \ signiﬁcant parameters\nin the agricultural ecosystem can be analyzed to increase\
    \ the factor of sustainability, i.e.,\nassessing soil quality and monitoring soil\
    \ toxicity, water quality and its controlled usage,\nweather conditions, and optimized\
    \ usage of fertilizers.\nAll the aforementioned variables will contribute to higher\
    \ revenues. However, the\nbeneﬁts of smart farming can only be exploited if the\
    \ quality of internet is able to accommo-\ndate the IoT infrastructure. In this\
    \ regard, the following section discusses internet access\nquality in developing\
    \ countries.\n2.4. Quality of Internet Access in Developing Countries\nIoT provides\
    \ an environment in which objects, animals, or humans have uniquely\nidentiﬁed\
    \ data that can be communicated over the internet without the need for computer\n\
    interactions between humans and computer [65]. In 2015, over 13.4 billion devices\
    \ were\nlinked to the internet (as part of IoT) and it is forecasted that by the\
    \ year 2020 there will\nbe a rise in 18.5% to 38.5 billion devices, according\
    \ to Juniper research (Juniper research\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n8 of 37\n\
    2015) [66]. Today, nearly every ﬁeld of modern society is being overtaken by IoT\
    \ [67]. The\nmain areas include smart health, smart cities, intelligent industries,\
    \ driverless cars, smart\nagriculture, precision farming, smart homes, etc. [68].\
    \ In this regard, it has been deemed\nnecessary for every household and business\
    \ sector to become connected with the internet,\nif we want to realize the maximum\
    \ utilization of IoT. Figure 4a shows the graph of internet\nusers worldwide on\
    \ the basis of geographic division and Figure 4b shows the subsequent\npenetration\
    \ rate till October 2020 [69]. It is worth noting that, although the number of\
    \ users\nin Asia and Africa is high as observed in Figure 4a, if Figure 4b is\
    \ analyzed, then it becomes\nevident that there is a clear-cut digital division,\
    \ as the penetration rate in Asia and Africa is\na mere 59.5% and 47.1%. In most\
    \ of the developing and underdeveloped countries in Asia\nand Africa, the agricultural\
    \ sector plays a prominent role in the contribution of overall Gross\nDomestic\
    \ Product (GDP). Therefore, reforms in communication technology are deemed\nnecessary\
    \ in such regions to incorporate the IoT paradigm into the agricultural domain.\n\
    Figure 4. (a) Internet users worldwide. (b) Internet world penetration rate [69].\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n9 of 37\nIoT has great potential and is one of the\
    \ main areas for future internet services growth.\nIoT problems are exploratory\
    \ in major IT companies and most countries. New uses of\nIoT are being searched\
    \ for and developed, but most work has been done in the ﬁeld of\nstandardization\
    \ of solutions [70]. IoT issues are included in the European Digital Agenda\n\
    (2016) [66]. As part of the European framework for research and innovation HORIZON\n\
    2020, more than EUR 140 billion is estimated to have been invested in IoT technology\n\
    between 2016 and 2017 alone (European Commission, 2015). In March 2015, the EU\n\
    Commission launched the Innovation Internet Alliance. The objective of the alliance\
    \ was to\ndevelop close cooperation on innovation and standardization of IoT (European\
    \ Commission\n2016) between the EU Commission, stakeholders, and parties involved\
    \ in IoT [66].\nThe fragmented existence of platforms and communications protocols\
    \ is one of the\nmajor problems of the present day, and contributes to incompatibility\
    \ problems between\ndifferent IoT devices and features [71,72]. IoT is well known\
    \ in precision agriculture,\nbut only proprietary solutions that lead to compatibility\
    \ and connectivity issues between\nvarious equipment are being used [73]. New\
    \ technologies need to be sought, based on\nopen standards and frameworks that\
    \ are compatible with smartphones. Many products\nthat are based on open hardware\
    \ at least partially are currently on the market and prices\nare considerably\
    \ lower than proprietary solutions. Therefore, by keeping the current\ninfrastructure\
    \ in consideration, the agriculture methodological paradigm can be taken to\n\
    the next level by connecting to the IoT.\n2.5. Embarking Agriculture on IoT\n\
    Farmers today have to face the biggest challenges in crop production as global\
    \ pop-\nulation grows. Therefore, it has been deemed necessary for the farming\
    \ sector to bring\nmajor shifts in adapting the latest technologies. IoT is driving\
    \ change in agriculture, which\nhas brought a shift in the farming paradigm. IoT\
    \ refers to devices or objects embedded\nin the sensor for the purpose of measurement\
    \ and transfer of datasets through network\ndevices, from pumps and tractors to\
    \ weather stations. In essence, IoT means that these\nphysical machines can transmit\
    \ and receive information from farms on devices using the\ninternet in order to\
    \ remotely measure all types of data and provide that information to\nthe farmer.\
    \ Soil moisture, chemical properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather\n\
    details can be collected in real time by IoT devices. IoT devices information\
    \ helps farmers\nto track farms and accordingly helps to advise farmers to increase\
    \ productivity and yields.\nFarmers can also respond faster to farm conditions\
    \ and save time and money. Nonetheless,\nwith the advent of IoT, there lies a\
    \ major challenge in the processing of high volumes of\ndata generated from the\
    \ on-ﬁeld sensors. Therefore, researchers need to tackle this issue by\ncoming\
    \ up with cloud computing models synchronized with on-ﬁeld agricultural sensors.\n\
    2.6. Data Processing Challenge in IoT\nOne of the biggest hurdles of IoT is to\
    \ process large datasets in tandem. However,\nknowing what the data are, what\
    \ the nature of the data is, and how they go through\nare some of the key components\
    \ that need to be looked upon in this process. Gathering\nthe data forms the initial\
    \ stage, and the other factor comprises ingestion of data to the\nsystem from\
    \ the sensor. It is deemed necessary to understand that the data go through\n\
    all the gateways before entering into the system where the data are actually cleansed\
    \ and\ntransformed, which eventually leads to substantial insights. The big question\
    \ lies with how\nmany speciﬁc points of computation should exist. Let us consider\
    \ an instance, whereby\nthere is a drip irrigation system which ﬁnds that one\
    \ of the plants is not getting enough\nwater. Now, this delay could not be disturbing\
    \ for the system as the concerned person\nhandling the drip irrigation system\
    \ can come back the next morning and actually provide\nsome water or maybe some\
    \ other time it can be dealt with. However, in order to bring\nsustenance in the\
    \ agricultural industry, it is necessary for the farmers to understand the\nfactors\
    \ that govern crop growth by optimizing the usage of fertilizers and water. In\
    \ these\nkinds of situations, decisions are taken close to the actions or where\
    \ the data originate\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n10 of 37\nfrom. Therefore, in\
    \ this regard, one can realistically conduct some processing for something\nto\
    \ be analyzed and thus, one can recognize some patterns and do some planning for\
    \ the\nlong term, accordingly. This gives a vision at a spectrum on a scale of\
    \ time as to where\nthe processing needs to happen. So, by considering all these\
    \ scenarios, it becomes evident\nthat not all the data are important, and this\
    \ is the challenging aspect to comprehend. This\ngives an insight of what data\
    \ need to be stored, what need to be discarded, what need to\nbe retained for\
    \ short-term purposes, and what need to be retained for long-term purposes.\n\
    Thus, all these are challenging issues that need to be addressed and that is where\
    \ storage\ntechnologies are actually highlighted. There are a number of systems\
    \ that are actually\nbeing worked upon; however, due to the lack of quality internet\
    \ access infrastructure in\ndeveloping countries, the feasibility of their implementation\
    \ remains a challenge. One\nof the viable solutions to solve this problem could\
    \ be via edge computing whereby the\nessential data could be ofﬂoaded from the\
    \ cloud over the edge of the cloud, and this is\nwhere the paradigm of smart sensing\
    \ with edge computing comes in.\n2.7. IoT-Based Smart Sensing with Edge Computing\n\
    Numerous embedded programmable devices have been utilized in recent literature.\n\
    Some are personalized while others are industrial programmable boards or full\
    \ sens-\ning/monitoring systems in closed-source applications. Researchers select\
    \ their equipment\naccording to the goals of each study or the main objective.\
    \ Business pertaining to sensing\nservices includes a range of features outside\
    \ the box to allow scientists to concentrate on\nother aspects of IoT de-planting,\
    \ such as meta-processing, smart tracking and monitoring\nalgorithms, cloud interoperability,\
    \ and more [74–76]. On the other hand, the programmable\nopen approach gives designers\
    \ versatility in monitoring the actions of the nodes and\nnetwork and in programming\
    \ new peripheral devices, such as new sensors or drive mod-\nules [77,78]. The\
    \ next subsections discuss various communication paradigms and wireless\nsensors\
    \ and nodes which are suitable to be used in the agricultural domain.\n3. Communication\
    \ in IoT\nDespite signiﬁcant changes, IoT still evolves, as can be seen from many\
    \ reviews, to\nachieve its ﬁnal form [79]. The conﬁguration of IoT is based on\
    \ three layers: a network\nlayer (data transfer), a perception layer, and an application\
    \ layer for data storage and\nmanipulation [80]. The network layer is considered\
    \ to be the physical layer of the archi-\ntecture, where the on-ﬁeld sensors and\
    \ actuators directly interact with the environment\nand gather data as per the\
    \ requirement. Technology such as Wireless Sensor Network\n(WSN), Radio Frequency\
    \ Identiﬁcation (RFID), and recently, Near Field Communications\n(NFC) are used\
    \ on the perception layer [79]. Correlation exists between WSN and RFID\ntechnology\
    \ due to semi-passive and active RFID tags which can also be viewed as lower-\n\
    computing and storage wireless nodes [81]. A wireless sensing node normally consists\n\
    of more than one sensor module (either external or embedded along with digital\
    \ sensor\ndevices), a processing module, typically a low-power microcontroller\
    \ unit, and a Radio Fre-\nquency (RF) communication module compatible with low-power\
    \ wireless communication\ntechnology [82].\nAt the network layer of the IoT, WSN\
    \ communicates with physical objects and their\nsurroundings, neighboring nodes,\
    \ or gateways. The network layer is also responsible for\nbuilding a network paradigm,\
    \ by using which the data are typically forwarded to a remote\nstorage infrastructure\
    \ for further analysis and processing [83]. Wireless standards which\nare used\
    \ to develop communication protocols, i.e., 802.15.4, bridge the difference among\n\
    the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. These types of protocols comprise\
    \ Sigfox,\nZigBee, 6LowPan, WirelessHART, and ISA100.11a. [74,84]. In addition\
    \ to this, Bluetooth\nLow Energy (BLE), Long-Range and Long-Range Wide Area Network\
    \ (LoRa/LoRaWAN),\nand low-power WiFi have also been used in the network layer.\n\
    The application layer is the IoT’s third layer. This layer is responsible for\
    \ getting\ndata downloaded and delivering application-speciﬁc service to the users’\
    \ device via an\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n11 of 37\napplication programming\
    \ interface. It is very important, and it promotes the realization\nof IoT in\
    \ several respects. The application layer faces a variety of unresolved suits,\
    \ such\nas system recognition as a unique device. Identifying and addressing billions\
    \ of devices\naround the world would provide them across the future internet with\
    \ direct internet-like\naccess and power. Identity uniqueness, durability, and\
    \ scalability are essential character-\nistics of the approach scheme [83]. IPv6\
    \ can mitigate some system recognition problems\nwith its aspects of internet\
    \ mobility and is expected to play a key role in this sector [85].\nThe heterogeneity\
    \ of the wireless nodes, diversity in data types, parallel operations, and\nintegration\
    \ of data from devices further exacerbate the problem [86].\nWhile numerous theoretical\
    \ parameters of the WSN have been studied extensively in\nliterature, practical\
    \ IoT/WSN implementations are very demanding for agriculture and\nremain a difﬁcult\
    \ task. Sensor modules must be sufﬁciently reliable, with the required mea-\n\
    suring range available which is protected from environmental factors that either\
    \ produce\nfalse readings or cause malfunctions in the system. As the IoT possesses\
    \ distributed nature,\ntherefore replacing the power source can be a very tough\
    \ challenge for battery-operated\nnodes in open ﬁelds or other agricultural facilities.\
    \ Consequently, very stringent power lim-\nitations inﬂuence the hardware selection\
    \ and the low-power characteristics of the chosen\nperipherals are often taken\
    \ into consideration when designing a new device. The software\ncomponents to\
    \ be implemented must be carefully inspected to incorporate the functionality\n\
    of a system. The ﬁnal function code includes a fully integrated understanding\
    \ of software\nengineering and adequate testing to prevent ﬁeld failures [87].\
    \ Other characteristics that\nallow an integrated, low-power system to be chosen\
    \ for use are its longer-term reliability,\nthe number of digital and analogue\
    \ inputs/outputs that reduce the number of peripheral\ndevices (sensors and actuators)\
    \ to be supported, the capacity of power harvesting modules,\nand the effort needed\
    \ to program the system.\nIoT is a dominant type of IT wireless technology in\
    \ the seven major groups, i.e.,\nthe Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM),\
    \ Wireless Personal Area Network\n(WPAN), the Cognitive Radio/Wireless Regional\
    \ Area Network (WRAN), Wireless Radio,\nmesh, Point-to-Point (P2P), and the Low-Power\
    \ Network (LPN), Low-Power Wide Area\nNetwork (LPWAN). Further GSM standard is\
    \ divided into GSM EDGE Radio Access Net-\nwork (GERAN) and Universal Mobile Telecommunication\
    \ System (UMTS) and Universal\nTerrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) [88].\
    \ Many wireless devices are produced in\ncompliance with different wireless standards.\
    \ One prominent problem is the interference\nbetween devices that run on the same\
    \ band (for example Bluetooth, ZigBee, and WiFi) or\nadjacent bands [89].\nTable\
    \ 1 summarizes the IoT wireless networking which offers a wide range of band-\n\
    width, operating frequency, range, and power consumption. The various technologies\
    \ and\nspeciﬁcations as well as the discrepancies between IoT projects and their\
    \ unique criteria\nimpede network interoperability. Two very common phenomena\
    \ are high temperatures\nand high humidity when it comes to agricultural deployments.\
    \ Based on observations by\nBannister et al. [90], when the temperature increases\
    \ from 25 ◦C to 65 ◦C, it has a major\neffect on the signal intensity obtained.\
    \ Boano et al. [91] presented similar ﬁndings. In\naddition, humidity in agricultural\
    \ deployments can also be very high. For open ﬁelds,\nthe wireless nodes are exposed\
    \ directly to rain or irrigation systems. Relative humidity in\ngreenhouses can\
    \ also reach 80% for long periods. Dampness has been shown to greatly\nimpact\
    \ the distribution of radio waves [74,92]. It is necessary to take the specs of\
    \ the\nnumber of nodes into account, i.e., the distance between them, the antenna\
    \ height, and\nthe operating frequency based on the appropriate size of the messages\
    \ when selecting\na wireless transceiver for the agricultural purpose. The next\
    \ subsection discusses the\nsensors which are used or have the potential to be\
    \ deployed over agricultural ﬁelds for soil\nassessment and monitoring soil pollutants\
    \ such as heavy metal toxics. In addition, the next\nsubsection also highlights\
    \ the various wireless nodes and the associated microcontroller\nand transceiver.\n\

    \ Used Sensors for Smart Farming and Heavy Metal Identiﬁcation\nSensors for Soil\
    \ Moisture (SM) have been used in crop ﬁelds for decades to measure\nwater content.\
    \ The use of handheld/manual soil moisture technology is increasingly being\n\
    replaced by automated technologies, since there were difﬁculties in manual soil\
    \ moisture\nreadings in remote production areas. In the past decade, technology\
    \ has been developed for\nwireless data collection, providing managers and users\
    \ with real-time access to soil moisture\ndata, resulting in more successful water\
    \ management decisions. Some of the prominent\nsensing devices to measure soil\
    \ moisture comprise gravimetric sampling, resistive sensors,\ncapacitive sensors,\
    \ and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) [93]. Gravimetric sampling is a\ndirect and\
    \ normal SM measurement tool [94]. SM is determined by a proportion of dry\nsoil\
    \ mass to wet soil mass including pores. It needs the manual drying of soil samples\n\
    taken from the ﬁeld and oven sampling [94]. The electrical conductivity of water\
    \ and\nthe measuring of resistance changes based on soil water content are primarily\
    \ resistive\nsensors, such as granular matrix sensors. This method includes sensor\
    \ calibration for\nprecise SM reading.\nIntelligent irrigation-based measurement\
    \ to maintain soil moisture levels is signiﬁcant\nto improve plant productivity\
    \ and quality. On the other hand, soil moisture sensors these\ndays are expensive,\
    \ i.e., the ECHO-EC5 soil moisture sensor costs around USD 169 [95].\nIn order\
    \ to overcome the cost constraint factor, Wang et al. [95] proposed an RFID-based\n\
    GreenTag sensor to maintain and improvise plant productivity and quality.\nIn\
    \ addition, RFID sensors can be combined with biosensors comprising aptamer and\n\
    DNA-based properties which can be used to detect heavy metals at nanoscale and\
    \ large\nscale levels pertaining to food safety monitoring. A heavy metal detection-based\
    \ biosensor\nis composed of genetically modiﬁed bacterial cells and a green ﬂuorescent\
    \ signal ampliﬁer\nwhich detects the presence of arsenite in foods [96,97]. Its\
    \ arsenic detection lasts for an\nhour with a detection range of 5–140 µg/L. Other\
    \ methodologies pertaining to biosensors,\ni.e., aptamers and graphene electrodes,\
    \ have also been used to detect arsenic with the\npossibility of being developed\
    \ as simple and easy-to-use low-cost devices [97,98].\nThe EC-5 series sensors\
    \ were also used by Wu et al. [99] for ﬁeld-speciﬁc calibration\nand evaluation\
    \ in sandy soils. Nonetheless, EC-5 sensors have turned out to be helpful to\n\
    reveal soil water content dynamics in different soil depths post rainfall conditions.\
    \ The\nECHO series has other variants of sensors; i.e., ECHO-EA10 can be used\
    \ for medium\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n13 of 37\ntextured soil type with low\
    \ electrical conductance conditions. In addition to this, there is\nECHO-10HS\
    \ soil moisture sensor which is a new addition in the soil moisture sensor family\n\
    and possesses high-frequency oscillation, which enables the sensors to accurately\
    \ measure\nsoil moisture in any of the soil or soilless media with minimum salinity\
    \ and textural effects.\nIn order to measure soil water content and salinity,\
    \ Zemni et al. [100] used 5TE sensors\nat different soil depths to assess dielectric\
    \ permittivity (Ka) and electrical conductivity\n(ECa). It is to be noted that\
    \ 5TE sensors are based on frequency domain reﬂectometry\n(FDR); therefore, they\
    \ use a ﬁxed frequency wave of broadband signal which makes the\ndevice cheaper\
    \ and more compact. Nolz et al. [101] deployed hydro probe2 sensors to\nevaluate\
    \ near surface soil water and determine in situ water retention function. Hydro\n\
    probe sensors are advantageous due to their linear signal response. On the contrary,\
    \ hydro\nprobe sensors are not suitable for sandy soils [102]. Udukumburage et\
    \ al. [103] used an\nMP406 soil moisture sensor to verify the saturated condition\
    \ of the expansive soil layer.\nThey also used this sensor to measure volumetric\
    \ water content values in the soil column\nduring the wetting and drying process\
    \ [104]. In order to maintain the indoor ecosystem\nservices, air quality plays\
    \ an essential role. In this regard, MIKROE gas sensors are used to\nmonitor the\
    \ air quality [105,106]. To evaluate and assess the vegetation change and study\n\
    physiological and metabolic response of corn ﬁelds and paddy ﬁelds, the Pogo II\
    \ VWC has\nbeen widely used [107,108].\nHu et al. [109] used Portable X-ray Fluorescence\
    \ Spectroscopy (PXRF) to assess the\nheavy metal content in soil for which they\
    \ covered 301 farmland soils from Fuyang in\nZhejiang Province, in the southern\
    \ Yangtze River Delta, China. Conventional methods for\nheavy metal detection\
    \ such as Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS), Atomic Fluores-\ncence Spectrometry\
    \ (AFS), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy\n(ICP-OES),\
    \ are expensive and lengthy procedures which are executed in laboratories. There-\n\
    fore, these methods are not taken into consideration for rapid testing and high-density\n\
    evaluation of soil heavy metals contamination. As an alternative method for rapid\
    \ heavy\nmetal detection, Portable X-ray Fluorescence (PXRF) was used to assess\
    \ cumulative con-\ncentrations of soil heavy metals based on linear regression\
    \ models between ﬂuorescence\nintensity and speciﬁc heavy metal concentration.\
    \ Due to its ease of use and rapid testing\nability using non-destructive quantiﬁcation,\
    \ PXRF has been widely used by researchers\nin numerous domains [110–113]. For\
    \ the heavy metal assessment in agricultural soil con-\nducted by Hu et al. [109],\
    \ VNIR sensor was used to anticipate soil properties comprising\npH, soil nitrogen,\
    \ and carbon [114,115]. In addition to PXRF, NixPRO color sensor can also\nbe\
    \ used to identify hotspots and total spatial area in excess of environmental\
    \ thresholds in\nlandﬁll soils [116].\nLately Zhao and Liu [117] have developed\
    \ a Portable Electrochemical System (PES)\nfor on-site heavy metal detection on\
    \ farmland. Their system was composed of a three-\nelectrode conﬁguration which\
    \ comprised a signal acquisition system integrated with a\nmicrocontroller-based\
    \ potentiostat to perform square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry.\nTheir system\
    \ was assessed by testing the detection of pd(II) and cd(II) in acetic acid soil\n\
    extracts and acetate buffer solution [117]. However, their system did not include\
    \ any\nwireless sensor module to transmit heavy metal composition data.\nOther\
    \ than the aforementioned sensors, there are several other wireless sensors ded-\n\
    icated to: photosynthesis, i.e., Beta Therm temperature sensor; leaf wetness sensor,\
    \ i.e.,\nSLWA-M003; precision sensor for leaf temperature, i.e., ∆LA-C; light\
    \ intensity sensor,\ni.e., BH1750FUI sensor [118–122]. With the advent of these\
    \ sensors, CO2 sensors also\nplay an essential role, especially in greenhouse\
    \ systems [123]. CO2 sensors have also\nbeen widely used to measure the subsequent\
    \ level in peat soil, landﬁll, and forest control\nsite [124,125]. In the smart\
    \ farming ecosystem, the growth and quality of the fruit bunch\ncannot be neglected.\
    \ In this regard, there are dedicated fruit growth monitoring sensors\nwhich researchers\
    \ have used in their domain of plantation. Thalheimer [126] designed\nan optoelectronics\
    \ sensor for monitoring fruit and stem radial growth. Their developed\nsensor\
    \ was lightweight and easy to install with low maintenance. Nonetheless, the sensor\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n14 of 37\nwas well tested in open ﬁeld conditions.\
    \ In addition to this, the effect of gas concentration\nduring the fruit growth\
    \ was studied by Ma et al. [127], for which a smart ethylene elec-\ntrochemical\
    \ sensor was established to investigate ethylene emission from fruits. Lately,\n\
    Hanssens et al. [128] came up with a heat ﬁeld deformation sensor to measure sap\
    \ ﬂow\ndynamics through the tomato peduncle. Heat griddling of the peduncle was\
    \ performed to\ndifferentiate ﬂow of xylem and phloem with respect to developing\
    \ fruits.\nCapacitive sensors calculate SM on the basis of changes in soil capacitance\
    \ due to\ndifferences in water content [129]. Commercial UTs use capacitive sensors,\
    \ which are\nusually more accurate than resistive sensors but cost more [130].\
    \ Ground Penetrating\nRadars (GPR) [131] are based upon electromagnetic wave absorption\
    \ and reﬂection. SM\nsensing uses impulses, frequency sweeping, and frequency-modulated\
    \ technologies. This\nmethod is used for measuring soil moisture near the surface\
    \ (up to 10 cm). The most\nreliable soil humidity samples used in ﬁelds are neutron\
    \ scattering samples [132] and\nscattering samples use radiation methods for calculating\
    \ SM by estimating changes to the\nneutron ﬂux density due to water content of\
    \ the soil [133,134]. However, in such cases,\nspeciﬁc licenses are required to\
    \ carry out its implementation.\nNumerous research studies have been performed\
    \ to develop electrochemical devices\nfor various applications, which are known\
    \ as potentiostat [135–141]. Lately, an Arduino-\nbased potentiostat was fabricated\
    \ from cost-efﬁcient components and was able to execute\nsimple electrochemical\
    \ experiments, whereby the results were recorded and analyzed in a\nWindows operating\
    \ system via USB interface [136–138]. As an addition to Arduino-based\npotentiostat,\
    \ Raspberry Pi (RPi) controller was also used to execute the electrochemical\n\
    experiments, whereby the results were displayed on the LCD touch panel connected\
    \ to the\ncontroller [139]. Both Arduino- and Raspberry Pi-based potentiostat\
    \ have the potential to\nincorporate wireless sensors for data transmission; however,\
    \ these controllers do not con-\ntain a built-in Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)\
    \ and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)\nwhich make the overall design more sophisticated.\
    \ In this regard, Hanisah et al. [142] came\nup with a portable Heavy Metal Potentiostat\
    \ (HMstat) to detect heavy metal composi-\ntion on-site. Their potentiostat comprised\
    \ a digital Control Signal Component (CSC) and\nthe electronic component, which\
    \ is the analog Potentiostat Read-out Circuit Component\n(PRCC), as shown in Figure\
    \ 5 [142]. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that both the Arduino\nand RPi controller\
    \ board do support the incorporation of various sensor modules. There-\nfore,\
    \ researchers have room to incorporate soil moisture and temperature sensors along\n\
    with other sensors depending on the slots available in the controller; thus, an\
    \ integrated\nsystem for soil moisture and heavy metal analysis can be developed.\n\
    Figure 5. (a) The HMstat consists of Control Signal Component (CSC) and Potentiostat\
    \ Read-out\nCircuit Component (PRCC) connected to the electrochemical cell (consisting\
    \ of Screen Printed\nElectrode Gold (SPGE) and (b) overall connection of HMstat\
    \ [142].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n15 of 37\nOther soil physical properties\
    \ can be calculated to populate the map of the soil with\nother soil properties\
    \ such as soil organic content, pH, sand, silt particles percentage, and\nnutrients\
    \ such as Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation\n\
    Ca, CEC, and K/Mg [143–145]. In situ, calculating these properties in real time\
    \ also faces\nchallenges due to scale, cost, and technology limitations.\nIn precision\
    \ farming, some of the long-lasting decisions can be taken using yield\nmonitoring.\
    \ This method helps in providing spatial distribution of crop yields at the end\n\
    of the growing season [146,147]. Yield sensors are normally mounted on farm equipment\n\
    and capture yield data automatically in the course of the harvest. In particular,\
    \ mass\nﬂow sensors on grain containers are mounted to record grain inﬂows along\
    \ with the\nposition [148]. The collected data are analyzed with tools such as\
    \ ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and\nEnvironment System Analysis International [149].\nIn\
    \ order to get an insight into the crop yield combined with ﬁeld topography, Electrical\n\
    Conductivity (EC) sensors are used [150]. Soil’s ability to conduct current is\
    \ measured\nby electrical conductivity. EC assessment is used to assess the use\
    \ of phosphorus, cations\nin water, drainage, and rooting depths [150]. EC maps\
    \ are used for zoning the area. The\nzoning is also used to incorporate precision\
    \ agricultural practices such as variable rate irri-\ngation, variable rate seeding,\
    \ and drainage management. Electromagnetic Induction (EMI)\nmethods can be used\
    \ for the mapping of the EC by apparent Electrical Conductance (ECa)\nand Visible\
    \ Near Infrared Reﬂectance (VNIR) [151]. There are a number of commercial\ntools\
    \ available, i.e., Veris 3100, EC400 sensors in conjunction with GPS systems [149,152].\n\
    In the domain of soil sensing, macronutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, and\
    \ phos-\nphorus are essential to the growth of crops. The evaluation of these\
    \ nutrients helps to\nassess the effects of fertilizer and potential applications.\
    \ The optical detection is based\non reﬂectance spectroscopy to measure the macrosimulation’s\
    \ reﬂection and absorp-\ntion [153,154]. A sensing system using planar electromagnetic\
    \ sensors has been developed\nin the detection of nitrate and sulphate concentration\
    \ in natural water resources [155].\nThis approach is used to detect the amounts\
    \ of nitrate and sulphates by correlating\nthe impedance of the sensor array with\
    \ their concentration. The key approaches to soil\nmacronutrients include electrochemical,\
    \ VIS-NIRS, and ATR spectroscopy [149,152,156].\nThese approaches to soil macronutrients\
    \ are limited to sensing a single desired ion because\nthe membrane used in these\
    \ methods only reacts to one ion [157]. To achieve a simultane-\nous multi-ion\
    \ sensing, it is necessary to build a detector array for the sensing of soil macro\n\
    nutrients [158].\nThere are several opportunities to advance the state of precision\
    \ farming through\nthe utilization of the above discussed sensors. The following\

    WSNs typically consist of a large number of nodes that run in a particular conﬁgura-\n\
    tion. Usually, autonomous and spatially dispersed sensor nodes collaborate to\
    \ track and\ncollect environmental conditions. Data can be processed in central/decentralized\
    \ mode by\nsending data to a sink that transfers them to other networks (e.g.,\
    \ through a gateway). A\nbroad variety of application-speciﬁc limitations is included\
    \ in the project, design, prototype,\nand use of a WSN.\nThe BTnode is a Bluetooth-based\
    \ radio module and microcontroller for autonomous\nwireless communication [159].\
    \ BTnode is equipped with general purpose interfaces which\ncan be conﬁgured on\
    \ the basis of application speciﬁc requirement. BTnode can be utilized\nwith several\
    \ peripherals, i.e., sensors, actuators, RFID, and GPS receivers. A promising\n\
    factor of BTnode is its compact size of 6 × 4 cm with standard wireless interface.\
    \ A pictorial\ndescription of BTnode is shown in Figure 6. The device comprises\

    \ and is equipped\nwith a universally usable sensor and actuator platform [169,170].\
    \ Figure 10 pictorially\nrepresents the Preon32 sensor. Preon32 is incorporated\
    \ with Cortex-M3 controller which is\ncompatible with IEEE 802.15.4 radio frequency\
    \ module. In addition, this module enables\ndevelopers to develop the wireless\
    \ module codes using an object-oriented programming\nlanguage like Java [169].\
    \ It also demonstrates the functionalities of external interfaces, i.e.,\nUSB,\
    \ CAN, and SPI, etc. [164,169].\nFigure 10. Preon32 sensor [170].\nThe Mica2 Mote\
    \ is shown in Figure 11. These motes are CrossBow Technology’s mote\ntechnology\
    \ of the second and third century. In combination with the CC1000/CC2420\nRF Module,\
    \ Mica2 and MicaZ use the Atmega128L controllers [171]. With the interface\nAgriculture\
    \ 2021, 11, 475\n19 of 37\nsupport for the link to the mote, the Mica2/MicaZ are\
    \ ﬁtted with moisture, temperature,\nand light sensors [162]. These motes also\
    \ measure barometric pressure, seismic waves,\netc. [172–174].\nFigure 11. Mica2\
    \ Mote sensor [174].\nUsually, the sensor nodes of a WSN consist of three basic\
    \ building blocks: sensors,\ncomputer units, and communication units. The sensor\
    \ nodes need a working device, a\nrouting protocol, and eventually a simulator\
    \ to allow a WSN to function properly.\nThe most critical issues concerning WSN\
    \ include the lack of standardization of the\nhardware nodes, limited consumption\
    \ of energy, communication latency, out-of-order\nand loss of packets, distributed\
    \ reconﬁguration and scalability factors. In this regard, the\nOperating System\
    \ (OS) acts at the helm to arbitrate the resource access. It is worth noting\n\
    that the primary OS’s for WSNs are TinyOS, MANTIS, Contiki, Nano-RK, and LiteOS\
    \ [175].\nTinyOS (TOS) is open source, modular, component-based, module-speciﬁc\
    \ and built\nfor wireless sensor networks [176]. Nonetheless, this OS complies\
    \ with programs which\nrequire very low memory and also comprises numerous libraries\
    \ that manage network\nprotocols, distributed services, transducer drivers, and\
    \ data collection tools. TinyOS uses a\nmonolithic architecture class to construct\
    \ a static image on the node using the component\nmodel. TOS offers multithreading\
    \ support from version, named TOS Threads, using a\ncooperative threading approach.\
    \ In order to come up with a lightweight open source\nOS, Contiki was developed\
    \ by the Swedish Institute of Computer Science [177]. The\npromising factor of\
    \ Contiki is its portability factor which is based on an event-driven kernel.\n\
    Contiki includes so-called protothreads, which can be used at the individual process\
    \ level.\nNonetheless, Contiki includes many applications supporting features\
    \ like the multitasking\nkernel, preventive multithreading, prototype threads,\
    \ TCP/IP protocol, IPv6 protocol,\nlight telnet client, and quick web server etc.\
    \ [178]. It is worth noting that Contiki supports\ndynamic memory management;\
    \ it does not support applications in real time [179].\nWith the advent of cross\
    \ platform requirements, the multi-threaded WSN models were\ndeveloped. The MultimodAl\
    \ system for in situ wireless sensor (MANTIS) NeTworks [164]\nis a multi-threaded\
    \ WSN operating system. MANTIS is an easy-to-use OS that includes\nkernel, scheduler,\
    \ and network stack, and is compatible to be used across various platforms,\n\
    i.e., PDA or a PC.\nIn addition, Nano-RK was built for WSNs based on multitasking\
    \ [175]. The design\nobjectives for Nano-RK include multihop networking, effective\
    \ power management to ex-\ntend WSN lifetime, limited resources lighting applications,\
    \ and priority scheduling. LiteOS\nbased in Unix was developed by the University\
    \ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [164] in\norder to support the programming paradigm\
    \ for WSNs. LiteOS offers a familiar Unix,\nthread, and C programming environment\
    \ and is built using a hybrid programming model\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n20\
    \ of 37\nwhich allows programming, both event-driven and thread-driven. Some of\
    \ the common\nwireless nodes which can be used in precision agriculture are summarized\

    \ support\nNow, the question is how the previously discussed sensors could be\
    \ deployed over an\nIoT-based High-Performance Computing (HPC) framework with\
    \ optimized scheduling. In\nthis regard, the next subsection discusses the signiﬁcance\
    \ of Edge Computing.\n3.2. Role of Edge Computing\nIt is essential to look at\
    \ data that can be processed immediately close to where the\ndata originate with\
    \ the help of edge. So, at the edge there is a requirement of some kind\nof storage,\
    \ computing ability to be able to take care of real-time processing needs. For\n\
    long-term retention for data analysis realistically, some planning activity is\
    \ to be done\nin the cloud. Therefore, if that is the case, then what kind of\
    \ storage solutions are we\nlooking at? In this regard, an edge needs to be designed\
    \ in such a way that it could possess\nlocal processing power needed in decision-making\
    \ ability and largely it is going to be\nright intensive. Thus, some storage is\
    \ required at the edge level which is going to be fast,\ni.e., largely of course\
    \ solid-state drive to overcome the issues of low latency. However, in\nthe current\
    \ scenario, data analysis and long-term planning are essential; therefore, users\n\
    may compromise with lower degrees of latencies, but the factor of storage remains\
    \ a\npriority. The prominent challenge in edge computing is with respect to the\
    \ volume of\nthe data. Having so many sensors deployed for computing, the heterogeneity\
    \ of data\nthemselves is another challenging issue. The coherency of data always\
    \ exists at the edge\nlevel and it is essential for the user to correlate the\
    \ data to discrete points, and without this\ncorrelation, one cannot get insights\
    \ for the generated data. Now, to maintain correlation\nof high-speed data becomes\
    \ another bottleneck in edge computing. To overcome this\nissue, the workﬂow optimization\
    \ along with energy aware scheduling criteria becomes\na necessity for edge computing.\
    \ In this regard, ﬂexibility and agility could be achieved\nwith lower cost, whereby\
    \ rapid provisioning of data could be enabled with continuous\ninnovation, free\
    \ ﬂow of data transmission could be observed to and from sensors without\nbeing\
    \ clogged, on demand analytics with hybrid cloud and multicloud deployments could\n\
    be met, and distributed storage could be created in order to manage high-volume\
    \ generated\ndata. Having mentioned the aforementioned parameters, it could be\
    \ asserted in a nutshell\nthat agility and ﬂexibility need to be maintained at\
    \ the seconds or subseconds level of\ncomputing to manage the real-time complex\
    \ problems. Nonetheless, this has become\npossible with the help of IoT device\
    \ sensors. Since at the edge level, a ﬁnite amount of\nstorage is being maintained,\
    \ therefore the workﬂow optimization is to be designed in such\na way that it\
    \ can meet the real-time computing demands in seconds or subseconds level, i.e.,\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n21 of 37\nthe deﬁned system needs to be able to address\
    \ this problem of getting the data that come in\nquickly and starting to process\
    \ them to gain some insights into certain correlation and then\nkeep that storage\
    \ free for the next set of data that is coming in. Therefore, with respect to\n\
    workﬂow optimization, we need to look at the set of devices which needs to be\
    \ employed\nto be able to address all the data that are coming in. In this context,\
    \ if a High-Performance\nComputing (HPC) framework could be set over the edge\
    \ level, then the aforementioned\nissues are feasible to be resolved. It is essential\
    \ for the working of HPC framework attached\nto the edge to smoothen the workﬂow\
    \ optimization and scheduling criteria.\nVarious edge nodes require various types\
    \ of resources. To this end, it is necessary\nto select an appropriate scheduling\
    \ approach to ensure the consistency of resources and\nthe availability of services.\
    \ Researchers have suggested resource continuity management\napproaches, such\
    \ as the layered model Fog to Cloud (F2C) and OpenFog Reference Archi-\ntecture\
    \ (OpenFog RA) [180,181].\nThe F2C layered model is a novel architecture focused\
    \ on data sharing and data inte-\ngration that can achieve service parallelization\
    \ and less service execution time. OpenFog\nRA has been designed to meet the same\
    \ F2C objective [181]. Therefore, researchers are\nproposing a distributed management\
    \ system incorporating edge and cloud tools to efﬁ-\nciently achieve resource\
    \ consistency within a traditional hierarchical architecture [181,182].\nLi et\
    \ al. [183] came up with EveryLite, a lightweight scripting language for resource-\n\
    constrained, heterogeneous edge devices. Such tasks which are both time-limited\
    \ and\nspace-complex are referred to as microtasks by interfaces in the migration\
    \ process. In edge\ncomputing, EveryLite can perform microtasks. Kang et al. [184]\
    \ designed a lightweight\nscheduler that can automatically schedule tasks of different\
    \ layers of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNN) between mobile devices and the cloud data\
    \ center without proﬁling each program.\nBy becoming adapted to the lightweight\
    \ scheduler, working professionals can be adapted to\na range of low-latency and\
    \ energy-efﬁcient DNN architectures, hardware systems, wireless\nnetworks, and\
    \ server workloads.\nBy embracing cooperative competition and game theory, Zhang\
    \ et al. [122] established\nCoGTA, a system for allocation of tasks. For edge\
    \ computing systems, CoGTA aims at\ndelay-sensitive and social-sensing applications.\
    \ CoGTA may tackle a few crucial problems,\nsuch as Bottom-up Game-theoretic Task\
    \ Allocation (BGTA). Similarly, the Markovian\nstochastic channel was used by\
    \ Zhang et al. [185] to provide an optimal solution and\nofﬂoad strategy for collaborative\
    \ operation between cloud and edge devices. This problem\nof minimal energy scheduling\
    \ tasks can be formulated on directed acyclic graphs as a\nrestricted, shortest\
    \ path problem. This problem is then solved using the regular Lagrange\nRelaxation-dependent\
    \ Aggregated Cost (LARAC) algorithm.\nKwak et al. [186] suggested a dynamic allocation\
    \ algorithm for CPU/network resource\nor task in the mobile networking context.\
    \ To scale the CPU/network speed, they used\nthe Lyapunov optimization technique.\
    \ Meanwhile, Liang et al. [187] proposed a new\napproach to resource management\
    \ by taking into account both bandwidth availability and\nsource selection.\n\
    Data are distributed in edge computing which requires distributed data processing,\n\
    storage, and networking resources [0]. In addition, edge devices tend to be heterogeneous,\n\
    leading to a heterogeneous runtime environment and heterogeneous data on-edge\
    \ device.\nFurthermore, resources are limited on edge apps. As such, proposing\
    \ an optimum, complex,\nand energy-aware scheduling strategy in edge computing\
    \ is complicated. If resource\nabstraction and edge OS management would allow\
    \ developers to focus on their applications\nwithout trying to think about hardware,\
    \ connectivity, and code written for speciﬁc devices,\nthis would be a huge leap\
    \ forward for complex projects to be realized. This will reduce\ncomplexity, simplify\
    \ growth, and reduce edge computing costs for the ecosystem.\n3.3. HPC on Edge\
    \ (HPCE)\nThis new High-Performance Computing (HPC) solution seeks to move beyond\
    \ the\nagricultural services offered on edge and provide a comprehensive platform\
    \ for precision\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n22 of 37\nfarming and animal husbandry\
    \ and furnish with utility not only for farmers but also for\nstakeholders. The\
    \ HPCE architecture is adapted from CYBELE conceptual framework [2].\nThe HPCE\
    \ model uses open and proprietary vast amounts of datasets, including sensor\n\
    readings, as well as satellite data and historic climatic and environmental information\
    \ for\nready reference. While this would be the most effective way to use HPC\
    \ technology, it\nonly uses the latest software platforms and projects that are\
    \ being developed by HPCE’s e-\ncontrolled services, as well as increased HPC\
    \ e-infrastructure to enable huge heterogeneous\ndata processing to be done and\
    \ ﬁnd modern solutions to complex problems using dedicated\nalgorithms. Due to\
    \ the interconnection of large-oriented approaches, varying datasets,\nand available\
    \ big data techniques, it is possible to scale distributed big data research to\n\
    enormous scales when holding many types of datasets together in one place [2].\
    \ In doing\nso, it enables the aggregated data and metadata to be aligned semantically\
    \ to a standard\nscheme and data model and enables advanced data analytics to\
    \ take secret information\ninto account. In addition to this, the HPCE architecture\
    \ will also help in gaining insights\nfrom adaptive data visualization services.\n\
    With reference to CYBELE [2], the architectural approach of the HPC on edge is\n\
    illustrated in Figure 12. By organizing a product component based on interdependencies,\n\
    this is intended to highlight the importance of pipelines being constructed to\
    \ promote\ncompatibility and show how to maintain the integrity of interdependent\
    \ services. It is worth\nnoting that CYBELE resonates well with the EdgeX platform\
    \ architecture. EdgeX platform\ncomprises four core services, i.e., device services,\
    \ core services, supporting services, and\napplication services to enable smooth\
    \ workﬂow optimization [188]. In addition, it will be\ninteresting to see a synchronization\
    \ of EdgeX with a dedicated HPC framework for faster\nbatch processing of data\
    \ over edge.\nFigure 12. High Performance Computing on Edge.\nBig, heterogeneous\
    \ data are made available through repositories powered by HPC\nwhich is responsible\
    \ for the processing at the edge layer. In this regard, as can be seen in\nFigure\
    \ 11, HPC frameworks such as Spark, Hadoop, YARN, Big Deep Learning (BigDL),\n\
    Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and Kubernetes are deployed for the batch processing\
    \ of\ndata using distributed framework attached to the edge layer [189]. It is\
    \ worth noting that\nSpark and BigDL are the widely used frameworks in many organizations\
    \ for their open\nsource and high degree of interoperability features. Spark and\
    \ BigDL are based on MapRe-\nduce framework which has high room for tuning for\
    \ smooth workﬂow optimization [190].\nThe transmission of the application process\
    \ interface along with data from the cloud layer\nto the edge layer is conducted\
    \ using 4G/5G or ﬁber/DOCSIS/DSL communication system.\nThis is seen on the middle\
    \ section of the architecture as shown in Figure 12. At ﬁrst,\nAgriculture 2021,\
    \ 11, 475\n23 of 37\nthe data are processed in the background prior to being passed\
    \ on to the check-in stage\nfor data validator or timestamp validator for resolution\
    \ of data veriﬁcation and timing\nproblems. Once data are obtained in edge layer,\
    \ quality checks are conducted to identify\nanomalies and any other data irregularities,\
    \ maintaining their accuracy and validity, which\nare accompanied by a series\
    \ of measures aligned with processes of data cleansing.\nFinally, the HPE data\
    \ provenance service provides the mechanisms required for\nrecording all relevant\
    \ information concerning incoming data of interest. With HPE, the\ndata provenance\
    \ platform is inherently connected to the data policy and asset brokerage\nengine\
    \ that enables the platform to bind data providers and data users with data share\n\
    and business features. In addition to facilitating interoperability and reuse\
    \ of data, the\ninspected data are annotated and harmonized semantically. Since\
    \ the data come from a\nvariety of physically distributed data sources, a standard\
    \ data model will be created for\nthe semantic deﬁnition and annotation of the\
    \ data. To facilitate the pipeline and allow the\nvarious heterogeneous components\
    \ to communicate seamlessly, the model will be used as\na common language to annotate\
    \ data and exchange messages between the components.\nClean and semantically uplifted\
    \ data are then available, i.e., open and proprietary data to\nbe queried, analyzed,\
    \ and viewed. An exempliﬁcation of how ground sensors have their\ndata stored\
    \ and analyzed at cloud data base is shown in Figure 13. The on-ﬁeld data are\n\
    continuously assessed by a real-time monitoring system to ensure triggering effects\
    \ if any\nthreshold point is crossed. Simultaneously, the on-ﬁeld data are also\
    \ stored in the cloud\ndatabase from where the user can download the required\
    \ data and at the same time, data\nanalysis could be applied using the machine\
    \ learning tools stored over the cloud database.\nFigure 13. Illustration for\
    \ storage and analysis of data from ground sensors to cloud database.\nTo facilitate\
    \ simulation execution, a deﬁned experimental composition setting is de-\nsigned,\
    \ as shown in the top right part of the architecture (cloud layer) in Figure 12.\
    \ The\ncomposition framework of experiments aims to support the separate design,\
    \ development,\nand execution of big data research procedures, the support of\
    \ embedded scientiﬁc compu-\ntation and reproductive tests. In the analysis method,\
    \ its subsequent template is selected\nto provide each analytical template with\
    \ its own software and execution endpoint and\nallow the user to modify the appropriate\
    \ conﬁguration variables (i.e., input algorithm,\nexecution parameters, netting\
    \ parameters, and output parameters). The results of each\nanalytical template\
    \ are presented. The composition system for experiments will promote\nthe design\
    \ and implementation of data analysis workﬂows consisting of a number of data\n\
    analysis procedures, interconnected in terms of data sources and input and output\
    \ artifacts.\nThe outcome will constitute the input to another research template\
    \ when a template is\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n24 of 37\nexecuted. The output\
    \ of the research model is an object for session that contains all the\nmemory\
    \ output values.\nIn addition to big data, advanced analysis must be implemented\
    \ when selecting input\ndatasets and developing workﬂows. For HPCE, advanced analytical\
    \ algorithms are avail-\nable to stakeholders that allow them to explore various\
    \ forms of data visually and to ﬁnd\nand solve new trends. In order to achieve\
    \ improved delivery and monitoring, machining\nand predictive modelling methods\
    \ should be modiﬁed so as to handle the predictive life\ncycle of data planning,\
    \ detection, and analysis. However, the implementation of advanced\nanalytics\
    \ along with huge, complex data increases the need for strong computing power\n\
    and a higher processing memory, so that information can be collected within a\
    \ realistic\ntimeframe. When the test cases are executed, multiple HPC attributes\
    \ are needed, including\nstorage power, speed of the device, memory capacity,\
    \ and quick turnaround time.\nThe next section discusses the IoT-based communication\
    \ methodologies in edge\ncomputing used for precision farming developed by several\
    \ researchers.\n3.4. Edge Computing in Precision Farming\nIoT incorporation in\
    \ precision farming has brought about changes in the communica-\ntions of actuators\
    \ and sensors with remote servers. With respect to networking technologies,\n\
    modern IoT-capable nodes provide new energy-saving transceivers and network topologies\n\
    that are tailored to ﬁeld conditions where mobile and WiFi base stations are rare\
    \ [191].\nMultiple topologies that use wireless sensor networks can route data\
    \ messages via commu-\nnication nodes to reach a gateway with the internet connectivity,\
    \ as shown in the proposal\nfrom Akka and Sokullu [192].\nMore recent developments\
    \ with IoT involve network protocols to communicate\nthrough the internet with\
    \ remote devices via applications designed for data reduction. For\nmonitoring\
    \ purposes, for example [191,193,194], researchers used the MQTT protocol for\n\
    data collection from sensor nodes at greenhouses. These protocols allowed the\
    \ gathering\nand analysis by Shukla et al. of data at intermediate cloud middleware\
    \ [195]. A further\nexpanded analysis of this topic can be found in the work of\
    \ Kalox et al. [196]. A gateway\nusing ZigBee collects data from a real deployment\
    \ of sensors, which are then sent to a\ndata cloud driven by FIWARE through web-based\
    \ protocols. The work takes advantage\nof open interfaces to build a number of\
    \ client applications that can access the cloud mod-\nule. However, no IoT protocols\
    \ are used, and only an early version of FIWARE is used.\nMartinez et al. [197]\
    \ presented research on how to handle crops in PA environments using\nthe cloud\
    \ plane. The FIWARE core is used here, along with a collection of additional en-\n\
    ablers, to communicate with IoT gateways through a variety of protocols, such\
    \ as Message\nQueuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol\
    \ (CoAP), where\ncurrent and historical data are stored in the cloud for analytics.\
    \ The output of FIWARE\nis assessed for PA using a collection of synthetic tests,\
    \ but no real implementation of the\nproposal is provided. As per Zyrianoff et\
    \ al. [198], a reﬁned optimization has to be made in\nFIWARE to get it implemented\
    \ over fog computing domain.\nThe incorporation of intermediate processing stages\
    \ in the data path is an evolution\nof mainly cloud-based platforms. Before sending\
    \ monitored data to the cloud, Liu [199]\nperformed local preprocessing at data\
    \ collection gateways. Ferrandez-Pastor et al. [200]\nexpanded on this concept\
    \ by evaluating a range of IoT protocols and technologies in a\nreal hydroponic\
    \ implementation to achieve effective computation-ofﬂoading. Moreover, a\nsimilar\
    \ method for computation ofﬂoading was also implemented by Chang et al. [201]\n\
    in the domain of aeroponics. However, in these works, a lack of ﬂexibility is\
    \ noticeable\nin the way edge computing is implemented, and this layer is exclusively\
    \ oriented to data\nfusion. Guillen et al. [202] proposed a hybridization of Artiﬁcial\
    \ Intelligence (AI) with IoT\nin precision agriculture. However, it was found\
    \ that there is still a big gap between AI and\nIoT due to computational resources.\
    \ In this regard, they proposed an inclusion of Graphical\nProcessing Unit (GPU)\
    \ in the edge device to enhance the computational services [202]. For\nan efﬁcient\
    \ computation ofﬂoading, Chen et al. [203] proposed ThriftyEdge which has the\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n25 of 37\nsubstantial potential to support computational\
    \ intensive tasks by proper ofﬂoading across\nlocal device and edge cloud in proximity.\
    \ ThriftyEdge is well suited to be deployed in ad\nhoc networks for precision\
    \ agriculture [203].\nThe IoT-based generic monitoring system was deﬁned by Oliver\
    \ et al. [204]. It was\ndeployed and validated on ﬂoriculture domain, with a setup\
    \ of monitoring weather and\nsoil conditions. Strategically, the goal was to foresee\
    \ such diseases which could impede\nplantations proactively. For example, bacterial\
    \ leaf spots, damp-off root rots, soft rots, and\nbacterial spots are among such\
    \ diseases. HPE’s overall architecture is cloud-centric and\nuses an edge computer\
    \ node to gather information from the distributed sensor network.\nMySense is\
    \ a generic framework for the rapid development and use of precision wine sce-\n\
    narios monitoring application [205]. It consists of four layers, including sensors/actuators,\n\
    WSN/gateway, web, and cloud applications. For local tasks and real-time alarm\
    \ generation,\nfog computing is used on the WSN/gateway layer. The platform was\
    \ used in a winery to\nstudy the dynamics of diseases in the current microclimatic\
    \ setting.\nThe necessary ingredient that makes farming operations work is consistent,\
    \ productive\nsoil. Lavanya et al. [206] came up with an Internet-of-Things-based\
    \ sensing framework\nfor assessing nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium (NPK) concentrations\
    \ in soil. In order to\nallow a colorimetric approach in the sensor, Light Dependent\
    \ Resistors (LDR) and Light\nEmitting Diodes (LEDs) were used. A fuzzy rule-based\
    \ method implemented on an edge\ncomputer using Raspberry Pi was used to assess\
    \ the sensed values pertaining to nutrient\ndeﬁciency. To assess other nutrient\
    \ shortages, additional rules were added to this rationale.\nThis method was low-cost\
    \ and provided a quick alternative compared to laboratory testing\nmethods, which\
    \ take a longer time and are also costly. Soil fertility is optimized by assisting\n\
    farmers in effectively managing their soil nutrition, resulting in cost savings,\
    \ improved\nﬁeld management, and increased environmental conservation by eliminating\
    \ runoff and\nleaching pollution. Park et al. [207] presented an exemplary case\
    \ study in the domain\nof tomato production that demonstrated how edge computing\
    \ generated scalable data\nanalytics. In this case, a Raspberry Pi served as a\
    \ sensor setup base station and a network\nedge node. On the edge node, a prediction\
    \ analysis was implemented for the growth state\nof cherry tomato, and the data\
    \ generated were sent to a cloud-based central server for\nmodel integration and\
    \ analytical interpretation to gain insights to predict results. This\nstrategy\
    \ not only reduces data ﬂow, but it also allows farmers to preserve their data.\n\
    Atmospheric temperature is a critical factor for the productivity of plants, and\
    \ in\nthis regard, it plays a prominent role in irrigation planning and greenhouse\
    \ management.\nKrintz et al. [208] used Single Spectrum Analysis (SSA) along with\
    \ linear regression to\nintroduce a temperature forecast system using low-cost\
    \ microcontrollers and single board\ncomputer. The introduction of edge computing\
    \ in their methodological paradigm drasti-\ncally reduced the factor of latency.\
    \ The advantageous part of their developed system is\nthat the farmers can opt\
    \ for a microclimate monitoring network rather than installing a\nsophisticated\
    \ weather station.\nFan and Gao [209] also looked at task parallelism in mobile\
    \ edge computing. An\nofﬂoading delay may arise because of the transmission characteristics.\
    \ In addition, com-\nputation delay normally happens over cloud transactions while\
    \ determining when to\ncontinue with the operation. Merelli et al. [210] looked\
    \ at edge computing as a foundation\nfor metagenomics research in agriculture,\
    \ and found feasibility for remote microbial studies\nof water, air, and soil.\
    \ Traditional methods for metagenomics research necessitate a large\namount of\
    \ data transfer to the cloud. However, with the advent of advanced edge tech-\n\
    nologies, remote analyses can be performed, and the results can be sent to the\
    \ cloud using\na combination of System-on-a-Chip (SoC) and edge computing. A mix\
    \ of edge and cloud\nprovides a highly appealing approach to provide complete\
    \ analysis workﬂows. The results\nof the experiments revealed a 95 percent reduction\
    \ in data streaming, thereby demonstrat-\ning the feasibility of metagenomic research\
    \ at a remote level. For singular analyses, an edge\nsolution is feasible. On\
    \ the other hand, a subsequent work by the authors in the domain of\nmetagenomics\
    \ revealed that shifting computation to the cloud improves cost and efﬁciency\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n26 of 37\nas the frequency of analyses increases [211].\
    \ Nonetheless, if AI and blockchain can be\nincorporated over IoT services, then\
    \ the farmers and the stakeholders will obtain a better\nunderstanding of the\
    \ crops along with a fast and easy way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed crops\
    \ [212]. In addition, with the help of AI, water usage can be optimized and it\n\
    will also be possible to determine whether the treated wastewater is suitable\
    \ for irrigation at\na given point in time and what are the relevant crops on\
    \ which the treated wastewater can\nbe used, depending upon its composition [212].\

    \ technologies which can provide economically competitive domain to farm-\ning\
    \ sector along with ﬁnancial viability whilst enhancing environmental efﬁciency\
    \ and\nbeing socially acceptable are the need of the hour in terms of sustainability.\
    \ However, given\nthe availability of capital, meeting these sustainability targets\
    \ would often entail trade-offs.\nFurthermore, the objectives are “moving goals”\
    \ that must adapt to new problems and pri-\norities. Technological advancements\
    \ are rapid; however, their deployment in the farming\nsector remains incomplete.\
    \ It is quite common practice with the farmers in developing\nnations that they\
    \ tend to opt for trial-and-error methods in technology adoption rather than\n\
    following a systematic way. This could have signiﬁcant consequences for farm structure\n\
    and the number of farmers who will be able to make a living in the future.\n4.1.\
    \ Awareness Regarding the Latest Ongoing Technology\nAn initiative toward better\
    \ farmer education and training along with the help of\nﬁnancial resources, non-government\
    \ organizations, the media, and the general public\ncan contribute to making sustainable\
    \ farm technology adoption easier. Dedicated laws\ncan be put forward by the government\
    \ which may comprise incentives and disincentives\nfor the adoption of the latest\
    \ technology. Environmental laws along with zoning codes,\nanimal welfare guidelines,\
    \ and public health policies, are increasingly constraining farmers’\nactions.\
    \ In this regard, there is a deemed requirement for tailored digital technology\
    \ which\nthe farmers should get acquainted with. However, because of the numerous\
    \ parameters\ncomprising policy factors and economic situation at the helm in\
    \ different contexts, there is\nno adequate explanation for why farmers implement\
    \ speciﬁc technologies. Therefore, it\nbecomes necessary for the respective governments\
    \ to furnish substantial knowledge and\ninfrastructure to farmers to uplift their\
    \ respective agriculture segments.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n27 of 37\n4.2.\
    \ Government Support to Provide Adequate Infrastructure\nIt is important to determine\
    \ which innovations are most effective in particular situa-\ntions in respective\
    \ agricultural segments and it is also important to ensure an appropriate\nmechanism\
    \ to provide incentives to promote the achievement of sustainability goals for\
    \ the\nbeneﬁt of global welfare. Rationale for priorities of food production in\
    \ an environmentally\nfriendly way is often accomplished by the use of suitable\
    \ technologies. To achieve these\nobjectives, some goals need to be tweaked in\
    \ agricultural activities by aligning interests\nwith those goals. Additional\
    \ perks can be allocated to the farmers who understand the\nbeneﬁts from technology\
    \ and practice them.\nMore follow-up is needed in monitoring the implementation\
    \ of innovations in order\nto ensure transparency in policy factor and research\
    \ activities pertaining to the adoption\nof new technology in the agrisector.\
    \ Post implementation evaluations of results will\nhelp to correct mistakes before\
    \ too much money is pumped into the wrong segment.\nThis is critical because agricultural\
    \ innovations come from a variety of places. Rating\ntechnologies and predicting\
    \ potential future patterns will aid policymakers in moving\ntoward sustainable\
    \ agriculture.\nA broader participatory approach involving a variety of stakeholders\
    \ would promote\nthe implementation of innovations for sustainable farming systems.\
    \ Farmers along with\nconsumer groups and the associated agricultural food industry\
    \ who are inclined towards\nsustainable farming should be included as stakeholders.\
    \ Since sustainable technologies\nare applied at the farm level, therefore the\
    \ farmers must be involved in the technology\nadoption discussion. In an ideal\
    \ world, there will be a stronger sense of ownership in\nthe selection of technology\
    \ in the entire agricultural food chain. Farmers’ adoption of\ntechnology is inﬂuenced\
    \ by the associated industries. However, the industrial segment\nshould learn\
    \ from the farmers’ requirements, which will help them to standardize the latest\n\
    technology, which in turn will make a substantial impact on the farming sector.\n\
    4.3. Soil Analysis to Promote Variety of Crop Growth\nIn countries where farming\
    \ is still done in the conventional way, farmers grow crops\nby planting without\
    \ understanding the properties of soil and its quality. As a result of this,\n\
    in the long run, farmers will not beneﬁt from the amount of money they will earn\
    \ from\ntheir farming. The current soil testing process uses a manual method which\
    \ ﬁrst involves\nthe sampling of soil and then the submission of samples to laboratories\
    \ for analysis. Due\nto the lengthy and laborious process, this manual process\
    \ is inefﬁcient. Because of human\ninterference, there is a risk of human error.\
    \ As a result, farmers could obtain inaccurate\ninformation. In that case, there\
    \ is a need for an automated method for soil testing and crop\nprediction. Soil\
    \ testing is crucial because soil testing assists in understanding the fertility\n\
    of soil and this allows predictions to be made about the potential crop yield.\
    \ Therefore,\na system could be proposed that consists of a handheld device which\
    \ will provide a pH\nreading and will help estimate the quantity of nitrogen (N),\
    \ phosphorus (P), and potassium\n(K) in the soil. In addition, a classiﬁcation\
    \ algorithm can be developed to determine\ncrops suitable for speciﬁc applications\
    \ based on the data obtained from the system, and\naccordingly the appropriate\
    \ fertilizers for the ﬁeld can be provided.\n4.4. Providing Meteorological Services\
    \ to the Farmers\nBringing weather and climate knowledge into agricultural decision\
    \ making has con-\ntributed to an increase in agricultural production in many\
    \ countries. However, in develop-\ning countries where several small farms are\
    \ rain-fed, it is difﬁcult to get access to weather\nand climate information to\
    \ help direct decision making. Government ofﬁcials should\nconsider this critical\
    \ knowledge which is useful to farmers and others dealing with poverty\nand hunger.\
    \ This situation continues because national meteorological and hydrological\n\
    services in developing countries do not receive adequate funding to cover the\
    \ expense of\ndelivering these services to the farmers. The government lacks substantial\
    \ information\nabout the signiﬁcant role of meteorological services which contribute\
    \ to the socioeconomic\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n28 of 37\ndevelopment of the\
    \ nation. This state of obliviousness prevails even though governments\nconfront\
    \ multiple challenging issues in the realm of agriculture, water resources manage-\n\
    ment, health, and disaster risk mitigation, all of which are heavily affected\
    \ by weather\nand environment.\nDespite repeated periods of drought and crop failure,\
    \ as well as occasional famines,\nﬂooding often leads to losses of human life\
    \ and major property destruction. In addition,\nit also causes wide-ranging impacts\
    \ on socioeconomic growth. Therefore, it is only with\nthe advent of recent development\
    \ that there has been substantial study into quantifying\nthe beneﬁts of weather\
    \ and climate knowledge-related services. It is deemed necessary to\ntake small\
    \ steps by undertaking pilot projects to research the socioeconomic gains of using\n\
    weather and climate information-related services in agriculture.\n4.5. Yield Production\n\
    The feasibility of smart farming relies on internet connectivity and a panel to\
    \ accom-\nmodate the sensor hub. Using these features, it has become easier for\
    \ the farmers to monitor\nthe process of cultivation using their smart devices.\
    \ With the aid of sensors and intercon-\nnectivity, the smart farming initiative\
    \ helps farmers to optimize the consumption of water,\npesticide, and fertilizers\
    \ to maintain the yield quality by maintaining several parameters\nsuch as soil\
    \ condition, level of pesticide, temperature, and humidity. The system can be\n\
    made more successful by combining the fertilization and pesticide spraying systems,\
    \ all of\nwhich can be managed with an IoT application. Farmers may decide which\
    \ variety of crop\nis compatible for cultivation with their respective farm. Accordingly,\
    \ the farmers can opt\nfor innovative technologies such as drone-based farming\
    \ and various weather prediction\ntools, etc.\nYoung agropreneurs involved in\
    \ cultivation business can beneﬁt from smart farming\nin terms of farm maintenance,\
    \ irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application. The\nsensors in the smart\
    \ farming paradigm are tailored to report various readings, including\nmeasurements\
    \ pertaining to the number of pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation pump\nstatus,\
    \ humidity, and temperature. The readings also provide details pertaining to the\n\
    growth timeline of the crop, as well as the crop type, i.e., when it was grown,\
    \ the date it\nwas cultivated, and how much was harvested. In agriculture, IoT\
    \ is seen as a prominent\nand promising factor in the agricultural domain which\
    \ can boost the yield in a quick\nmanner. In addition, the smart farming paradigm\
    \ can also serve as an avenue for the\nstartup companies to invest in.\n4.6. Sustainable\
    \ Land Use\nThere have been empirical studies that have attempted to quantify\
    \ the effect of agri-\ncultural policies associated with land use sustainability;\
    \ however, these studies turned out\nto be inconclusive. Although different opinions\
    \ on the relationship between prices and soil\ndeterioration derive from differences\
    \ in discount rates and risk aversion preferences, it is\nimportant to deﬁne these\
    \ differences as this allows for better clariﬁcation when participat-\ning in\
    \ discussions with others. To understand the impacts of changes in relative prices\
    \ on\nagricultural resource distribution, four different responses can be distinguished:\
    \ (i) expan-\nsion of the total agricultural area (extensiﬁcation); (ii) rise\
    \ in the number of agricultural\ninputs used, also known as intensiﬁcation; (iii)\
    \ change in technology; and (iv) change in\ncrop choices. A differentiation is\
    \ to be made among recurring costs that are capable of\nraising productivity and\
    \ ﬁxed asset investments that work to enhance soil quality in the\nlong term.\n\
    If greater agricultural production occurs as a result of increased area, impact\
    \ on the\nenvironment in terms of deforestation, overgrazing, ﬂooding, and sedimentation\
    \ is a likely\nresult. If there are changes in cropping activities at the same\
    \ time as the expansion of\nthe land area, then the new cropping activities will\
    \ have an effect due to the soil quality\nthat depends on the negative impacts\
    \ of previous cropping activities on the resource.\nTherefore, it is unclear whether\
    \ the interplay among agricultural policies, along with\nAgriculture 2021, 11,\
    \ 475\n29 of 37\nthe supply response of farmers and the implications for sustainable\
    \ land use has been\nadequately explored.\n5. Conclusions\nThe scope of the current\
    \ paper is to introduce and pave the way for smart sensing\nwith edge computing\
    \ technology in the developing nations, whose gross domestic product\nrelies substantially\
    \ on agriculture. In this regard, the applicability of various sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ with an ease of edge computing has been put forward in this paper. Smart\nsensors\
    \ offer intriguing possibilities for precision agriculture. As of now, ongoing\
    \ research\nin edge computing and smart sensing for agricultural domain is only\
    \ in its initial stage.\nNonetheless, prototypes of edge computing systems have\
    \ already been developed by\nmany researchers for speciﬁc agricultural domains;\
    \ however, the interpretability of edge\ncomputing techniques with various sensing\
    \ units still remains a challenge. There is a\nneed to set up and deploy cost-effective\
    \ high-performance computing-based edge nodes\nto enable smooth data ﬂow operations\
    \ for precision agriculture. Implementing these\nsophisticated and efﬁcient edge\
    \ technologies will solve these issues and in a broader\nperspective, this will\
    \ open up a new segment for farmers in developing nations. In\naddition to this,\
    \ a major problem to be dealt with in this context is inadequate internet\nconnectivity,\
    \ which is seen as a global issue and which affects the growth of developing\n\
    and underdeveloped nations because not every region of the world has access to\
    \ the\ninternet. In a nutshell, to uplift the agricultural domain in developing\
    \ nations, a dedicated\ncost-effective infrastructure is required which can completely\
    \ digitize the farming sector in\nthe best possible way.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ growing demand for food in terms of quality and quantity has increased the need\n\
    for industrialization and intensiﬁcation in the agriculture ﬁeld. Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) is a highly\npromising technology that is oﬀering many innovative\
    \ solutions to modernize the agriculture sector.\nResearch institutions and scientiﬁc\
    \ groups are continuously working to deliver solutions and products\nusing IoT\
    \ to address diﬀerent domains of agriculture. This paper presents a systematic\
    \ literature\nreview (SLR) by conducting a survey of IoT technologies and their\
    \ current utilization in diﬀerent\napplication domains of the agriculture sector.\
    \ The underlying SLR has been compiled by reviewing\nresearch articles published\
    \ in well-reputed venues between 2006 and 2019. A total of 67 papers were\ncarefully\
    \ selected through a systematic process and classiﬁed accordingly. The primary\
    \ objective\nof this systematic study is the collection of all relevant research\
    \ on IoT agricultural applications,\nsensors/devices, communication protocols,\
    \ and network types. Furthermore, it also discusses the\nmain issues and challenges\
    \ that are being investigated in the ﬁeld of agriculture. Moreover, an\nIoT agriculture\
    \ framework has been presented that contextualizes the representation of a wide\
    \ range\nof current solutions in the ﬁeld of agriculture. Similarly, country policies\
    \ for IoT-based agriculture\nhave also been presented. Lastly, open issues and\
    \ challenges have been presented to provide the\nresearchers promising future\
    \ directions in the domain of IoT agriculture.\nKeywords:internetofthings;agriculture;devices/sensors;agriculturalapplications;communicationprotocols\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe widespread of the internet from the last two decades has\
    \ brought unlimited beneﬁts for\norganizations and citizens over the globe. The\
    \ major beneﬁt of this innovation was the capability\nto producer and consumer\
    \ services in real time. Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) is promising\nto provide\
    \ the same beneﬁt through its innovative technologies and giving a way to enhance\
    \ the\nuser’s perception and ability by modifying the working environment. IoT\
    \ oﬀers multiple solutions in\ndiﬀerent domains such as healthcare, retail, traﬃc,\
    \ security, smart homes, smart cities, and agriculture.\nIoT deployment in agriculture\
    \ is considered the ideal solution because in this area there is a need for\n\
    continuous monitoring and controlling. In the ﬁeld of agriculture, IoT is used\
    \ at diﬀerent levels in the\nagriculture industrial production chain [1]. The\
    \ main applications of IoT in agriculture are Precision\nFarming, Livestock, and\
    \ Greenhouses, which are grouped into diﬀerent monitoring domains. All these\n\
    applications are monitored with the help of diﬀerent IoT-based sensors/devices\
    \ by using wireless\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319; doi:10.3390/electronics9020319\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n2 of 41\nsensor networks\
    \ (WSNs) that helps the farmers collect relevant data through sensing devices.\
    \ Some\nIoT-based setups analyze and process the remote data by applying cloud\
    \ services, which helps the\nresearchers and agriculturists make better decisions.\
    \ Nowadays, with the advancement of current\ntechnology, environment monitoring\
    \ solutions oﬀer additional facilities in terms of management\nand decision making.\
    \ A custom-made landslide risk monitoring system has been developed that\nallows\
    \ quick implementations in hostile environments without user intervention [2].\
    \ What is more\ninteresting about the developed system is that it deals with node\
    \ failures and reorganizes the poor\nquality communication links on the network\
    \ by itself. An IoT management is proposed in [3] that\nmonitors the elements\
    \ such as wind, soil, atmosphere, and water over a large area. Moreover, IoT-based\n\
    agricultural monitoring solutions have been identiﬁed based on the sub-domains\
    \ to which they\nbelong. The identiﬁed sub-domains are soil monitoring, air monitoring,\
    \ temperature monitoring,\nwater monitoring, disease monitoring, location monitoring,\
    \ environmental conditions monitoring,\npest monitoring, and fertilization monitoring.\
    \ Further, the IoT paradigm improves human interaction\nin the physical world\
    \ through low-cost electronic devices and communication protocols. IoT also\n\
    monitors diﬀerent environmental conditions to create dense and real-time maps\
    \ of noise level, air,\nwater pollution, temperature, and damaging radiations\
    \ [4,5]. Besides, data collected about diﬀerent\nenvironmental parameters is transmitted\
    \ to the user by trigger alerts or sending recommendations to\nauthorities via\
    \ messages [6].\nIn the last few decades, a large number of studies have been\
    \ presented in the IoT-based agriculture\ndomain. Therefore, it is important to\
    \ collect, summarize, analyze, and classify the state-of-the-art\nresearch in\
    \ this area. The purpose of this research is to present a comprehensive systematic\
    \ literature\nreview in the ﬁeld of IoT agriculture. The contributions of this\
    \ paper related to the IoT agriculture\ndomain are as follows. In Section 2, we\
    \ present a background of IoT agriculture technology. In Section 3,\nwe present\
    \ the research methodology by deﬁning research questions, inclusion/exclusion\
    \ criteria, and\nsearch string to collect eﬀective studies relevant to the IoT\
    \ agriculture domain and focused on diﬀerent\npublication channels. In Section\
    \ 4, we present the research results in the form of tables by synthesizing\nthe\
    \ selected papers. Besides, some IoT-based agricultural applications, sensors/devices,\
    \ communication\nprotocols, and country policies are also presented in this section.\
    \ In Section 5, we present a summary\nof our ﬁndings through a research hierarchy\
    \ and designed an IoT-based smart farming framework.\nIn Section 6, open issues\
    \ and challenges in IoT agriculture have been discussed from many diﬀerent\nperspectives.\
    \ Moreover, research validity threats are presented in Section 8. Section 9 presents\
    \ the\nconclusions of the article.\n2. Background\nResearchers have proposed diﬀerent\
    \ IoT-based technologies in the agriculture ﬁeld that are\nincreasing the production\
    \ with less workforce eﬀort. Researchers have also worked on diﬀerent\nIoT-based\
    \ agriculture projects to improve the quality and increase agricultural productivity.\
    \ Some\nIoT-based agricultural techniques have been identiﬁed from the literature,\
    \ which have been summarized\nin this section.\nCarnegie Melon University has\
    \ worked on a plant nursery by using wireless\nsensors technology [7]. In [8],\
    \ a WSN-based polyhouse monitoring system has been presented\nthat makes use of\
    \ carbon dioxide, humidity, temperature and light detection modules. By using\
    \ GPS\ntechnology and ZigBee protocol a WSN-based system has been proposed that\
    \ monitors diﬀerent\nagricultural parameters [9]. A real-time rice crop monitoring\
    \ system has been designed to increase\nthe productivity [10]. The crop monitoring\
    \ system has been presented in [11], which collects the\ninformation of rainfall\
    \ and temperature and analyzes it to mitigate the risk of crop loss and enhance\n\
    crop productivity. A low-cost Bluetooth-based system has been proposed in [12]\
    \ for monitoring various\nagricultural variables such as temperature by using\
    \ a microcontroller that works as a weather station.\nThe proposed system is best\
    \ for monitoring real-time ﬁeld data. Moreover, the disadvantage of this\nsystem\
    \ is its limited communication range and required Bluetooth conﬁguration with\
    \ smartphones\nfor continuous monitoring. A smart sensing platform based on ZigBee\
    \ has developed by [13] for\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n3 of 41\nmonitoring diﬀerent\
    \ environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, sunlight, and pressure.\n\
    The developed platform provides a fast data rate, low-cost hardware, and an accurate\
    \ sensor working\non mesh network so that each node can communicate with each\
    \ other eﬀectively. A Global System for\nMobile Communications (GSM) based irrigation\
    \ monitoring system has been developed that uses an\nandroid app for measuring\
    \ diﬀerent environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, and\ncontrol\
    \ of the water level. The basic purpose of this system is to develop a low-cost\
    \ wireless system,\nwhereas the negative aspect of the system is to know the operating\
    \ command to actuate the ﬁeld\nmotor and agriculture parameters [14]. To measure\
    \ the greenhouse parameters such as humidity and\ntemperature, a system has been\
    \ proposed on the basis of GSM and Field Programmable Gate Array\n(FPGA). The\
    \ proposed system provides cost-eﬀective and timely monitoring solutions to monitor\
    \ crop\nand soil conditions [15]. In [16], a simple, ﬂexible networking low-cost\
    \ system has been proposed that\nuses a fuzzy control system to monitor diﬀerent\
    \ greenhouse parameters. The operation and design\nmethodologies for WSN have\
    \ been proposed in [17] for a more advanced monitoring and controlling\nsystem\
    \ in the greenhouse. Multiple environmental problems related to greenhouses have\
    \ also been\naddressed such as WSN components standardization, wireless node packaging,\
    \ and electromagnetic\nﬁeld interference. In [18], a system has been proposed\
    \ that monitors the animal’s health as well as\nidentiﬁes the widespread diseases,\
    \ whether it originates from biological attacks or natural causes.\nA low-cost\
    \ animal health monitoring system is presented in [19] that measures the heart\
    \ rate, postures,\nand body temperature.\n3. Research Methodology\nA systematic\
    \ literature review (SLR) is selected as the research methodology for this paper.\
    \ The goal\nof this research is to investigate and provide a review of existing\
    \ IoT-based agricultural monitoring\napplications, sensors/devices, and communication\
    \ protocols. We have followed the methodology\nproposed by [20] to make research\
    \ impartial in the context of information selection and results in\nrepresentations.\
    \ The research methodology for this systematic mapping study has been illustrated\
    \ in\nFigure 1.\nElectronics 2020, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n3 of 41 \nsensor working\
    \ on mesh network so that each node can communicate with each other effectively.\
    \ A \nGlobal System for Mobile Communications (GSM) based irrigation monitoring\
    \ system has been \ndeveloped that uses an android app for measuring different\
    \ environmental conditions such as \nhumidity, temperature, and control of the\
    \ water level. The basic purpose of this system is to develop \na low-cost wireless\
    \ system, whereas the negative aspect of the system is to know the operating \n\
    command to actuate the field motor and agriculture parameters [14]. To measure\
    \ the greenhouse \nparameters such as humidity and temperature, a system has been\
    \ proposed on the basis of GSM and \nField Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The\
    \ proposed system provides cost-effective and timely \nmonitoring solutions to\
    \ monitor crop and soil conditions [15]. In [16], a simple, flexible networking\
    \ \nlow-cost system has been proposed that uses a fuzzy control system to monitor\
    \ different greenhouse \nparameters. The operation and design methodologies for\
    \ WSN have been proposed in [17] for a more \nadvanced monitoring and controlling\
    \ system in the greenhouse. Multiple environmental problems \nrelated to greenhouses\
    \ have also been addressed such as WSN components standardization, wireless \n\

    \ been proposed that \nmonitors the animal’s health as well as identifies the\
    \ widespread diseases, whether it originates from \nbiological attacks or natural\
    \ causes. A low-cost animal health monitoring system is presented in [19] \nthat\
    \ measures the heart rate, postures, and body temperature. \n3. Research Methodology\

    \ for this paper. The \ngoal of this research is to investigate and provide a\

    \ ﬁrst step of this SLR is the deﬁnition of research questions and provision of\
    \ the current\nresearch status on IoT-based agriculture. This SLR addresses eight\
    \ research questions with their\ncorresponding motivation represented in Table\
    \ 1.\nTable 1. Research questions. IoT: Internet of Things.\nNo\nResearch Question\n\
    Main Motivation\nRQ1\nWhat are the major targeted primary publication\nchannels\

    \ for relevant studies on the research topics. A search string\nhas been deﬁned\
    \ that is used to gather published articles related to the research topics. We\
    \ conducted\na pilot search based on the speciﬁc keywords, and we decided to use\
    \ only IoT applications in the\nagriculture search string. However, in the pilot\
    \ search, we have also used IoT sensors/devices and\ncommunication protocols in\
    \ agriculture. Internet research has been performed by using multiple search\n\
    engines and digital libraries to collect information. The obtained results were\
    \ compiled manually\nto get the best sources for information to answer the deﬁned\
    \ research questions. Selected search\nengines and digital libraries have been\
    \ chosen based on their scientiﬁc contents and closely related\nto the objective\
    \ of this paper. The chosen databases were Springer, Elsevier, IEEE, MDPI, and\
    \ IGI\nGlobal. The next step is to identify the consistent procedures and search\
    \ terms to seek out technical\nand scientiﬁc documentation in search engines and\
    \ digital libraries. The set of keywords selected to\ndeﬁne the search string\
    \ from the research questions is given in Table 2.\nTable 2. Search string.\n\

    3.4. Screening of Relevant Papers\nAll the papers in the search were not precisely\
    \ relevant to research questions; therefore, they\nneeded to be assessed according\
    \ to the actual relevancy. For this purpose, we used the search process\nElectronics\
    \ 2020, 9, 319\n5 of 41\ndeﬁned by Dybå and Dingsøyr [21] for the screening of\
    \ relevant papers. In the ﬁrst screening phase,\npapers were selected based on\
    \ their titles, and we excluded those studies that were irrelevant to the\nresearch\
    \ area. For example, the keyword protocol returns articles relevant to IoT in\
    \ other ﬁelds that\nhave diﬀerent meanings than the IoT technology used in agriculture.\
    \ These papers were totally out of\nscope, so we excluded them. In the second\
    \ phase of screening, we read the abstract of each article that\nwas selected\
    \ in the ﬁrst screening phase. Furthermore, inclusion and exclusion criteria also\
    \ used to\nscreen papers.\nWe decided to exclude the following types of papers:\n\
    •\nArticles not presenting new and emerging ideas.\n•\nPapers published other\
    \ than conferences, journals, patents, and technical reports.\n•\nArticles without\
    \ deﬁning data sources or where the data collection procedure was unclear.\n•\n\
    Articles not published in the English language.\n•\nPapers published before 2006.\n\
    •\nPapers that are not relevant to the search string.\nPapers have been selected\
    \ on the basis of the given exclusion criteria and after examining the\nabstract\
    \ of selected studies, we have decided to include it in the next screening phase.\n\
    3.5. Keywording Using Abstract\nTo ﬁnd the relevant papers through keywording\
    \ by using the abstract, we used a process deﬁned\nby Petersen et al. [22]. Keywording\
    \ has been done in two phases. In the ﬁrst phase, we have examined\nthe abstract\
    \ and identiﬁed the concepts and keywords that reﬂected the contribution of the\
    \ studies.\nIn the second phase, a higher level of understanding is developed\
    \ on the basis of these keywords. For\nthe mapping of reviews, we have used keywords\
    \ to form and cluster the categories.\n3.6. Quality Assessment\nIn an SLR, generally,\
    \ quality assessment (QA) is carried out to assess the quality of selected papers.\n\
    In this SLR, a questionnaire has been designed to measure the quality of the selected\
    \ papers. The QA\nin this SLR is carried out by following the previous mapping\
    \ study [23].\n(a)\nThe study contributes to IoT in agriculture. The possible\
    \ answers for this research question were\n“Yes (+1)” and “No (0)”.\n(b)\nThe\
    \ study represents a clear solution in the ﬁeld of agriculture by using IoT. The\
    \ possible answers\nfor this research question were “Yes (+1)”, “partially (0.5)”,\
    \ and “No (0)”.\n(c)\nThe published studies that have been cited by other articles\
    \ and possible answers for this research\nquestion were: “partially (0)” if the\
    \ citation count is 1 to 5, “No (−1)” if paper is not being cited by\nany author,\
    \ and “Yes (+1)” if citation count is more than ﬁve.\n(d)\nThe published study\
    \ is from a stable and recognized publication source. The answer to this\nquestion\
    \ has been evaluated by considering the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) lists and\
    \ CORE\nranking computer science conferences.\nPossible answers for journals and\
    \ conferences are presented in Table 3.\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n6 of 41\nTable\

    \ Process\nThe selection and search processes results are presented in Table 4.\
    \ Initially, 3179 papers were\nselected when the search protocol was applied on\
    \ the selected repositories. A screening process\nhas been applied on the basis\
    \ of the exclusion criteria, keywords, titles, abstracts, and full articles\n\
    of retrieved papers. One author retrieved all these papers; then, two authors\
    \ examined the papers,\nwhich led to the selection of a total 240 papers. After\
    \ that, we eliminated the duplicate titles and the\ntitles that were not relevant\
    \ to the review. For example, most of the excluded papers were related to\ngeneral\
    \ IoT such as privacy, security, healthcare, retail, and smart cities. To determine\
    \ the assessment\nagreement between two authors, a Cohen’s kappa coeﬃcient of\
    \ 0.91 was used, which indicates that\nthe evaluation made by authors is a perfect\
    \ measurement [24]. Furthermore, after reading the full\nabstracts of the selected\
    \ 171 papers in the duplication phase, we have selected 104 papers on the basis\n\
    of their abstracts. In the end, 67 studies were selected out of 3179.\nTable 4.\

    \ been applied to providing a set of possible answers to the deﬁned\nresearch\
    \ questions.\nRQ1: The answer to this question is given by identifying the publication\
    \ channels and sources for\nall papers.\nRQ2: To identify the frequency of approaches\
    \ of each article, which has been classiﬁed according\nto the publication year.\n\
    RQ3: Research approaches have been classiﬁed according to developing techniques\
    \ in the selected\nstudies such as whether they proposed a system, solution, method,\
    \ model, application, survey, platform,\narchitecture, ecosystem, review, and\
    \ framework.\nRQ4: To identify the primary IoT solution for agriculture, diﬀerent\
    \ monitoring, controlling, and\ntracking applications have been investigated.\n\
    RQ5: The deﬁned research question identiﬁes the primary focus of the selected\
    \ studies in the\nIoT agricultural ﬁeld.\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n7 of 41\n\
    RQ6: This research question has been designed to measure the utilization of devices/sensors\
    \ used\nby selected IoT agricultural solutions.\nRQ7: Which communication protocol\
    \ or network system has been designed or implemented to\nprovide an IoT-based\
    \ agricultural solution.\nRQ8: Diﬀerent country policies have been discussed to\
    \ measure the value of IoT in agriculture.\n4. Analysis\nIn this section, ﬁndings\
    \ related to the SLR questions that are presented in Table 1 are described.\n\
    Research studies after choosing the screening process have been used to illustrate\
    \ each research\nquestion answer to make an essential contribution to the IoT\
    \ agriculture ﬁeld.\n4.1. Selection of Results\nAnalysis of the state-of-the-art\
    \ IoT-based smart farming studies is a key challenge due to the\ncoverage of multiple\
    \ application domains, communication protocols, sensors/devices, and protocols.\n\
    According to our research questions, we have gathered 67 primary studies in this\
    \ section. After analyzing\nthe selected studies, we have addressed each question\
    \ according to the extracted information. Quality\nassessment and the overall\
    \ classiﬁcation results of the selected papers have been presented in Table 5.\n\

    \ is to evaluate and determine the air condition in order to prevent \nfrom damaging\
    \ effects. In [25] an IoT-based agricultural air, humidity, and temperature monitoring\
    \ \nsystem has been proposed. This system offers a real-time microclimate monitoring\
    \ solution that is \nbased on WSNs. The system consists of a temperature and humidity\
    \ sensor that is supported by a \ncommunication technology called ZigBee and powered\
    \ by solar panels. \nFigure 5. IoT agriculture applications.\nElectronics 2020,\
    \ 9, 319\n20 of 41\nAir Monitoring\nThe aim of this sub-domain is to evaluate\
    \ and determine the air condition in order to prevent\nfrom damaging eﬀects. In\
    \ [25] an IoT-based agricultural air, humidity, and temperature monitoring\nsystem\
    \ has been proposed. This system oﬀers a real-time microclimate monitoring solution\
    \ that is\nbased on WSNs. The system consists of a temperature and humidity sensor\
    \ that is supported by a\ncommunication technology called ZigBee and powered by\
    \ solar panels.\nSoil Monitoring\nPaper categorized in this sub-domain [26] proposed\
    \ solutions for soil moisture and temperature\nmonitoring in the ﬁelds using WSN.\
    \ Both of these systems are maintained through multiple\ncommunication technologies\
    \ such as GPRS, ZigBee, and the internet, where the user interacts with the\n\
    system through web applications [63,85].\nWater Monitoring\nThe studies that have\
    \ been categorized in this sub-domain intend to monitor water quality or\nwater\
    \ pollution by sensing PH, temperature, and chemicals, which can change the normal\
    \ conditions\nof water. In [27], an IoT-based solution has been presented to monitor\
    \ the water quality by measuring\ntemperature, conductivity, and turbidity. This\
    \ solution based on WSN combines sensing devices and\nmonitors the multiple parameters\
    \ of water in urban areas. Moreover, [28] developed a WSN-based\nsystem to monitor\
    \ the rainfall and water level in irrigation systems. A web-based decision support\n\
    system has been proposed in [29] that use sensors to measure temperature, solar\
    \ radiations, humidity,\nand rainfall for irrigation monitoring in olive ﬁelds.\n\
    Disease Monitoring\nThe LOFAR-agro Project is the best example for crop or plant\
    \ monitoring [30]. This project protects\nthe potato crop by monitoring diﬀerent\
    \ climate conditions such as temperature and humidity through\nWSN. The proposed\
    \ system protects the crop by analyzing the collected data from fungal diseases.\n\
    Environmental Condition Monitoring\nAn environmental condition monitoring system\
    \ is proposed in [34] that measures the spatial\nsampling of humidity sensors\
    \ using WSN. To determine the behavior of 2D correlation, a historical\ndatabase\
    \ is being used in the proposed system. Moreover, another environmental conditions\
    \ monitoring\nsystem is proposed in [35] that integrates forecasting and drought\
    \ monitoring musing IoT.\nCrop and Plant Growth Monitoring\nIn this sub-domain,\
    \ farmlands have been analyzed by using the mobile sensors presented in [94].\n\
    The essential purpose of this proposed system is to monitor the growth of grapes\
    \ and control plans\nfor viticulture activities. To monitor apple orchards, researchers\
    \ proposed an eﬃcient and intelligent\nmonitoring system that provides suggestions\
    \ based on the sensed data [95]. The basic purpose of this\nproposed system is\
    \ to decrease the management costs, improve the quality of apples, and protect\
    \ from\npest attacks. It is a WSN-based system that is designed by using ZigBee\
    \ and GPRS to monitor the\ngrowth of apples.\nTemperature Monitoring\nSoil temperature\
    \ plays a vital role in crop productivity. In [96], a system has been proposed\n\
    to monitor the amount of nutrients between surface and ground water. To measure\
    \ the quantity of\nnutrients in soil, electrochemical impedance was applied. Soil\
    \ test results are monitored through\nan inductance (L), capacitance (C), and\
    \ resistance (R) (LCR) meter, and the results are calculated via\nstandard library\
    \ measurements.\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n21 of 41\nHumidity Monitoring\nThe\
    \ humidity level is measured in air by using multiple humidity sensors. An inappropriate\n\
    amount of humidity leaves a negative impact on plants regarding cell growth [36].\n\
    Monitoring Gases in Greenhouse\nAgriculture and greenhouse gases are related to\
    \ each other. The excessive amount of gases in a\ngreenhouse increases the temperature,\
    \ which directly impacts the agriculture productivity. To monitor\nthe greenhouse\
    \ gases and CH4, a WSN and solar powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system\n\
    has been presented [37].\nFertilization and Pest Control\nIn this domain, an IoT\
    \ solution provides conservation approaches to improve the quality of the\ncrops\
    \ and amount of nutrients usage. An online climate monitoring system has been\
    \ presented for\ngreenhouses to monitor pests, irrigation, fertilization, and\
    \ climate [33]. The system use WSN to gather\nand analyze sensed data for eﬃcient\
    \ analysis.\nGreenhouse Illumination Control\nAn automated agriculture system\
    \ is developed to monitor the growth of cabbages and melons in\ngreenhouses [38].\
    \ The designed system monitors the crop growing process and controls the greenhouse\n\
    environmental conditions such as temperature, ambient light, and humidity.\nLocation\

    \ area network (CAN) or wireless technology such as LoRa, Zigbee, NB-IoT, and\n\
    Bluetooth. Meanwhile, a wide area network (WAN) component is further divided into\
    \ sub-components\nthat are mobile communication technologies. The cellular communication\
    \ technology consist of four\ngenerations of technology, whereas 5G technology\
    \ was announced in 2016, which will revolutionize\nthe agriculture monitoring\
    \ process by providing high-speed data transmission, network control, and\nenergy\
    \ consumption. Moreover, the data acquisition component not only transmits the\
    \ agricultural\nrelated information collected from the data visualization component,\
    \ but also sends the control\ncommands to the system management.\nA common platforms\
    \ component is responsible for decision making, data storage, and statistical\n\
    analysis on agricultural data by implementing various models and algorithms for\
    \ the agricultural\nproduction process. The component has been further divided\
    \ into sub-components, namely: (i) Edge\nComputing, (ii) Cloud Computing, and\
    \ (iii) Big Data. Big data technology makes predictive analysis\nby ﬁnding the\
    \ internal links among the data, which are collected through information mining\
    \ and\nother resources.\nMoreover, it also provides data support for new operations\
    \ and performs multiple processing\ntechniques such as image processing, statistical\
    \ analysis, simulation, prediction, early warning, and\nmodeling [93]. Cloud Computing\
    \ provides software services, hardware services, infrastructure services,\nand\
    \ platform services to diﬀerent IoT agricultural applications. The cloud platform\
    \ oﬀers cheap\ndata storage services to the farmers such as image, text, videos,\
    \ and other agricultural data, which\nfacilitates the agricultural enterprises\
    \ by reducing storage cost [42]. Moreover, it is a diﬃcult task to\nmake the direct\
    \ use of raw agricultural data for decision making on the basis of farmers’ technical\n\
    expertise. In contrast, agricultural experts can also give suggestions and make\
    \ accurate judgments\nbased on quantitative analysis. Therefore, only cloud computing\
    \ provides an intelligent and secure\nplatform for monitoring crop [128] Although\
    \ the cloud platform helps the farmer through its advance\ntechniques, still,\
    \ there are some limitations due to which farmers face technology losses related\
    \ to\ninternet connectivity and low power. Edge computing is one of the new computing\
    \ models that\nperform the calculations at the edge of the network. This platform\
    \ also reduces the computational\nload by improving data transmission speed and\
    \ protects agricultural data because processing in edge\ncomputing occurs more\
    \ compared to cloud computing [76,129].\nData processing consists of audio, video,\
    \ text image processing, and many other processing\ntechniques. These features\
    \ may be added or removed according to the system requirements.\nData visualization\
    \ is one of the most visible components in the IoT agricultural ﬁeld, which consists\n\
    of monitoring, controlling, and tracking/tracing. The monitoring function includes\
    \ environmental\nconditions monitoring, crop and plants growth monitoring, disease\
    \ monitoring, soil monitoring, and\nanimal health monitoring. The controlling\
    \ function controls the diﬀerent agricultural parameters such as\npest, fertilization,\
    \ and greenhouse illumination control. Moreover the tracking/tracing sub-component\n\
    tracks the animals and ﬁeld location. The whole monitoring, controlling, and tracking\
    \ process is\ncontrolled is through a controller and managed through the system\
    \ management component.\nThe system management component includes various kinds\
    \ of actuators, sensors, microcontrollers,\nand drone controllers. The most commonly\
    \ used sensors/devices are environmental conditions\nmonitoring sensors, crop/plant\
    \ monitoring sensors, and animal health monitoring sensors/devices.\nThese sensors\
    \ collect information about diﬀerent agricultural variables, and this collected\
    \ information\nis processed through embedded devices to make the proper analysis\
    \ for smart farming.\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n30 of 41\n5.3. State-of-the-Art\
    \ IoT Agricultural Solutions in the Market\nAccording to the report of Finistere\
    \ Ventures, more than 2 billion dollars have been invested\naround the globe in\
    \ AgTech, which is expected to increase in the coming years [130]. As IoT is gaining\n\
    is importance in diﬀerent applications of smart farming, almost all of the top\
    \ technology ﬁrms are\ninvesting and supporting this technology in their own way\
    \ to develop innovation in the agriculture\nﬁeld. Table 10 represents the diﬀerent\
    \ IoT agricultural solutions proposed by the top technologies ﬁrms.\nTable 10.\
    \ Available solutions and initiatives regarding IoT in agriculture.\nIndustries\n\
    Initiatives and Solutions\nSamsung\nSamsung takes the initiative in the ﬁeld of\
    \ IoT by providing its Samsung Data Systems\n(SDS) IoT Platform, which connects\
    \ the multiple IoT devices and communication protocols\nsuch as Modbus, Zigbee,\
    \ Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), MQTT, and LoRaWAN [131].\nAeroFarms\nAeroFarms provides\
    \ indoor farming solutions by analyzing data related to plants into data\nthrough\
    \ big data, imaging, and artiﬁcial intelligence technologies [132].\nMicrosoft\n\
    Microsoft also works on data-driven farming techniques by resolving the issues\
    \ from cloud\nto sensor [133]. The Bosch technology ﬁrm provides diﬀerent sensors\
    \ analytics techniques\nand IoT-based data management techniques to monitor the\
    \ crop productivity and\ndiseases [134].\nR- Style Lab\nR- Style Lab is the top\
    \ IoT software-providing company that oﬀers multiple software\nsolutions such\
    \ as predictive maintenance, drone’s inspections, and crop/animal monitoring\n\
    solutions, and it provides some embedded software that can easily be integrated\
    \ into\nportable trackers [135,136].\nIBM\nIBM has provide an AI-based service\
    \ called Watson Decision, which is best solution to\nimprove the sustainability,\
    \ harvesting, and quality of smart farming by using IoT and AI\ntechnologies [137].\n\
    Intel\nIntel has been developed an IoT-based platform Inﬁswift, which helps increase\
    \ the\neﬃciency of agricultural solutions through advanced connected services\
    \ [138].\nGoogle\nGoogle has suggested a vision for advanced agricultural solutions\
    \ by joining the MIT\nMedia Lab Open Agriculture Initiative to provide a healthier\
    \ food system [139].\n6. Open Issues and Challenges\nThere are many open issues\
    \ and challenges that are associated with the implementation of\nIoT applications.\
    \ Some of the challenges that are identiﬁed from the literature have been discussed\
    \ in\nthis section.\n6.1. Security\nSecurity issues arise at a diﬀerent level\
    \ of IoT-based agricultural systems, which need to be\naddressed. Due to low security,\
    \ users face many diﬃculties such as loss of data and other on-ﬁeld\nparameters.\
    \ IoT privacy and security issues have been discussed in [140–142] broadly. In\
    \ the agriculture\nﬁeld, IoT devices are at risk due to physical interference\
    \ such as attack by animals and predators or\nmodiﬁcation in physical address\
    \ [142,143]. Moreover, due to low energy consumption and limited\nmemory, it is\
    \ hard to implement sophisticated and complex algorithms. The precision farming\
    \ services\nsuch as IoT-enabled location information and location-based services\
    \ are exposed to hackers that\nmay use this information for device capturing [141,142,144].\
    \ Attackers attack the IoT device and\ntake out cryptographic implementations.\
    \ Other communication layers also undergo some vulnerable\ndenial-of-service (DoS)\
    \ attacks and wireless signal blocking [142]. Major security threats to the cloud\n\
    infrastructure are hijacking attacks, session hijacking, database issues, and\
    \ denial of service attack [142].\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n31 of 41\n6.2. Cost\n\
    While deploying IoT in agriculture, several cost-related issues arise such as\
    \ setup and running\ncosts. The setup costs consist of hardware costs such as\
    \ IoT devices/sensors, base station infrastructure,\nand gateways. Moreover, running\
    \ costs includes an uninterrupted subscription for the management of\nIoT devices,\
    \ the exchange of information among other services, and centralized services that\
    \ provide\ninformation/data collection [47].\n6.3. Lack Knowledge of Technology\n\
    Poor understanding of technology is the main barrier among the farmers who are\
    \ living in rural\nareas. This problem is common in developing countries, where\
    \ most farmers are uneducated [145].\nThe implementation of IoT in agriculture\
    \ is a big challenge, because a lot of investment is required in\nfarmer’s training\
    \ before deploying IoT infrastructure.\n6.4. Reliability\nIn the ﬁeld of agriculture,\
    \ IoT devices are deployed in an open environment due to which harsh\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions may cause communication failure and the humiliation of deployed sensors.\n\
    Therefore, it is important to ensure the physical safety of deployed IoT devices/sensors\
    \ to protect them\nfrom severe climate conditions [146].\n6.5. Scalability\nA\
    \ large number of IoT devices and sensors are deployed in the agriculture ﬁeld,\
    \ due to which an\nintelligent IoT management system is required for the identiﬁcation\
    \ and controlling of each node [147].\n6.6. Localization\nThere are many factors\
    \ that need to be considered while deploying devices/sensors. Such devices\nshould\
    \ have the ability to provide functionality and support to the rest of the world\
    \ without deploying\nadditional devices with overhead conﬁguration [148].\nMoreover,\
    \ it is important to select the\nbest deployment position so that devices can\
    \ communicate and exchange information without\nany interference.\n6.7. Interoperability\n\
    There are billions of IoT devices, standards, and protocols that are needed to\
    \ interoperate.\nInteroperability involves semantic, syntactic, technical, and\
    \ organizational policy. Semantic interoperability\nis the ability to deal with\
    \ the interpretation of content exchanged among humans. Syntactical interoperability\n\
    is related to data formats, such as java script object notation (JSON), data interchanged\
    \ electronically,\nextensible markup language (XML), and variables separated by\
    \ a comma. Technical interoperability\nis associated with the development of infrastructure,\
    \ protocols, and hardware/software components\nthat enable the IoT devices’ communication.\
    \ Organizational interoperability is related to policies for\ncommunicating and\
    \ transferring data effectively across the different geographic regions and infrastructure.\n\
    Whereas, in [149], three methods have been proposed through which interoperability\
    \ can also be obtained,\nwhich are (i) two standards open and close, (ii) partnership\
    \ among services and product developers, and\n(iii) mediator and adaptors services.\
    \ More research work is expected to obtain a high interoperability\namong multiple\
    \ IoT devices.\n7. Integration Challenges of IoT and Cloud Computing in Agriculture\n\
    The aim of the cloud-based IoT paradigm is to analyze and integrate the data that\
    \ is coming from\nthe real world into IoT objects. This paradigm requires interacting\
    \ with millions of end devices that\nare thoroughly distributed [110]. Although\
    \ the cloud platform helps the farmer through its advance\ntechniques, still,\
    \ there are some limitations due to which farmers face technology loss related\
    \ to internet\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n32 of 41\nconnectivity, low-power communication\
    \ devices, and many other integration challenges. Moreover,\nthe monitoring and\
    \ controlling processes have made the data sharing of IoT devices more diﬃcult,\n\
    because IoT communication devices face connectivity issues and latency problems\
    \ [111]. Some of the\nnetworking challenges that users face while assessing and\
    \ uploading the information on cloud are\ngiven in Table 11.\nTable 11. Mapping\
    \ problems and solutions regarding IoT and cloud computing integration.\nYear\n\
    Reference\nProblems\nSolutions\n2016\n[150]\nIt has become very diﬃcult to handle\
    \ the\ndata-generating devices and\npower-constrained sensors, in order to\nobtain\
    \ the more valuable services.\nThe cloud of things (CoTs) solution has been\n\
    presented to handle the increasing demand of\ndata-generating devices and other\n\
    communication resources underlying the\nWSNs.\n2016\n[151]\nIoT consist of millions\
    \ of interconnected\ndevices such as WSAN, RFID etc. in\norder to exchange the\
    \ agricultural\ninformation; therefore, cloud computing\ntechnology is necessary\
    \ due to the\nconnectivity limitations in this ﬁeld.\nAuthors presented a survey\
    \ on cloud\ninfrastructures, cloud platforms, and\nIoT middleware for the integration\
    \ of devices\nand communication protocols.\n2013\n[152]\nDue to the adaptation\
    \ of a large number\nof wireless technologies, IoT has stepped\nout to create\
    \ a fully integrated future\nnetwork.\nImplemented cloud solutions by using Aneka,\n\
    which is a centric vision for the convergence\nof internet, WSN, and distributed\
    \ computing.\n2013\n[153]\nThe integration of IoT and cloud\ncomputing has become\
    \ a primary need\nover the last few years to manage\ndiﬀerent power connectivity\
    \ issues.\nThe author designed a framework to procure\ndata from decentralized,\
    \ heterogeneous,\nhighly distributed, and virtual devices that\ncan be controlled,\
    \ analyzed, and managed\nautomatically.\n2014\n[154]\nThe IoT has become more\
    \ persistent due\nto which its integration with cloud\ncomputing is very important.\n\
    The integration of both technologies is not\nsimple, because diﬀerent key issues\
    \ occur\nthat people face while accessing the\ncommunication network to retrieve\
    \ or upload\ninformation to the cloud. A survey has been\npresented that highlights\
    \ the main challenges\nand provides their respective solutions.\n8. Threats to\
    \ Validity\nThere have been four kinds of threats to validity identiﬁed in this\
    \ section.\n8.1. Construct Validity\nIn the SLR, construct validity threats are\
    \ relevant to the classiﬁcation of selected studies [147,148].\nSearch keywords\
    \ have been proposed and identiﬁed by two authors, and seven terms related to\n\
    IoT agriculture have been used in the search string. However, the list is not\
    \ complete; some alternative\nand additional terms may alter the list of ﬁnal\
    \ selected papers [84]. A search string was performed\nby using IEEE Xplore, Science\
    \ Direct, Springer, MDPI, and IGI Global. According to the statistics\nof the\
    \ search engines, we have found most of the research papers related to IoT agriculture\
    \ in these\nelectronics libraries. To mitigate the risk of missing essential and\
    \ related publications, we have sought\nout the related papers in major IoT agriculture\
    \ research venues. Although the standard of the primary\nstudies decreased by\
    \ including publications that are not from top journals and conferences, it indicates\n\
    that the studies relevant to IoT have increased.\n8.2. Internal Validity\nThis\
    \ type of validity handles the extraction data analysis process, in which two\
    \ authors have\nidentiﬁed the classiﬁcation of selected papers and the data extraction\
    \ process, whereas one author\nreviewed the ﬁnal results. Data collection and\
    \ paper classiﬁcation have been made on the judgment of\nElectronics 2020, 9,\
    \ 319\n33 of 41\ntwo authors. The kappa coeﬃcient value was 0.91, which indicates\
    \ that there has been a high level of\nagreement among the authors and reduces\
    \ the dissimilarity threats signiﬁcantly by showing a similar\nunderstanding of\
    \ relevance.\n8.3. External Validity\nExternal validity is related to the generalization\
    \ of this study. The mapping results have been\nconsidered regarding the IoT domain,\
    \ and the validity of the results presented in this paper concerns\nonly the IoT\
    \ agriculture domain. The classiﬁcation of the papers and search string presented\
    \ in this\nresearch may help the practitioners as a starting point for IoT agriculture\
    \ research, and researchers can\ncategorize the addition studies accordingly.\n\
    8.4. Conclusion Validity\nThe conclusion validity threat is related to the identiﬁcation\
    \ of improper relationships that may\ngenerate an incorrect conclusion. In the\
    \ mapping study, a conclusion validity threat refers to the\ndiﬀerent elements\
    \ such as incorrect data extraction and missing studies. To decrease this threat,\
    \ the\ndata extraction and selection process have been clearly deﬁned in the previous\
    \ paragraph on internal\nvalidity. The traceability among the extracted data and\
    \ the conclusion has been strengthened through\nthe direct generation of frequency\
    \ plots and bubble plots generated from the collected data by applying\nstatistical\
    \ analysis.\n9. Conclusions\nThis article has presented a systematic literature\
    \ review that presents a discussion on selective\nhigh-quality research articles\
    \ published in the domain of IoT-based agriculture. The survey has\nbeen conducted\
    \ by employing a systematic methodology to select 67 studies. Thereafter, an analysis\n\
    of diﬀerent IoT agriculture applications, sensors/devices, and communication protocols\
    \ has been\npresented. The most promising fact is that this area of research is\
    \ being patronized by the governments\nof various countries, and many countries\
    \ have their IoT agriculture policies. Apart from this, all\nthe major components\
    \ of IoT-based agriculture have been contextualized in a framework. Lastly,\n\
    the promising future directions have been discussed for the researchers working\
    \ in the domain of\nIoT-based agriculture.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

  explanation: This study evaluates real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management
    systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies to address the global
    food challenge. The authors posit that edge computing plays a crucial role by
    reducing latency, enabling real-time decision-making, and alleviating reliance
    on cloud connectivity for automated irrigation systems.
  extract_1: '"Edge computing offers several benefits for real-time irrigation management
    systems. Firstly, edge computing can reduce latency by processing data closer
    to the source, eliminating the need for data to travel to the cloud and back,
    which can take a significant amount of time." This benefit enables real-time decision-making,
    which is crucial for irrigation management, especially in scenarios where rapid
    adjustment is necessary based on changing environmental conditions or crop requirements.'
  extract_2: '"Secondly, edge computing can enable real-time decision-making by bringing
    the processing power closer to the sensors and actuators. This allows for a more
    immediate response to changes in the environment or crop conditions, ensuring
    that the irrigation system is always operating at optimal efficiency." By enabling
    real-time decision-making, edge computing empowers the automated irrigation system
    to adapt to dynamic conditions in real-time, leading to more efficient and effective
    irrigation practices.'

    Abstract: The growth of the global population coupled with a decline in natural\
    \ resources, farmland,\nand the increase in unpredictable environmental conditions\
    \ leads to food security is becoming a major\nconcern for all nations worldwide.\
    \ These problems are motivators that are driving the agricultural\nindustry to\
    \ transition to smart agriculture with the application of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) and\nbig data solutions to improve operational efﬁciency and productivity.\
    \ The IoT integrates a series\nof existing state-of-the-art solutions and technologies,\
    \ such as wireless sensor networks, cognitive\nradio ad hoc networks, cloud computing,\
    \ big data, and end-user applications. This study presents\na survey of IoT solutions\
    \ and demonstrates how IoT can be integrated into the smart agriculture\nsector.\
    \ To achieve this objective, we discuss the vision of IoT-enabled smart agriculture\
    \ ecosystems\nby evaluating their architecture (IoT devices, communication technologies,\
    \ big data storage, and\nprocessing), their applications, and research timeline.\
    \ In addition, we discuss trends and opportunities\nof IoT applications for smart\
    \ agriculture and also indicate the open issues and challenges of IoT\napplication\
    \ in smart agriculture. We hope that the ﬁndings of this study will constitute\
    \ important\nguidelines in research and promotion of IoT solutions aiming to improve\
    \ the productivity and quality\nof the agriculture sector as well as facilitating\
    \ the transition towards a future sustainable environment\nwith an agroecological\
    \ approach.\nKeywords: sustainable agriculture; food security; green technologies;\

    1. Introduction\nIn order to meet the current global needs of humanity, new solutions\
    \ and technologies\nare constantly being proposed and implemented. This has led\
    \ to the advent of the Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) [1,2]. IoT is deﬁned as the\
    \ network of all objects that are embedded\nwithin devices, sensors, machines,\
    \ software and people through the Internet environment\nto communicate, exchange\
    \ information and interact in order to provide a comprehen-\nsive solution between\
    \ the real world and the virtual world [3]. In recent years, IoT has\nbeen applied\
    \ in a series of domains, such as smart homes [4,5], smart cities [6,7], smart\n\
    energy [8,9], autonomous vehicles [10,11], smart agriculture [12–15], campus manage-\n\
    ment [16,17], healthcare [18,19], and logistics [20,21]. Series of other IoT applications\
    \ have\nbeen described by Shaﬁque et al. [22]. An illustration of rich and diverse\
    \ IoT applications\nfor smart agriculture is provided in Figure 1.\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396. https://doi.org/10.3390/app12073396\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n2 of 19\nIn recent years, with the aim of increasing\
    \ agricultural production, new solutions and \ntechnologies have been introduced\
    \ in the agriculture sector [24]. An emerging trend is the \napplication of the\
    \ IoT and big data. A significant number of studies have been focused on \nresearch,\
    \ experiments, and applications [25,26]. According to the Cisco forecast, over\
    \ 500 \nbillion IoT devices will be connected to the Internet by 2030 [27]. The\
    \ use of IoT and big \ndata will enable smart agriculture and is expected to enhance\
    \ efficiency and productivity \n[28]. \n \nFigure 1. An illustration of IoT applications\
    \ for smart agriculture. \nOver the years, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have\
    \ been strongly applied in the \nagricultural sector, building the foundation\
    \ for developing smart agriculture [29]. The \nunique characteristics of WSN,\
    \ such as the ability to self-organize, self-configure, self-es-\ntablish, and\
    \ self-recover, make it suitable for smart agriculture [30]. The sensor device\
    \ \nconsists of a radio frequency (RF) transceiver, sensor, microcontroller, and\

    \ are integrated seamlessly to help farmers improve productivity, prod-\nuct quality,\
    \ and profitability [37]. \nFigure 1. An illustration of IoT applications for\
    \ smart agriculture.\nAccording to the United Nations’ (UN 2019) statistics, the\
    \ world population is esti-\nmated to grow to 10 billion by 2050 [23]. As a consequence,\
    \ the requirements of agricultural\nproducts are continually increasing. However,\
    \ farmlands are declining, natural resources\nare increasingly depleted, and the\
    \ rise of unpredictable nature challenges, such as global\nwarming, salinization,\
    \ and ﬂooding, make food security the most concerning problem for\nall nations\
    \ worldwide.\nIn recent years, with the aim of increasing agricultural production,\
    \ new solutions and\ntechnologies have been introduced in the agriculture sector\
    \ [24]. An emerging trend is the\napplication of the IoT and big data. A signiﬁcant\
    \ number of studies have been focused on\nresearch, experiments, and applications\
    \ [25,26]. According to the Cisco forecast, over 500\nbillion IoT devices will\
    \ be connected to the Internet by 2030 [27]. The use of IoT and big data\nwill\
    \ enable smart agriculture and is expected to enhance efﬁciency and productivity\
    \ [28].\nOver the years, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been strongly applied\
    \ in the agri-\ncultural sector, building the foundation for developing smart\
    \ agriculture [29]. The unique\ncharacteristics of WSN, such as the ability to\

    \ (RF) transceiver, sensor, microcontroller, and battery power [31]. The WSN\n\
    focuses on applications such as environmental monitoring, machine control automation,\n\
    and traceability [32–35].\nAlong with the development of science and technology,\
    \ the urgent requirement for\nbreakthrough solutions and technologies aiming at\

    \ electrochemical sensor, and\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n5 of 19\n(5) air ﬂow\

    2.2. Communication Technology\nThe survey of communication technologies for IoT\
    \ [43,44] indicated that to integrate\nIoT into the smart agriculture sector,\
    \ communication technologies must progressively\nimprove the evolution of IoT\
    \ devices. They play an important role in the development of\nIoT systems. The\
    \ existing communication solutions can be classiﬁed as: protocol, spectrum,\n\
    and topology.\nProtocols: many wireless communication protocols have been proposed\
    \ for the smart\nagriculture sector. Based on these protocols, devices in a smart\
    \ agricultural system can\ninteract, exchange information, and make decisions\
    \ to monitor and control farming condi-\ntions and improve yields and production\
    \ efﬁciency. The typical, low-power communication\nprotocol numbers commonly used\
    \ in smart agriculture can be divided into short-range and\nlong-range categories\
    \ based on the communication range.\n-\nShort-range: NFMI (near-ﬁeld magnetic\
    \ induction) [45], Bluetooth [46], ZigBee [47],\nterahertz (Z-Wave) [48,49], and\
    \ RFID [50].\n-\nLong-range: LoRa [51], Sigfox [52], and NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT)\
    \ [53].\nTable 1 presents some typical communication technologies for the smart\
    \ agriculture\nsector. The values in Table 1 indicate that short-range communication\
    \ technologies have\na transmission distance of less than 20 (m), high energy\
    \ efﬁciency, and low data rate.\nThese protocols are often employed in sensor\
    \ networks, while long-range communication\ntechnologies have transmission distances\
    \ of up to several tens of kilometres, consume more\nenergy, and are installed\
    \ for backhaul device-to-device communications. A diverse survey\nof low-power\
    \ communication technologies for IoT that presents solutions, challenges, and\n\
    some open issues is described by Sundaram et al. [54].\nTable 1. Some typical\

    Spectrum: Each radio device uses certain frequency bands for communication. The\n\
    FCC (Federal Communications Commission) has deﬁned unlicensed spectrum bands for\n\
    unlicensed operations in scientiﬁc, industrial, and medical purposes [55]. These\
    \ spectrum\nbands are often applied for low-power levels and short-range applications.\
    \ Consequently, a\nseries of common technologies for the smart agriculture sector,\
    \ from wireless machine con-\ntrol and UAVs to communication technologies such\
    \ as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, use unlicensed\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n6 of 19\n\
    spectrum bands [56]. However, the use of unlicensed spectra faces several challenges,\
    \ such\nas the quality of service guarantee, the cost of setting up the initial\
    \ infrastructure, and the\ninterference generated by the huge number of IoT devices\
    \ [57,58].\nA licensed spectrum usually is allocated to mobile networks. It provides\
    \ more efﬁcient\nnetwork trafﬁc, more reliability, enhances the quality of service\
    \ (QoS), offers security,\nprovides extensive coverage, and involves lower initialization\
    \ infrastructure costs for users.\nHowever, the use of licensed spectrum bands\
    \ has faced some limitations, such as high data\ntransmission costs and the low\
    \ energy efﬁciency of IoT devices [59].\nSeveral recent studies have demonstrated\
    \ the efﬁciency of unlicensed spectrum bands\nin the mm wave range. It uses extremely\
    \ low power but provides large transmission\ndistances and high data rates [60,61].\
    \ One limitation of the mm wave spectrum is that the\ndata rate is strongly affected\
    \ by weather conditions, especially rain [62].\nTopology: The establishment of\
    \ the communication spectrum band and operation pro-\ntocol of IoT devices depends\
    \ on the structure that deploys IoT devices for smart agriculture\napplications.\
    \ Network structures for smart agriculture usually have two main types of\nnodes:\
    \ sensor and backhaul nodes [63]. The common characteristics of IoT sensor nodes\n\
    are short communication distance, low data rate, and high energy efﬁciency. In\
    \ contrast,\nIoT backhaul nodes often require large transmission distances, high\
    \ throughput, and data\nrates. Therefore, based on the role of each IoT network\
    \ node, the sensor node or backhaul\nnode selects and installs appropriate communication\
    \ technologies [64]. Figure 5 presents a\ntypical low-power network topology designed\
    \ for measuring and monitoring factors in a\nsmart farm. The system includes:\n\
    (1)\nIoT sensor nodes collect information from the farming environment, such as\
    \ soil\nmoisture, air humidity, temperature, nutrient ingredients of soil, pest\
    \ images, and\nwater quality, then transmit collected data to IoT backhaul devices.\
    \ Depending on\nthe operation purpose and installation location, IoT sensor nodes\
    \ can be installed as\nRFDs (reduced-function devices), which only communicate\
    \ with FFDs (full-function\ndevices). These nodes cannot communicate with the\
    \ other RFDs, aiming to save\nenergy and decrease investment costs.\n(2)\nIoT\
    \ backhaul nodes, besides having the role of an IoT sensor node, also play a role\
    \ as\nintermediate nodes to receive information from other IoT nodes and transmit\
    \ it to the\ncontrol centre. IoT backhaul nodes are often installed as an FFD\
    \ device, which can\nconnect to other FDD and RFD devices.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12,\

    \ besides the main problems of sensing, collecting\ndata, and controlling devices\
    \ to respond to the real farming environment, data storage and\nprocessing are\
    \ also important problems and face some challenges [26,28]. In reality, the\n\
    number of collected data is huge, and traditional data storage, organization,\
    \ and processing\nsolutions are not feasible. Therefore, big data processing solutions\
    \ need to be researched\nand applied for smart agriculture [65,66].\nThe complexity\
    \ of data storage and processing is due to the unique characteristics\nof the\
    \ smart agriculture ﬁeld, including unstructured data and various formats, such\n\
    as text, images, audio and video, economic ﬁgures, and market information. Recent\n\
    solutions and technologies have introduced the use of cloud platforms for storage\
    \ and\ndata analytics, which are collected from farms [36,67]. In addition, cloud-assisted\
    \ big data\nanalytic solutions, such as edge computing [68] or fog computing [69],\
    \ are also proposed to\nreduce latency and costs and support QoS.\nThe survey\
    \ results demonstrate that, in recent years, many management information\nsystems\
    \ for smart agriculture have been proposed [70–72]. Nowadays, possible solutions\n\
    have been developed and commercialized, providing solutions and services for farmers\n\

    \ and increasing sales of products.\n3. Typical Applications of IoT in Smart Agriculture\n\
    In recent years, a series of IoT applications for agriculture have been introduced.\n\
    According to survey results, we divided these applications into categories based\
    \ on their\npurpose, including monitoring, tracking and traceability, and greenhouse\
    \ production. The\ndetailed results are presented in the following subsection.\n\
    3.1. Monitoring\nIn the agriculture sector, factors affecting the farming and\
    \ production process can be\nmonitored and collected, such as soil moisture, air\
    \ humidity, temperature, pH level, etc.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n8 of 19\n\
    These factors depend on the considered agricultural sector. Some smart agricultural\
    \ sectors\nare applying the following monitoring solutions:\nCrop Farming: In\
    \ this sector, some vital factors that affect the farming process and\nproduction\
    \ efﬁciency include air temperature, precipitation, air humidity, soil moisture,\n\
    salinity, solar radiation, pest status, soil nutrient ingredients, etc. In [81],\
    \ the authors\ndesigned an IoT device called FarmFox. This device allows real-time\
    \ collection and analysis\nof the composition of the farming soil and transmits\
    \ the information to farmers/owners\nvia the Internet. The results demonstrate\
    \ the health of the soil is monitored in real time to\nprovide timely recommendations\
    \ to farmers aiming to increase productivity and farming\nefﬁciency.\nFurthermore,\
    \ in [82], the authors proposed an IoT device to allow intelligent control\nof\
    \ temperature and humidity factors, called a weather radar. This device will automatically\n\
    turn on the warning mode using the light signal and send messages to the farmer\
    \ when the\ntemperature or humidity exceeds a pre-installed threshold. In [83],\
    \ the authors introduced\nan IoT system based on Web GIS to monitor pest status\
    \ and provide early warnings. In\naddition, this study also proposes a predictive\
    \ model based on monitoring the habitat of\npests and diseases. The efﬁciency\
    \ of the proposed system was indicated, based on the\npredicted ﬁgures of the\
    \ locust epidemic, to have a high accuracy rate (over 87%) in 2019\n(China).\n\
    Monitoring information, such as soil condition, moisture, and temperature, and\
    \ the\nprediction of natural factors, such as rainfall and weather, support the\
    \ control of growing\nconditions of crops, helping farmers plan and make irrigation\
    \ decisions to optimize pro-\nduction and reduce labour costs. In addition, the\
    \ collected data, combined with big data\nprocessing technology, can provide recommendations\
    \ for implementing preventive and\nremedial solutions against pests and diseases\
    \ in farming.\nAquaponics: It is an integration of aquaculture and hydroponics.\
    \ Aquaponics is a\nfarming technique where ﬁsh waste becomes a source of nutrients\
    \ needed by plants. One of\nthe most important issues in such farms is constantly\
    \ monitoring water quality, water level,\ntemperature, salinity, pH, sunlight,\
    \ etc. [84]. According to this research direction, in [85],\nthe authors designed\
    \ an IoT system to monitor the temperature and pH value of water for\naquaponics\
    \ farms. Moreover, this system is also equipped with a control system of water\n\
    metrics to keep the ﬁsh habitat stable and an automatic ﬁsh feeding function to\
    \ increase\nthe productivity of the ﬁsh. The results show that the IoT system\
    \ had stable operation and\nprovided real-time monitoring parameters. The authors\
    \ of [86] designed an aquaponics\nfarm for households/urban areas based on IoT.\
    \ This system recommends the proper ratio\nof ﬁsh and plants.\nConsequently, the\
    \ system decreases feed consumption as well as reduces carbon\nemissions into\
    \ the environment. The primary purpose of this proposal aims to balance the\n\
    self-sustaining ability of the aquaponics system. The experimental results demonstrate\
    \ the\nnumber of ﬁsh decreases from 30 to 15, and the number of plants increases\
    \ from 20 to 30,\nbut the crop production will increase by more than 50%. A detailed\
    \ and diverse survey of\nthe IoT systems and devices for control and monitoring\
    \ of aquaponics farms is introduced\nin [87]. Based on the obtained data, monitoring\
    \ can improve the production of ﬁsh and\nplants through the control, supplementation,\
    \ and regulation of nutritional ingredients in\nthe water. The collected data\
    \ were also used to automate the management of aquaponics\nfarms to reduce labour\
    \ costs.\nForestry: Humans depend on forests for survival. Moreover, forests play\
    \ a vital\nrole in the carbon cycle and provide a habitat for more than two-thirds\
    \ of animal species\nin the world. Forests also have the effect of protecting\
    \ watersheds, limiting ﬂoods, and\nmitigating climate change. The main factors\
    \ that need to be monitored in a forest include\nsoil ingredients, air temperature,\
    \ humidity, and concentration of several different gases,\nsuch as oxygen, methane,\
    \ ammonia, and hydrogen sulphide. A series of forest control\nsystems and solutions\
    \ are presented in [88,89] based on IoT and big data analytics.\nAppl. Sci. 2022,\
    \ 12, 3396\n9 of 19\nIn [90], the authors designed a peatland forest environmental\
    \ monitoring system.\nThis forest area plays a very vital role in the rainforest\
    \ ecosystem of Brunei. However,\nthe peatland forest type is very burnt. This\
    \ work designed an IoT system to monitor\nenvironmental conditions, such as temperature,\
    \ humidity, wind direction, barometric\npressure, and manage possible disasters.\
    \ For the purpose of enhancing feasibility, IoT\ndevices use the solar-powered\
    \ system and communicate with the monitoring centre based\non the LoRa network.\
    \ In [91], the authors proposed a solution to control forest changes\nand vitality\
    \ by using high-resolution RapidEye satellite imagery. This solution has been\n\
    deployed commercially in several states in Germany and has detected leaf diseases\
    \ in a\npine forest affected by pests. Survey results indicate that monitoring\
    \ in forestry focuses on\nproviding early warning systems against forest ﬁres,\
    \ pest control, or deforestation.\nLivestock Farming: It is deﬁned as the process\
    \ of raising domesticated animals, such as\ncows, pigs, sheep, and goats, chickens,\
    \ etc., in an agricultural environment to obtain traction,\nserve production,\
    \ and obtain products such as meat, eggs, milk, fur, leather, etc. In this\narea,\
    \ the factors to be monitored depend on the type and number of farming animals\
    \ [92].\nIn [93], the authors designed a support system for the diagnosis, prevention,\
    \ and treatment\nof diseases for livestock called VetLink. This system can provide\
    \ recommendations for\nanimal health for farmers in rural areas where it is difﬁcult\
    \ to access veterinary doctors\nimmediately. In [94], the authors proposed a noncontact\
    \ temperature measurement system\nand monitoring of animals to ensure early detection\
    \ of diseases and animal health. This\nsystem can be used for remote monitoring\
    \ of animal health and timely anomaly detection.\nIn [95], the authors introduced\
    \ a monitoring system for large-scale pig farms based on IoT.\nThe speciﬁc solution\
    \ is to attach an IC tag on each pig to monitor the behaviour of each pig,\nsuch\
    \ as their period of feeding and resting and exercise. Data from sensors are collected\n\
    and combined with data analytics solutions that can make recommendations for pig\
    \ health.\nThe monitoring data of water, feed, and animal health for livestock\
    \ in the farming\nprocess helps farmers set up livestock plans, reduce labour\
    \ costs, and enhance production\nefﬁciency. While a series of solutions has been\
    \ provided for monitoring large-scale farms,\ntheir application in small and medium-sized\
    \ farms is very limited, especially in developing\ncountries. This can be attributed\
    \ to the high cost and the lack of knowledge needed to\nset up, manage, and operate\
    \ IoT systems. Therefore, effective and low-cost solutions for\nagricultural IoT\
    \ have much potential.\n3.2. Tracking and Tracing\nIn order to meet the needs\
    \ of consumers and increase proﬁt value, in the future, farms\nneed to demonstrate\
    \ that products offered to the market are clean products and can be\ntracked and\
    \ traced conveniently, thereby enhancing the trust of consumers in product\nsafety\
    \ and health-related issues. In order to solve this problem, a series of tracking-\
    \ and\ntracing-based problems for the smart agricultural sector has been proposed,\
    \ speciﬁcally as\nfollows:\nIn [96], the authors designed an information system\
    \ that allows tracking and tracing\nof agricultural products and foods such as\
    \ dairy and vegetables, called SISTABENE. This\nsystem helps suppliers track the\
    \ production process and errors arising in the supply chain,\nand helps end-users\
    \ trace the origin of food. In [97], the authors proposed a food supply\nchain\
    \ traceability system based on blockchain technology. It helps to track and trace\
    \ agri-\nfood supply chains’ production process and trace the origin of agricultural\
    \ products. This\nsolution has been employed at Shanwei Lvfengyuan Modern Agricultural\
    \ Development\nCo., Ltd. (Shanwei, China). Although there are still limitations,\
    \ the results demonstrate\nthat this solution has successfully supported the tracing\
    \ of food and agricultural prod-\nucts through QR codes, improving product quality\
    \ and ensuring the clear traceability of\nproducts. In [98,99], the authors proposed\
    \ smart agricultural solutions to tracking and\ntracing agricultural products,\
    \ thereby allowing consumers to know the product’s entire\nhistory. These solutions\
    \ enable tracking and tracing some of the data collected along the\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n10 of 19\nsupply chain, ensuring that consumers and other stakeholders\
    \ can identify products’ origin,\nlocation, and history.\n3.3. Smart Precision\
    \ Farming\nThe advent of the GPS (global positioning system) has created breakthrough\
    \ advances\nin many ﬁelds of science and technology. The GPS provides the most\
    \ important parameters\nfor locating a device, such as location and time. GPS\
    \ systems have been successfully\ndeployed in many ﬁelds, such as smartphones,\
    \ vehicles, and IoT ecosystems. However,\nGPS is only good support for outdoor\
    \ systems and the sky. Meanwhile, the demand\nfor the locating and navigating\
    \ systems in the home and on the streets of smart cities is\ngrowing rapidly.\
    \ Aiming to solve this problem, an advanced global navigation satellite\nsystem\
    \ (GNSS) is being deployed [100]. Based on GPS and GNSS systems, suitable farming\n\
    maps have been established for ﬁelds and farms. As a result, agricultural machinery\
    \ and\nequipment can be operated autonomously [101]. Figure 6 presents an illustration\
    \ of the\ntypical cloud-assisted, IoT-based precision agriculture platform.\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n11 of 20 \n \ntheir machines, allowing\
    \ machines to operate autonomously and remotely via the Internet \n[107]. \n \n\
    Figure 6. Cloud-assisted IoT-based precision agriculture platform. \n3.4. Greenhouse\
    \ Production \nA greenhouse consists of walls and a roof, which are usually made\
    \ from transparent \nmaterials, such as plastic or glass. In a greenhouse, plants\
    \ are grown in a controlled envi-\nronment, including controlling for moisture,\
    \ nutrient ingredients of the soil, light, tem-\nperature, etc. Consequently,\
    \ greenhouse technology makes it possible for humans to grow \nany plant, at any\
    \ time, by providing suitable environmental conditions [108]. Figure 7 \nillustrates\
    \ a smart agriculture IoT system for monitoring greenhouse farming factors \n\
    based on IoT ecosystems. \nIn [109], the authors introduced an IoT-based greenhouse\
    \ environmental monitoring \nsystem for multipoint monitoring in large greenhouses.\
    \ Instead of using multiple sensors \nat different locations, this solution involves\
    \ a drive system that allows the sensor system \ndiff\nl\ni\ni\nh\nh\nTh\ni\n\

    In smart precision farming, one of the most important applications is the use\
    \ of drones\nin monitoring and farming activities. Some common farming tasks using\
    \ UAVs include\nspraying pesticides, fertilizing, sowing seeds, evaluating and\
    \ mapping, and monitoring\ncrop growth. In [102], the authors presented a detailed\
    \ survey of drone applications for\nsmart agriculture, including applications,\
    \ control technology, and future trends of the UAV\napplication for smart agriculture.\
    \ In [103], the authors designed an automatic agricultural\nproduct classiﬁcation\
    \ system based on camera systems, image processing algorithms, and\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n11 of 19\nmechanical actuators. The experimental results for\
    \ agriculture products such as oranges\nand tomatoes present a classiﬁcation success\
    \ rate of over 95%, and the sorting time for each\nproduct is less than 1(s).\
    \ This solution can be adapted and applied to the classiﬁcation of\ndifferent\
    \ agricultural products. In [104], the authors proposed a solution to estimate\
    \ grape\nproduction. The proposed solution combines an RGB-D camera mounted on\
    \ a mobile robot\nplatform and size estimation algorithm for a bunch of grapes.\
    \ The experimental results\npresent an average error in the range of [2.8–3.5]\
    \ (cm). The results demonstrate this solution\nis a feasible method for evaluating\
    \ the productivity of large-scale grape farms.\nThe survey results show that smart\
    \ precision agricultural equipment, such as irriga-\ntion systems, unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles (UAV), and smart agricultural equipment, etc.,\nare conﬁgurable in\
    \ an autonomous-control mode based on certain conditions or can be\ncontrolled\
    \ remotely by the farmer via the Internet [105,106]. Smart precision farming helps\n\
    to improve productivity and production efﬁciency and is suitable for large-scale\
    \ farms.\nNowadays, suppliers of precision agricultural equipment have IoT modules\
    \ built into their\nmachines, allowing machines to operate autonomously and remotely\
    \ via the Internet [107].\n3.4. Greenhouse Production\nA greenhouse consists of\
    \ walls and a roof, which are usually made from transparent\nmaterials, such as\
    \ plastic or glass. In a greenhouse, plants are grown in a controlled\nenvironment,\
    \ including controlling for moisture, nutrient ingredients of the soil, light,\n\
    temperature, etc. Consequently, greenhouse technology makes it possible for humans\
    \ to\ngrow any plant, at any time, by providing suitable environmental conditions\
    \ [108]. Figure 7\nillustrates a smart agriculture IoT system for monitoring greenhouse\

    \ of IoT in the agricultural sector still presents some \nchallenges. We have\
    \ present two main problems: economic efficiency and technical prob-\nlems. We\
    \ consider these issues coupled with policies that will drive the integration\
    \ of IoT \ntechnologies in agriculture. \nFigure 7. An illustration of IoT application\

    \ this solution involves a drive system that allows the sensor system\nto move\
    \ to different locations in the greenhouse. The experimental results show that\
    \ the\nproposed system can effectively monitor multiple points in large greenhouses.\
    \ In [110], the\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n12 of 19\nauthors introduced an energy-saving\
    \ temperature control technology for smart greenhouses.\nThis study proposed two\
    \ intelligent control methods: active disturbance rejection control\nand fuzzy\
    \ active disturbance rejection control. The experimental results demonstrate\n\
    that the proposed technology saves over 15% of the total energy consumption of\
    \ the\ngreenhouse. In [111], the authors designed an intelligent IoT system to\
    \ monitor and\ncontrol greenhouse temperature for energy efﬁciency and improve\
    \ crop productivity. The\nexperimental results for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\
    \ where daytime temperatures can be\nabove 50 ◦C, demonstrate the efﬁciency of\
    \ the proposed solution, including saving energy\nand predicting the rate of plant\
    \ growth.\nRecent studies indicated that solutions integrating IoT, big data processing,\
    \ and artiﬁ-\ncial intelligence could be applied in greenhouses to reduce labour\
    \ and energy efﬁciency.\nMoreover, it also provides direct connections between\
    \ the greenhouse farms and the cus-\ntomer [112–115].\n4. Challenges and Open\
    \ Research Directions\nThe survey results indicate that IoT components for the\
    \ smart agriculture sector,\nincluding hardware and software, have been focused\
    \ on research and achieved many\nbreakthrough results. Several IoT solutions have\
    \ been deployed on large-scale farms/ﬁelds.\nHowever, the widespread deployment\
    \ of IoT in the agricultural sector still presents some\nchallenges. We have present\
    \ two main problems: economic efﬁciency and technical prob-\nlems. We consider\
    \ these issues coupled with policies that will drive the integration of IoT\n\
    technologies in agriculture.\n4.1. Economic Efﬁciency\nIn agricultural economics,\
    \ one of the most important characteristics is a low rate of\nproﬁt of an investment\
    \ project, which presents many risks from natural conditions. The\nbeneﬁt–cost\
    \ of a new technology seeking deployment in agriculture should be carefully\n\
    calculated to ensure a trade-off between the cost of technology implementation\
    \ and the\nproﬁt potential. Therefore, we discuss the economic aspects related\
    \ to IoT implementation\nin smart agriculture.\nThere are several types of costs\
    \ related to the implementation of IoT in agriculture.\nWe divided them into categories,\
    \ including (1) the system initialization cost and (2) the\nsystem operating cost.\
    \ The system initialization cost includes hardware purchases (IoT\ndevices, gateways,\
    \ base station infrastructure). The system operating cost includes service\nregistration\
    \ cost and the cost of labour to manage IoT devices. Furthermore, additional op-\n\
    erating costs include incurred costs from energy consumption, maintenance, data\
    \ exchange\namong IoT devices, gateways and cloud servers. According to the opinion\
    \ of Turgut and\nBoloni [116], the successful deployment of the IoT technologies\
    \ will only happen if the\ncustomer beneﬁts (customers need to know the beneﬁts\
    \ and potential) that IoT systems\nprovide exceed their physical value and privacy\
    \ costs. The businesses participating in the\nIoT domain will proﬁt and achieve\
    \ success. We can describe this process using these two\nconditions, as follows:\n\
    Success o f IoT Applications=\n\x1A Vservice > Cpri + Cuser\nh\n+ Cpay, Farmer\
    \ Bene f its\n(1)\nVin f o + Rpay > Cbusiness\nh\n, Businesses Bene f its\n(2)\n\
    where\nVservice is the expected value received by the IoT service users.\nCpri\
    \ is the cost of the loss of privacy.\nCuser\nh\nis the equipment and hardware\
    \ costs the user pays.\nCpay is the payment for the service fee.\nVin f o is the\
    \ received information value.\nRpay is the received direct payment.\nCbusiness\n\
    h\nis the share of the hardware and maintenance costs of the business.\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n13 of 19\nAccording to the opinion of the service user\
    \ (farmers or the owner of the farm),\nEquation (1) shows that the perceived value\
    \ of the service for the user (Vservice) must be\nhigher than the total of costs,\
    \ including: the cost of the loss of privacy (Cpri), the equipment\nand hardware\
    \ costs the user pays (Cuser\nh\n), and the payments for the service fee (Cpay),\
    \ while\nthe opinion of the service provider, as shown in Equation (2), shows\
    \ that the received\ninformation value (Vin f o) and the received direct payments\
    \ (Rpay) must be higher than the\nshare of the hardware and maintenance costs\
    \ of the business (Cbusiness\nh\n).\nThere is still a gap between service providers\
    \ and service users (farmers or the owner\nof the farm), leading to the slow deployment\
    \ of IoT applications in smart agriculture. In\nterms of the economic aspect,\
    \ the analyzed results show that the need for a support policy\nfrom regulatory\
    \ agencies and governments to allow service providers and service users\nto use\
    \ IoT-based smart agriculture applications in their infancy can be met. As discussed\n\
    in [117], to promote smart agriculture, the European Union has issued supportive\
    \ economic\npolicies, the so-called the European CAP (Common Agricultural Policy),\
    \ whose annual\nbudget amounts to approximately EUR 59 billion and is paid for\
    \ by the nations of the EU.\nIn our view, to be able to apply IoT in the ﬁeld\
    \ of smart agriculture, service costs\n(Cpay) and the operating and system initialization\
    \ cost of IoT (Cuser\nh\n) needs to constantly be\nimproved and optimized to reduce\
    \ the cost of the IoT services for farmers. In addition, IoT\nbusinesses (service\
    \ providers) also need to maximize the value of information obtained\n(Vin f o)\
    \ to improve the proﬁtability of the service providers.\nIn reality, service providers\
    \ may commercially exploit the information received (Vin f o)\nin the period of\
    \ providing services for farms, aiming to encourage the deployment of\nIoT applications\
    \ in smart agriculture. Nowadays, several IoT platform providers allow\nfree registration\
    \ and use of services with some limitation conditions regarding services’\nfunctionality\
    \ and ability processing; the number of connected IoT devices; and the number\n\
    of data stored while premium functions and services charge users a fee.\nIn addition,\
    \ one of the signiﬁcant factors slowing down IoT adoption in agriculture\nis farmers’\
    \ knowledge and ability to use IoT devices. In developed countries, this issue\n\
    can be easily solved due to the accessibility of new technologies of farmers.\
    \ Otherwise, in\ndeveloping countries, where the majority of farmers in rural\
    \ areas have very limited access\nto advanced technologies, this issue is a signiﬁcant\
    \ challenge [118,119].\n4.2. Technical Problems\nInterference: Deploying a huge\
    \ number of IoT devices for smart agriculture can\ncause interference to different\
    \ network systems, especially some IoT networks using short\nspectrum bands such\
    \ as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, and LoRa (See Table 1). Interference can\ndegrade\
    \ system performance as well as reduce the reliability of IoT ecosystems. IoT\n\
    networks that use cognitive technology to reuse unlicensed spectra increase the\
    \ cost of the\ndevice. In our opinion, the advent of the 6G network [120] will\
    \ allow a huge number of\ndevices to connect to the Internet with an extremely\
    \ high access speed and extremely large\nbandwidth. The full interference problem\
    \ of IoT networks will be solved.\nSecurity and Privacy: One of the most important\
    \ problems of applying IoT in smart\nagriculture is the security problem, including\
    \ the protection of data and systems from\nattacks on the Internet. In regard\
    \ to system security, IoT devices’ limited capacity and\nability led to complex\
    \ encryption algorithms that are impossible to implement on IoT\ndevices. As a\
    \ result, IoT systems can be attacked using the Internet to gain system control\n\
    rights; IoT gateways are also attacked via denial of service [121–123]. In addition,\
    \ cloud\nservers can be attacked by data spooﬁng to perform unauthorized tasks\
    \ that affect the\nautonomous farming processes of farms. Cloud infrastructures\
    \ can also be controlled by\nattackers [124,125]. Several issues of detailed IoT\
    \ data privacy and security measures have\nbeen discussed in [126–128]. According\
    \ to Neshenko et al., the IoT data security issue is one\nof the biggest problems\
    \ slowing down IoT adoption in smart agriculture [129].\nRegarding data security,\
    \ the obtained information from IoT systems in farms is col-\nlected, processed,\
    \ and commercially exploited by service providers to varying degrees.\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n14 of 19\nTherefore, one of the most important problems of policies\
    \ regards the validity and legal\nstatus of farm data [130]. In reality, these\
    \ data are of great value when aggregated and\nanalyzed for large-scale agricultural\
    \ activities. Consequently, without policies, the data\nprivacy and security of\
    \ farms can affect the competitive advantage of farmers/farm owners.\nIn our opinion,\
    \ using cryptography coupled with access keys is a possible solution to\nsolve\
    \ this problem. Keys could be made available based on a regional user group and\n\
    to those who contributed to the database. For further complex cases, secure multiparty\n\
    computation can be used, where the homomorphic encryption method [131,132], or\
    \ this\nmethod combined with the blockchain [133], can be applied for the purpose\
    \ of balancing\nprivacy and data utility.\nIn our opinion, the security problems\
    \ of IoT systems will be an exciting research topic\nand garner attention for\
    \ both academia and industry research. An in-depth survey of\nthreats and solutions\
    \ to improve robustness, trust, and privacy for future IoT systems is\npresented\
    \ in [134].\nReliability: Most IoT devices are expected to be deployed outdoors\
    \ (in ﬁelds and\nfarms). Harsh work environments lead to the rapid degradation\
    \ of IoT devices’ quality and\ncan lead to unexpected manufacturer failures. The\
    \ mechanical safety of IoT devices and\nsystems must be ensured so they can withstand\
    \ extremes of weather, such as temperature,\nhumidity, rainstorms, and ﬂoods [135].\
    \ In our opinion, new materials and technologies\nneed to continue to be studied\
    \ to improve the durability of devices.\nThe open problems and challenges discussed\
    \ in this section indicate that for IoT\nto be widely deployed in the smart agriculture\
    \ sector, there are still many issues to be\nsolved. Service providers need to\
    \ reduce the service costs, more effectively exploiting\nthe information collected\
    \ from the farm. On the other hand, farmers need to improve\ntheir skills to be\
    \ able to apply IoT solutions on their farm to enhance productivity and\nfarming\
    \ efﬁciency. Researchers need to continually study and propose optimal solutions\n\
    and technologies to ensure IoT systems’ privacy and security and improve the durability\
    \ of\nIoT devices. These are really major challenges and exciting research topics\
    \ in the future so\nIoT can be widely applied in the smart agriculture sector.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nIn this study, we presented an overview of IoT and big data for\
    \ the smart agriculture\nsector. Several issues related to promoting IoT deployment\
    \ in the agriculture sector have\nbeen discussed in detail. Survey results indicate\
    \ that many studies have been performed\nto apply IoT for smart agriculture, aiming\
    \ to enhance productivity, reduce human labour,\nand improve production efﬁciency.\
    \ The beneﬁts of applying IoT and big data in agriculture\nwere discussed. In\
    \ addition, we also pointed out the challenges we need to overcome\nto be able\
    \ to accelerate the deployment of IoT in smart agriculture. However, there are\n\
    still some challenges that need to be addressed for IoT solutions to be affordable\
    \ for the\nmajority of farmers, including small- and medium-scale farm owners.\
    \ In addition, security\ntechnologies need to be continuously improved, but in\
    \ our opinion, the application of\nIoT solutions for smart agriculture is inevitable\
    \ and will enhance productivity, provide\nclean and green foods, support food\
    \ traceability, reduce human labour, and improve\nproduction efﬁciency. On the\
    \ other hand, this survey also points out some interesting\nresearch directions\
    \ for security and communication technologies for IoT. We think that\nthese will\
    \ be very exciting research directions in the future.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    \ success in health care, smart city,\nindustrial production and so on. Protected\
    \ agriculture is one of the ﬁelds which has broad application\nprospects of IoT.\
    \ Protected agriculture is a mode of highly eﬃcient development of modern agriculture\n\
    that uses artiﬁcial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature,\
    \ to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants.\
    \ This review aims to gain insight into\nthe state-of-the-art of IoT applications\
    \ in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure\nand key technologies.\
    \ Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research\nand\
    \ deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the\
    \ contributions\nmade by diﬀerent academicians and organizations. Selected references\
    \ were clustered into three\napplication domains corresponding to plant management,\
    \ animal farming and food/agricultural\nproduct supply traceability. Furthermore,\
    \ we discussed the challenges along with future research\nprospects, to help new\
    \ researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in\n\
    protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of things; protected agriculture; integrated application; state-of-the-art\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) was ﬁrst developed in 1999 by the\
    \ network radio frequency\nidentiﬁcation (RFID) system proposed by the Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID\nLabs [1]. With the application and development\
    \ of new information technologies, the connotation\nand extension of IoT have\
    \ undergone major changes [2]. IoT can be deﬁned as a huge internet-based\nnetwork\
    \ connecting physical and virtual “things” with standard and interoperable communication\n\
    protocols. To be speciﬁc, everything, such as a sensor and an actuator possessing\
    \ unique identity\nand attribute, exchange messages and communicate with each\
    \ other to realize intelligent positioning,\ntracking, identiﬁcation, perception,\
    \ monitoring and management via kinds of networks anytime and\nanywhere [3]. IoT\
    \ has penetrated pervasively most aspects of human life everywhere such as health\n\
    care, smart home, smart city, industrial control and so on. Agriculture is an\
    \ ideal candidate for the\ndeployment of IoT solutions because it occurs in wide\
    \ areas that need to be continuously monitored\nand controlled [4,5].\nThe concept\
    \ of protected agriculture is relative to open-ﬁeld agriculture. It uses artiﬁcial\
    \ techniques\nto change climatic factors such as natural light, temperature and\
    \ humidity to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals\
    \ and plants, enabling them to grow around the clock.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833;\
    \ doi:10.3390/s19081833\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    2 of 24\nThe environment of protected agriculture is completely or largely artiﬁcially\
    \ controlled andwhich has\nbroken the limits of climate and land conditions for\
    \ the growth of animals and plants to a certain extent.\nSo it is also called\
    \ controllable agriculture. Compared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture\n\
    has more potential to apply IoT technology, because it is less aﬀected by climatic\
    \ and geographical\nfactors. Some mature IoT solutions in other ﬁelds can be transferred\
    \ directly to protected agriculture [6].\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ sensor, wireless communication, cloud computing,\nmachine learning and Big Data\
    \ technologies, IoT technology has emerged and is gradually being\npromoted and\
    \ applied in the protected agriculture ﬁeld [7–9]. It is playing an important\
    \ role in various\nareas of protected agriculture as it is capable of helping\
    \ farmers monitor soil condition, climate change\nand animal and plant health\
    \ [10]. When the environmental factor change beyond the set threshold,\nIoT will\
    \ automatically send a warning message to the administrator to remove the hidden\
    \ danger.\nIt can also control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ carbon dioxide concentration\nand illumination according to the condition of\
    \ crop growth in real time [11,12]. In addition, cameras in\nthe IoT system are\
    \ able to capture crop diseases and insect pests in the greenhouse in real time,\n\
    helping farmers ﬁnd problems and take targeted preventive measures [13]. Through\
    \ GPS, RFID and\nother location-based sensors, goods such as vegetables can be\
    \ tracked and monitored visually during\ntransportation and storage. Supermarket\
    \ managers use smart phone or PC to monitor and predict\nproduct status and the\
    \ demand for getting product on shelves. At the user or consumer end, people can\n\
    query the variety, origin, processing and other farm product information by means\
    \ of the QR code,\nbarcode, etc. IoT for protected agriculture can help create\
    \ an informed, connected, developed and\nadaptable rural community. Low-cost embedded\
    \ devices can improve the interaction between humans\nand the physical world.\
    \ Cloud computing, edge computing, and Big Data can provide valuable analysis\n\
    and support for decisions. In summary, IoT will become an important tool in the\
    \ next few years to\nengage people in embedded agriculture which includes suppliers,\
    \ farmers, technicians, distributors,\nmerchants, consumers and government representatives\
    \ [14,15].\nOn the basis of the potential of IoT applications in protected agriculture\
    \ described in the previous\nparagraphs, this paper aims to identify the current\
    \ state of solutions in these ﬁelds. The IoT fundamental\nstructure in protected\
    \ agriculture is introduced in detail based on agricultural sensors, wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks, cloud computing, edge clouding and machine learning technologies.\
    \ The application of IoT\nin protected agriculture and how it makes contributions\
    \ is displayed. Furthermore, the open issues,\nchallenges, future opportunities\
    \ and development trends are discussed.\nIn this article, a comprehensive and\
    \ profound review of IoT in protected agriculture has been\nexecuted based on\
    \ a survey of real-world deployments and published papers over the past 10 years.\n\
    Firstly, a keyword-based search for conference papers and articles was performed\
    \ mainly from the\nscientiﬁc databases IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and ACM Digital\
    \ as well as from Google Scholar.\nFor search keywords, we used the following\
    \ query: “Internet of Things” and either “greenhouse”\nor “livestock” or “aquaculture“\
    \ or “agriculture“. Then, we ﬁltered out papers referring to IoT but\nnot applied\
    \ to the protected agricultural domain. Finally, we checked these papers selected\
    \ from the\nprevious step and picked out the ﬁnal papers according to the problem\
    \ they addressed, the solution\nproposed, impact achieved (if measurable), tools,\
    \ systems and algorithms used.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\
    \ Section 2 presents the structure of IoT in protected\nagriculture. The key technologies\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture are introduced in Section 3. The three\nimportant\
    \ applications in protected agriculture are summed up in Section 4. We further\
    \ discussed\nthe challenges to be faced and the problems that need to be solved\
    \ for IoT in protected agriculture as\nwell as a few future development directions\
    \ in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 outlines the conclusions of\nthis paper.\n\

    2.1. Simple Review of Previous IoT Structure\nAt present, there is no uniﬁed opinion\
    \ on the structure of IoT. The composition of IoT can be\ndivided into three parts:\
    \ object end, cloud end and network end. Smart items, smart devices and\nlocal\
    \ intelligent systems interact directly with the physical world to form the “object\
    \ end” of IoT\n(also known as “front end”). The cloud computing platform that\
    \ provides computing, storage and\nother resources performs fusion processing\
    \ and intelligent analysis of the sensing data from the object\nend and performs\
    \ execution control to constitute the “cloud end” (also referred to as “back end”)\
    \ of\nIoT. The communication infrastructure of the connection object end and the\
    \ cloud end constitutes the\n“network end” of IoT. According to the diﬀerent functions\
    \ implemented by physical entity services\nin the IoT, IoT architecture established\
    \ by the current service-oriented approach can be divided into\nthe following\
    \ two categories: cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT architecture.\
    \ In the\ncloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ basic physical information\ncollection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information to the cloud, but does not\nprovide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational processing and knowledge\nmining of physical\
    \ information are all implemented in the cloud. One of their typical representatives\n\
    is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the uID center\
    \ of the nonproﬁt\nstandardization organization initiated by the university of\
    \ Tokyo, Japan. As shown in Figure 1,\nits architecture consisted of ucode tags\
    \ such as RFID, bar codes, RF and IR beacons, user terminals,\na ucode resolution\
    \ server and application information servers [16]. For software developers, the\
    \ main\nchallenge in building such systems is how to build a back-end cloud service\
    \ platform that supports\nmassive item information management and data processing.\

    \ \n2.2. Structure of IoT in Protected Agriculture \nBased on the actual situation\
    \ of protected agriculture and the experience of other scholars, we \nproposed\
    \ a five-layer IoT architecture [22]. As shown in Figure 5, these layers are briefly\
    \ described \nbelow: \n(1). Perception layer: This layer consists of various sensors,\
    \ terminal devices, agricultural \nmachinery, wireless sensor network (WSN), RFID\
    \ tags andreaders, etc. The common sensors \nare environmental sensors, animal\
    \ and plant life information sensors and other sensors related \nto agriculture.\
    \ Through these sensors, information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed,\
    \ \nplant diseases, insect pests and animal vital signs can be obtained. The collected\
    \ information is \nsimply processed by the embedded device and uploaded to a higher\
    \ layer through the \nnetwork layer for further processing and analysis. \n(2).\
    \ Network layer: The network layer is the infrastructure of IoT, which includes\
    \ a converged \nnetwork formed by various communication networks and the internet.\
    \ The transmission \nmedium can be wired technology such as CAN bus and RS485\
    \ bus or wireless technology like \nZigbee, Bluetooth, LoRa and NB-IoT. The network\
    \ layer not only transmits various kinds of \nagricultural related information\
    \ collected by the perception layer to the higher layer, but also \nsends the\
    \ control commands of the application layer to the perception layer, so that the\
    \ related \ndevices of the sensing layer take corresponding actions.  \n(3). Middleware\
    \ layer: IoT can provide different types of services for different devices. The\
    \ technical \nspecifications (processor, power supply, communication module) and\
    \ system of each device \nare different and different devices cannot be connected\
    \ and communicated with each other, \nwhich leads to heterogeneity problems. The\
    \ middleware layer aggregates, filters and processes \nreceived data from IoT\
    \ devices, which greatly reduces the processing time and cost of the \nabove issues\
    \ and provides developers with a more versatile tool to build their applications.\
    \ It \nalso simplifies the steps of new service development and new device deployment\
    \ which \nFigure 4. IoT-A IoT framework [21].\n2.2. Structure of IoT in Protected\

    \ layer to the perception layer, so that the related devices of the\nsensing layer\
    \ take corresponding actions.\n(3).\nMiddleware layer: IoT can provide diﬀerent\
    \ types of services for diﬀerent devices. The technical\nspeciﬁcations (processor,\
    \ power supply, communication module) and system of each device\nare diﬀerent\
    \ and diﬀerent devices cannot be connected and communicated with each other,\n\
    which leads to heterogeneity problems. The middleware layer aggregates, ﬁlters\
    \ and processes\nreceived data from IoT devices, which greatly reduces the processing\

    \ Crucial Technologies of IoT in Protected Agriculture\n3.1. Sensor Technology\n\
    Sensor plays an indispensable role in obtaining environment, plant and animal\
    \ information and it\nis also one of the technical bottlenecks in the development\
    \ of IoT. In recent years, sensor technology\nhas rapidly developed with the emergence\
    \ of new materials and methods [23]. The conventional\nenvironment sensors such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, light intensity, heat and gas sensors have been\n\
    relatively mature and widely deployed in protected agriculture. Nowaday, about\
    \ 6000 research and\nproduction organizations engage in sensor research from more\
    \ than 40 countries, including famous\nmanufacturers such as Honeywell, Foxboro,\
    \ ENDEVCO, Bell & Howell and Solartron companies.\nThere are three main types\
    \ of widely used and researched agricultural sensors: physical property type\n\
    sensors, biosensors and micro electro mechanical system sensors (MEMS). The physical\
    \ property type\nsensor realizes the signal conversion through the physical change\
    \ of the sensitivity of the material\nof the sensor itself, which is mainly temperature,\
    \ humidity and gas sensor. The biosensor [24] uses\nthe organism itself as a sensitive\
    \ component to transmit information according to the reaction of the\norganism\
    \ to the outside world and includes enzyme sensor [25], microbial sensor, adaptive\
    \ sensor [26],\netc., which is mainly used to detect pesticide residue, heavy\
    \ metal ion, antibiotic residue and toxic\ngas [27,28]. The MEMS sensor is the\
    \ embodiment of the new generation of research and development\ntechnology in\
    \ the ﬁeld of sensors with small size, low power consumption, low cost and reliability\
    \ [29].\nAlthough sensor technology has made great strides in both principles\
    \ and manufacturing\nprocesses, there are still some open issues. A typical example\
    \ among those open issue is the research\nand development of soil sensors and\
    \ vital sign information sensors of animal and plant, which is an\nurgent conundrum\
    \ to overcome in long time. The complex composition as well as diﬀerent physical\n\
    and chemical properties of soil turn the rapid and situ measurement of soil nitrogen\
    \ and other elements\ninto an international diﬃculty. Since the life process of\
    \ animals and plants is very complicated, in order\nto realize the accurate detection\
    \ of information about their life, it is necessary to make breakthroughs in\n\
    the physical mechanism and measurement model of the life process. Related research\
    \ has been carried\nout using physicochemical properties, spectroscopy, multispectral,\
    \ hyper-spectral, nuclear magnetic\nresonance as well as other detection methods\
    \ [30–33].\nAnother problem is the promotion and application of these sensors.\
    \ For one thing there is still\na lack of uniform technical standards in the collection,\
    \ transmission and the interface with the platform\nand human-computer interaction\
    \ interface; for another, the cost has limited the large scale application\nof\
    \ fresh sensors in intelligent agriculture. Currently, the cost of sensing equipment\
    \ for the collection and\ntransmission of animal and plant status is prohibitively\
    \ expensive for ordinary peasants. The number\nof nodes in a sensor network can\
    \ often reach tens of thousands. To make the sensor network practical,\nthe cost\
    \ of each node must be controlled within $1, but now the price is as high as $80\
    \ [34].\n3.2. Data Transmission Technology\nIn this section, the details of data\
    \ transmission technology are discussed, which is one of the vital\ntechnologies\
    \ for real-time dynamic acquisition of agricultural information. Diﬀerent from\
    \ industrial\napplication, agricultural information acquisition is not demanding\
    \ in timelines and a slight delay in\nthe transmission process has little eﬀect\
    \ on agricultural production.\nCompared with wired transmission technology such\
    \ as ﬁeldbus, wireless communication\ntechnology has advantages of low construction\
    \ and maintenance cost, low power consumption\nand excellent extensibility. Recently,\
    \ most researchers, organizations and manufacturers choose it\nto build up their\
    \ WSN in environment monitoring [35,36], automatic irrigation [37] and remote\n\
    control [38]. As shown in Table 1, the summary of popular wireless technologies\
    \ and basic parameters\nwas presented. Diﬀerent vendors and research institutes\
    \ have developed their own wireless devices\nbased on these wireless protocols,\
    \ which has somewhat increased the heterogeneity of IoT. In addition,\nwireless\
    \ signals of diﬀerent protocols located in the same band can cause mutual interference\
    \ such as\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n8 of 24\nZigBee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth [39].\
    \ Wi-Fi has high communication speed but high power consumption,\nwhich is suitable\
    \ for sensor network deployment at ﬁxed points. Although Bluetooth has high security,\n\
    its communication distance is too short and power consumption is high, which is\
    \ suitable for short-time\nclose-range networking. ZigBee has the advantages of\
    \ low consumption, low cost and self-organization\nand each node can be used as\
    \ a relay station for transmitting data of adjacent nodes. So it easily expands\n\
    the coverage of the sensor network and is an ideal long-distance, large-range\
    \ sensor networking.\nTable 1. Summary of popular wireless technologies and basic\

    \ mW\nIn recent years, the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is one of IoT hotspots\
    \ and\nthought as a novel technology with great development potential, which is\
    \ attributed to its huge\nadvantages such as ultra-long distance communication\
    \ and it can be used as an important complement\nof the traditional wireless local\
    \ area network (WLAN) and mobile cellular mobile communication\ntechnologies (such\
    \ as GSM and GPRS). At this stage, LPWAN has many technical standards, which can\n\
    be classiﬁed into two categories. The ﬁrst is a proprietary patented technology\
    \ that works under\nan unlicensed spectrum, such as LoRa, Sigfox and RPMA. The\
    \ second is a cellular communication\ntechnology that works under a licensed spectrum,\
    \ such as EC-GSM, eMTC and NB-IoT. Due to the use\nof dedicated frequency bands\
    \ and uniﬁed deployment by operators, licensed spectrum technology\nhas carrier-class\
    \ security and low interference characteristics, which forms full network coverage\n\
    and operation [40,41]. The unlicensed spectrum uses the common spectrum without\
    \ paying high\nspectrum costs but requires special handling of co-channel interference.\
    \ There are many beneﬁts of IoT\ndeployments based on LPWAN in the agricultural\
    \ environment. Firstly, the maximum connection\ndistance of the LPWAN terminal\
    \ device to the base station varies from several kilometers to several tens\n\
    of kilometers, which saves the trouble of setting up and maintaining routing devices.\
    \ Compared with\nthe 2.4 GHz band, LPWAN adopts the sub-1GHz band to acquire less\
    \ attenuation and multipath\nfading caused by obstacles and dense surfaces like\
    \ concrete walls [42,43]. Moverover, the sensitivity\nof state of the art LPWAN\
    \ receivers reaches as low as –130 dBm due to modulation techniques such\nas narrowband\
    \ and spread spectrum. Secondly, ultra low power operation is another advantage\
    \ of\nLPWAN which is achieved by duty cycling mechanism, lightweight medium access\
    \ control protocols\nand oﬄoading complex tasks [44]. Thirdly, most LPWAN technologies\
    \ support a large number of\ndevice connections by diversity techniques, adaptive\
    \ channel selection and data rate technologies,\netc. [45]. Finally, the LPWAN\
    \ connects a large number of end devices, while keeping the cost of\nhardware\
    \ below ﬁve dollars [46]. LPWAN technologies target a diverse set of applications\
    \ with varying\nrequirements in protected agriculture and therefore it should\
    \ provide some sort of quality of service\n(QoS) over the same underlying LPWAN\
    \ technology. However, current LPWAN technologies provide\nno or limited QoS.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1833\n9 of 24\nMeanwhile, mobile cellular communication technology\
    \ has undergone four generations of\ntechnology updates and the ﬁfth-generation\
    \ mobile communication technology (5G) was announced in\n2016, which will make\
    \ large ﬁle transfer such as agricultural images and audio a reality and bring\
    \ new\nimpetus to the agricultural IoT. From the perspective of future research,\
    \ the research of wireless sensor\nnetworks focuses mainly on communication, energy\
    \ conservation, network control and its application\nin agricultural monitoring.\n\
    3.3. WSN\nThe WSN consists of a lot of sensor nodes that are usually powered by\
    \ battery and it is a multi-hop\nself-organizing network system formed by wireless\
    \ communication to collaboratively sense, collect and\nprocess various information\
    \ of the perceived object in the network coverage area [47,48]. It can be\ndivided\
    \ into terrestrial WSN and wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN). The agricultural\n\
    sensors are usually planted into soil and lower frequency wireless technologies\
    \ are more selected\ndue to low attenuation in WUSN. Besides, antenna size and\
    \ energy consumption in WUSN is higher\nthan terrestrial WSN [49]. With development\
    \ of LPWAN, IoT may not need a mesh-style WSN with\npower-based routing, where\
    \ one node forwards packets of other nodes.\n3.4. Cloud Computing\nCloud computing\
    \ grew out of distributed computing, parallel processing and grid computing.\n\
    It is an Internet-based computing system that provides hardware services, infrastructure\
    \ services,\nplatform services, software services and storage services to various\
    \ IoT applications. Its essence is\na system for dynamically deploying and allocating/redistributing\
    \ as well as dynamic monitoring\nof virtualized computing and storage resource\
    \ pools, thereby providing users with computing,\ndata storage and platform services\
    \ that meet QoS requirements [50,51]. It played a strong role in\npromoting the\
    \ development of agricultural IoT. Firstly, cloud computing can provide farmers\
    \ with cheap\ndata storage services for text, image, video and other agricultural\
    \ information, which greatly reduces\nthe storage costs of agricultural enterprises\
    \ [52]. Secondly, it is diﬃcult to make direct use of these raw\ndata for making\
    \ decisions based on the technical level of farmers. Agricultural experts can\
    \ only make\naccurate judgments and give suggestions based on quantitative analysis.\
    \ Only cloud computing can\nsupport intelligent large-scale computing systems\
    \ [53,54]. Thirdly, cloud computing could provide\na secure platform for the development\
    \ of various IoT applications such as crop monitoring [55].\n3.5. Edge Computing\n\
    Edge computing refers to a new computing model that performs calculations at the\
    \ edge of the\nnetwork [56]. In the edge computing, the downlink data of the edge\
    \ represents the cloud service,\nthe uplink data represents IoT service and the\
    \ edge of edge computing refers to any computing\nand network resources between\
    \ the data source and the cloud computing center path. Because the\ncomputing\
    \ task is partially migrated to the network edge device, edge hormone can improve\
    \ data\ntransmission performance, ensure real-time processing and reduce the computational\
    \ load of the cloud\ncomputing center. Moreover, edge computing better protects\
    \ data because processing occurs closer to\nthe source than in cloud computing\
    \ [57,58].\n3.6. Machine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a smart way for computers\
    \ to simulate people’s learning activities, acquire\nnew knowledge, continuously\
    \ improve performance and implement their own perfection. In recent\nyears, machine\
    \ learning has achieved great success in algorithm, theory and application [59]\
    \ and have\nbeen combined with other agricultural technologies to maximized crop\
    \ yield while minimizing the input\ncosts [60]. The main machine learning algorithms\
    \ are naïve bayes, discriminant analysis, K-nearest\nneighbor, support vector\
    \ machine (SVM) [61], K-means clusterin, fuzzy clustering, gaussian mixture\n\
    models, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), deep learning [62], decision tree algorithm\
    \ and so on [63].\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n10 of 24\nML can discover the internal\
    \ connection between messy, modelless and complex agricultural\ndata, make accurate\
    \ predictions and provide a theoretical basis for agricultural decision-making.\n\
    Machinelearning technology is playing an important role in crop breeding, disease\
    \ identiﬁcation,\npest and disease prediction, intelligent irrigation planning\
    \ and agricultural expert systems [64–67].\nFor example, ML technology can analyze\
    \ past farmland data, including the performance of crops under\ndiﬀerent climatic\
    \ conditions and the inheritance of a particular phenotype. As well, ML technology\n\
    can explore the association rules and then build a probability model to predict\
    \ which genes are\nmost likely to participate in the expression of a certain good\
    \ trait of the plant, which can help the\nbreeding expert conduct a reasonable\
    \ breeding experiment [68–70]. Kyosuke et al. came up with\na method for detecting\
    \ the maturity of a single intact tomato-based ML, which consisted of three\n\
    steps: pixel-based segmentation, blob-based segmentation and individual fruit\
    \ detection. In the ﬁrst\ntwo steps, decision trees were generated based on features\
    \ such as color, shape, texture and size and\nimage segmentations were conducted\
    \ using the generated trees. Finally, the automatical detection of\nindividual\
    \ fruit in multiple tomatoes was achieved by X-means clustering method. The results\
    \ of the\ntomato detection image test showed that their method achieved a recall\
    \ of 0.80, while the precision\nwas 0.88 [71]. Rahnemoonfar et al. proposed deep\
    \ learning architecture for counting fruits based\non convolutional neural networks.\
    \ They used synthetic images to train the neural network to save\ntime-consuming\
    \ collect and annotate. The network was trained for three epochs on 24,000 synthetic\n\
    images using an Adam optimizer and 100 randomly chosen images were tested. The\
    \ experimental\nresults demonstrated that their method had higher average accuracy\
    \ as comparing with others [72].\n3.7. Big Data\nThe protected agriculture produces\
    \ billions of dynamic, complex and spatial data including soil\ndatabases, greenhouse\
    \ environment data, livestock vaccination records and government investment\n\
    data. Compared with relational data structures that are logically expressed using\
    \ two-dimensional\ntables, agricultural data is more unstructured and has a large\
    \ number of hypermedia elements\nsuch as expert experience, knowledge and agricultural\
    \ models in the form of text, charts, pictures,\nanimations and voice/video [73].\
    \ The “big” of these data can be reﬂected in four dimensions: volume,\nvelocity,\
    \ variety and veracity [74]. Big Data technology is able to ﬁnd out the internal\
    \ links of collected\ndata through information mining and other means, discover\
    \ new information and provide data support\nfor the next operation. The most commonly\
    \ used techniques to deal with Big Data technology are\nimage processing, modeling\
    \ and simulation, machine learning, statistical analysis and geographical\ninformation\
    \ systems (GIS) [75].\n4. IoT Applications in Protected Agriculture\n4.1. Plant\
    \ Management\nCompared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture provides\
    \ a relatively suitable and\ncontrollable environment for crop growth by greenhouse\
    \ technology, which to some extent is free\nfrom the constraints of the natural\
    \ environment and promoted the intensive and eﬃcient use of\nagricultural resources.\
    \ However, spatial and temporal variability of crops’ growth environmental\nparameters\
    \ in the protected agriculture are strong and aﬀect each other [76,77], which\
    \ made it diﬃcult\nto adapt to the growth of diﬀerent types of plants in diﬀerent\
    \ growth stages by traditional cultivation\nand environmental regulation. Therefore,\
    \ it needs higher accuracy in the aspect of monitoring and\ncontrol. Many works\
    \ have attempted to design and test types of monitoring and control systems to\n\
    adjust greenhouse environmental parameters such as air temperature and humidity,\
    \ light intensity\nand CO2 concentration based on IoT and their results have proven\
    \ it is technically and economically\nfeasible [78]. At the low level of IoT development,\
    \ the environmental data were simply processed and\nusually presented in sheet\
    \ and plot form [79,80]. Later, some studies collected huge amounts of data\n\
    to set up various models based on plant growth or greenhouse climate [81–83],\
    \ which contributed\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n11 of 24\nto predicting the crop\
    \ yield and environment parameter changes to help farmers better manage\ngreenhouse.\
    \ CAI et al. developed a low-cost smart greenhouse remote monitor system based\
    \ on IoT.\nThe system used STM32F103 single chip machine and sensors to collect\
    \ environmental information\nand transferred the data to cloud by LPWAN. Security\
    \ link was established with TLS, which reduced\nsystem costs while ensuring the\
    \ security of data transmission. At the same time, they adopted a time\nseries\
    \ database to store data so that tremendous storage space can be saved [84]. He\
    \ et al. have reported\na greenhouse temperature intelligent control system based\
    \ on NB-IoT. The relative error of greenhouse\nenvironmental information collection\
    \ was below 1%, the average control accuracy was 3.57% (±1.0 ◦C),\nthe transmission\
    \ distance was not limited and the automatic regulation of crop growth temperature\n\
    was realized [85].\nNowaday, with the development of cloud computing, ML, etc.,\
    \ IoT solution can easily achieve\nsmart data processing and analyzing at low\
    \ cost and in a convenient way [86,87]. At the same time,\ngreenhouse technology\
    \ has also undergone several generations of upgrades and has now evolved into\n\
    highly mechanized and automated plant factories. Deng et al. have implemented\
    \ a closed-loop control\nsystem in a salad-cultivating plant factory based on\
    \ the kinetic model. Both digital simulation and\nreal-time results demonstrated\
    \ the system can work stably under the internal variations and external\ndisturbances\
    \ [88]. Zamora-Izquierdo et al. developed a smart farming IoT platform based on\
    \ edge and\ncloud computing, which was designed for soilless culture greenhouses\
    \ at low cost. The platform was\ncomposed of local, edge and cloud parts: the\
    \ local part dealt with data gathering and automatic control\nthough Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems, the edge part took main management tasks and could improve the\nstability\
    \ of this systems, the cloud part was in charge of data analytics. Compared with\
    \ a regular\nopen control, the platform saved more than 30% water [89]. Katsoulas\
    \ et al. have designed an\nonline irrigation system for hydroponic greenhouse\
    \ crops and their results indicated it increased\nwater and fertilizer use eﬃciency\
    \ by 100% [90]. Liao et al. implemented a IoT-based system in\nan orchid greenhouse\
    \ to monitor the environmental factors and the growth status of phalaenopsis.\n\
    They developed an image processing algorithm to estimate the leaf area of phalaenopsisthe\
    \ and\nidentiﬁed the relationship between growth of plant leaves and environmental\
    \ factors. The proposed\nsystem could provide quantitative information with high\
    \ spatiotemporal resolution for ﬂoral farmers\nand contribute to updating farming\
    \ strategies for phalaenopsis in the future [91].\nDiseases and insect pests bring\
    \ a great threat to the growth of crops as and traditional technology\nand chemical\
    \ prevention and control has a certain lag and negative impact [92,93]. The rise\
    \ of IoT\nhas brought more eﬃcient and smarter solutions to crop disease and pest\
    \ control. Many types of\nIoT sensors can collect information about location,\
    \ greenhouse environment status, crop growth and\npest situation anywhere in real-time,\
    \ which helps farmers keep track of crop pests and diseases.\nThen, all raw image\
    \ and data are sent to cloud centers and later processed and analyzed by various\n\
    models and algorithms based on diﬀerent diseases and pests [94,95]. Finally, these\
    \ cloud centers\ngenerally provide farmers with the following services: disease\
    \ or pest identiﬁcation, disaster prediction\nand warning and recommended governance\
    \ measures from expert systems. Tirelli et al. proposed\na pest insect trap automatic\
    \ monitoring system using ZigBee technology, which can estimate the\ninsect density\
    \ by collected data from diﬀerent sites and send a warning message to farmers\
    \ when it\nexceeded the set value [96]. Ahouandjinou et al. proposed a pest monitoring\
    \ system which detected\nthe presence of pests by the acquisition of ultrasound\
    \ and assisted others in building up protocols\nfor early exterminate of the pests\
    \ [97]. Foughali et al. presented a potato late blight prevention and\ndecision\
    \ support system using cloud IoT and helped the agriculturists take eﬀective action\
    \ to treat\nthis disease [98]. Both Semios and Spensa Company launched their own\
    \ integrated pest management\nsystem, which was able to count the number of pests\
    \ by images, as well as characterize and capture\nthe insects. At present, pest\
    \ and disease warning research mainly provides medium and long-term\nwarning based\
    \ on historical data, which can provide macro guidance for crop production but\
    \ low\ntimeliness. Therefore, future research should focus on online monitoring\
    \ as well as diagnosis and early\nwarning of agricultural diseases.\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 1833\n12 of 24\n4.2. Animal Farming\nLivestock and aquatic product farming\
    \ is an important part of protected agriculture and an area\nwhere IoT applications\
    \ have achieved good results. To achieve good control eﬀects in animal breeding,\n\
    IoT should not only overcome harsh environmental factors, but also pay attention\
    \ to the eﬀects of animal\nbehaviors [99,100]. IoT have been applied in monitoring\
    \ and management of environment, animal,\nfeed and farming process [101,102].\
    \ The livestock monitoring items include information such as body\ntemperature,\
    \ weight, behavior, exercise volume, food intake, disease information and environmental\n\
    factors, which can help people understand animal’s own physiological and nutritional\
    \ status and\nadaptability to external environmental conditions. In aquaculture,\
    \ management projects focus on water\nquality such as dissolved oxygen content,\
    \ water temperature and pH value [103,104] because water\nquality greatly aﬀects\
    \ the growth of aquatic animals. With animal growth and nutrient optimization\n\
    model and intelligent IoT equipment, it is possible to realiaze automatic feeding\
    \ and optimal control of\nfeeding time and intake according to their growth cycle,\
    \ individual quality, feeding cycle and eating\nsituation [105,106]. The Osborne\
    \ Industrial Company has produced TEAM automated electronic sow\nfeeding (ESF)\
    \ stations including pregnancy stations and estrus detection stations. The ESF\
    \ stations\nidentify the sow through the RFID tags worn by each sow and deliver\
    \ the corresponding quantity\nand type of feed based on information such as parity,\
    \ lyrical condition and gestational age. The estrus\ndetection stations can detect\
    \ rutting sows in the sow population and their detection accuracy is 7%\nhigher\
    \ than the manual ones. Encinas et al. presented a distributed monitoring IoT\
    \ system for\nwater quality monitoring. Their model was able to help ﬁsheries\
    \ acquire water quality parameters\nsuch as pH and temperature data in real time\
    \ to optimize pond resources and prevent unwanted\nconditions [107]. Soto-Zarazu´a\
    \ et al. proposed an automated recirculation tilapia farming system\nbased on\
    \ the fuzzy algorithm. The results of this work showed that it saved water by\
    \ 97.42% and\nthe water quality environmental parameters were controlled within\
    \ the acceptable range of tilapia\nculture [108]. Many researches have focused\
    \ on analysis of animal behavior, health care and diagnosis\nand warning of diseases\
    \ based on IoT [109–111]. Yazdanbakhsh et al. proposed an intelligent livestock\n\
    surveillance system. They attempted many machine learning algorithms to process\
    \ raw data of\nhealthy and ill cows and ﬁnally obtained good results used a wavelet-domain\
    \ ensemble classiﬁer with\n80.8% sensitivity and 80% speciﬁcity [112]. Wens Group,\
    \ the largest livestock breeding enterprise\nin China, took the lead in carrying\
    \ out research on the animal husbandry based on IoT and built\nthe corresponding\
    \ system for monitoring livestock vital signs, behavior and breeding environment\n\
    information [113]. Liu et al. collected a variety of penaeus vannamei information\
    \ such as real-time data\non the culture environment, disease image data and expert\
    \ disease diagnosis and treatment and ﬁnally,\nconstructed a remote intelligent\
    \ diagnosis model based on IoT [114]. Liu et al. proposed a web-based\ncombined\
    \ nutritional model for precisely predicting the growth, feed amount and nitrogen\
    \ phosphorus\noutput of gibel carp [115]. The current online diagnostics and early\
    \ warning of animal diseases is at an\nearly stage due to the lack of corresponding\
    \ sensors and models. With upgrading of hardware and\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms,\
    \ future research should focus on the improvement of Big Data depth\nalgorithm\
    \ and the establishment of comprehensive models of animal behavior and disease.\n\
    A few studies have made in-depth research in monitoring animal odor and hazardous\
    \ gas\nproduced during the breeding process such as ammonia gas and sulfur dioxide\
    \ [116]. Pan developed\nan electronic nose network system for monitoring and real-time\
    \ analysis of odors from livestock\nfarms. They placed e-noses in and around the\
    \ farm to build up a wireless network to measure odor\ncompounds as well as environmental\
    \ parameters [117].\n4.3. Agri-food Supply Chain Traceability\nNowday, agricultural\
    \ products/food safety issues are receiving worldwide attention and their\nsafety\
    \ traceability is one solution accepted by all parties of Agri-food domains. Governments\
    \ in many\ncountries and regions have promulgated laws and regulations to promote\
    \ the establishment of food\ntraceability system and strengthen the supervision\
    \ of agricultural products/food safety. The Agri-food\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    13 of 24\nsupply chain traceability IoT-based system can ensure food safety and\
    \ quality at each link of the\nproduction, from the cropland to the consumer (Figure\
    \ 6), which could help consumers establish\nconﬁdence in food safety and contribute\
    \ to sustainable development of the whole food industry [118].\n \n4.3. Agri-food\

    \  can ensure food safety and quality at each \nlink of the production, from the\
    \ cropland to the consumer (Figure 6), which could help consumers \nestablish\
    \ confidence in food safety and contribute to sustainable development of the whole\
    \ food \nindustry [118].  \n \nFigure 6. Schematic representation of the Agri-food\
    \ supply chain from the grower to consumer. \nIn past years, a lot of countries\
    \ have established the traceability platform for meat,milk, fish and \nagri-food\
    \ products based on IoT [119–121]. However, the fresh food cold chain logistics\
    \ traceability \nhas also drawn widespread attention [122,123]. RFID technology\
    \ still played an important role in \nAgri-food supply chain traceability due\
    \ to its small size and low cost [124]. As a novel technology, \nnear field communication\
    \ (NFC) has been progressively developed and used because of its safe and \nsimple\
    \ operation [125,126]. A common problem in the development of IoT is its asynchronous\
    \ \nheterogeneous data flow and distributed features. This requires the traceability\
    \ system to establish \nuniform and accurate identification naming rules to facilitate\
    \ quick and unique retrieval of \ninformation on a farm product [127]. As the\
    \ deployment of IoT infrastructure is completed, the \nsupply chain will move\
    \ towards virtualization which is no longer required physical contact. The \n\
    virtualization of an agri-food supply chain helps administrators better monitor,\
    \ control, plan and \noptimize food supply chain processes [128]. Wang et al.\
    \ proposed a food safety pre-warning system \nbased on association rules mining\
    \ and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning \nFigure 6. Schematic\

    \ naming rules to facilitate quick and unique retrieval of information\non a farm\
    \ product [127]. As the deployment of IoT infrastructure is completed, the supply\
    \ chain will\nmove towards virtualization which is no longer required physical\
    \ contact. The virtualization of an\nagri-food supply chain helps administrators\
    \ better monitor, control, plan and optimize food supply\nchain processes [128].\
    \ Wang et al. proposed a food safety pre-warning system based on association\n\
    rules mining and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning analysis,\
    \ reaction and\nemergency feedback. First, they accessed food critical information\
    \ through data processing and\nanalysis of food traceability data for safety assessment.\
    \ On this basis of this data, the system used the\nassociated data mining method\
    \ to discover the connection between them and then obtained the food\nsafety risk\
    \ analysis results. Subsequently, the system made a corresponding early warning\
    \ response\nbased on this result [129].\nRecently, the increasing incidents of\
    \ food falsiﬁcation have not only brought about great economic\nlosses, but also\
    \ undermined consumers’ conﬁdence in food safety. The blockchain technology with\n\
    decentralization, non-tamperability, development transparency and machine autonomy\
    \ features\nbrings new solutions to the above problems [130,131]. Tian et al.\
    \ reported a new decentralized\ntraceability system based on IoT and blockchain\
    \ technology, which can provid an open, transparent,\nneutral, safe and reliable\
    \ information platform for producers, governments, consumers and other\nstakeholders\
    \ [132]. Kaijun et al. combined the supply chain and blockchain technology to\
    \ propose\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n14 of 24\na double chain architecture agricultural\
    \ traceability system by studying the dual chain structure and\nits storage mode,\
    \ resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism and consensus algorithm [133].\n\
    Now, with the innovation and maturity of related technologies, it is not diﬃcult\
    \ for researchers to\ndevelop a complete set of traceability systems. The rise\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence technology enables\nexisting traceability systems\
    \ to provide automation, intelligence and human services to businesses\nand consumers.\
    \ Chen et al. adopted fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy rule method to come up with\n\
    an autonomous tracing system for backward design in food supply chain based on\
    \ IoT, which better\ntraced food product problems [134]. However, there are still\
    \ some problems in food safety traceability.\nIt is worth noting that the current\
    \ agricultural product safety traceability system only focuses on\na certain level\
    \ of supply chain or a certain type of goods. With the participation of multiple\
    \ projects\nor multiple sessions, we believe that the focus of future research\
    \ should be on more complex and\nsystematic supply chains.\n5. Disscussion\n5.1.\
    \ Hardware and Software Challenges\nWhen IoT technology is applying in protected\
    \ agriculture, it is inevitable to encounter challenges\nfrom all aspects. In\
    \ the perception layer, various devices must face the harsh and complex greenhouse\n\
    environment. Strong solar radiation, high temperatures, high humidity, strong\
    \ vibrations and other\nhazards can easily damage or destroy sensors or end devices.\
    \ Moreover, the daily activities of livestock\ncan interfere with the work of\
    \ the sensor or execution nodes, resulting in poor detection and control.\nIn\
    \ a general way, the information collection nodes rely on the battery with limited\
    \ power to maintain\nits work because the behavior of frequent battery replacement\
    \ consume a lot of energies and money.\nTherefore, it is an urgent need to make\
    \ great progress in developing low-power acquisition equipment,\nenergy-saving\
    \ sink node routing protocols and energy-balanced communication algorithms [135].\n\
    The devices places in various places generate incalculable data and the storage\
    \ of such data\nis also a huge challenge for some small servers.\nThose agricultural\
    \ IoT data have real-time,\ndynamic, granular and fragmented characteristics,\
    \ which brings great challenges to intermediate\ndesign, data large-scale screening,\
    \ screening, mining, processing and decision analysis techniques.\nMoreover, existing\
    \ databases cannot store unstructured data such as audio, video and images. As\
    \ a result,\nquite a lot real-time sensing data are not fully exploited. Besides,\
    \ some models and algorithms are not\nenough to to reﬂect objective reality, so\
    \ that they cannot eﬀectively guide agricultural production.\n5.2. Network Challenge\n\
    In protected agriculture, the sensor and device need to continuously operate under\
    \ the harsh\nand varied environment and their arrangement is sparse and irregular.\
    \ Compared with the wired\nnetwork with high wiring costs, the wireless network\
    \ has the advantages of low cost, good networking\nﬂexibility and high scalability\
    \ and therefore becomes the main application mode of the current\nmonitoring system.\
    \ Many actual deployments have displayed that common wireless communication\n\
    technologies are aﬀected by temperature, humidity andbuildings or other spatial\
    \ barriers [136–138].\nThe growth of animals and plants changes also result in\
    \ background noise [139] because of the\nmulti-path propagation eﬀects, which\
    \ lows reliability of data transmission. It is easy to isolate a node in\nthe\
    \ original communication network due to low node deployment density and the above\
    \ obstacles in\nprotected agriculture. If this node is responsible for communication\
    \ routing tasks of many devices and\nthis node is damaged and isolated from the\
    \ network, this will cause partial or even paralysis of most of\nthe network.\
    \ Most relevant theories and research needes on the eﬀects of the crop growth,\
    \ the thickness\nand material of wall, and the radio signal transmission loss\
    \ and electromagnetic wave transmission\nbetween soil and air interface, etc.\
    \ To determine the optimal position, height and network topology\nof sensor nodes\
    \ under diﬀerent environmental conditions. On the other hand, ad hoc intelligent\n\
    wireless network technology is needed to reduce or avoid paralysis of large-area\
    \ networks. The rise of\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n15 of 24\nLPWAN may solve e above\
    \ paralysis problems of WLAN due to its long communication distance,\nwhich obviates\
    \ the need for the dense and expensive deployments of relays and gateways altogether.\n\
    However, the cost of erecting LPWAN base stations is high.\nThe process of recording\
    \ various agricultural products’ status from the ﬁeld to the table\ngenerates\
    \ a large amount of data, which brings great challenges to wireless communication\
    \ with\na low transmission rate. At same times, it also brought network nodes\
    \ many problems in energy\ndistribution, data calculation, storage and communication.\
    \ Therefore, there is an urgent need to\ndevelop high-capacity data and real-time\
    \ broadband communication standards for technologies in\ncomplex agricultural\
    \ application environments.\n5.3. Security Challenge\nThe problems of security\
    \ and privacy are thought as crucial challenges in applications of protected\n\
    agriculture due to real-world examples of losses due to vulnerabilities, network\
    \ attacks or privacy issues.\nAs a multi-network heterogeneous converged network,\
    \ it not only has the same security problems as\nsensor networks, mobile communication\
    \ networks and the Interne, but also has its particular issues\nsuch as privacy\
    \ protection issues, authentication and access control issues for heterogeneous\
    \ networks,\nstorage and management of information issues, etc.\nIn the perception\
    \ layer, security threats are mainly against the WSN and RFID. In agricultural\n\
    applications, many of the sensor nodes are deployed in the long-term unsupervised\
    \ farmland\nenvironment and the wireless network itself is open, so the wireless\
    \ transmission is vulnerable to\nexternal interference and illegal users. Coupled\
    \ with the fact that these devices are respectively\nplaced elsewhere, a single\
    \ security measure is not enough [140]. The main threats to WSN include\neavesdropping\
    \ attack, node capture, replay attack and information wiretapping. So multiple\
    \ security\nmechanisms such as anonymity mechanism, data encryption and identity\
    \ authentication mechanisms\nare necessary [141,142].\nThe security threat of\
    \ RFID refers mainly to the attacks that are encountered when the RFID\nreader\
    \ and the tag communicate and such attacks usually lead to user privacy. In addition,\
    \ because the\nRFID tag is rewritable, the security and validity of the RFID tag\
    \ data will not be guaranteed.\nThere are lots of ways to enhance RFID tag security\
    \ such as modifying tag frequency, enciphered data.\nSensor nodes are diﬀerent\
    \ from RFID tag because they are active and relate to the dynamic properties of\n\
    things. Therefore, when applying encryption algorithms, key distribution policies,\
    \ intrusion detection\nmechanisms and security routing policies in speciﬁc devices,\
    \ we need to consider the limitations of\ntheir own hardware.\nSince networks\
    \ of diﬀerent architectures need to be connected to each other, there are even\n\
    greater challenges in terms of security authentication across network architectures.\
    \ The transport\nlayer will encounter the following security challenges: proxy\
    \ attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks,\nmalicious code injection, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, attacks across heterogeneous networks, etc.\nThe common measures dealt\
    \ with these network layer threats and attacks are: authorization,\nauthentication,\
    \ encryption, anti-virus protection, etc. IoT terminal devices in protected agriculture\n\
    have the characteristics of weak computing power and small storage space. Due\
    \ to limited resources,\nIoT encryption technology must be an easy to implement,\
    \ lightweight security technology that is\nsuitable for use in sensitive information\
    \ environments [143,144].\nWhen massive agricultural data is transmitted to the\
    \ application layer, in addition to the intelligent\nprocessing of data, data\
    \ security and privacy should also be considered. At this level, a large amount\n\
    of private data about users is collected, such as the consumption of agricultural\
    \ materials, the purchase\ninformation of fruits and vegetables and the location\
    \ of agricultural machinery. Therefore, the database\naccess control strategy\
    \ should be strengthened on the basis of intelligent data processing. When diﬀerent\n\
    users access the same data, they should limit their permissions and operations\
    \ according to their security\nlevel or identity, eﬀectively ensuring data security\
    \ and privacy. On the other hand, application layer\nservice providers should\
    \ accelerate the development and upgrade of authentication mechanisms\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1833\n16 of 24\nand encryption mechanisms for application scenarios\
    \ such as agricultural production, processing,\ntransportation and consumption.\n\
    5.4. Other Challenges\nThere are other challenges that need to be addressed, which\
    \ are related to the further application of\nIoT technology in protected agriculture.\
    \ Thousands of devices which have huge diﬀerences in processor,\nmemory, communication\
    \ protocol and programming language are deployed in protected agriculture,\nwhich\
    \ inevitably results in heterogeneity issues. Besides, most of devices in protected\
    \ agriculture are\nconnected to the cloud or others by the non-standard heterogeneous\
    \ interfaces [14,22]. This has led\nto problems of both device heterogeneity and\
    \ data heterogeneity. The device heterogeneity problem\naﬀects the scalability\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture and the data heterogeneity problem hinders the\n\
    use of fusion information by models [145]. Although many research institutes,\
    \ hardware and software\nmanufacturers and related organizations have made a lot\
    \ of contributions to the standardization and\ndeployment of IoT in agriculture,\
    \ it still needs to establish a complete and clear structure, protocols and\n\
    standards to connect various heterogeneous devices and services [146,147].\nThe\
    \ cost has always been a barrier to the large-scale application of IoT to ordinary\
    \ farmers,\nespecially in developing countries like China and India. Despite a\
    \ large number of embedded devices\nand platforms have emerged and the cost of\
    \ hardware and software is rapidly decreasing, but here is\nanother situation\
    \ in high-quality and high-precision sensors and devices. Moreover, some funds\
    \ are\nneeded to train farmers to become proﬁcient in the use of IoT equipment.\
    \ In order to be able toplay\na better role in the future, the cost of sensing,\
    \ transmission, analysis and application components and\nequipment on the IoT\
    \ need to further reduce in order to lower the price and make it more aﬀordable\n\
    in the next decade [148]. Government departments should recognize the signiﬁcant\
    \ potential for the\ndevelopment of IoT in protected agriculture and increase\
    \ investment and support through policies and\nfunds to attract more capital and\
    \ achieve rapid development and application.\nIn addition, the usability of the\
    \ terminal device needs to be further improved, for example, the user\ninterface\
    \ needs to be friendlier andthe device needs to be more convenient in size and\
    \ easy to carry.\nIoT brings many beneﬁts to ecological environment and brings\
    \ some problems.. More and\nmore equipment is being placed in agriculture andso\
    \ the issues of environmental friendliness should\nreceive some attention in the\
    \ future. As the e-waste generated by IoT devices and the consumption of\nenergy\
    \ are gradually increasing, the sustainable development of the ecological environment\
    \ is also one\ncommon concern. Examples of interesting research topics include\
    \ the use of degradable materials and\nrenewable energy sources, the reduction\
    \ of equipment size and the use of energy-saving algorithms\nand new green ICT\
    \ technology [149,150].\nThe application of the Internet of Things in facility\
    \ agriculture needs to consider the socio-economic\nconsequences. On the one hand,\
    \ it increases the level of intelligence in agricultural monitoring,\ncontrol\
    \ and decision-making, thereby increasing the eﬃciency and quality of agricultural\
    \ production.\nAt the same time, it will also change the demand for the existing\
    \ agricultural workforce, causing some\npeople who are engaged in simple repetitive\
    \ tasks to lose their jobs, which will cause a series of\nsocial problems.\n5.5.\
    \ Future Prospects\nIoT technology is being applied to many ﬁelds of society,\
    \ economy and life at an unprecedented\nspeed, making human society step into\
    \ a new era of high intelligence. IoT technology is evolving\nand mature, and\
    \ many novel deployments and applications are constantly being built in protected\n\
    agriculture. Based on the above analysis and discussion of the key technologies\
    \ and applications of IoT\nin the protection of agriculture, we will present its\
    \ future development prospects and key research and\ndevelopment directions in\
    \ the following aspects. In the perception layer, the development of sensors\n\
    should focus on new sensitive materials, mechanisms, processes and methodologies\
    \ as well as low\npower consumption and low cost. Besides, we must accelerate\
    \ the development of sensors and rapid\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n17 of 24\ndetection\
    \ devices soil, animal and plant life. At the network layer, we should focus on\
    \ high-capacity data\nreal-time broadband communication standards and technologies\
    \ for complex agricultural application\nenvironments, high-reliability, adaptive,\
    \ low-power network deployment and management strategies\nand algorithms. With\
    \ wide coverage, high capacity, low power consumption and low cost, LPWAN is\n\
    ideal for some agricultural scenarios where text-based, video and voice service\
    \ support is not required\nand coverage, power consumption and cost are critical.\
    \ Future research and deployment should\nfocus on IoT solutions based on LPWAN.\
    \ In the application layer, governments and organizations\nshould develop uniﬁed\
    \ standards for the sensors and identiﬁcation interface devices, data transmission\n\
    communication protocols, multi-source data fusion analysis processing and application\
    \ services in\nprotected agriculture through international cooperation or negotiation.\
    \ Software developers should\ndevelop large open source databases and signal processing\
    \ algorithm libraries for diﬀerent areas\nof facility agriculture. For universities\
    \ and research institutes, cloud-based agricultural intelligent\ndecision-making\
    \ models, multi-source data-based information fusion algorithms, agricultural\
    \ Big Data\nmining technologies, distributed intelligent processing systems and\
    \ lightweight IoT authentication,\nencryption and authorization mechanisms will\
    \ be the key research directions for the future. With an\nincreased presence of\
    \ IoT technology in protected agriculture, its potential for the reﬁned management\n\
    of crop, livestock and aquatic animals will be recognized. Besides, as a technical\
    \ means to monitor\nthe production, processing, circulation and consumption of\
    \ agricultural products, IoTwill play an\nincreasingly important role in food\
    \ safety.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this survey, we present a comprehensive review of\
    \ the state-of-the-art in IoT deployment\nfor protected agriculture applications.\
    \ First, a simple review of previous IoT structure was given.\nSecondly, the basic\
    \ IoT architectures in protected agriculture were introduced. Next, discussions\
    \ of\nsensor, data communication, cloud computing, edge computing, ML and other\
    \ vital IoT technologies\nin protected agriculture are elaborated.\nThen, we highlight\
    \ various IoT applications and their\npotential to solve various farming problems\
    \ in protected agriculture. By classifying the research and\ndeployment literature\
    \ on IoT in protected agriculture, three important application ﬁelds were given:\n\
    plant management, animal farming and agri-food supply chain traceability. Finally,\
    \ a detailed analyses\nof IoT research challenges and future prospects were outlined.\n\
    The survey of the existing works directs us concluding remarks. The future prospects\
    \ of IoT in\nprotected agriculture are expectant, but the challenges mentioned\
    \ above must handle. In order to\ncope with its complex and changing agricultural\
    \ environment, the hardware devices must be fully\nupgraded to further enhance\
    \ their universality, reliability, expansibility, endurance and intelligence\n\
    level, while reducing costs and operative diﬃculty. Secondly, the local network\
    \ must be protected from\ninterference from other networks. In addition, the interoperability,\
    \ ﬁltering and semantic annotation of\ndata generated by the various devices of\
    \ IoT must be realized to a certain extent. Only in this way\ncan we optimize\
    \ the Big Data decision support model by using a large amount of heterogeneous\
    \ data.\nSecurity, anonymity and control over the access rights on the information\
    \ is vital for such a system to\nbe adopted. Finally, the impact of IoT on the\
    \ agroecological environment and social economy should\nbe considered in the application\
    \ of protected agriculture, to realize the sustainable development of\nagricultural\
    \ environment as quick as possible.\nAuthor Contributions: The collection, classiﬁcation\

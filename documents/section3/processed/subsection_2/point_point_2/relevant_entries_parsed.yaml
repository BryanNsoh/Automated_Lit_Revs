  explanation: The passage focuses on the use of edge computing in IoT applications
    within the context of automated irrigation management systems. Specifically, it
    highlights the benefits of using edge computing to reduce latency, enable real-time
    decision-making, and reduce reliance on cloud connectivity. The passage emphasizes
    that edge computing devices can be deployed in a topology and connected to a gateway
    using a communication protocol. Individual or aggregated measurements are received
    by a server where they can be queried, cleaned, and analyzed. Relevant insights
    are then fed back to an end-user or other IoT devices to inform decisions. This
    process can be more efficient and reliable than relying solely on cloud-based
    computing, especially in remote or resource-constrained environments.
  extract_1: Edge computing is becoming more common in commercial IoT products, in
    which onboard device memory and processing capacity is utilized to carry out some
    data reduction and analysis [80]. However, for insights that require a large quantity
    of measurements or computational power, transmitting data to the cloud for computing
    will be required. Table 2 summarizes common IoT data transmission protocols and
    their associated advantages and disadvantages.
  extract_2: The IoT for smallholder agriculture represents a challenge for data transmission
    due to remote locations, with devices distributed over large areas or multiple
    farms that have potentially limited access to electricity and cellular networks.
    Therefore, the range, data rate, and power consumption are important design considerations
    and are compared for the common communication protocols in Figure 5.

    Abstract: With the arrival of new technologies in modern smart factories, automated
    predictive

    maintenance is also related to production robotisation. Intelligent sensors make
    it possible to

    obtain an ever-increasing amount of data, which must be analysed efﬁciently and
    effectively to

    support increasingly complex systems’ decision-making and management. The paper
    aims to review

    the current literature concerning predictive maintenance and intelligent sensors
    in smart factories.

    We focused on contemporary trends to provide an overview of future research challenges
    and

    classiﬁcation. The paper used burst analysis, systematic review methodology, co-occurrence
    analysis

    of keywords, and cluster analysis. The results show the increasing number of papers
    related to key

    researched concepts. The importance of predictive maintenance is growing over
    time in relation

    to Industry 4.0 technologies. We proposed Smart and Intelligent Predictive Maintenance
    (SIPM)

    based on the full-text analysis of relevant papers. The paper’s main contribution
    is the summary and

    overview of current trends in intelligent sensors used for predictive maintenance
    in smart factories.

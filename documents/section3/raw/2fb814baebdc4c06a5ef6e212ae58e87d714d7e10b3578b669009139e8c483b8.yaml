    With the deep combination of both modern information technology and traditional
    agriculture, the era of agriculture 4.0, which takes the form of smart agriculture,
    has come. Smart agriculture provides solutions for agricultural intelligence and
    automation. However, information security issues cannot be ignored with the development
    of agriculture brought by modern information technology. In this paper, three
    typical development modes of smart agriculture (precision agriculture, facility
    agriculture, and order agriculture) are presented. Then, 7 key technologies and
    11 key applications are derived from the above modes. Based on the above technologies
    and applications, 6 security and privacy countermeasures (authentication and access
    control, privacy-preserving, blockchain-based solutions for data integrity, cryptography
    and key management, physical countermeasures, and intrusion detection systems)
    are summarized and discussed. Moreover, the security challenges of smart agriculture
    are analyzed and organized into two aspects: 1) agricultural production, and 2)
    information technology. Most current research projects have not taken agricultural
    equipment as potential security threats. Therefore, we did some additional experiments
    based on solar insecticidal lamps Internet of Things, and the results indicate
    that agricultural equipment has an impact on agricultural security. Finally, more
    technologies (5 G communication, fog computing, Internet of Everything, renewable
    energy management system, software defined network, virtual reality, augmented
    reality, and cyber security datasets for smart agriculture) are described as the
    future research directions of smart agriculture. Published in: IEEE/CAA Journal

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: I. Introduction Agriculture is the primary industry
    in the world, and it plays an important role in social stability and economic
    development [1]. Overcoming the contradiction between the population explosion
    and the limited grain yield is a challenge that motivates an increasing number
    of studies on smart agriculture. The development of agriculture is based on both
    the improvement in productivity and the restrictions of the era, and the progress
    of science and technology drives the revolution of agriculture [2]. Fig. 1 is
    used to help readers understand the characteristics and confronted issues of agriculture
    development (from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture 4.0). • Agriculture 1.0: the
    traditional agricultural era (between 1784 and around 1870) dominated by human
    and animal resources, the main issue of agriculture was the low efficiency of
    operation. • Agriculture 2.0: the era of mechanized agriculture (in the 20th century),
    the main issue was the inefficient use of resources. • Agriculture 3.0: the era
    of high-speed development of automatic agriculture (between 1992 to 2017), the
    main issue was the low level of intelligence. • Agriculture 4.0: the era of smart
    agriculture (which is characterized by unmanned operations, begin at 2017) is
    mainly marked by the use of modern information technology to both serve agriculture
    and develop it intelligently. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References

    \ success in health care, smart city,\nindustrial production and so on. Protected\
    \ agriculture is one of the ﬁelds which has broad application\nprospects of IoT.\
    \ Protected agriculture is a mode of highly eﬃcient development of modern agriculture\n\
    that uses artiﬁcial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature,\
    \ to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants.\
    \ This review aims to gain insight into\nthe state-of-the-art of IoT applications\
    \ in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure\nand key technologies.\
    \ Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research\nand\
    \ deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the\
    \ contributions\nmade by diﬀerent academicians and organizations. Selected references\
    \ were clustered into three\napplication domains corresponding to plant management,\
    \ animal farming and food/agricultural\nproduct supply traceability. Furthermore,\
    \ we discussed the challenges along with future research\nprospects, to help new\
    \ researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in\n\
    protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of things; protected agriculture; integrated application; state-of-the-art\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) was ﬁrst developed in 1999 by the\
    \ network radio frequency\nidentiﬁcation (RFID) system proposed by the Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID\nLabs [1]. With the application and development\
    \ of new information technologies, the connotation\nand extension of IoT have\
    \ undergone major changes [2]. IoT can be deﬁned as a huge internet-based\nnetwork\
    \ connecting physical and virtual “things” with standard and interoperable communication\n\
    protocols. To be speciﬁc, everything, such as a sensor and an actuator possessing\
    \ unique identity\nand attribute, exchange messages and communicate with each\
    \ other to realize intelligent positioning,\ntracking, identiﬁcation, perception,\
    \ monitoring and management via kinds of networks anytime and\nanywhere [3]. IoT\
    \ has penetrated pervasively most aspects of human life everywhere such as health\n\
    care, smart home, smart city, industrial control and so on. Agriculture is an\
    \ ideal candidate for the\ndeployment of IoT solutions because it occurs in wide\
    \ areas that need to be continuously monitored\nand controlled [4,5].\nThe concept\
    \ of protected agriculture is relative to open-ﬁeld agriculture. It uses artiﬁcial\
    \ techniques\nto change climatic factors such as natural light, temperature and\
    \ humidity to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals\
    \ and plants, enabling them to grow around the clock.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833;\
    \ doi:10.3390/s19081833\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    2 of 24\nThe environment of protected agriculture is completely or largely artiﬁcially\
    \ controlled andwhich has\nbroken the limits of climate and land conditions for\
    \ the growth of animals and plants to a certain extent.\nSo it is also called\
    \ controllable agriculture. Compared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture\n\
    has more potential to apply IoT technology, because it is less aﬀected by climatic\
    \ and geographical\nfactors. Some mature IoT solutions in other ﬁelds can be transferred\
    \ directly to protected agriculture [6].\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ sensor, wireless communication, cloud computing,\nmachine learning and Big Data\
    \ technologies, IoT technology has emerged and is gradually being\npromoted and\
    \ applied in the protected agriculture ﬁeld [7–9]. It is playing an important\
    \ role in various\nareas of protected agriculture as it is capable of helping\
    \ farmers monitor soil condition, climate change\nand animal and plant health\
    \ [10]. When the environmental factor change beyond the set threshold,\nIoT will\
    \ automatically send a warning message to the administrator to remove the hidden\
    \ danger.\nIt can also control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ carbon dioxide concentration\nand illumination according to the condition of\
    \ crop growth in real time [11,12]. In addition, cameras in\nthe IoT system are\
    \ able to capture crop diseases and insect pests in the greenhouse in real time,\n\
    helping farmers ﬁnd problems and take targeted preventive measures [13]. Through\
    \ GPS, RFID and\nother location-based sensors, goods such as vegetables can be\
    \ tracked and monitored visually during\ntransportation and storage. Supermarket\
    \ managers use smart phone or PC to monitor and predict\nproduct status and the\
    \ demand for getting product on shelves. At the user or consumer end, people can\n\
    query the variety, origin, processing and other farm product information by means\
    \ of the QR code,\nbarcode, etc. IoT for protected agriculture can help create\
    \ an informed, connected, developed and\nadaptable rural community. Low-cost embedded\
    \ devices can improve the interaction between humans\nand the physical world.\
    \ Cloud computing, edge computing, and Big Data can provide valuable analysis\n\
    and support for decisions. In summary, IoT will become an important tool in the\
    \ next few years to\nengage people in embedded agriculture which includes suppliers,\
    \ farmers, technicians, distributors,\nmerchants, consumers and government representatives\
    \ [14,15].\nOn the basis of the potential of IoT applications in protected agriculture\
    \ described in the previous\nparagraphs, this paper aims to identify the current\
    \ state of solutions in these ﬁelds. The IoT fundamental\nstructure in protected\
    \ agriculture is introduced in detail based on agricultural sensors, wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks, cloud computing, edge clouding and machine learning technologies.\
    \ The application of IoT\nin protected agriculture and how it makes contributions\
    \ is displayed. Furthermore, the open issues,\nchallenges, future opportunities\
    \ and development trends are discussed.\nIn this article, a comprehensive and\
    \ profound review of IoT in protected agriculture has been\nexecuted based on\
    \ a survey of real-world deployments and published papers over the past 10 years.\n\
    Firstly, a keyword-based search for conference papers and articles was performed\
    \ mainly from the\nscientiﬁc databases IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and ACM Digital\
    \ as well as from Google Scholar.\nFor search keywords, we used the following\
    \ query: “Internet of Things” and either “greenhouse”\nor “livestock” or “aquaculture“\
    \ or “agriculture“. Then, we ﬁltered out papers referring to IoT but\nnot applied\
    \ to the protected agricultural domain. Finally, we checked these papers selected\
    \ from the\nprevious step and picked out the ﬁnal papers according to the problem\
    \ they addressed, the solution\nproposed, impact achieved (if measurable), tools,\
    \ systems and algorithms used.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\
    \ Section 2 presents the structure of IoT in protected\nagriculture. The key technologies\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture are introduced in Section 3. The three\nimportant\
    \ applications in protected agriculture are summed up in Section 4. We further\
    \ discussed\nthe challenges to be faced and the problems that need to be solved\
    \ for IoT in protected agriculture as\nwell as a few future development directions\
    \ in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 outlines the conclusions of\nthis paper.\n\

    2.1. Simple Review of Previous IoT Structure\nAt present, there is no uniﬁed opinion\
    \ on the structure of IoT. The composition of IoT can be\ndivided into three parts:\
    \ object end, cloud end and network end. Smart items, smart devices and\nlocal\
    \ intelligent systems interact directly with the physical world to form the “object\
    \ end” of IoT\n(also known as “front end”). The cloud computing platform that\
    \ provides computing, storage and\nother resources performs fusion processing\
    \ and intelligent analysis of the sensing data from the object\nend and performs\
    \ execution control to constitute the “cloud end” (also referred to as “back end”)\
    \ of\nIoT. The communication infrastructure of the connection object end and the\
    \ cloud end constitutes the\n“network end” of IoT. According to the diﬀerent functions\
    \ implemented by physical entity services\nin the IoT, IoT architecture established\
    \ by the current service-oriented approach can be divided into\nthe following\
    \ two categories: cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT architecture.\
    \ In the\ncloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ basic physical information\ncollection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information to the cloud, but does not\nprovide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational processing and knowledge\nmining of physical\
    \ information are all implemented in the cloud. One of their typical representatives\n\
    is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the uID center\
    \ of the nonproﬁt\nstandardization organization initiated by the university of\
    \ Tokyo, Japan. As shown in Figure 1,\nits architecture consisted of ucode tags\
    \ such as RFID, bar codes, RF and IR beacons, user terminals,\na ucode resolution\
    \ server and application information servers [16]. For software developers, the\
    \ main\nchallenge in building such systems is how to build a back-end cloud service\
    \ platform that supports\nmassive item information management and data processing.\
    \ The cloud platforms that have been\nestablished so far mainly include Xively\
    \ and Aneka [17].\nSensors 2018, 18, x FOR PEER REVIEW  \n3 of 25 \n \n2. The\

    \ Crucial Technologies of IoT in Protected Agriculture\n3.1. Sensor Technology\n\
    Sensor plays an indispensable role in obtaining environment, plant and animal\
    \ information and it\nis also one of the technical bottlenecks in the development\
    \ of IoT. In recent years, sensor technology\nhas rapidly developed with the emergence\
    \ of new materials and methods [23]. The conventional\nenvironment sensors such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, light intensity, heat and gas sensors have been\n\
    relatively mature and widely deployed in protected agriculture. Nowaday, about\
    \ 6000 research and\nproduction organizations engage in sensor research from more\
    \ than 40 countries, including famous\nmanufacturers such as Honeywell, Foxboro,\
    \ ENDEVCO, Bell & Howell and Solartron companies.\nThere are three main types\
    \ of widely used and researched agricultural sensors: physical property type\n\
    sensors, biosensors and micro electro mechanical system sensors (MEMS). The physical\
    \ property type\nsensor realizes the signal conversion through the physical change\
    \ of the sensitivity of the material\nof the sensor itself, which is mainly temperature,\
    \ humidity and gas sensor. The biosensor [24] uses\nthe organism itself as a sensitive\
    \ component to transmit information according to the reaction of the\norganism\
    \ to the outside world and includes enzyme sensor [25], microbial sensor, adaptive\
    \ sensor [26],\netc., which is mainly used to detect pesticide residue, heavy\
    \ metal ion, antibiotic residue and toxic\ngas [27,28]. The MEMS sensor is the\
    \ embodiment of the new generation of research and development\ntechnology in\
    \ the ﬁeld of sensors with small size, low power consumption, low cost and reliability\
    \ [29].\nAlthough sensor technology has made great strides in both principles\
    \ and manufacturing\nprocesses, there are still some open issues. A typical example\
    \ among those open issue is the research\nand development of soil sensors and\
    \ vital sign information sensors of animal and plant, which is an\nurgent conundrum\
    \ to overcome in long time. The complex composition as well as diﬀerent physical\n\
    and chemical properties of soil turn the rapid and situ measurement of soil nitrogen\
    \ and other elements\ninto an international diﬃculty. Since the life process of\
    \ animals and plants is very complicated, in order\nto realize the accurate detection\
    \ of information about their life, it is necessary to make breakthroughs in\n\
    the physical mechanism and measurement model of the life process. Related research\
    \ has been carried\nout using physicochemical properties, spectroscopy, multispectral,\
    \ hyper-spectral, nuclear magnetic\nresonance as well as other detection methods\
    \ [30–33].\nAnother problem is the promotion and application of these sensors.\
    \ For one thing there is still\na lack of uniform technical standards in the collection,\
    \ transmission and the interface with the platform\nand human-computer interaction\
    \ interface; for another, the cost has limited the large scale application\nof\
    \ fresh sensors in intelligent agriculture. Currently, the cost of sensing equipment\
    \ for the collection and\ntransmission of animal and plant status is prohibitively\
    \ expensive for ordinary peasants. The number\nof nodes in a sensor network can\
    \ often reach tens of thousands. To make the sensor network practical,\nthe cost\
    \ of each node must be controlled within $1, but now the price is as high as $80\
    \ [34].\n3.2. Data Transmission Technology\nIn this section, the details of data\
    \ transmission technology are discussed, which is one of the vital\ntechnologies\
    \ for real-time dynamic acquisition of agricultural information. Diﬀerent from\
    \ industrial\napplication, agricultural information acquisition is not demanding\
    \ in timelines and a slight delay in\nthe transmission process has little eﬀect\
    \ on agricultural production.\nCompared with wired transmission technology such\
    \ as ﬁeldbus, wireless communication\ntechnology has advantages of low construction\
    \ and maintenance cost, low power consumption\nand excellent extensibility. Recently,\
    \ most researchers, organizations and manufacturers choose it\nto build up their\
    \ WSN in environment monitoring [35,36], automatic irrigation [37] and remote\n\
    control [38]. As shown in Table 1, the summary of popular wireless technologies\
    \ and basic parameters\nwas presented. Diﬀerent vendors and research institutes\
    \ have developed their own wireless devices\nbased on these wireless protocols,\
    \ which has somewhat increased the heterogeneity of IoT. In addition,\nwireless\
    \ signals of diﬀerent protocols located in the same band can cause mutual interference\
    \ such as\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n8 of 24\nZigBee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth [39].\
    \ Wi-Fi has high communication speed but high power consumption,\nwhich is suitable\
    \ for sensor network deployment at ﬁxed points. Although Bluetooth has high security,\n\
    its communication distance is too short and power consumption is high, which is\
    \ suitable for short-time\nclose-range networking. ZigBee has the advantages of\
    \ low consumption, low cost and self-organization\nand each node can be used as\
    \ a relay station for transmitting data of adjacent nodes. So it easily expands\n\
    the coverage of the sensor network and is an ideal long-distance, large-range\
    \ sensor networking.\nTable 1. Summary of popular wireless technologies and basic\

    \ mW\nIn recent years, the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is one of IoT hotspots\
    \ and\nthought as a novel technology with great development potential, which is\
    \ attributed to its huge\nadvantages such as ultra-long distance communication\
    \ and it can be used as an important complement\nof the traditional wireless local\
    \ area network (WLAN) and mobile cellular mobile communication\ntechnologies (such\
    \ as GSM and GPRS). At this stage, LPWAN has many technical standards, which can\n\
    be classiﬁed into two categories. The ﬁrst is a proprietary patented technology\
    \ that works under\nan unlicensed spectrum, such as LoRa, Sigfox and RPMA. The\
    \ second is a cellular communication\ntechnology that works under a licensed spectrum,\
    \ such as EC-GSM, eMTC and NB-IoT. Due to the use\nof dedicated frequency bands\
    \ and uniﬁed deployment by operators, licensed spectrum technology\nhas carrier-class\
    \ security and low interference characteristics, which forms full network coverage\n\
    and operation [40,41]. The unlicensed spectrum uses the common spectrum without\
    \ paying high\nspectrum costs but requires special handling of co-channel interference.\
    \ There are many beneﬁts of IoT\ndeployments based on LPWAN in the agricultural\
    \ environment. Firstly, the maximum connection\ndistance of the LPWAN terminal\
    \ device to the base station varies from several kilometers to several tens\n\
    of kilometers, which saves the trouble of setting up and maintaining routing devices.\
    \ Compared with\nthe 2.4 GHz band, LPWAN adopts the sub-1GHz band to acquire less\
    \ attenuation and multipath\nfading caused by obstacles and dense surfaces like\
    \ concrete walls [42,43]. Moverover, the sensitivity\nof state of the art LPWAN\
    \ receivers reaches as low as –130 dBm due to modulation techniques such\nas narrowband\
    \ and spread spectrum. Secondly, ultra low power operation is another advantage\
    \ of\nLPWAN which is achieved by duty cycling mechanism, lightweight medium access\
    \ control protocols\nand oﬄoading complex tasks [44]. Thirdly, most LPWAN technologies\
    \ support a large number of\ndevice connections by diversity techniques, adaptive\
    \ channel selection and data rate technologies,\netc. [45]. Finally, the LPWAN\
    \ connects a large number of end devices, while keeping the cost of\nhardware\
    \ below ﬁve dollars [46]. LPWAN technologies target a diverse set of applications\
    \ with varying\nrequirements in protected agriculture and therefore it should\
    \ provide some sort of quality of service\n(QoS) over the same underlying LPWAN\
    \ technology. However, current LPWAN technologies provide\nno or limited QoS.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1833\n9 of 24\nMeanwhile, mobile cellular communication technology\
    \ has undergone four generations of\ntechnology updates and the ﬁfth-generation\
    \ mobile communication technology (5G) was announced in\n2016, which will make\
    \ large ﬁle transfer such as agricultural images and audio a reality and bring\
    \ new\nimpetus to the agricultural IoT. From the perspective of future research,\
    \ the research of wireless sensor\nnetworks focuses mainly on communication, energy\
    \ conservation, network control and its application\nin agricultural monitoring.\n\
    3.3. WSN\nThe WSN consists of a lot of sensor nodes that are usually powered by\
    \ battery and it is a multi-hop\nself-organizing network system formed by wireless\
    \ communication to collaboratively sense, collect and\nprocess various information\
    \ of the perceived object in the network coverage area [47,48]. It can be\ndivided\
    \ into terrestrial WSN and wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN). The agricultural\n\
    sensors are usually planted into soil and lower frequency wireless technologies\
    \ are more selected\ndue to low attenuation in WUSN. Besides, antenna size and\
    \ energy consumption in WUSN is higher\nthan terrestrial WSN [49]. With development\
    \ of LPWAN, IoT may not need a mesh-style WSN with\npower-based routing, where\
    \ one node forwards packets of other nodes.\n3.4. Cloud Computing\nCloud computing\
    \ grew out of distributed computing, parallel processing and grid computing.\n\
    It is an Internet-based computing system that provides hardware services, infrastructure\
    \ services,\nplatform services, software services and storage services to various\
    \ IoT applications. Its essence is\na system for dynamically deploying and allocating/redistributing\
    \ as well as dynamic monitoring\nof virtualized computing and storage resource\
    \ pools, thereby providing users with computing,\ndata storage and platform services\
    \ that meet QoS requirements [50,51]. It played a strong role in\npromoting the\
    \ development of agricultural IoT. Firstly, cloud computing can provide farmers\
    \ with cheap\ndata storage services for text, image, video and other agricultural\
    \ information, which greatly reduces\nthe storage costs of agricultural enterprises\
    \ [52]. Secondly, it is diﬃcult to make direct use of these raw\ndata for making\
    \ decisions based on the technical level of farmers. Agricultural experts can\
    \ only make\naccurate judgments and give suggestions based on quantitative analysis.\
    \ Only cloud computing can\nsupport intelligent large-scale computing systems\
    \ [53,54]. Thirdly, cloud computing could provide\na secure platform for the development\
    \ of various IoT applications such as crop monitoring [55].\n3.5. Edge Computing\n\
    Edge computing refers to a new computing model that performs calculations at the\
    \ edge of the\nnetwork [56]. In the edge computing, the downlink data of the edge\
    \ represents the cloud service,\nthe uplink data represents IoT service and the\
    \ edge of edge computing refers to any computing\nand network resources between\
    \ the data source and the cloud computing center path. Because the\ncomputing\
    \ task is partially migrated to the network edge device, edge hormone can improve\
    \ data\ntransmission performance, ensure real-time processing and reduce the computational\
    \ load of the cloud\ncomputing center. Moreover, edge computing better protects\
    \ data because processing occurs closer to\nthe source than in cloud computing\
    \ [57,58].\n3.6. Machine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a smart way for computers\
    \ to simulate people’s learning activities, acquire\nnew knowledge, continuously\
    \ improve performance and implement their own perfection. In recent\nyears, machine\
    \ learning has achieved great success in algorithm, theory and application [59]\
    \ and have\nbeen combined with other agricultural technologies to maximized crop\
    \ yield while minimizing the input\ncosts [60]. The main machine learning algorithms\
    \ are naïve bayes, discriminant analysis, K-nearest\nneighbor, support vector\
    \ machine (SVM) [61], K-means clusterin, fuzzy clustering, gaussian mixture\n\
    models, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), deep learning [62], decision tree algorithm\
    \ and so on [63].\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n10 of 24\nML can discover the internal\
    \ connection between messy, modelless and complex agricultural\ndata, make accurate\
    \ predictions and provide a theoretical basis for agricultural decision-making.\n\
    Machinelearning technology is playing an important role in crop breeding, disease\
    \ identiﬁcation,\npest and disease prediction, intelligent irrigation planning\
    \ and agricultural expert systems [64–67].\nFor example, ML technology can analyze\
    \ past farmland data, including the performance of crops under\ndiﬀerent climatic\
    \ conditions and the inheritance of a particular phenotype. As well, ML technology\n\
    can explore the association rules and then build a probability model to predict\
    \ which genes are\nmost likely to participate in the expression of a certain good\
    \ trait of the plant, which can help the\nbreeding expert conduct a reasonable\
    \ breeding experiment [68–70]. Kyosuke et al. came up with\na method for detecting\
    \ the maturity of a single intact tomato-based ML, which consisted of three\n\
    steps: pixel-based segmentation, blob-based segmentation and individual fruit\
    \ detection. In the ﬁrst\ntwo steps, decision trees were generated based on features\
    \ such as color, shape, texture and size and\nimage segmentations were conducted\
    \ using the generated trees. Finally, the automatical detection of\nindividual\
    \ fruit in multiple tomatoes was achieved by X-means clustering method. The results\
    \ of the\ntomato detection image test showed that their method achieved a recall\
    \ of 0.80, while the precision\nwas 0.88 [71]. Rahnemoonfar et al. proposed deep\
    \ learning architecture for counting fruits based\non convolutional neural networks.\
    \ They used synthetic images to train the neural network to save\ntime-consuming\
    \ collect and annotate. The network was trained for three epochs on 24,000 synthetic\n\
    images using an Adam optimizer and 100 randomly chosen images were tested. The\
    \ experimental\nresults demonstrated that their method had higher average accuracy\
    \ as comparing with others [72].\n3.7. Big Data\nThe protected agriculture produces\
    \ billions of dynamic, complex and spatial data including soil\ndatabases, greenhouse\
    \ environment data, livestock vaccination records and government investment\n\
    data. Compared with relational data structures that are logically expressed using\
    \ two-dimensional\ntables, agricultural data is more unstructured and has a large\
    \ number of hypermedia elements\nsuch as expert experience, knowledge and agricultural\
    \ models in the form of text, charts, pictures,\nanimations and voice/video [73].\
    \ The “big” of these data can be reﬂected in four dimensions: volume,\nvelocity,\
    \ variety and veracity [74]. Big Data technology is able to ﬁnd out the internal\
    \ links of collected\ndata through information mining and other means, discover\
    \ new information and provide data support\nfor the next operation. The most commonly\
    \ used techniques to deal with Big Data technology are\nimage processing, modeling\
    \ and simulation, machine learning, statistical analysis and geographical\ninformation\
    \ systems (GIS) [75].\n4. IoT Applications in Protected Agriculture\n4.1. Plant\
    \ Management\nCompared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture provides\
    \ a relatively suitable and\ncontrollable environment for crop growth by greenhouse\
    \ technology, which to some extent is free\nfrom the constraints of the natural\
    \ environment and promoted the intensive and eﬃcient use of\nagricultural resources.\
    \ However, spatial and temporal variability of crops’ growth environmental\nparameters\
    \ in the protected agriculture are strong and aﬀect each other [76,77], which\
    \ made it diﬃcult\nto adapt to the growth of diﬀerent types of plants in diﬀerent\
    \ growth stages by traditional cultivation\nand environmental regulation. Therefore,\
    \ it needs higher accuracy in the aspect of monitoring and\ncontrol. Many works\
    \ have attempted to design and test types of monitoring and control systems to\n\
    adjust greenhouse environmental parameters such as air temperature and humidity,\
    \ light intensity\nand CO2 concentration based on IoT and their results have proven\
    \ it is technically and economically\nfeasible [78]. At the low level of IoT development,\
    \ the environmental data were simply processed and\nusually presented in sheet\
    \ and plot form [79,80]. Later, some studies collected huge amounts of data\n\
    to set up various models based on plant growth or greenhouse climate [81–83],\
    \ which contributed\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n11 of 24\nto predicting the crop\
    \ yield and environment parameter changes to help farmers better manage\ngreenhouse.\
    \ CAI et al. developed a low-cost smart greenhouse remote monitor system based\
    \ on IoT.\nThe system used STM32F103 single chip machine and sensors to collect\
    \ environmental information\nand transferred the data to cloud by LPWAN. Security\
    \ link was established with TLS, which reduced\nsystem costs while ensuring the\
    \ security of data transmission. At the same time, they adopted a time\nseries\
    \ database to store data so that tremendous storage space can be saved [84]. He\
    \ et al. have reported\na greenhouse temperature intelligent control system based\
    \ on NB-IoT. The relative error of greenhouse\nenvironmental information collection\
    \ was below 1%, the average control accuracy was 3.57% (±1.0 ◦C),\nthe transmission\
    \ distance was not limited and the automatic regulation of crop growth temperature\n\
    was realized [85].\nNowaday, with the development of cloud computing, ML, etc.,\
    \ IoT solution can easily achieve\nsmart data processing and analyzing at low\
    \ cost and in a convenient way [86,87]. At the same time,\ngreenhouse technology\
    \ has also undergone several generations of upgrades and has now evolved into\n\
    highly mechanized and automated plant factories. Deng et al. have implemented\
    \ a closed-loop control\nsystem in a salad-cultivating plant factory based on\
    \ the kinetic model. Both digital simulation and\nreal-time results demonstrated\
    \ the system can work stably under the internal variations and external\ndisturbances\
    \ [88]. Zamora-Izquierdo et al. developed a smart farming IoT platform based on\
    \ edge and\ncloud computing, which was designed for soilless culture greenhouses\
    \ at low cost. The platform was\ncomposed of local, edge and cloud parts: the\
    \ local part dealt with data gathering and automatic control\nthough Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems, the edge part took main management tasks and could improve the\nstability\
    \ of this systems, the cloud part was in charge of data analytics. Compared with\
    \ a regular\nopen control, the platform saved more than 30% water [89]. Katsoulas\
    \ et al. have designed an\nonline irrigation system for hydroponic greenhouse\
    \ crops and their results indicated it increased\nwater and fertilizer use eﬃciency\
    \ by 100% [90]. Liao et al. implemented a IoT-based system in\nan orchid greenhouse\
    \ to monitor the environmental factors and the growth status of phalaenopsis.\n\
    They developed an image processing algorithm to estimate the leaf area of phalaenopsisthe\
    \ and\nidentiﬁed the relationship between growth of plant leaves and environmental\
    \ factors. The proposed\nsystem could provide quantitative information with high\
    \ spatiotemporal resolution for ﬂoral farmers\nand contribute to updating farming\
    \ strategies for phalaenopsis in the future [91].\nDiseases and insect pests bring\
    \ a great threat to the growth of crops as and traditional technology\nand chemical\
    \ prevention and control has a certain lag and negative impact [92,93]. The rise\
    \ of IoT\nhas brought more eﬃcient and smarter solutions to crop disease and pest\
    \ control. Many types of\nIoT sensors can collect information about location,\
    \ greenhouse environment status, crop growth and\npest situation anywhere in real-time,\
    \ which helps farmers keep track of crop pests and diseases.\nThen, all raw image\
    \ and data are sent to cloud centers and later processed and analyzed by various\n\
    models and algorithms based on diﬀerent diseases and pests [94,95]. Finally, these\
    \ cloud centers\ngenerally provide farmers with the following services: disease\
    \ or pest identiﬁcation, disaster prediction\nand warning and recommended governance\
    \ measures from expert systems. Tirelli et al. proposed\na pest insect trap automatic\
    \ monitoring system using ZigBee technology, which can estimate the\ninsect density\
    \ by collected data from diﬀerent sites and send a warning message to farmers\
    \ when it\nexceeded the set value [96]. Ahouandjinou et al. proposed a pest monitoring\
    \ system which detected\nthe presence of pests by the acquisition of ultrasound\
    \ and assisted others in building up protocols\nfor early exterminate of the pests\
    \ [97]. Foughali et al. presented a potato late blight prevention and\ndecision\
    \ support system using cloud IoT and helped the agriculturists take eﬀective action\
    \ to treat\nthis disease [98]. Both Semios and Spensa Company launched their own\
    \ integrated pest management\nsystem, which was able to count the number of pests\
    \ by images, as well as characterize and capture\nthe insects. At present, pest\
    \ and disease warning research mainly provides medium and long-term\nwarning based\
    \ on historical data, which can provide macro guidance for crop production but\
    \ low\ntimeliness. Therefore, future research should focus on online monitoring\
    \ as well as diagnosis and early\nwarning of agricultural diseases.\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 1833\n12 of 24\n4.2. Animal Farming\nLivestock and aquatic product farming\
    \ is an important part of protected agriculture and an area\nwhere IoT applications\
    \ have achieved good results. To achieve good control eﬀects in animal breeding,\n\
    IoT should not only overcome harsh environmental factors, but also pay attention\
    \ to the eﬀects of animal\nbehaviors [99,100]. IoT have been applied in monitoring\
    \ and management of environment, animal,\nfeed and farming process [101,102].\
    \ The livestock monitoring items include information such as body\ntemperature,\
    \ weight, behavior, exercise volume, food intake, disease information and environmental\n\
    factors, which can help people understand animal’s own physiological and nutritional\
    \ status and\nadaptability to external environmental conditions. In aquaculture,\
    \ management projects focus on water\nquality such as dissolved oxygen content,\
    \ water temperature and pH value [103,104] because water\nquality greatly aﬀects\
    \ the growth of aquatic animals. With animal growth and nutrient optimization\n\
    model and intelligent IoT equipment, it is possible to realiaze automatic feeding\
    \ and optimal control of\nfeeding time and intake according to their growth cycle,\
    \ individual quality, feeding cycle and eating\nsituation [105,106]. The Osborne\
    \ Industrial Company has produced TEAM automated electronic sow\nfeeding (ESF)\
    \ stations including pregnancy stations and estrus detection stations. The ESF\
    \ stations\nidentify the sow through the RFID tags worn by each sow and deliver\
    \ the corresponding quantity\nand type of feed based on information such as parity,\
    \ lyrical condition and gestational age. The estrus\ndetection stations can detect\
    \ rutting sows in the sow population and their detection accuracy is 7%\nhigher\
    \ than the manual ones. Encinas et al. presented a distributed monitoring IoT\
    \ system for\nwater quality monitoring. Their model was able to help ﬁsheries\
    \ acquire water quality parameters\nsuch as pH and temperature data in real time\
    \ to optimize pond resources and prevent unwanted\nconditions [107]. Soto-Zarazu´a\
    \ et al. proposed an automated recirculation tilapia farming system\nbased on\
    \ the fuzzy algorithm. The results of this work showed that it saved water by\
    \ 97.42% and\nthe water quality environmental parameters were controlled within\
    \ the acceptable range of tilapia\nculture [108]. Many researches have focused\
    \ on analysis of animal behavior, health care and diagnosis\nand warning of diseases\
    \ based on IoT [109–111]. Yazdanbakhsh et al. proposed an intelligent livestock\n\
    surveillance system. They attempted many machine learning algorithms to process\
    \ raw data of\nhealthy and ill cows and ﬁnally obtained good results used a wavelet-domain\
    \ ensemble classiﬁer with\n80.8% sensitivity and 80% speciﬁcity [112]. Wens Group,\
    \ the largest livestock breeding enterprise\nin China, took the lead in carrying\
    \ out research on the animal husbandry based on IoT and built\nthe corresponding\
    \ system for monitoring livestock vital signs, behavior and breeding environment\n\
    information [113]. Liu et al. collected a variety of penaeus vannamei information\
    \ such as real-time data\non the culture environment, disease image data and expert\
    \ disease diagnosis and treatment and ﬁnally,\nconstructed a remote intelligent\
    \ diagnosis model based on IoT [114]. Liu et al. proposed a web-based\ncombined\
    \ nutritional model for precisely predicting the growth, feed amount and nitrogen\
    \ phosphorus\noutput of gibel carp [115]. The current online diagnostics and early\
    \ warning of animal diseases is at an\nearly stage due to the lack of corresponding\
    \ sensors and models. With upgrading of hardware and\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms,\
    \ future research should focus on the improvement of Big Data depth\nalgorithm\
    \ and the establishment of comprehensive models of animal behavior and disease.\n\
    A few studies have made in-depth research in monitoring animal odor and hazardous\
    \ gas\nproduced during the breeding process such as ammonia gas and sulfur dioxide\
    \ [116]. Pan developed\nan electronic nose network system for monitoring and real-time\
    \ analysis of odors from livestock\nfarms. They placed e-noses in and around the\
    \ farm to build up a wireless network to measure odor\ncompounds as well as environmental\
    \ parameters [117].\n4.3. Agri-food Supply Chain Traceability\nNowday, agricultural\
    \ products/food safety issues are receiving worldwide attention and their\nsafety\
    \ traceability is one solution accepted by all parties of Agri-food domains. Governments\
    \ in many\ncountries and regions have promulgated laws and regulations to promote\
    \ the establishment of food\ntraceability system and strengthen the supervision\
    \ of agricultural products/food safety. The Agri-food\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    13 of 24\nsupply chain traceability IoT-based system can ensure food safety and\
    \ quality at each link of the\nproduction, from the cropland to the consumer (Figure\
    \ 6), which could help consumers establish\nconﬁdence in food safety and contribute\
    \ to sustainable development of the whole food industry [118].\n \n4.3. Agri-food\

    \  can ensure food safety and quality at each \nlink of the production, from the\

    \ confidence in food safety and contribute to sustainable development of the whole\
    \ food \nindustry [118].  \n \nFigure 6. Schematic representation of the Agri-food\
    \ supply chain from the grower to consumer. \nIn past years, a lot of countries\
    \ have established the traceability platform for meat,milk, fish and \nagri-food\
    \ products based on IoT [119–121]. However, the fresh food cold chain logistics\
    \ traceability \nhas also drawn widespread attention [122,123]. RFID technology\
    \ still played an important role in \nAgri-food supply chain traceability due\
    \ to its small size and low cost [124]. As a novel technology, \nnear field communication\
    \ (NFC) has been progressively developed and used because of its safe and \nsimple\
    \ operation [125,126]. A common problem in the development of IoT is its asynchronous\
    \ \nheterogeneous data flow and distributed features. This requires the traceability\
    \ system to establish \nuniform and accurate identification naming rules to facilitate\
    \ quick and unique retrieval of \ninformation on a farm product [127]. As the\
    \ deployment of IoT infrastructure is completed, the \nsupply chain will move\
    \ towards virtualization which is no longer required physical contact. The \n\
    virtualization of an agri-food supply chain helps administrators better monitor,\
    \ control, plan and \noptimize food supply chain processes [128]. Wang et al.\
    \ proposed a food safety pre-warning system \nbased on association rules mining\
    \ and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning \nFigure 6. Schematic\

    \ contact. The virtualization of an\nagri-food supply chain helps administrators\
    \ better monitor, control, plan and optimize food supply\nchain processes [128].\
    \ Wang et al. proposed a food safety pre-warning system based on association\n\
    rules mining and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning analysis,\
    \ reaction and\nemergency feedback. First, they accessed food critical information\
    \ through data processing and\nanalysis of food traceability data for safety assessment.\
    \ On this basis of this data, the system used the\nassociated data mining method\
    \ to discover the connection between them and then obtained the food\nsafety risk\
    \ analysis results. Subsequently, the system made a corresponding early warning\
    \ response\nbased on this result [129].\nRecently, the increasing incidents of\
    \ food falsiﬁcation have not only brought about great economic\nlosses, but also\
    \ undermined consumers’ conﬁdence in food safety. The blockchain technology with\n\
    decentralization, non-tamperability, development transparency and machine autonomy\
    \ features\nbrings new solutions to the above problems [130,131]. Tian et al.\
    \ reported a new decentralized\ntraceability system based on IoT and blockchain\
    \ technology, which can provid an open, transparent,\nneutral, safe and reliable\
    \ information platform for producers, governments, consumers and other\nstakeholders\
    \ [132]. Kaijun et al. combined the supply chain and blockchain technology to\
    \ propose\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n14 of 24\na double chain architecture agricultural\
    \ traceability system by studying the dual chain structure and\nits storage mode,\
    \ resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism and consensus algorithm [133].\n\
    Now, with the innovation and maturity of related technologies, it is not diﬃcult\
    \ for researchers to\ndevelop a complete set of traceability systems. The rise\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence technology enables\nexisting traceability systems\
    \ to provide automation, intelligence and human services to businesses\nand consumers.\
    \ Chen et al. adopted fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy rule method to come up with\n\
    an autonomous tracing system for backward design in food supply chain based on\
    \ IoT, which better\ntraced food product problems [134]. However, there are still\
    \ some problems in food safety traceability.\nIt is worth noting that the current\
    \ agricultural product safety traceability system only focuses on\na certain level\
    \ of supply chain or a certain type of goods. With the participation of multiple\
    \ projects\nor multiple sessions, we believe that the focus of future research\
    \ should be on more complex and\nsystematic supply chains.\n5. Disscussion\n5.1.\
    \ Hardware and Software Challenges\nWhen IoT technology is applying in protected\
    \ agriculture, it is inevitable to encounter challenges\nfrom all aspects. In\
    \ the perception layer, various devices must face the harsh and complex greenhouse\n\
    environment. Strong solar radiation, high temperatures, high humidity, strong\
    \ vibrations and other\nhazards can easily damage or destroy sensors or end devices.\
    \ Moreover, the daily activities of livestock\ncan interfere with the work of\
    \ the sensor or execution nodes, resulting in poor detection and control.\nIn\
    \ a general way, the information collection nodes rely on the battery with limited\
    \ power to maintain\nits work because the behavior of frequent battery replacement\
    \ consume a lot of energies and money.\nTherefore, it is an urgent need to make\
    \ great progress in developing low-power acquisition equipment,\nenergy-saving\
    \ sink node routing protocols and energy-balanced communication algorithms [135].\n\
    The devices places in various places generate incalculable data and the storage\
    \ of such data\nis also a huge challenge for some small servers.\nThose agricultural\
    \ IoT data have real-time,\ndynamic, granular and fragmented characteristics,\
    \ which brings great challenges to intermediate\ndesign, data large-scale screening,\
    \ screening, mining, processing and decision analysis techniques.\nMoreover, existing\
    \ databases cannot store unstructured data such as audio, video and images. As\
    \ a result,\nquite a lot real-time sensing data are not fully exploited. Besides,\
    \ some models and algorithms are not\nenough to to reﬂect objective reality, so\
    \ that they cannot eﬀectively guide agricultural production.\n5.2. Network Challenge\n\
    In protected agriculture, the sensor and device need to continuously operate under\
    \ the harsh\nand varied environment and their arrangement is sparse and irregular.\
    \ Compared with the wired\nnetwork with high wiring costs, the wireless network\
    \ has the advantages of low cost, good networking\nﬂexibility and high scalability\
    \ and therefore becomes the main application mode of the current\nmonitoring system.\
    \ Many actual deployments have displayed that common wireless communication\n\
    technologies are aﬀected by temperature, humidity andbuildings or other spatial\
    \ barriers [136–138].\nThe growth of animals and plants changes also result in\
    \ background noise [139] because of the\nmulti-path propagation eﬀects, which\
    \ lows reliability of data transmission. It is easy to isolate a node in\nthe\
    \ original communication network due to low node deployment density and the above\
    \ obstacles in\nprotected agriculture. If this node is responsible for communication\
    \ routing tasks of many devices and\nthis node is damaged and isolated from the\
    \ network, this will cause partial or even paralysis of most of\nthe network.\
    \ Most relevant theories and research needes on the eﬀects of the crop growth,\
    \ the thickness\nand material of wall, and the radio signal transmission loss\
    \ and electromagnetic wave transmission\nbetween soil and air interface, etc.\
    \ To determine the optimal position, height and network topology\nof sensor nodes\
    \ under diﬀerent environmental conditions. On the other hand, ad hoc intelligent\n\
    wireless network technology is needed to reduce or avoid paralysis of large-area\
    \ networks. The rise of\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n15 of 24\nLPWAN may solve e above\
    \ paralysis problems of WLAN due to its long communication distance,\nwhich obviates\
    \ the need for the dense and expensive deployments of relays and gateways altogether.\n\
    However, the cost of erecting LPWAN base stations is high.\nThe process of recording\
    \ various agricultural products’ status from the ﬁeld to the table\ngenerates\
    \ a large amount of data, which brings great challenges to wireless communication\
    \ with\na low transmission rate. At same times, it also brought network nodes\
    \ many problems in energy\ndistribution, data calculation, storage and communication.\
    \ Therefore, there is an urgent need to\ndevelop high-capacity data and real-time\
    \ broadband communication standards for technologies in\ncomplex agricultural\
    \ application environments.\n5.3. Security Challenge\nThe problems of security\
    \ and privacy are thought as crucial challenges in applications of protected\n\
    agriculture due to real-world examples of losses due to vulnerabilities, network\
    \ attacks or privacy issues.\nAs a multi-network heterogeneous converged network,\
    \ it not only has the same security problems as\nsensor networks, mobile communication\
    \ networks and the Interne, but also has its particular issues\nsuch as privacy\
    \ protection issues, authentication and access control issues for heterogeneous\
    \ networks,\nstorage and management of information issues, etc.\nIn the perception\
    \ layer, security threats are mainly against the WSN and RFID. In agricultural\n\
    applications, many of the sensor nodes are deployed in the long-term unsupervised\
    \ farmland\nenvironment and the wireless network itself is open, so the wireless\
    \ transmission is vulnerable to\nexternal interference and illegal users. Coupled\
    \ with the fact that these devices are respectively\nplaced elsewhere, a single\
    \ security measure is not enough [140]. The main threats to WSN include\neavesdropping\
    \ attack, node capture, replay attack and information wiretapping. So multiple\
    \ security\nmechanisms such as anonymity mechanism, data encryption and identity\
    \ authentication mechanisms\nare necessary [141,142].\nThe security threat of\
    \ RFID refers mainly to the attacks that are encountered when the RFID\nreader\
    \ and the tag communicate and such attacks usually lead to user privacy. In addition,\
    \ because the\nRFID tag is rewritable, the security and validity of the RFID tag\
    \ data will not be guaranteed.\nThere are lots of ways to enhance RFID tag security\
    \ such as modifying tag frequency, enciphered data.\nSensor nodes are diﬀerent\
    \ from RFID tag because they are active and relate to the dynamic properties of\n\
    things. Therefore, when applying encryption algorithms, key distribution policies,\
    \ intrusion detection\nmechanisms and security routing policies in speciﬁc devices,\
    \ we need to consider the limitations of\ntheir own hardware.\nSince networks\
    \ of diﬀerent architectures need to be connected to each other, there are even\n\
    greater challenges in terms of security authentication across network architectures.\
    \ The transport\nlayer will encounter the following security challenges: proxy\
    \ attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks,\nmalicious code injection, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, attacks across heterogeneous networks, etc.\nThe common measures dealt\
    \ with these network layer threats and attacks are: authorization,\nauthentication,\
    \ encryption, anti-virus protection, etc. IoT terminal devices in protected agriculture\n\
    have the characteristics of weak computing power and small storage space. Due\
    \ to limited resources,\nIoT encryption technology must be an easy to implement,\
    \ lightweight security technology that is\nsuitable for use in sensitive information\
    \ environments [143,144].\nWhen massive agricultural data is transmitted to the\
    \ application layer, in addition to the intelligent\nprocessing of data, data\
    \ security and privacy should also be considered. At this level, a large amount\n\
    of private data about users is collected, such as the consumption of agricultural\
    \ materials, the purchase\ninformation of fruits and vegetables and the location\
    \ of agricultural machinery. Therefore, the database\naccess control strategy\
    \ should be strengthened on the basis of intelligent data processing. When diﬀerent\n\
    users access the same data, they should limit their permissions and operations\
    \ according to their security\nlevel or identity, eﬀectively ensuring data security\
    \ and privacy. On the other hand, application layer\nservice providers should\
    \ accelerate the development and upgrade of authentication mechanisms\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1833\n16 of 24\nand encryption mechanisms for application scenarios\
    \ such as agricultural production, processing,\ntransportation and consumption.\n\
    5.4. Other Challenges\nThere are other challenges that need to be addressed, which\
    \ are related to the further application of\nIoT technology in protected agriculture.\
    \ Thousands of devices which have huge diﬀerences in processor,\nmemory, communication\
    \ protocol and programming language are deployed in protected agriculture,\nwhich\
    \ inevitably results in heterogeneity issues. Besides, most of devices in protected\
    \ agriculture are\nconnected to the cloud or others by the non-standard heterogeneous\
    \ interfaces [14,22]. This has led\nto problems of both device heterogeneity and\
    \ data heterogeneity. The device heterogeneity problem\naﬀects the scalability\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture and the data heterogeneity problem hinders the\n\
    use of fusion information by models [145]. Although many research institutes,\
    \ hardware and software\nmanufacturers and related organizations have made a lot\
    \ of contributions to the standardization and\ndeployment of IoT in agriculture,\
    \ it still needs to establish a complete and clear structure, protocols and\n\
    standards to connect various heterogeneous devices and services [146,147].\nThe\
    \ cost has always been a barrier to the large-scale application of IoT to ordinary\
    \ farmers,\nespecially in developing countries like China and India. Despite a\
    \ large number of embedded devices\nand platforms have emerged and the cost of\
    \ hardware and software is rapidly decreasing, but here is\nanother situation\
    \ in high-quality and high-precision sensors and devices. Moreover, some funds\
    \ are\nneeded to train farmers to become proﬁcient in the use of IoT equipment.\
    \ In order to be able toplay\na better role in the future, the cost of sensing,\
    \ transmission, analysis and application components and\nequipment on the IoT\
    \ need to further reduce in order to lower the price and make it more aﬀordable\n\
    in the next decade [148]. Government departments should recognize the signiﬁcant\
    \ potential for the\ndevelopment of IoT in protected agriculture and increase\
    \ investment and support through policies and\nfunds to attract more capital and\
    \ achieve rapid development and application.\nIn addition, the usability of the\
    \ terminal device needs to be further improved, for example, the user\ninterface\
    \ needs to be friendlier andthe device needs to be more convenient in size and\
    \ easy to carry.\nIoT brings many beneﬁts to ecological environment and brings\
    \ some problems.. More and\nmore equipment is being placed in agriculture andso\
    \ the issues of environmental friendliness should\nreceive some attention in the\
    \ future. As the e-waste generated by IoT devices and the consumption of\nenergy\
    \ are gradually increasing, the sustainable development of the ecological environment\
    \ is also one\ncommon concern. Examples of interesting research topics include\
    \ the use of degradable materials and\nrenewable energy sources, the reduction\
    \ of equipment size and the use of energy-saving algorithms\nand new green ICT\
    \ technology [149,150].\nThe application of the Internet of Things in facility\
    \ agriculture needs to consider the socio-economic\nconsequences. On the one hand,\
    \ it increases the level of intelligence in agricultural monitoring,\ncontrol\
    \ and decision-making, thereby increasing the eﬃciency and quality of agricultural\
    \ production.\nAt the same time, it will also change the demand for the existing\
    \ agricultural workforce, causing some\npeople who are engaged in simple repetitive\
    \ tasks to lose their jobs, which will cause a series of\nsocial problems.\n5.5.\
    \ Future Prospects\nIoT technology is being applied to many ﬁelds of society,\
    \ economy and life at an unprecedented\nspeed, making human society step into\
    \ a new era of high intelligence. IoT technology is evolving\nand mature, and\
    \ many novel deployments and applications are constantly being built in protected\n\
    agriculture. Based on the above analysis and discussion of the key technologies\
    \ and applications of IoT\nin the protection of agriculture, we will present its\
    \ future development prospects and key research and\ndevelopment directions in\
    \ the following aspects. In the perception layer, the development of sensors\n\
    should focus on new sensitive materials, mechanisms, processes and methodologies\
    \ as well as low\npower consumption and low cost. Besides, we must accelerate\
    \ the development of sensors and rapid\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n17 of 24\ndetection\
    \ devices soil, animal and plant life. At the network layer, we should focus on\
    \ high-capacity data\nreal-time broadband communication standards and technologies\
    \ for complex agricultural application\nenvironments, high-reliability, adaptive,\
    \ low-power network deployment and management strategies\nand algorithms. With\
    \ wide coverage, high capacity, low power consumption and low cost, LPWAN is\n\
    ideal for some agricultural scenarios where text-based, video and voice service\
    \ support is not required\nand coverage, power consumption and cost are critical.\
    \ Future research and deployment should\nfocus on IoT solutions based on LPWAN.\
    \ In the application layer, governments and organizations\nshould develop uniﬁed\
    \ standards for the sensors and identiﬁcation interface devices, data transmission\n\
    communication protocols, multi-source data fusion analysis processing and application\
    \ services in\nprotected agriculture through international cooperation or negotiation.\
    \ Software developers should\ndevelop large open source databases and signal processing\
    \ algorithm libraries for diﬀerent areas\nof facility agriculture. For universities\
    \ and research institutes, cloud-based agricultural intelligent\ndecision-making\
    \ models, multi-source data-based information fusion algorithms, agricultural\
    \ Big Data\nmining technologies, distributed intelligent processing systems and\
    \ lightweight IoT authentication,\nencryption and authorization mechanisms will\
    \ be the key research directions for the future. With an\nincreased presence of\
    \ IoT technology in protected agriculture, its potential for the reﬁned management\n\
    of crop, livestock and aquatic animals will be recognized. Besides, as a technical\
    \ means to monitor\nthe production, processing, circulation and consumption of\
    \ agricultural products, IoTwill play an\nincreasingly important role in food\
    \ safety.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this survey, we present a comprehensive review of\
    \ the state-of-the-art in IoT deployment\nfor protected agriculture applications.\
    \ First, a simple review of previous IoT structure was given.\nSecondly, the basic\
    \ IoT architectures in protected agriculture were introduced. Next, discussions\
    \ of\nsensor, data communication, cloud computing, edge computing, ML and other\
    \ vital IoT technologies\nin protected agriculture are elaborated.\nThen, we highlight\
    \ various IoT applications and their\npotential to solve various farming problems\
    \ in protected agriculture. By classifying the research and\ndeployment literature\
    \ on IoT in protected agriculture, three important application ﬁelds were given:\n\
    plant management, animal farming and agri-food supply chain traceability. Finally,\
    \ a detailed analyses\nof IoT research challenges and future prospects were outlined.\n\
    The survey of the existing works directs us concluding remarks. The future prospects\
    \ of IoT in\nprotected agriculture are expectant, but the challenges mentioned\
    \ above must handle. In order to\ncope with its complex and changing agricultural\
    \ environment, the hardware devices must be fully\nupgraded to further enhance\
    \ their universality, reliability, expansibility, endurance and intelligence\n\
    level, while reducing costs and operative diﬃculty. Secondly, the local network\
    \ must be protected from\ninterference from other networks. In addition, the interoperability,\
    \ ﬁltering and semantic annotation of\ndata generated by the various devices of\
    \ IoT must be realized to a certain extent. Only in this way\ncan we optimize\
    \ the Big Data decision support model by using a large amount of heterogeneous\
    \ data.\nSecurity, anonymity and control over the access rights on the information\
    \ is vital for such a system to\nbe adopted. Finally, the impact of IoT on the\
    \ agroecological environment and social economy should\nbe considered in the application\
    \ of protected agriculture, to realize the sustainable development of\nagricultural\
    \ environment as quick as possible.\nAuthor Contributions: The collection, classiﬁcation\

    \ lately due to the ever-expanding Internet-of-things\n(IoT) network. It still\
    \ is and continues to be the best practice for implementing complex computational\n\
    applications, emphasizing the massive processing of data. However, the cloud falls\
    \ short due to\nthe critical constraints of novel IoT applications generating\
    \ vast data, which entails a swift response\ntime with improved privacy. The newest\
    \ drift is moving computational and storage resources to\nthe edge of the network,\
    \ involving a decentralized distributed architecture. The data processing\nand\
    \ analytics perform at proximity to end-users, and overcome the bottleneck of\
    \ cloud computing.\nThe trend of deploying machine learning (ML) at the network\
    \ edge to enhance computing applications\nand services has gained momentum lately,\
    \ speciﬁcally to reduce latency and energy consumed while\noptimizing the security\
    \ and management of resources. There is a need for rigorous research efforts\n\
    oriented towards developing and implementing machine learning algorithms that\
    \ deliver the best\nresults in terms of speed, accuracy, storage, and security,\
    \ with low power consumption. This\nextensive survey presented on the prominent\
    \ computing paradigms in practice highlights the latest\ninnovations resulting\
    \ from the fusion between ML and the evolving computing paradigms and\ndiscusses\

    1. Introduction\nThere has been a signiﬁcant progression of computing paradigms\
    \ during recent\ndecades. Cloud computing is perhaps the most well-established,\
    \ which emerged from\nthe requirement of harnessing “computing as a utility”,\
    \ enabling the rapid growth of new\ninternet services [1]. The arrival of the\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) paved the way for vast data\ngeneration, eventually\
    \ leading to big data [2]. Cloud computing was a hot research area\nuntil the\
    \ widespread use of the Internet of Things disclosed all of the centralized paradigm’s\n\
    ﬂaws [1]. With cloud-based deployment, cloud data centers manage the analyzing,\
    \ storing,\nand decision-making of data. As the data volume along with the velocity\
    \ surged, trans-\nferring the big data brought forth by IoT devices to the cloud\
    \ became inefﬁcient, owing\nto bandwidth constraints, and would not meet the time-sensitive\
    \ and ultra-low latency\ndemands of applications and could raise privacy concerns\
    \ as well.\nThe scope of IoT has broadened since its advent and speciﬁes a digital\
    \ interconnection\nof devices and objects, capable of procuring and sharing information\
    \ across platforms for\nadded value [3]. The proliferation of IoT is consorted\
    \ by an increased capacity, reduced\nSensors 2022, 22, 196. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22010196\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 196\n2 of 38\ncommunication\
    \ cost, and astounding technological development. IoT warrants not just\ndevice\
    \ data management, but also information exchange among multidisciplinary plat-\n\
    forms. The huge data procured from numerous smart devices entails sharing to add\
    \ value\nand a comprehensive understanding of the concerned domain. With collaborative\
    \ IoT,\nheterogeneous domains and settings enable sensors, gateways, and services\
    \ to collaborate\nat various levels, enriching the quality of human life while\
    \ improving business processes.\nThe IoT ecosystem extends in scale and complexity,\
    \ encompassing a range of heteroge-\nneous devices that stretch over several layers\
    \ of IoT architecture. As IoT systems partake\nin critical infrastructures, they\
    \ necessitate resilient service operability [4]. IoT applications\nare disparate,\
    \ deployed in healthcare, industries, domotics, smart homes, smart cities,\nsmart\
    \ transportation, etc. The IoT devices are constituted of small, resource-constrained\n\
    smart objects, ineffective at handling complex tasks, which entails task ofﬂoading\
    \ to distant\ncloud servers [5]. The limited storage and computing potential forces\
    \ IoT devices to rely\non cloud data centers [6]. This ensues an increased latency,\
    \ and the intermittent internet\nconnectivity renders IoT devices inept at managing\
    \ time-critical real-time applications.\nThus, the IoT revolution has steered\
    \ new research into decentralized models. In this\ncontext, edge computing emerged,\
    \ intending to bring cloud computing capability to the net-\nwork edge, addressing\
    \ unfolding issues that cannot be ﬁxed by cloud computing solely,\nsuch as latency,\
    \ bandwidth, and connectivity challenges [7]. Correspondingly, numerous\nedge\
    \ computing solutions have been suggested, including Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC)\n\
    and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) [8,9]. Fog computing surfaced as one of the highly\n\
    evolved Edge computing concepts. Fog computing aspires to represent a comprehensive\n\
    framework, allocating resources in sequence along the cloud to the smart devices\
    \ [10].\nThus, it is not a mere cloud extension, as it actively engages in synergizing\
    \ the cloud with\nIoT. In addition, the requisite for sustainable/green computing\
    \ that aids in conserving\nenergy is crucial to IoT devices. As IoT devices have\
    \ energy limitations, it is vital to de-\nvise energy-aware solutions into the\
    \ future [11]. In parallel with technological progress,\nit is imperative to cut\
    \ back on the carbon footprint to limit environmental deterioration\nalongside\
    \ global warming [12]. The exploration of edge paradigms is at its budding phase,\n\
    and innovative viewpoints pertaining to these paradigms that arise in literature\
    \ regularly\nwarrant extensive research [13].\nTable 1 shows the list of acronyms\

    \ to extending applications via the internet as services, as well\nas the software\
    \ and technology that underpins the data centers furnishing these services [1].\n\
    NIST formalizes cloud computing [32] as “a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient,\n\
    on-demand network access to a shared pool of conﬁgurable computing resources (e.g.,\
    \ net-\nworks, servers, storage, applications, and services) which can be rapidly\
    \ provisioned and\nreleased with minimal management effort or service provider\
    \ interaction”. The essential\ncharacteristics of the cloud model include on-demand\
    \ self-service, broad network access, re-\nsource pooling, rapid elasticity, and\
    \ measured service. A cloud infrastructure encompasses\nsoftware and hardware,\
    \ extending vital features of the cloud model.\nThe cloud solutions are procurable\
    \ through the following service models [33]:\n•\nSoftware as a service (SaaS)—the\
    \ cloud provider presents consumers with applications\naccessible via the program\
    \ interface or web browser, and the consumer has limited\ncontrol over user-speciﬁc\
    \ applications.\n•\nPlatform as a service (PaaS)—On the cloud infrastructure,\
    \ the consumers are allowed to\nbuild and distribute applications. They can exercise\
    \ control on applications deployed\nbut not on the cloud infrastructure.\n•\n\
    Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)—The customer is furnished with essential computing\n\
    resources vital to processing, storing, and networking. The user exercises control\
    \ upon\nstorage, applications, and operating systems, but not cloud infrastructure.\

    3.2. Internet-of-Things\nKevin Ashton, co-creator and executive director of the\
    \ Auto-ID Center at the Mas-\nsachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in 1999\
    \ introduced the phrase “Internet of\nThings” [34]. The Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ [35] characterizes an extensive environment\nconnecting heterogeneous physical\
    \ objects to the internet to ﬁne-tune the efﬁciency of\nreal-time ubiquitous applications.\
    \ As per the International Telecommunication Union\n(ITU), the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) is a universal framework that connects things which\nmay be physical as\
    \ well as virtual, distinguished, and incorporated within communi-\ncation networks,\
    \ depending on prevailing and emerging collaborative information and\ncommunication\
    \ technologies (ICT) to facilitate enhanced services [36].\n3.2.1. Essential Features\n\
    The fundamental characteristics of the Internet of Things include [37–40]:\n•\n\
    Interconnectivity—the IoT may be connected to global communication infrastructure.\n\
    •\nThings-related services—IoT is adept at offering physical/virtual things, privacy,\
    \ as\nwell as semantic consistency services within the limits of things.\n•\n\
    Heterogeneity—the IoT devices pertain to diverse hardware platforms and networks.\n\
    •\nConstrained resources—the IoT devices encounter computational and energy restric-\n\
    tions.\n•\nDynamic change—the state of devices and the related environment are\
    \ subject to\ndynamic change.\n•\nUncontrolled environment—the IoT devices are\
    \ deployed in an uncontrolled setting.\n•\nMassive scale—the devices to be monitored\
    \ and those that connect with one another\nare enormous and will continue to surge\
    \ exponentially into the future.\n3.2.2. New Challenges in IoT\nAs billions of\
    \ devices are connected globally, data expands exponentially and accumu-\nlates\
    \ 24/7, driving big data to become the current buzzword [41]. The International\
    \ Data\nCorporation (IDC) estimates that by 2025, IoT devices may reach 41.6 billion\
    \ and create\n79.4 zettabytes of data [42]. The ﬁve Vs of big data [43], namely,\
    \ volume, variety, velocity,\nveracity, and value, pose distinct challenges. In\
    \ the current scenario, the majority of data\nresulting from IoT devices are managed\
    \ by the cloud. The resulting cloud IoT synergy\nposes demands that cannot be\
    \ tackled by the existing cloud computing model alone [44].\nA concise outline\
    \ of challenges that IoT encounters [13,45–48] drives the need for edge and\n\
    fog computing as a solution to manage demands [36] and is outlined as follows:\n\
    •\nLow latency—IoT applications [44] and industrial control systems [49] demand\
    \ low\nlatency within a few milliseconds that can hardly be met by the existing\
    \ cloud model.\n•\nHigh network bandwidth—The escalating amount of IoT devices\
    \ produce sizable\ndata [50], which may be rendered useless due to high bandwidth\
    \ usage to transfer it\nto the cloud or denied due to privacy concerns; hence,\
    \ entails to be dealt with locally.\n•\nLimited resources—numerous IoT-connected\
    \ devices possess limited resources to\ninteract directly with the cloud, demanding\
    \ intensive computation and complex\nprotocols.\n•\nIT and OT convergence—In industrial\
    \ systems, the conﬂuence of information technol-\nogy (IT) and operational technology\
    \ (OT) creates new needs. As ofﬂine systems may\ncause business loss or consumer\
    \ annoyance, contemporary cyber-physical systems\ndemand continual and safe operation.\
    \ Thus, the upgradation of the system software\nand hardware causes concern.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 196\n9 of 38\n•\nIntermittent connectivity—When IoT devices\
    \ have intermittent network connectivity,\nit is difﬁcult to provide uninterrupted\
    \ cloud services to those devices.\n•\nGeographical distribution—the majority\
    \ of IoT devices entail services of comput-\ning and storage that are dispersed\
    \ across large geographic areas, and it is highly\nchallenging to position them\
    \ at a location that meets IoT demands [51].\n•\nContext-awareness—Local contextual\
    \ data must be accessed and processed by IoT\napplications (vehicular networks\
    \ and augmented reality), for which the physical\ndistance between IoT devices\
    \ and the centralized cloud is a hindrance.\n•\nSecurity and privacy—The existing\
    \ cybersecurity solutions prove to be unsatisfactory\nto manage IoT applications\
    \ due to the evolving security challenges [52,53].\n3.3. Mobile Computing\nThe\
    \ computation carried out through mobile phones, tablets, or laptops is noted\
    \ as\nmobile computing. The mobile devices offer substantial beneﬁts to mobile\
    \ users but still\nencounter limitations due to a low processing capability, battery,\
    \ memory due to their\nportable size, and operate at on-and-off network connectivity\
    \ [2]. Along with resource\nconstraints, mobile computing encounters communication\
    \ latency, demand adaptability\nof mobile clients, etc. Thus, these drawbacks\
    \ cause mobile computing to be inept for\napplications with demands for low latency,\
    \ robustness, and when huge data generated\nfrom mobile devices need to be processed\
    \ and stored on it. Moreover, the escalation\nin mobile device utilization increased\
    \ the data ﬂow, causing network congestion. Data\nofﬂoading is a viable solution\
    \ to mitigate the strain on the cellular network [54]. The existing\ndemerits\
    \ of mobile computing can be overcome by integrating it with cloud computing [55].\n\
    The expansion of mobile computing set the stage for and impacted the cloud and\
    \ fog\ncomputing evolution.\n3.4. Mobile Cloud Computing\nNIST states that the\
    \ cloud computing alliance with IoT devices and mobile devices fa-\ncilitates\
    \ data and CPU-intensive applications suitable for the IoT environment [56]. The\
    \ con-\ncept of Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is that it combines cloud computing\
    \ and mobile\napplications with sophisticated computing modules processed on the\
    \ cloud [57]. It enables\ndata processing and storage away from mobile devices,\
    \ beneﬁtting not just smartphones\nand a wide range of mobile subscribers. Major\
    \ computational tasks are moved to the cloud\nwith MCC, improving mobile devices’\
    \ battery life [2]. With MCC being grounded on\nthe notion of mobile ofﬂoading,\
    \ mobile devices entrust storage as well as processing to\nremote units to achieve\
    \ workload mitigation and optimization in terms of energy, cost, and\nlongevity\
    \ [45].\nThe mobile devices’ proliferation entails the efﬁcient management of\
    \ constrained\nresources with MCC, as it operates on the synergy between cloud\
    \ computing and mobile\ncomputing. It is capable of operating data-intensive mobile\
    \ applications as it prevails over\nbattery, memory, and computation power restrictions\
    \ from the user viewpoint. However,\nwith cellular communication, long-distance\
    \ data transmission to/from a core network\nresults in higher latency, jitter,\
    \ and network overhead. This can be overcome if the computa-\ntion, analysis,\
    \ and ﬁltering of data occurs at the proximity of the data source, facilitating\
    \ Fog\nComputing (FC) and MEC [58]. The limited bandwidth, ﬂexibility, and control,\
    \ along with\nan unreliable latency, security, and privacy issues are some challenges\
    \ faced by MCC [28].\nThe partitioning of mobile applications by adaptive ofﬂoading\
    \ during runtime allows\nthe management of computer-intensive units of the application\
    \ [59].\n3.5. Mobile Ad hoc Cloud Computing\nMobile Ad hoc Cloud Computing (MACC)\
    \ is an edge computing paradigm involving\nmobile devices that share resources\
    \ in a dynamic and temporary network facilitated by\ntransport and routing protocols\
    \ [2,58,60]. It offers a decentralized network [61] with\ndynamic mobile devices,\
    \ accommodating devices joining or leaving the network continually.\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 196\n10 of 38\nIt favors environments that lack uninterrupted internet connectivity.\
    \ MACC is the most\ndecentralized, as it comprises mobile devices only.\n3.6.\
    \ Cloud of Things\nThe two concepts of cloud computing and IoT have evolved independently\
    \ through\nthe years in terms of hardware and software. With IoT facing challenges\
    \ due to the process-\ning, battery, and storage capacity, these issues can be\
    \ solved by combining cloud computing\nand IoT [62]. Cloud computing is capable\
    \ of ﬁlling the gaps in IoT regarding computing,\nnetworking, and storage capabilities\
    \ due to the cloud’s virtually unlimited capabilities and\nresources. It can assist\
    \ in implementing numerous IoT applications [63,64]. In the Cloud-\nof-Things\
    \ (CoT), IoT devices constitute a virtualized cloud structure. Here, computing\
    \ is\nperformed over the cloud of pooled resources consisting of IoT devices in\
    \ contrast to mist\ncomputing, where computing is carried out on IoT devices [65].\n\
    3.7. Mist Computing\nMist computing is initiated to include endpoint connected\
    \ devices at the extreme edge\nsuitable for self-aware autonomic systems in the\
    \ near future [2,66]. In the IoT-fog-cloud\ncontinuum, mist computing is the ﬁrst\
    \ computing point to allow computation, storage,\nand networking across fog to\
    \ things. Mist computing forms the superset of MACC, as\nmist, devices, and networking\
    \ are not restricted to mobile devices and ad hoc, respectively.\nIt allows utilizing\
    \ the peripheral component (sensors or actuators) capacity to pre-process\ndata\
    \ before sending them to the fog or cloud layer [67]. Mist computing aids in large-scale\n\
    IoT systems development and enriches computational efﬁciency at the edge of the\
    \ IoT\narchitecture [68].\n3.8. Edge Computing\nDespite the fact that edge computing\
    \ has been mentioned in the literature before\ncloud computing, its signiﬁcance\
    \ grew dramatically with the introduction of IoT and\nthe ensuing demands. Edge\
    \ computing places cloud computing’s services close to the end-\nuser, distinguished\
    \ by a rapid processing and response time [26]. Edge computing denotes\ntechnologies\
    \ that enable computation to be accomplished at the network’s edge, upon\ndownstream\
    \ data for cloud services, and upstream data for IoT services [69]. It unfolds\n\
    the cloud’s network by extending the computation, storage, and resources to the\
    \ edge\nof the network, close to the data source, with the resolve to accomplish\
    \ critical needs of\nreal-time servicing, application intelligence, security,\
    \ and privacy, along with the network’s\nrequirements for low latency and high\
    \ bandwidth [13,27].\nThe signiﬁcant aspects of cloud computing are its ability\
    \ to grasp the big picture,\nprocess vast amounts of data, perform in-depth analyses,\
    \ process data in non-real-time,\nand determine business decisions. Being centralized,\
    \ entire data must be transferred to\nthe cloud with underlying risks of data\
    \ loss and data leakage, as security and privacy\ncannot be ensured, and sensitive\
    \ information is at threat of disclosure [27]. Edge computing\nis an extension\
    \ to cloud computing, which considerably minimizes the volume of data\ntransmitted\
    \ across nodes, lowering transmission costs and the network bandwidth usage.\n\
    It leads to utilization and computing efﬁciency along with energy consumption.\
    \ Edge\ncomputing can be more effective in small-scale, intelligent, real-time\
    \ analyses. It eliminates\nthe risk associated with the network transmission,\
    \ ensuring data security. If data become\ncompromised, it impacts only local data.\
    \ The edge computing architecture is federated,\nwherein edge devices are positioned\
    \ between the cloud and terminal devices to tender\ncloud services to the network’s\
    \ edge [24,70]. As edge computing shifts service provisioning\nfrom the cloud\
    \ to the edge, it favors IoT application demands, enabling IoT devices to\nbe\
    \ more scalable and energy-efﬁcient [71]. The cloud–edge alliance involves a typical\n\
    three-layer model distinguished as the terminal (sensors, cameras, and smartphones),\
    \ edge\n(base stations, access points, routers, switches, and gateways), and cloud\
    \ [27]. In terms of\nSensors 2022, 22, 196\n11 of 38\ndevice types, communication\
    \ protocols, and services, edge computing can be implemented\nin various ways\
    \ [9,13,26].\n3.9. Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC)\nThe Mobile Edge Computing\
    \ standard has been constituted by the European Telecom-\nmunications Standards\
    \ Institute (ETSI) [72], which offers cloud computing and IT function-\nalities\
    \ within the Radio Access Network (RAN) in the vicinity of mobile subscribers\
    \ [71].\nAs of 2017, ETSI renamed “Mobile Edge Computing” to “Multi-Access Edge\
    \ Computing”\ndue to increasing interest in MEC by non-cellular operators [73,74].\
    \ MEC is a continuation\nof mobile computing via edge computing, delivering computation\
    \ and storage to energy\nand resource-constrained mobile devices [2].\nWith Multi-Access\
    \ Edge Computing, a cloud server is deployed at the cellular net-\nwork’s base\
    \ stations. It executes tasks such as enhancing the application’s performance\
    \ and\nminimizing network congestion, bandwidth use, and latency for subscribers\
    \ that cannot\nbe achieved with a conventional network architecture [75–77]. Even\
    \ though the process-\ning and memory capabilities of mobile devices improve,\
    \ they are still not sufﬁcient to\nhandle compute-intensive tasks, which has led\
    \ to MCC and MEC models [78]. The MEC\narchitecture is portrayed in Figure 5.\
    \ MEC considerably reduces the process duration\nand energy demands of mobile\
    \ devices by setting up computational and other resources\nclose to the base stations\
    \ [79]. As base stations serve as crucial access points to several\nIoT devices,\
    \ end devices could be directly serviced with just one hop through MEC [80].\n\
    MEC showcases a low latency, proximity to the user, location awareness, and geographical\n\
    distribution. However, it restraints the need to install a dedicated MEC server\
    \ for MEC\nservices. With the rise in the demand for resources over time, scaling\
    \ is another major\nchallenge [81]. MEC exhibits the reliability, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ and a low latency suitable to\ndiverse applications [82] and outperforms MCC\
    \ comparably [83].\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n12 of 41 \n \nenergy\

    \ They focus on servicing time-sensitive applications operating under\nrestricted\

    \ has been presented in 2009 [101]. The phrase ‘Fog Computing’ has\nbeen propounded\
    \ by Cisco researchers in 2012 [42,102]. Fog computing and cloudlets are\nrelated\

    \ Essential Features \nThe significant trait of fog computing is that the computation,\
    \ communication, and \nstorage tasks are accomplished close to end-users by capitalizing\
    \ on the key attribute of \nfog’s proximity to the edge. The additional characteristics\
    \ of fog computing [15,106] are \noutlined as follows: \n• \nLow latency: The\
    \ proximity of fog nodes to end devices that generate data, such as \nsensors\
    \ and actuators, entails a significantly faster reaction and analysis than from\
    \ \nthe centralized cloud data center. This feature considerably minimizes the\
    \ data \ntransfer across the internet and enables a low latency to manage real-time\
    \ \napplications, notably sensitive to latency and time. \n•\nSave bandwidth:\

    The signiﬁcant trait of fog computing is that the computation, communication,\
    \ and\nstorage tasks are accomplished close to end-users by capitalizing on the\
    \ key attribute of\nfog’s proximity to the edge. The additional characteristics\
    \ of fog computing [15,106] are\noutlined as follows:\n•\nLow latency: The proximity\
    \ of fog nodes to end devices that generate data, such as\nsensors and actuators,\
    \ entails a signiﬁcantly faster reaction and analysis than from\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 196\n14 of 38\nthe centralized cloud data center. This feature considerably\
    \ minimizes the data transfer\nacross the internet and enables a low latency to\
    \ manage real-time applications, notably\nsensitive to latency and time.\n•\n\
    Save bandwidth: As the fog model allows data computation and storage between\n\
    conventional cloud and end nodes, less complex pre-processing tasks are handled\n\
    locally. It dramatically minimizes data transfer across the internet, with endpoints\n\
    offering fast and premium localized computer and storage services. Transferring\
    \ only\nappropriate data to the cloud substantially reduces the network transmission\
    \ and\nbandwidth usage, beﬁtting the big data era.\n•\nMulti-tenancy: On account\
    \ of the vastly virtualized and distributed infrastructure,\nmulti-tenancy in\
    \ a constrained environment is possible.\n•\nSupport for mobility: Due to the\
    \ direct interaction between fog applications and\nmobile devices, more control\
    \ over mobile devices is maintained. Thus, the fog model\nfacilitates better control\
    \ of users along with mobile devices to administrators and\nsatisﬁes mobility\
    \ demands that are location-based and the way information is accessed,\nresulting\
    \ in enhanced system performance and service quality.\n•\nInteraction in real-time:\
    \ Contrary to the cloud, fog applications deliver services in real-\ntime because\
    \ of their low-latency feature.\n•\nContext-awareness: the nodes and end devices\
    \ in the fog setting are aware of the con-\ntextual location.\n•\nGeographically\
    \ wide distribution: The fog model’s decentralized architecture facili-\ntates\
    \ geographically distributed deployment with a large number of widely dispersed\n\
    nodes. It imparts closer data analysis, rapid big data processing, improved decision-\n\
    making potential in real-time and location-based services to consumers.\n•\nWireless\
    \ access networking: Though fog is deployed in wired environments, it is also\n\
    suitable for IoT wireless networks.\n•\nSupport for heterogeneity: The fog infrastructure\
    \ encompasses high-speed lines to\nthe data center and wireless access methods\
    \ to the edge devices. Fog nodes are avail-\nable physically or virtually, and\
    \ service interfaces are incredibly dynamic, operating\nin wired and wireless\
    \ settings coming from different hardware and software ven-\ndors and heterogeneous\
    \ to cater to the low latency demand of globally distributed\napplications.\n\
    •\nSeamless interoperability and federation: Owing to its heterogeneous nature,\
    \ fog\nnodes and devices originate from various vendors and are generally deployed\
    \ in di-\nverse settings. For the effective interaction of devices from different\
    \ providers, fog\ncomputing must enable interoperability with federated services\
    \ across domains. Thus,\nto allow interoperability and cooperation across diverse\
    \ resources and devices, fog\ncomputing employs policies for resource management.\n\
    •\nReal-time analytics: With data collected and processed close to the sources,\

    \ and adaptability to varying conditions\nwith the data load, resource pooling,\
    \ network demands, and ﬂexible computing.\n•\nSupport for industrial applications:\
    \ As computing and analyses are conducted in real-\ntime, industrial applications\

    An individual device or IoT could be a fog device, server, or gateway. The fog\

    \ sensors tracking temperature\nand humidity, etc. Alongside physical sensors,\
    \ the physical layer also comprises virtual\nsensors, which also produce data\
    \ as well.\nb.\nFog device, server, and gateway layer\nAn individual device or\
    \ IoT could be a fog device, server, or gateway. The fog server\nentails conﬁguration,\
    \ computation, and storage capabilities, higher comparably in order to\nhandle\
    \ the fog device and gateway. It further pertains to hardware conﬁguration, devices\n\

    \ and servers is in charge of handling and servicing data on storage and\nhardware\
    \ conﬁguration and connectivity for the fog servers and devices. The processing\n\
    demands of different applications are addressed at this layer.\nc.\nMonitoring\
    \ layer\nThe system operation, services, resources, and responses are tracked\
    \ by the monitoring\nlayer, which facilitates identifying appropriate resources\
    \ in the midst of the operation. If\na possibility arises for the fog device as\
    \ well as the fog server where resource availability\nSensors 2022, 22, 196\n\
    18 of 38\nbecomes negative for processing or storage, assistance from peers may\
    \ be sought. The sys-\ntem monitoring unit aids in efﬁcient decision making in\
    \ such unforeseen scenarios and\nresource failure by tracking the present resource\
    \ consumption, usage and then estimating\nresource demands into the future. The\
    \ performance prediction component tracks and\nforecasts the performance of the\
    \ fog system depending on the resource availability and\nsystem load. This unit\
    \ is necessary to keep up with the relevant Quality of Service (QoS)\ndemands\
    \ in SLA (service level agreements). The occurrence of repeated SLA violations\
    \ may\nincrease system costs due to penalties for the provider. Even though this\
    \ issue cannot be\ncompletely ruled out, SLA violations can be greatly reduced\
    \ if the performance prediction\ncomponent foresees the system’s performance and\
    \ usage.\nd.\nPre- and post-processing layer\nThe multiple components of this\
    \ layer are distinctly concerned with the data analysis\nat the basic as well\
    \ as advanced levels. The data accumulated are subjected to analysis and\nﬁltering\
    \ with trimming alongside a reconstruction performed when needed. Once data\n\
    processing is accomplished, the component called data ﬂow ﬁnalizes the process\
    \ if the data\nhave to be stored locally or in the cloud. Fog computing insists\
    \ on stream processing,\nwhich processes and stores minimum relevant data at the\
    \ edge, as all data generated may\nnot be useful. As per the application, requisite\
    \ data trimming can be performed where\nthe mean value of the data within a minute\
    \ or hour could be stored if the sensor produces\ndata every second. In instances\
    \ where data values do not differ signiﬁcantly over time\nbut tend to affect performance,\
    \ the number of readings taken can be reduced. Though\nperfect accuracy would\
    \ not be achievable, application requisites may be attained. The data\nreconstruction\
    \ module reconstructs the data as per the pattern in which data is generated\n\
    in times of incomplete and faulty data produced by sensors to avoid application\
    \ failure or\nan interruption.\ne.\nStorage layer\nThe storage module is accountable\
    \ for data storage by storage virtualization. The unit\nreferred to as the data\
    \ backup afﬁrms data availability and minimizes data loss caused by\nsystem failure\
    \ by creating a backup of critical data. It also periodically customizes schemes\n\
    of data backups. By storage virtualization, a collection of storage devices functions\
    \ as\na single device, enabling manageability and maintainability; thus, offering\
    \ an enterprise-\nlevel operation, at low-cost hardware and storage.\nf.\nResource\
    \ management layer\nThe resource management layer addresses resource allocation,\
    \ resource scheduling,\nand energy saving. The reliability unit at this layer\
    \ ensures the application of scheduling\nreliability, system reliability, and\
    \ the allocation of resources. Maintaining reliability is\ncritical, as a complex\
    \ fog system encompasses IoT and fog devices alongside the cloud\nwith many failure\
    \ possibilities. The scalability component assures that the fog resources\nare\
    \ scalable when resource demand surges at peak hours. The fog model aspires to\
    \ offer\nhorizontal as well as vertical scalability, while the cloud platform\
    \ ensures horizontal scal-\nability. With distributed resources for processing,\
    \ networking, and storage, the resource\nallocation unit allocates, deallocates,\
    \ and reallocates resources. As multiple applications\nare run concurrently in\
    \ fog systems, the scheduling of applications is managed by the ap-\nplication\
    \ scheduling component. The energy-efﬁcient resource management is handled by\n\
    an energy-saving component at this layer, which reduces operational costs.\ng.\n\
    Security layer\nThe security layer deals with all issues that relate to security,\
    \ such as encrypting\ncommunication, securing stored data, preserving fog users’\
    \ privacy, etc. Similar to cloud\ncomputing, fog computing is deliberated as a\
    \ utility model. As users connect to the cloud\nfor availing services, users also\
    \ connect to the fog system for services; however, the fog\nmiddleware manages\
    \ interactions with the cloud. The provider must authorize the user\nattempting\
    \ the service connection, and the authentication unit authenticates the user’s\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 196\n19 of 38\nrequest to avail fog service. To ensure security\
    \ and evade security breaches by intruders,\nevery interaction has to be encrypted.\
    \ The component of encryption encrypts the connection\nbetween IoT devices and\
    \ the cloud. The majority of fog components is connected wirelessly,\nand ensures\
    \ security is critical. Fog systems acting on users’ private data should not reveal\n\
    those without proper user approval. At times where users accept a provider’s security\n\
    policy without reading it, it is critical to assure that user privacy is upheld.\n\

    \ and cyclists and ﬁgures out the speed and distance of vehicles\napproaching\
    \ and collaborates to provide warning messages to adjacent vehicles. Moreover,\n\
    smart lighting is switched on when movement is detected and turned off automatically\n\
    when trafﬁc passes. This system comes handy in averting accidents, maintaining\
    \ low\nand steady trafﬁc, and collecting pertinent data to enhance performance.\
    \ With huge data\nproduced by intelligent transportation systems (ITS), processing\
    \ using centralized model\nresults in large delays. In this sense, fog nodes at\
    \ particular intersections could be utilized\nto analyze data locally and brief\

    Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)\nAugmented reality overlays digital\
    \ and virtual content into a physical environment. It\nis highly time-critical,\
    \ warranting responses in real-time. Moreover, it is extremely latency-\nintolerant,\
    \ as even a minor delay may impact user experience, effectuating a negative\n\
    response [116]. For this reason, fog computing has the potential to become a key\
    \ player\nin the augmented reality domain, as computer-intensive jobs can be ofﬂoaded\
    \ to nearby\nfog devices. This also holds true for the virtual reality (VR) ﬁeld,\

    \ are used to process and store enormous healthcare data\ngenerated from sensors,\
    \ the huge data transmission, deﬁning of location, and access latency\npose critical\
    \ challenges [118,119]. As healthcare datasets increase, there is a higher possi-\n\
    bility of error occurrence during processing as well as transmission. Even a minute\
    \ data\nanalysis error may instigate the administering of an inappropriate treatment\
    \ that could cost\na human life. The patient health data is sensitive; hence,\
    \ security and privacy preservation\nare vital. The integration of fog computing\

    \ an enhanced\nsystem response time along with an improvement in energy consumption\
    \ [120].\ne.\nSmart agriculture\nAs agriculture caters to the food supply chain,\
    \ it plays a prime role in smart city\nschemes [121]. With smart agriculture,\
    \ sensors installed in ﬁeld vehicles gather data\non plant growth and ﬁeld climate\
    \ conditions. Moreover, the ﬁeld can be sensed from\nthe sky using air balloons.\
    \ These sensing activities can be effectively accomplished by fog\ncomputing,\
    \ and agricultural lands can be managed and tracked through sensor nodes’\nalarm\
    \ notiﬁcations.\nf.\nSmart water management\nAs far as sustainable smart cities\
    \ are concerned, smart water management is crucial. It\nsupervises the quantity\
    \ of water consumed, transported and anticipates the use of water\nin the future.\
    \ Above all, it enhances the water system of the city to be more reliable,\nsustainable,\
    \ and efﬁcient, as it assists in mitigating water loss using sensors that collect\

    \ paradigm has evolved from the cloud computing utility model.\nWith IoT proliferation,\
    \ computations closer to the network edge signiﬁcantly minimize\nthe cost of computing\
    \ and data ofﬂoading at the cloud. However, processing at the edge\nposes numerous\
    \ challenges pertaining to devices, security, the network, integrating fog,\n\
    and IoT, which the distributed fog system has to deal with [28,44,110]. The open\
    \ challenges\nidentiﬁed are pictured in Figure 13.\n•\nStandards and programming\
    \ languages\nThe fog structure is distinct from the cloud as it extends cloud\
    \ services to end-user\ndevices, warranting upgraded standards and associated\
    \ programming languages, along\nwith effective user interfaces and network protocols\
    \ for IoT device management.\n•\nScalability\nScalability is a key issue for systems\
    \ involving extensive IoT applications on fog, and\nexploring optimal algorithms\
    \ that illustrate the fog system’s complexity would be valuable.\nIn the fog model,\
    \ time-critical tasks are executed at the fog, and others are moved for\nprocessing\
    \ to the cloud. Ascertaining when fog resources are utilized optimally depending\n\
    on service type, user count, and resource availability are signiﬁcant.\n•\nComputational\
    \ challenges\nThe Fog system continually interacts with the cloud servers. It\
    \ intends to respond\nto users within a stipulated duration and forward complex\
    \ computer-intensive tasks to\nthe cloud, which may take longer. The parts of\
    \ computation that are unrestricted by\nresponse time are sent to the cloud, while\
    \ others are carried out at the edge for a minimum\ncomputational cost. The challenge\
    \ lies with ﬁguring out which computer tasks are to be\nexecuted at the edge and\
    \ ofﬂoaded to the cloud.\n•\nDeployment challenges\nThe fog system has to be precisely\
    \ deployed to subdue latency. Factors such as\nthe type and task amount performed\
    \ at a particular tier, fog device capability, and reliability,\nand the number\
    \ of sensors determine implementation decisions. As per the application\nrequirements,\
    \ resource scaling, as well as shrinking, are carried out without hindering\n\
    the operation of ongoing services. OpenFog recommends the N-tier fog model from\
    \ s\nmobilization viewpoint; however, escalating the fog layer levels may instigate\
    \ delays,\nwhich require deﬁning the number of levels for the speciﬁc application.\n\
    •\nDecentralized framework and failure management\nThe decentralized fog entails\
    \ a high likeliness of fog device malfunction relating to\nthe software, hardware,\
    \ power source, mobility, as well as connectivity issues considering\nan unreliable\
    \ wireless connection, linking the majority of fog devices. The fog system is\n\
    adaptable to a minor disruption and resource shortage. The fog node failure may\
    \ make\nits respective virtualized resources unavailable, and related issues,\
    \ such as latency and\nmigration, have to be dealt with for resource availability\
    \ at downtime. The decentral-\nized fog results in the repetition of code at edge\
    \ devices, and this redundancy has to\nbe checked. The random distribution of\
    \ network resources at the edge complicates con-\nnectivity, which can be rectiﬁed\
    \ by deploying a middleware that manages resources to\nthe demanding application.\
    \ The small client services are disseminated from the cloud\nto the edge, and\
    \ acquiring such services from fog systems is quite challenging. The fog\nsystem\
    \ manages billions of IoT devices; hence, provisioning services to all fog devices\n\
    is arduous. The portability of the fog’s edge node requisites ubiquitous fog computing.\n\
    With fog being distributed, the preciseness of computation needs to be conﬁrmed\
    \ as its\napplications demand consistency.\nSensors 2022, 22, 196\n24 of 38\n\
    \ \nconnectivity, which can be rectified by deploying a middleware that manages\
    \ resources \nto the demanding application. The small client services are disseminated\
    \ from the cloud \nto the edge, and acquiring such services from fog systems is\
    \ quite challenging. The fog \nsystem manages billions of IoT devices; hence,\
    \ provisioning services to all fog devices is \narduous. The portability of the\
    \ fog’s edge node requisites ubiquitous fog computing. With \nfog being distributed,\
    \ the preciseness of computation needs to be confirmed as its \napplications demand\
    \ consistency. \n \nFigure 13. Fog computing—open challenges. \n• \nDevice heterogeneity\
    \ and resource management \nFog computing sets the stage for numerous heterogeneous\
    \ technologies to offer IoT \nservices with a key challenge of linking resources\
    \ from diverse platforms. It is vital to \nexamine algorithms that are competent\
    \ at handling scheduling, synchronizing for the \neffective utilization of IoT\
    \ devices that are short on resources. The diversified nature of \nedge devices\
    \ has to be emphasized by the fog architecture at the device as well as the \n\
    network levels. Utilizing heterogeneous devices in a diverse fog setting with\
    \ varying \napplication demands is strenuous. Numerous IoT devices from diverse\
    \ hardware and \nFigure 13. Fog computing—open challenges.\n•\nDevice heterogeneity\
    \ and resource management\nFog computing sets the stage for numerous heterogeneous\
    \ technologies to offer IoT\nservices with a key challenge of linking resources\
    \ from diverse platforms. It is vital to exam-\nine algorithms that are competent\
    \ at handling scheduling, synchronizing for the effective\nutilization of IoT\
    \ devices that are short on resources. The diversified nature of edge devices\n\
    has to be emphasized by the fog architecture at the device as well as the network\
    \ levels.\nUtilizing heterogeneous devices in a diverse fog setting with varying\
    \ application demands\nis strenuous. Numerous IoT devices from diverse hardware\
    \ and software vendors add to\nthe complexity factor. When the edge lacks computational\
    \ resources, it can be acquired and\nassigned from among the fog nodes setting\
    \ up a common pool of computing, network, and\nstorage resources, availed by applications\
    \ as per demand. The heterogeneity of fog devices\nand resources in the dynamic\
    \ fog setting enables resource scheduling and allocation to be\nmore challenging\
    \ than that of the cloud, with utilizing idle resources being fog’s top priority.\n\
    •\nSecurity and privacy\nThe heterogeneity of devices makes the fog framework\
    \ vulnerable to various attacks\ndue to its deployment in a not-so-secure setting.\
    \ As fog nodes are positioned between\nthe cloud and end-users, fog computing\
    \ is susceptible to security issues. Assuring the pri-\nvacy of sensitive data\
    \ originating from sensors is critical. The fog-based Distributed Denial\nof Service\
    \ (DDoS) attack is highly destructive, as diverse malignant devices overwhelm\n\
    resource-limited end devices with fake service requests. Another such attack is\
    \ the Man-in-\nthe-Middle Attack (MMA), which discloses sensitive private data.\
    \ The physical components\nof IoT devices can also be attacked, referred to as\
    \ a physical attack based on the protection\nlevel and implemented location.\n\
    •\nQoS\nThe fog framework encompasses devices from the cloud to the edge, and\
    \ the fog nodes\nare to provide end-to-end services adhering to users’ service-speciﬁc\
    \ QoS features. The fog\nsystem is entitled to manage the distribution of computing\
    \ and storage to the cloud while\norchestrating heterogeneous edge devices. Hence,\
    \ it is necessary to dynamically integrate\ncloud servers and fog devices.\n•\n\
    Blockchain and Software-Deﬁned Networking (SDN)\nSensors 2022, 22, 196\n25 of\
    \ 38\nIn fog-based IoT settings, blockchain technology can provide a secure framework\
    \ for\ncontrolling data and information exchanges amongst independently operating\
    \ devices.\nTo improve privacy and security, blockchain offers the safe transmission\
    \ and storage of\ndigitally signed documents. As a result, an additional study\
    \ into this technology is critical\nin order to offer and improve methods for\
    \ securely transmitting data between IoT devices,\nutilizing a trustworthy approach\
    \ such as a time-stamped contractual handshake.\nFurthermore, Software Deﬁned\
    \ Networking (SDN) is a networking technology that\nmay be used in conjunction\
    \ with fog technology to enable effective data exchange and\nresource collaboration.\
    \ SDN may also bring intelligence to fog-based IoT networks, among\nother things.\
    \ SDN may also be utilized to protect fog-based IoT infrastructures. The authors,\n\
    for example, developed a hybrid network design for smart cities that included\
    \ SDN with\nblockchain. As a result, research into SDN and its integration with\
    \ blockchain would be\nhelpful in providing an efﬁcient architecture for sustainable\
    \ smart cities.\n•\nLatency management\nLatency control is required in fog computing\
    \ to guarantee an acceptable level of Quality\nof Service. As a result, research\
    \ into various latency management techniques would aid\nin delivering services\
    \ with the least amount of delay and ensuring a higher QoS throughout\nthe system.\
    \ The estimate of resources is another key topic in fog computing. It aids\nin\
    \ allocating computing resources depending on various policies, allowing for the\
    \ correct\nallocation of resources for future computation. In order to attain\
    \ the necessary QoS,\na comprehensive study into various resource estimate policies\
    \ in terms of multiple aspects\nsuch as user attributes and experienced Quality\
    \ of Experience (QoE) would be useful.\n•\nSustainability\nIn order to reduce\
    \ the total carbon footprint, sustainability which refers to the utiliza-\ntion\
    \ of renewable energy supplies, energy harvesting, and energy-efﬁcient architecture,\n\
    is a crucial necessity when building fog-based IoT architectures for smart cities.\
    \ Dense\nIoT end-devices and fog computing servers are predicted in smart cities.\
    \ As a result,\nthe smart city infrastructure would suffer considerable energy\
    \ constraints. As a result, it is\ncritical to research various methods for increasing\
    \ the energy efﬁciency of fog-based IoT\nsystems without sacriﬁcing QoS, which\
    \ could be accomplished through energy-efﬁcient\ncaching methods.\n•\nInteroperability\
    \ and federation of fog\nAnother essential prerequisite for accomplishing the\
    \ goal of a fog-based IoT and sus-\ntainable smart cities becoming a reality is\
    \ interoperability. Because of the large number of\nheterogeneous IoT devices\
    \ running on multiple protocols, the interoperability of fog-based\nIoT systems\
    \ in sustainable smart cities is difficult. The fog-based IoT architecture should\n\
    provide interoperability so that various systems and devices can correctly comprehend\
    \ and\nuse each other’s functionalities. On that account, intense research efforts\
    \ are recommended\nto create frameworks that allow interoperability for fog-based\
    \ IoT systems in sustainable\nsmart cities.\nOn the fog, requests are processed\
    \ at proximity, mitigating latency. If numerous\nlatency-sensitive applications\
    \ were to request services, the interoperability of the Fog\nclusters and its\
    \ servers along with federation would be required so that a fog device can\nrequest\
    \ its peers to manage processing to avoid cloud involvement that increases latency.\n\
    •\nPower management\nFog nodes manage innumerable end devices, as in sensors,\
    \ and when fog nodes\nare employed as needed, they substantially multiply active\
    \ nodes, increasing the whole\nsystem’s power consumption. Hence, power has to\
    \ be managed effectively in large fog sys-\ntems. One such option to study would\
    \ be integrating the fog nodes in speciﬁc applications\nand moving tasks among\
    \ nodes. The majority of fog devices are power-constrained, and\nefﬁcient energy\
    \ utilization is essential.\nSensors 2022, 22, 196\n26 of 38\nTable 5 furnishes\

    \ IoT has led up to an overwhelmingly immense\namount of data generation, inferred\
    \ as big data [134]. Big data entails ever-expanding\ndatasets, which are heterogeneous\
    \ in nature, comprising of structured, semi-structured,\nand unstructured data\
    \ [135]. It garners potential for opportunities as well as challenges,\nincluding\
    \ the ﬁve Vs [136]. Thus, big data analytics is a promising solution that processes\n\
    the humongous big data and transforms it into smart data, imparting actionable\
    \ insights\ninto making data-driven decisions [137]. The key feature of fog computing\
    \ and edge\ncomputing models is the potential to quickly store and process data,\
    \ beneﬁting real-time\napplications and playing a crucial part in efﬁcient business\
    \ operations [138,139].\n4.2.2. Serverless Computing\nServerless computing facilitates\
    \ an easy and hastier IoT application development\nby eliminating the need to\
    \ manage a real infrastructure [140]. It is also referred to as\nthe Function-as-a-Service\
    \ (FaaS), implementing code as independent functions through\ndynamic resource\
    \ provisioning, which enhances the runtime infrastructure scalability [141,\n\
    142]. Integrating serverless computing to the edge computing model increases the\
    \ com-\nputation speed of data generated and processed by IoT applications deployed\
    \ on edge\ndevices [143]. As individual functions are executed on edge devices,\
    \ the response time,\nlatency, and energy consumed is decreased, and the reliability\
    \ is improved.\n4.2.3. Blockchain\nBlockchain is a novel concept to store data\
    \ as a chain of blocks to enhance data\nsecurity [144]. It is a super-secure method\
    \ to store, authenticate, and protect data, which\npromotes trusted transactions.\
    \ Blockchain usually revolves around securing cryptocurrency\nwith real potential\
    \ being transparent and immutable. It utilizes the distributed ledger\nmodel to\
    \ secure transactions and is decentralized in nature, providing accurate and efﬁcient\n\
    transactions, evading intermediaries. Blockchain is engaged in offering services\
    \ pertaining\nto ﬁnance, voting, supply chain monitoring, and smart contracts.\
    \ It can be deployed to\nsecure data generated by IoT applications [145,146].\n\
    4.2.4. Quantum Computing\nThe emerging ﬁeld of quantum computing extends a substantial\
    \ computational lead\nover classical computing by leveraging the quantum physics\
    \ principles of entanglement\nSensors 2022, 22, 196\n28 of 38\nand superposition\
    \ [147]. With unimaginably swift quantum computers, calculations are\nperformed\
    \ and stored using quantum bits referred to as qubits, which allows number\ncrunching\
    \ and problem-solving at an exponential scale. Seemingly unsolvable complex\n\
    tasks, predicting viable solutions to issues, and the processing of a massive\
    \ amount of\ndata can be handled with absolute ease by quantum computers. They\
    \ can further enhance\ncomputational efﬁciency, security, and energy efﬁciency\
    \ [148]. Quantum computing can\nbe combined with ML and DL techniques to predict\
    \ the resource demand and handle\nan efﬁcient resource and energy utilization\
    \ at fog and edge layers [149,150]. Quantum\ncomputing is in its budding stage,\
    \ with research efforts underway at an accelerating\npace [148].\n4.2.5. Software-Deﬁned\
    \ Networking\nSoftware-Deﬁned Networking is an upcoming paradigm that overcomes\
    \ the verti-\ncal integration issue by separating the control logic of the network\
    \ from the underlying\nswitches and routers, enabling a logical network control\
    \ centralization [151]. It makes it\nsimpler to manage a ﬂexible and reliable\
    \ network, introduces new networking abstrac-\ntions, and leads to network evolution.\
    \ SDN overcomes conventional network issues by\nenhancing the virtualization,\
    \ security, energy efﬁciency, and network reliability, optimizing\nthe network\
    \ topology, managing complexity, service orchestration-beneﬁtting fog, and\nedge\
    \ computing [152,153].\n4.2.6. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)\nArtiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ is a key ﬁeld of computer science, where machines mimic human\nintelligence/behavior\
    \ and is already transforming the world. The accelerating ability\nof machines\
    \ to learn and act smart is gearing up to drive even more businesses and\ntechnologies.\
    \ AI, collectively with its subﬁelds of machine learning and deep learning,\n\
    help businesses save cost, enrich customer experience, communicate effectively,\
    \ streamline\nworkﬂows, and obtain insights for better decisions. ML is the ability\
    \ of a machine to learn\nwithout involving explicit programming. It can analyze\
    \ huge datasets and offer actionable\ninsights. DL, which is a subset of ML, is\
    \ capable of handling complex computational tasks.\nAI has begun to see the light\
    \ of the day with automation and implementation occurring at\na large scale and\
    \ fast pace. Likewise, intense research efforts are underway for integrating\n\
    fog and edge computing with artiﬁcial intelligence to enhance the overall performance,\n\
    including resource, energy management, security, and reliability [154–156].\n\
    5. Sustainable/Green Computing in Fog/Edge\nSustainable/green computing is the\
    \ efﬁcient management of computational, commu-\nnication, and storage devices\
    \ through convincing design and manufacturing practices with\na reduced impact\
    \ on the environment [157]. The last decade has seen sustainable/green\ncomputing\
    \ permeating ﬁelds of social computing, mobile computing, agent systems based\n\
    on AI, as well as the Internet of Things. IoT nodes possess power constraints\
    \ and connecting\nwith the internet makes them vulnerable to attacks. For IoT\
    \ to be sustainable, energy and\nsecurity are the two key aspects to be emphasized.\n\
    5.1. Energy Sustainability\nWith IoT services pervading all aspects of our lives,\
    \ energy-constrained IoT devices\nspark concern while considering sustainability.\
    \ The massive number IoT sensors and\nactuators deployed necessitate a continuous\
    \ and persistent power supply. As the IoT\nnode size reduces, the size of the\
    \ battery also decreases. In light of the current trend to\nenhance IoT device\
    \ functionality, formulating sustainable solutions for confronting power\nconstraints\
    \ is essential [158].\nNumerous research efforts have been oriented towards energy\
    \ harvesting for self-\nsufﬁcient IoT functioning, alongside tackling IoT security\
    \ issues. The energy consumed\nby digital and smart gadgets has become concerning.\
    \ Energy harvesting from renewable\nSensors 2022, 22, 196\n29 of 38\nenergy sources\
    \ can power a myriad of IoT sensors [159,160]. With IoT sensors having\na battery\
    \ that lasts for a limited time, frequent charging or replacement is not viable\
    \ at\nall times. Hence, energy harvesting from renewable energy such as kinetic,\
    \ solar, ther-\nmal, etc., seems plausible [161]. Moreover, energy harvesting\
    \ this issue can be handled\nby deploying an efﬁcient data transmission policy\
    \ [162], with almost 80% of a sensor’s\nenergy being depleted on data transmission.\
    \ Even though efforts for enriching the energy\nefﬁciency of IoT systems are underway,\
    \ they hardly match the proliferating pace of IoT\nservices/dependence [158].\n\
    5.2. Security Sustainability\nIoT sustainability emphasizes the security of data\
    \ and devices. Securing data involves\nhandling conﬁdentiality and integrity aspects,\
    \ whereas device security concerns defense\nagainst stealth attacks. Energy-harvesting\
    \ chips are susceptible to malicious attacks, in-\ncluding DoS attacks that disrupt\
    \ sensors. Both the criteria of energy efﬁciency and security\ncharacterize the\
    \ IoT sustainability while, at the same time, challenging IoT progress [163]\n\
    as IoT devices are power constrained, which demands a reﬁned, lightweight energy\
    \ and\nsecurity framework.\nAccording to a study, 70% of connected devices are\
    \ at risk of cyber-attacks [164]. Fur-\nthermore, vulnerable smart devices are\
    \ estimated to cause 25% of all industrial attacks [158].\nAs IoT devices are\
    \ resource-constrained, they are highly prone to attack than desktops\nor laptops.\
    \ As the battery size decreases, it can hold less energy, which in turn reduces\n\
    the availability of resources that provide security. Hence, lightweight security\
    \ mechanisms\nsuitable for power constraint devices are essential, as traditional\
    \ security solutions designed\nfor resource-rich devices consume more energy,\
    \ owing to more computations. Research\nshows that the advanced encryption standard,\
    \ as well as the elliptic curve cryptography,\noffer a lightweight cryptographic\
    \ solution with an evaluation based on resource limitations,\nchip space, latency,\
    \ and throughput [165]. For the IoT systems to be sustainable, the balanc-\ning\
    \ of aspects such as energy efﬁciency, power consumption, performance, and security\
    \ is\nrequired [158].\n6. Conﬂuence of ML and Fog/Edge\nThe conventional cloud\
    \ model falls short of fulﬁlling IoT application necessities due\nto the enormous\
    \ data generated from IoT devices [166]. Transmitting the overwhelming\nIoT data\
    \ to the cloud would cause network overhead, consuming bandwidth, and latency\n\
    issues [167]. Hence, to cut back on the data transfer cost as well as network\
    \ delays, service\nproviders are steering towards the fog and edge computing [168],\
    \ with an additional\nopportunity for enforcing security and privacy [169]. The\
    \ IoT systems comprise edge\nequipment, sensors, and actuators with latency, bandwidth,\
    \ and security necessities [166].\nThe fog computing technology of extending computer\
    \ and storage to network’s edge solves\nprocessing and networking impediments\
    \ [167], enabling rapid processing close to the data\nsource [170]. The complexity\
    \ and dynamism of fog computing with its communication\nnetworks facilitating\
    \ low latency makes sophisticated computation possible in a conducive\nenvironment.\
    \ Fog computing confers societal beneﬁts through its range of applications,\n\
    namely, healthcare, Industry 4.0, autonomous vehicles, smart cities [171], etc.\n\
    Despite that, it encounters performance as well as security setbacks. As a result,\n\
    machine learning (ML), which is a subﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), is catching\
    \ on to\nassist FC in resolving its shortcomings. Using ML to enhance FC applications\
    \ and deliver\nefﬁcient services in terms of accuracy, latency reduction, energy\
    \ consumption, security,\nprivacy, resource, and trafﬁc management [25,172,173]\
    \ has been increasingly popular\nin recent times. Fog computing resource management\
    \ involving ML enhances the computer,\ndecision-making, and resource provisioning,\
    \ along with delay prediction. Deploying ML\ntechniques in fog computing facilitates\
    \ accurate data processing and analyses in real-time\nwhile managing the network\
    \ overhead as well as communication trafﬁc, owing to fog’s\ndecentralized model.\
    \ The security aspects for the device, network, and data involving fog\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 196\n30 of 38\ncomputing accompanied by ML prove to be effective.\
    \ The merging of the fog model with\nmachine learning has evolved into robust\
    \ end-user and upper-layer services, allowing for\ndeeper analytics and intelligent\
    \ answers to tasks.\nMachine learning (ML) is a promising option for intelligent\
    \ data processing and infer-\nence and is a prime enabler to various IoT application\
    \ domains [166], such as healthcare,\nsmart home, smart agriculture, smart industry,\
    \ smart grid, etc. It has a crucial part in design-\ning the intelligent/smart\
    \ setting for autonomous operations [167]. Machine learning has\nimmense potential\
    \ as a signiﬁcant IoT technology gaining traction to provide insights for\nIoT\
    \ applications [174]. IoT has excellent prospects for enhancing human life and\
    \ industrial\ngrowth as innumerable sensing devices perform monitoring and increase\
    \ communication\npotential [175]. For resource-constrained IoT devices, the conﬂuence\
    \ of machine learning\nwith the cloud, edge, and fog is vital for IoT implementation\
    \ [156,175] to usher in efﬁcient\nperformance, greater controllability, productivity,\
    \ and cost reduction possibilities, while\nmanaging IoT’s QoS challenges.\nEnabling\
    \ intelligence at fog and IoT improves the overall performance [100]. FC moves\n\
    the cloud’s potential to the edge of the network, where IoT and human users are\
    \ present.\nIntelligence can be incorporated into FC as device-driven or human-driven.\
    \ In a device-\ndriven approach, fog and IoT are equipped with more sensing, processing,\
    \ network, and\nstorage capabilities, enabling context awareness for decision\
    \ making and local resource\nmanagement. In a human-driven model, human users\
    \ act as the data source to the system,\nwhose behavioral pattern is the key in\
    \ shaping the network while serving them. Collectively,\nthese two approaches\
    \ can help meet IoT’s demand for QoS when designing fog computing\nsystems.\n\
    The harnessing of machine learning in an IoT setting facilitates deeper analytics\n\
    and helps materialize efﬁcient and smart IoT applications [174]. Moreover, it\
    \ can be\nutilized to overcome networking difﬁculties pertaining to routing, resource\
    \ allocation,\ntrafﬁc engineering, and security [176–180]. Neural networks are\
    \ deployed to effectively\nanalyze enormous data produced by IoT [181]. Moreover,\
    \ advanced AI involving deep\nlearning has been thriving in data analytics, decision\
    \ making, and prediction [85].\nThe potential of IoT has remarkably expanded thanks\
    \ to the convergence of ma-\nchine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence. Advanced\
    \ machine intelligence approaches have\nenabled substantial insights into a number\
    \ of real-world situations and the capacity to\ndetermine critical operational\
    \ choices from the massive volume of IoT sensory data. As\na result, ML and IoT\
    \ must work in tandem to solve complicated real-world issues and\nfulﬁll computation\
    \ and communication needs.\n7. Conclusions\nCloud computing has revolutionized\
    \ device interactions on the internet, which ush-\nered in the Internet-of-Things\
    \ and implemented a plethora of connected gadgets, with\nthe potential to continually\
    \ sense and respond to user requirements. The proliferation\nof networked IoT\
    \ devices and ensuing big data and the rigorous demands of emerging\nIoT applications,\
    \ such as low latency, location awareness, and mobility support in a geo-\ndistributed\
    \ scenario, have challenged the conventional cloud computing architecture.\nHence,\
    \ various computing paradigms such as edge and fog have emerged to address these\n\
    limitations by deploying resources at the network’s edge. The computing at edge\
    \ and fog\nimplies collecting, processing, and analyzing data close to the data\
    \ source and transmitting\nreﬁned results to the centralized cloud, favoring time-sensitive\
    \ applications that require\nincreased accuracy, low latency, high-speed analytics,\
    \ faster response time, improved re-\nliability, and availability. Combining fog/edge\
    \ with cloud computing has the prospect\nof aiding IoT in multiple ways. Because\
    \ the fog and edge computing paradigms are up-\nand-coming, exhaustive research\
    \ on this new technology is imperative. The evolving\ncomputing paradigms, as\
    \ well as the challenges and opportunities, were explored in this\nstudy. Budding\
    \ researchers can largely beneﬁt from this extensive survey to comprehend\nrecent\
    \ advances in evolving computing paradigms.\nSensors 2022, 22, 196\n31 of 38\n\

    \ (A.R.O.)\nAbstract: With the implementation of the Internet of Things, the agricultural\
    \ domain has become\ndata-driven, allowing for well-timed and cost-effective farm\
    \ management while remaining envi-\nronmentally sustainable. Thus, the incorporation\
    \ of Internet of Things in the agricultural domain\nis the need of the hour for\
    \ developing countries whose gross domestic product primarily depends\non the\
    \ farming sector. It is worth highlighting that developing nations lack the infrastructure\
    \ for\nprecision agriculture; therefore, it has become necessary to come up with\
    \ a methodological paradigm\nwhich can accommodate a complete model to connect\
    \ ground sensors to the compute nodes in a\ncost-effective way by keeping the\
    \ data processing limitations and constraints in consideration. In\nthis regard,\
    \ this review puts forward an overview of the state-of-the-art technologies deployed\
    \ in\nprecision agriculture for soil assessment and pollutant monitoring with\
    \ respect to heavy metal in\nagricultural soil using various sensors. Secondly,\
    \ this manuscript illustrates the processing of data\ngenerated from the sensors.\
    \ In this regard, an optimized method of data processing derived from\ncloud computing\
    \ has been shown, which is called edge computing. In addition to this, a new model\n\
    of high-performance-based edge computing is also shown for efﬁcient ofﬂoading\
    \ of data with smooth\nworkﬂow optimization. In a nutshell, this manuscript aims\
    \ to open a new corridor for the farming\nsector in developing nations by tackling\
    \ challenges and providing substantial consideration.\nKeywords: food security;\
    \ precision agriculture; Internet of Things; soil moisture; heavy metal;\nwireless\
    \ sensors; edge computing\n1. Introduction\nThe agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries has multiple challenges, i.e., if we\nlook at the production side,\
    \ the ﬁrst challenge which the farmer faces is the productivity\nchallenge, as\
    \ it becomes evident that developing countries are very low in productivity,\n\
    i.e., for any crop, the particular developing country could be the highest producer\
    \ but\nat the same time its productivity could be very low. Therefore, crop productivity\
    \ is a\nsigniﬁcant factor which has to be looked at. The second challenge which\
    \ the farmer faces is\nwith respect to climate change, industrial pollution, and\
    \ pest attacks, as they can damage\ncrops substantially. It is deemed necessary\
    \ for the farmer to mitigate those challenges by\nadapting to the latest technologies\
    \ and insurance schemes. The third challenge is related to\nmarket connectivity,\
    \ whereby the farmer produces crops and thus needs to be connected\nto distant\
    \ markets as per the crop production analysis and its subsequent data insights.\n\
    It is essential for the farmers to have all the information on a digital platform\
    \ and there\nshould be seamless trade between different markets and different\
    \ places. However, this\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11060475\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n2 of 37\n\
    connection between farmers and the distant market is nowhere to be seen in developing\n\
    countries. On the other hand, the industry is looking up for exports, which in\
    \ turn need to\nbe streamlined substantially. From the economic perspective of\
    \ the developing country, it is\na boon if more facility in nature and regulatory\
    \ support has to be given for people who are\nlooking to export outside their\
    \ country or who are looking to have a value-added product\nacross the globe.\
    \ Now, this mismanagement in the agricultural sector can potentially lead\nto\
    \ food security risk.\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is intended to help and maximize\
    \ the development of the\nfarming sector and will also help to ensure food security\
    \ [1]. It is to be highlighted that\nPA is a high-tech farming technology that\
    \ observes, measures, and analyzes farming ﬁelds\nand crops. With the advent of\
    \ PA, on-ﬁeld sensors can provide detailed levels of data\nfor problems of soil\
    \ and weather conditions pertaining to heavy metal toxics and climate\nchange.\
    \ Big data obtained from sensor networks and farm inputs tracking have a signiﬁcant\n\
    role to play to increase farm productivity, reduce environmental impacts, and\
    \ improve\nhuman welfare [2]. By combining artiﬁcial intelligence-based big data\
    \ analytics with sensor\nand image data, an integrated system could be developed\
    \ for the agricultural domain.\nImplementing intensive, high-value, personalized\
    \ management of crops would increase\nboth production and economic performance.\
    \ The aim of this paper is to highlight the\nimportance of smart sensors and high-performance\
    \ computing in protecting stakeholders\nin the agrifood value chain and providing\
    \ them with unlimited access to a large dataset of\nvarious categories in order\
    \ to track their farms. The challenges and consideration for the\nfarming sector\
    \ in developing countries are also highlighted. Figure 1 shows the number of\n\
    articles reviewed in various domains in the proposed manuscript.\nFigure 1. Distribution\
    \ of reviewed articles.\nThe structure of the paper is arranged as follows: The\
    \ ﬁrst section of the paper explains\nthe paper’s scope and the reasoning for\
    \ the proposed study. Section 2 gives an overview of\nfood security by taking\
    \ into consideration the pollution caused by persistent toxics and\nheavy metal.\
    \ In addition to this, Section 2 also highlights the importance of smart farming\n\
    based on IoT. Section 3 gives a detailed overview of the wireless communication\
    \ protocols\nand sensors used in the agricultural domain. Furthermore, Section\
    \ 3 also emphasizes\nthe importance of edge computing and also highlights the\
    \ model of High Performance\nComputing (HPC) on Edge. In addition, Section 3 also\
    \ details the various edge computing\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n3 of 37\nmethodologies\
    \ used by previous researchers in precision agriculture. Section 4 highlights\n\
    the current challenges and considerations for the agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries.\nFinally, Section 5 presents the conclusion of the proposed review.\n\
    2. Food Security: A Global Challenge in View of Soil Pollutants and Heavy\nMetal\
    \ Toxicants\nOver the next 35 years, the world’s growing population will demand\
    \ more food\nthan mankind has ever produced. However, food security faces a variety\
    \ of issues on\nboth the development and consumption sides, which would necessitate\
    \ further study\nin order to formulate a solution. The food system, on its current\
    \ course, would likely\nabsorb much of the remaining carbon budget if the temperature\
    \ rises by 2 ◦C by the year\n2050 [3]. As a result, it would leave no room for\
    \ other industries, making reaching the\nParis Agreement virtually impossible.\
    \ Due to severe weather conditions, climate change of\nthis magnitude would alter\
    \ what can be grown and worn, as well as the dynamics of pest\nand disease spread.\
    \ Food production shocks will occur, eventually leading to higher food\nprices\
    \ and civil unrest. Agriculture is important, but it consumes 70% of all freshwater,\n\
    resulting in one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity\
    \ and soil\ndepletion [4,5]. Finding new ways to sustainably produce more food\
    \ on available land will\nbe crucial as agricultural land becomes scarce. This\
    \ necessitates substantial assessment of\nagricultural soil monitoring and mitigating\
    \ the heavy metal pollutants and other toxics\nfrom the soil.\nHeavy metal contamination\
    \ is widely spread across the world, disrupting the at-\nmosphere and thereby\
    \ showing signiﬁcant threats to human health. The reason behind\nheavy metal contamination,\
    \ in general, is the rapid speed of urbanization along with\nindustrialization\
    \ and noticeable land use change in fast-moving developing nations such\nas China\
    \ and India. Post-Industrial Revolution and economic globalization, there has\n\
    been an unprecedented rise in the variety of environmental pollutants, with innumerable\n\
    anthropogenic sources. Therefore, this continuously evolving issue pertaining\
    \ to food\nsecurity has become a serious concern for the world, speciﬁcally its\
    \ inextricable relation to\nthe health of human beings [6,7].\nSeveral dangerous\
    \ heavy metals and metalloids comprising arsenic, cadmium, lead,\nand mercury\
    \ are categorized as non-essential for metabolism. These metals are considered\n\
    to be deleterious in different ways [8,9] and have thus been listed in the top\
    \ 20 list of\nhazardous substances by the United States Environmental Protection\
    \ Agency and the\nRadioactive Substances and Disease Registry Agency (ATSDR) [9,10].\
    \ With respect to\nmetabolic process, heavy metals, like Fe, Zn, Cr (III), and\
    \ Cu are considered to be essential\ncomponents along with enzymes and cytochromes,\
    \ which are inextricably connected to\nthe biota metabolic functioning [9,11].\
    \ With regard to urease, nickel is considered to be an\nimportant component; however,\
    \ it may pose an unnecessary risk to human health [12,13].\nTherefore, with respect\
    \ to the above context, soil–food crops and vegetation ecosystem is a\nwell-laid-out\
    \ example of abiotic–biotic interactions.\nHeavy metal pollution generated from\
    \ energy intensive industries poses a serious\nthreat to the sustenance of soil.\
    \ Apart from the ill effects on human health, heavy metal\nalso puts an adverse\
    \ impact on soil biota through soil microbe interaction and microbial\nprocesses\
    \ [9,14,15]. It also hampers the ecosystem when it comes to beneﬁcial soil in-\n\
    sects [16–18]. It is worth noting that medicinal plants can be used for bioaccumulation\
    \ of\nheavy metals. A prominent example of such a case is the “Paeonia Ostii”\
    \ Chinese medicinal\nplant [19]. Numerous medicinal plants are demonstrated to\
    \ bioaccumulate various heavy\nmetals, i.e., As, Cd, Fe, Pb, Cr, and Cu when grown\
    \ near industrial zones [9,20–23]. It is also\nessential to note that, even in\
    \ the greenhouse ecosystem, vegetation is susceptible to heavy\nmetal such as\
    \ Zn, Pb, Mn, Cu, and Cd due to decreased exposure to illumination [24].\nFor\
    \ a successful technological remedy, it is essential to understand the soil–food\
    \ crop\ntransfer mechanisms. In order to achieve this purpose, this analysis ﬁrst\
    \ discusses the\ndifferent causes of heavy metal contamination in the soil ecosystem\
    \ and its relevance to the\nhealth of human beings. In general, this type of analysis\
    \ gives an overall layout pertaining\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n4 of 37\nto heavy\
    \ metal sources within the agricultural domain which in turn is correlated to\n\
    anthropogenic inﬂuences. It also helps us to provide state-of-the-art information\
    \ regarding\nthe global scenario of heavy metal pollution spanning across different\
    \ continents in the\nagricultural domain. In this regard, the next subsection\
    \ elaborates on the heavy metal\nsources in the soil–crop ecosystem.\n2.1. Heavy\
    \ Metal Sources in Soil–Crop Ecosystems\nIt is evident from numerous studies that\
    \ the source of heavy metals in the agricultural\necosystem is due to industrial\
    \ pollution, sewage sludge, phosphate-based fertilizers, metal\npesticides, and\
    \ contaminated water [9,25–29]. In addition to the mentioned sources of heavy\n\
    metal pollution, it is also essential to understand the impact of anthropogenic\
    \ pollutants, as\nthey pose a risk to the health of human beings through dietary\
    \ intake of contaminated food\ncrops which become polluted either through soil\
    \ or direct atmospheric deposition over the\nsurface of plant leaves [17,30].\
    \ Waste efﬂuents discharged from industries and automobiles\naccumulate in soil,\
    \ thereby causing contamination in the food chains [9,31,32]. It is also\nworth\
    \ noting that coal-based power plants pose a signiﬁcant threat with respect to\
    \ Hg soil\npollution. In this regard, Li et al. [24,33] stated the adverse effect\
    \ on human health caused\nby consuming lettuce and water spinach grown in Hg-contaminated\
    \ soil area. Likewise,\nmany strong sources present a grim outlook for global\
    \ food safety. Figure 2 shows the\necosystem of heavy metal contamination. Heavy\
    \ metals emitted from automobile and\nindustrial smelters are transported to distant\
    \ locations, i.e., up to several kilometers away\nfrom their sources by wet or\
    \ dry deposition [34]. These metals accumulate in plant leaves\nthrough foliar\
    \ transmission after the deposition of atmospheric particles above the surface\n\
    of the leaf [34]. Fernandez and Eichert [35] proposed that particles can penetrate\
    \ the\nleaf tissue through the pores present on the leaf cuticle and inside stomata.\
    \ Similar to\nroot uptake, foliar uptake of heavy metals may also arise in a dose-dependent\
    \ manner.\nNonetheless, one of the leading contributors of heavy metal penetration\
    \ in agricultural soil\nalso comes from sewage and sludge pollution.\nFigure 2.\
    \ Ecosystem of heavy metal contamination.\nTo address the concern of rising wastewater\
    \ produced from domestic and industrial\nprocesses as a result of the growing\
    \ human population, a reliable strategy and stable\ntreatment systems are urgently\
    \ needed. With the rapid growth of agriculture in the past\ndecade, overuse of\
    \ water resources, especially for agriculture, has become a problematic\nissue\
    \ which threatens to intensify the effects of climate change. Agriculture constitutes\
    \ by\nfar the largest use of water in all countries [36]. In order to solve this\
    \ problem, it has been\nfound that wastewater reuse is a feasible option to minimize\
    \ anthropogenic impact [37].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n5 of 37\nFurthermore,\
    \ raw wastewater reuse in agriculture is a valuable tool for developing coun-\n\
    tries to minimize usage of freshwater while also addressing the challenge of rising\
    \ food\nproduction in water-scarce areas. The beneﬁts of reusing water in agriculture\
    \ are numerous\nand unquestionable, i.e., it saves signiﬁcant quantities of freshwater\
    \ which may be assigned\nfor other essential purposes; it provides nutrients that\
    \ may replace chemical fertilizers,\nthus helping to increase soil fertility and\
    \ crop yield and reduce production costs; it allows\nfor the expansion of agricultural\
    \ land in dry areas; it is a relatively cheap disposal method\nfor raw wastewater;\
    \ and it can help to prevent contamination of surface water. In addition,\nit\
    \ has been demonstrated that the health risks associated with raw wastewater usage\
    \ in\nagriculture are satisfactory if its biological content meets speciﬁed standards\
    \ [38,39].\nHaving elaborated on the positive side of raw wastewater, there are\
    \ also possible nega-\ntive effects, such as soil salinization and groundwater\
    \ contamination of metals and organic\ncompounds. It should be noted that these\
    \ are only theoretical at this point. Furthermore,\nthe use of untreated water\
    \ for agricultural production is potentially dangerous due to its\nmicrobial substance,\
    \ especially bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which can cause a number\nof diseases\
    \ because many of them can be sustained for longer periods in the environment.\n\
    This in turn tends to affect the quality of the soil.\nIt is crucial that farmers\
    \ aim to keep the quality of their soil high in order to pre-\nserve the health\
    \ of their soil species. Soil microbes are an important component of the\necosystem\
    \ [40]. Soil fertility depends in part on the breakdown of organic matter and\n\
    the ﬂow of nutrients through the ecosystem. When they are subjected to stresses\
    \ like\nextreme temperature, pH, salinity, and chemical pollution, they are able\
    \ to negatively affect\nproductivity [41–43]. Owing to the variety of anthropogenic\
    \ activities, soil may become\npolluted with a variety of heavy metals from manufacturing\
    \ and mining. Many forms of\ncontaminants, i.e., from mine waste, sewage sludge,\
    \ chemical fertilizer, and pesticides can\nend up in the soil system and adversely\
    \ affect soil microbes [43]. As another alternative,\nvegetables produced in greenhouses\
    \ also become polluted by heavy metals, often from\nanthropogenic sources. Within\
    \ the source, detection of heavy metals can be performed\nusing sophisticated\
    \ statistical and geospatial methods [9,44–47]. Greenhouse vegetables\nin China\
    \ were more susceptible to Cd pollution than crops in open farmland [48,49]. The\n\
    results of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that As, Ni, and\
    \ Cr are\nprimarily discharged from weathered rocks, while metallic pollutants\
    \ such as Hg and Pb\nare generated by industry, vehicle fumes, and reuse of wastewater\
    \ for irrigation [48,49].\nNonetheless, it is worth noting that PCA has been used\
    \ by several researchers in various\nagricultural domains for the assessment of\
    \ soil heavy metal pollutants [50–53].\nIdentifying soil pollutants and their\
    \ origins is important to research due to their close\nties to human health [54–56].\
    \ In this regard, it has become deemed necessary to come up\nwith tools and techniques\
    \ which can monitor heavy metal composition in the soil which can\nbe incorporated\
    \ into the smart farming ecosystem. Smart farming is considered to be the\nnext\
    \ key segment in the agriculture sector as it has changed the methodological paradigm\n\
    of how farmers operate on ﬁelds. The following subsection highlights the overview\
    \ of\nsmart farming and its beneﬁts.\n2.2. Smart Farming Initiatives Is the Need\
    \ of the Hour\nWith the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), smart devices have\
    \ reached into all facets\nof our day-to-day life, i.e., healthcare and wellness,\
    \ smart homes, automobile and logistics,\nintelligent cities and industries. In\
    \ recent decades, agriculture has seen a series of techno-\nlogical changes, increasingly\
    \ industrialized and technologically driven. Through different\nagriculture-based\
    \ smart devices, farmers today now have greater control over animal\nhusbandry\
    \ and cultivation processes, making them more predictable and productive. This,\n\
    along with the rising market demand for agricultural products, has helped to increase\
    \ the\nworldwide proliferation of intelligent agriculture technologies. It is\
    \ worth noting that for\nthe year 2020, IoT’s agricultural market share reached\
    \ $5.6 billion [57].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n6 of 37\nModern agriculture can\
    \ be addressed in several respects. For instance, AgriTech\nrefers to the use\
    \ of technology in the domain of agriculture [58]. In addition, intelligent\n\
    agriculture is primarily used to describe the use of IoT-based agricultural solutions.\
    \ With\nIoT sensors, farmers can make informed decisions and develop various parameters\
    \ of their\nwork, i.e., cattle to crop production, in order to collect environmental\
    \ and machine metrics.\nFor example, farmers can decide exactly how much pesticide\
    \ and fertilizer is to be utilized\nto optimize productivity by using smart agriculture\
    \ sensors for monitoring crop status. The\nsame applies to the concept of intelligent\
    \ farming. Figure 3 shows a broader perspective\non a modern-day agricultural\
    \ model, which incorporates various wireless sensor nodes to\nenable IoT-based\
    \ farming with satellite communication, where different ground sensors\nare deployed\
    \ which communicate with the cloud computing node for data processing and\nanalysis,\
    \ so that farmers can make correct decisions.\nFigure 3. Modern day agriculture.\n\
    Although smart IoT and industrial IoT are not as common as consumer-connected\n\
    devices, the market continues to be very competitive. IoT technologies are increasingly\n\
    being implemented for agriculture. COVID-19 has had a positive impact on IoT market\n\
    share in agriculture. Indeed, the smart framing market share is expected to hit\
    \ $6.2 billion\nby the end of 2021, as reported recently [57].\nIt is evident\
    \ that COVID-19 has made a signiﬁcant impact on the farming sector\nacross the\
    \ world. However, the agricultural sector is showing potential to make a strong\n\
    comeback by leveraging positive government policies which indicate adoption of\
    \ advanced\ntechnologies by making substantial investment in the agricultural\
    \ sector. This initiative\nwill make room for IoT-based agricultural solutions\
    \ as a prominent business strategy, thus\ncausing a reasonable increment in crop\
    \ production. However, in the current situation, the\nmarket is expected to show\
    \ a decline up to 0.8% for the ﬁrst two quarters of year 2021\ncompared to 2020\
    \ and this trend will show a positive growth from 2022 onwards [59].\nIn addition\
    \ to this, the smart world agriculture market is projected to triple to 15.3 bil-\n\
    lion dollars by 2025, compared to just over 5 billion dollars back in 2016 [60].\
    \ If the sector\ncontinues to expand, there will still be plenty of opportunities\
    \ for companies. In the coming\nyears, creating IoT products for agriculture will\
    \ distinguish companies as early adopters,\nthus helping to pave the way for success.\n\
    Today, the innovations on our immediate horizon include autonomous machines\n\
    which have the capacity to pluck and pick fruits and vegetables from the respective\
    \ plan-\ntation. A highly sophisticated sensing system includes microscopic sensors\
    \ and cameras\nthat help farmers track the growth of crops and warn them when\
    \ something is wrong\nor inform them of the optimum time to harvest. The Bonirob\
    \ developed by Deepﬁeld\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n7 of 37\nLabs [61] can take\
    \ a soil sample, liquidize it, and then analyze its pH and phosphorus\nlevels\
    \ in real time. Researchers expect to grow and harvest an entire hectare of land\
    \ barley\nwithout humans ever entering the ﬁeld as a proof of concept for autonomous\
    \ farming\ntechnology. Companies like Aerobotics [62] already have commercialized\
    \ software that an-\nalyzes infrared photos taken by drones to detect unhealthy\
    \ vegetation, similar to a real-life\ngame of SIM farming in which the farmer\
    \ receives a warning on their computer when a\ndisturbed area is detected. Machine\
    \ learning is constantly improving the system’s ability to\ndistinguish between\
    \ crop varieties and weeds that pose a threat to the farmer. Furthermore,\nvarious\
    \ pilots are hired by Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)-based companies to ﬂy light aircraft\n\
    equipped with multispectral cameras on data-gathering missions over vast farms\
    \ around\nthe country [63]. Planet Labs has a ﬂeet of CubSat satellites that take\
    \ weekly photographs\nof entire farms from space to aid in crop monitoring [64].\
    \ To cope with this new wave of\ndata, other companies are developing analytics\
    \ tools to act as farm management systems,\nenabling farmers to work on a variety\
    \ of land sizes. Farmers’ business networks can now\nintegrate data from several\
    \ farms into one large pool, giving their members access to\nmacro-level insights\
    \ that were previously only accessible to corporate mega farms.\n2.3. Beneﬁts\
    \ of Smart Farming\nIn certain ways, technology and IoT have the ability to change\
    \ agriculture. There are\nﬁve ways in which IoT can boost agriculture:\n•\nData:\n\
    •\nLoads of data gathered by sensors from the ﬁelds, i.e., temperature, soil quality,\
    \ crop\ngrowth progress, and animal health can be used to monitor the condition\
    \ of the farm\nalong with the performance of ﬁeld workers and efﬁciency of equipment.\n\
    •\nImproved internal process management and therefore lower output risks:\n•\n\
    The ability to forecast the production performance enables farmers to become prepared\n\
    for a better delivery of goods. Wise decisions can be made if the estimated production\n\
    of the crop is known.\n•\nCost savings and waste reduction by improved quality\
    \ control:\n•\nIf any irregularities in crop growth and animal health are seen,\
    \ then the risk of losing\nthe yield can be minimized.\n•\nImproved business productivity\
    \ through process automation:\n•\nSmart farming can automate several processes\
    \ during the development cycle, i.e.,\nirrigation, fertilization, or pest control\
    \ with intelligent devices.\n•\nImproved consistency and volume of the commodity:\n\
    •\nGreater control over production processes and retaining higher crop quality\
    \ levels\nand growth potential by automation can be achieved.\n•\nHelps to mitigate\
    \ soil toxicity and monitor signiﬁcant parameters, thereby providing\nsustainable\
    \ agriculture:\nWith the advent of low-cost sensors for monitoring agriculture,\
    \ signiﬁcant parameters\nin the agricultural ecosystem can be analyzed to increase\
    \ the factor of sustainability, i.e.,\nassessing soil quality and monitoring soil\
    \ toxicity, water quality and its controlled usage,\nweather conditions, and optimized\
    \ usage of fertilizers.\nAll the aforementioned variables will contribute to higher\
    \ revenues. However, the\nbeneﬁts of smart farming can only be exploited if the\
    \ quality of internet is able to accommo-\ndate the IoT infrastructure. In this\
    \ regard, the following section discusses internet access\nquality in developing\
    \ countries.\n2.4. Quality of Internet Access in Developing Countries\nIoT provides\
    \ an environment in which objects, animals, or humans have uniquely\nidentiﬁed\
    \ data that can be communicated over the internet without the need for computer\n\
    interactions between humans and computer [65]. In 2015, over 13.4 billion devices\
    \ were\nlinked to the internet (as part of IoT) and it is forecasted that by the\
    \ year 2020 there will\nbe a rise in 18.5% to 38.5 billion devices, according\
    \ to Juniper research (Juniper research\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n8 of 37\n\
    2015) [66]. Today, nearly every ﬁeld of modern society is being overtaken by IoT\
    \ [67]. The\nmain areas include smart health, smart cities, intelligent industries,\
    \ driverless cars, smart\nagriculture, precision farming, smart homes, etc. [68].\
    \ In this regard, it has been deemed\nnecessary for every household and business\
    \ sector to become connected with the internet,\nif we want to realize the maximum\
    \ utilization of IoT. Figure 4a shows the graph of internet\nusers worldwide on\
    \ the basis of geographic division and Figure 4b shows the subsequent\npenetration\
    \ rate till October 2020 [69]. It is worth noting that, although the number of\
    \ users\nin Asia and Africa is high as observed in Figure 4a, if Figure 4b is\
    \ analyzed, then it becomes\nevident that there is a clear-cut digital division,\
    \ as the penetration rate in Asia and Africa is\na mere 59.5% and 47.1%. In most\
    \ of the developing and underdeveloped countries in Asia\nand Africa, the agricultural\
    \ sector plays a prominent role in the contribution of overall Gross\nDomestic\
    \ Product (GDP). Therefore, reforms in communication technology are deemed\nnecessary\
    \ in such regions to incorporate the IoT paradigm into the agricultural domain.\n\
    Figure 4. (a) Internet users worldwide. (b) Internet world penetration rate [69].\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n9 of 37\nIoT has great potential and is one of the\
    \ main areas for future internet services growth.\nIoT problems are exploratory\
    \ in major IT companies and most countries. New uses of\nIoT are being searched\
    \ for and developed, but most work has been done in the ﬁeld of\nstandardization\
    \ of solutions [70]. IoT issues are included in the European Digital Agenda\n\
    (2016) [66]. As part of the European framework for research and innovation HORIZON\n\
    2020, more than EUR 140 billion is estimated to have been invested in IoT technology\n\
    between 2016 and 2017 alone (European Commission, 2015). In March 2015, the EU\n\
    Commission launched the Innovation Internet Alliance. The objective of the alliance\
    \ was to\ndevelop close cooperation on innovation and standardization of IoT (European\
    \ Commission\n2016) between the EU Commission, stakeholders, and parties involved\
    \ in IoT [66].\nThe fragmented existence of platforms and communications protocols\
    \ is one of the\nmajor problems of the present day, and contributes to incompatibility\
    \ problems between\ndifferent IoT devices and features [71,72]. IoT is well known\
    \ in precision agriculture,\nbut only proprietary solutions that lead to compatibility\
    \ and connectivity issues between\nvarious equipment are being used [73]. New\
    \ technologies need to be sought, based on\nopen standards and frameworks that\
    \ are compatible with smartphones. Many products\nthat are based on open hardware\
    \ at least partially are currently on the market and prices\nare considerably\
    \ lower than proprietary solutions. Therefore, by keeping the current\ninfrastructure\
    \ in consideration, the agriculture methodological paradigm can be taken to\n\
    the next level by connecting to the IoT.\n2.5. Embarking Agriculture on IoT\n\
    Farmers today have to face the biggest challenges in crop production as global\
    \ pop-\nulation grows. Therefore, it has been deemed necessary for the farming\
    \ sector to bring\nmajor shifts in adapting the latest technologies. IoT is driving\
    \ change in agriculture, which\nhas brought a shift in the farming paradigm. IoT\
    \ refers to devices or objects embedded\nin the sensor for the purpose of measurement\
    \ and transfer of datasets through network\ndevices, from pumps and tractors to\
    \ weather stations. In essence, IoT means that these\nphysical machines can transmit\
    \ and receive information from farms on devices using the\ninternet in order to\
    \ remotely measure all types of data and provide that information to\nthe farmer.\
    \ Soil moisture, chemical properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather\n\
    details can be collected in real time by IoT devices. IoT devices information\
    \ helps farmers\nto track farms and accordingly helps to advise farmers to increase\
    \ productivity and yields.\nFarmers can also respond faster to farm conditions\
    \ and save time and money. Nonetheless,\nwith the advent of IoT, there lies a\
    \ major challenge in the processing of high volumes of\ndata generated from the\
    \ on-ﬁeld sensors. Therefore, researchers need to tackle this issue by\ncoming\
    \ up with cloud computing models synchronized with on-ﬁeld agricultural sensors.\n\
    2.6. Data Processing Challenge in IoT\nOne of the biggest hurdles of IoT is to\
    \ process large datasets in tandem. However,\nknowing what the data are, what\
    \ the nature of the data is, and how they go through\nare some of the key components\
    \ that need to be looked upon in this process. Gathering\nthe data forms the initial\
    \ stage, and the other factor comprises ingestion of data to the\nsystem from\
    \ the sensor. It is deemed necessary to understand that the data go through\n\
    all the gateways before entering into the system where the data are actually cleansed\
    \ and\ntransformed, which eventually leads to substantial insights. The big question\
    \ lies with how\nmany speciﬁc points of computation should exist. Let us consider\
    \ an instance, whereby\nthere is a drip irrigation system which ﬁnds that one\
    \ of the plants is not getting enough\nwater. Now, this delay could not be disturbing\
    \ for the system as the concerned person\nhandling the drip irrigation system\
    \ can come back the next morning and actually provide\nsome water or maybe some\
    \ other time it can be dealt with. However, in order to bring\nsustenance in the\
    \ agricultural industry, it is necessary for the farmers to understand the\nfactors\
    \ that govern crop growth by optimizing the usage of fertilizers and water. In\
    \ these\nkinds of situations, decisions are taken close to the actions or where\
    \ the data originate\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n10 of 37\nfrom. Therefore, in\
    \ this regard, one can realistically conduct some processing for something\nto\
    \ be analyzed and thus, one can recognize some patterns and do some planning for\
    \ the\nlong term, accordingly. This gives a vision at a spectrum on a scale of\
    \ time as to where\nthe processing needs to happen. So, by considering all these\
    \ scenarios, it becomes evident\nthat not all the data are important, and this\
    \ is the challenging aspect to comprehend. This\ngives an insight of what data\
    \ need to be stored, what need to be discarded, what need to\nbe retained for\
    \ short-term purposes, and what need to be retained for long-term purposes.\n\
    Thus, all these are challenging issues that need to be addressed and that is where\
    \ storage\ntechnologies are actually highlighted. There are a number of systems\
    \ that are actually\nbeing worked upon; however, due to the lack of quality internet\
    \ access infrastructure in\ndeveloping countries, the feasibility of their implementation\
    \ remains a challenge. One\nof the viable solutions to solve this problem could\
    \ be via edge computing whereby the\nessential data could be ofﬂoaded from the\
    \ cloud over the edge of the cloud, and this is\nwhere the paradigm of smart sensing\
    \ with edge computing comes in.\n2.7. IoT-Based Smart Sensing with Edge Computing\n\
    Numerous embedded programmable devices have been utilized in recent literature.\n\
    Some are personalized while others are industrial programmable boards or full\
    \ sens-\ning/monitoring systems in closed-source applications. Researchers select\
    \ their equipment\naccording to the goals of each study or the main objective.\
    \ Business pertaining to sensing\nservices includes a range of features outside\
    \ the box to allow scientists to concentrate on\nother aspects of IoT de-planting,\
    \ such as meta-processing, smart tracking and monitoring\nalgorithms, cloud interoperability,\
    \ and more [74–76]. On the other hand, the programmable\nopen approach gives designers\
    \ versatility in monitoring the actions of the nodes and\nnetwork and in programming\
    \ new peripheral devices, such as new sensors or drive mod-\nules [77,78]. The\
    \ next subsections discuss various communication paradigms and wireless\nsensors\
    \ and nodes which are suitable to be used in the agricultural domain.\n3. Communication\
    \ in IoT\nDespite signiﬁcant changes, IoT still evolves, as can be seen from many\
    \ reviews, to\nachieve its ﬁnal form [79]. The conﬁguration of IoT is based on\
    \ three layers: a network\nlayer (data transfer), a perception layer, and an application\
    \ layer for data storage and\nmanipulation [80]. The network layer is considered\
    \ to be the physical layer of the archi-\ntecture, where the on-ﬁeld sensors and\
    \ actuators directly interact with the environment\nand gather data as per the\
    \ requirement. Technology such as Wireless Sensor Network\n(WSN), Radio Frequency\
    \ Identiﬁcation (RFID), and recently, Near Field Communications\n(NFC) are used\
    \ on the perception layer [79]. Correlation exists between WSN and RFID\ntechnology\
    \ due to semi-passive and active RFID tags which can also be viewed as lower-\n\
    computing and storage wireless nodes [81]. A wireless sensing node normally consists\n\
    of more than one sensor module (either external or embedded along with digital\
    \ sensor\ndevices), a processing module, typically a low-power microcontroller\
    \ unit, and a Radio Fre-\nquency (RF) communication module compatible with low-power\
    \ wireless communication\ntechnology [82].\nAt the network layer of the IoT, WSN\
    \ communicates with physical objects and their\nsurroundings, neighboring nodes,\
    \ or gateways. The network layer is also responsible for\nbuilding a network paradigm,\
    \ by using which the data are typically forwarded to a remote\nstorage infrastructure\
    \ for further analysis and processing [83]. Wireless standards which\nare used\
    \ to develop communication protocols, i.e., 802.15.4, bridge the difference among\n\
    the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. These types of protocols comprise\
    \ Sigfox,\nZigBee, 6LowPan, WirelessHART, and ISA100.11a. [74,84]. In addition\
    \ to this, Bluetooth\nLow Energy (BLE), Long-Range and Long-Range Wide Area Network\
    \ (LoRa/LoRaWAN),\nand low-power WiFi have also been used in the network layer.\n\
    The application layer is the IoT’s third layer. This layer is responsible for\
    \ getting\ndata downloaded and delivering application-speciﬁc service to the users’\
    \ device via an\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n11 of 37\napplication programming\
    \ interface. It is very important, and it promotes the realization\nof IoT in\
    \ several respects. The application layer faces a variety of unresolved suits,\
    \ such\nas system recognition as a unique device. Identifying and addressing billions\
    \ of devices\naround the world would provide them across the future internet with\
    \ direct internet-like\naccess and power. Identity uniqueness, durability, and\
    \ scalability are essential character-\nistics of the approach scheme [83]. IPv6\
    \ can mitigate some system recognition problems\nwith its aspects of internet\
    \ mobility and is expected to play a key role in this sector [85].\nThe heterogeneity\
    \ of the wireless nodes, diversity in data types, parallel operations, and\nintegration\
    \ of data from devices further exacerbate the problem [86].\nWhile numerous theoretical\
    \ parameters of the WSN have been studied extensively in\nliterature, practical\
    \ IoT/WSN implementations are very demanding for agriculture and\nremain a difﬁcult\
    \ task. Sensor modules must be sufﬁciently reliable, with the required mea-\n\
    suring range available which is protected from environmental factors that either\
    \ produce\nfalse readings or cause malfunctions in the system. As the IoT possesses\
    \ distributed nature,\ntherefore replacing the power source can be a very tough\
    \ challenge for battery-operated\nnodes in open ﬁelds or other agricultural facilities.\
    \ Consequently, very stringent power lim-\nitations inﬂuence the hardware selection\
    \ and the low-power characteristics of the chosen\nperipherals are often taken\
    \ into consideration when designing a new device. The software\ncomponents to\
    \ be implemented must be carefully inspected to incorporate the functionality\n\
    of a system. The ﬁnal function code includes a fully integrated understanding\
    \ of software\nengineering and adequate testing to prevent ﬁeld failures [87].\
    \ Other characteristics that\nallow an integrated, low-power system to be chosen\
    \ for use are its longer-term reliability,\nthe number of digital and analogue\
    \ inputs/outputs that reduce the number of peripheral\ndevices (sensors and actuators)\
    \ to be supported, the capacity of power harvesting modules,\nand the effort needed\
    \ to program the system.\nIoT is a dominant type of IT wireless technology in\
    \ the seven major groups, i.e.,\nthe Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM),\
    \ Wireless Personal Area Network\n(WPAN), the Cognitive Radio/Wireless Regional\
    \ Area Network (WRAN), Wireless Radio,\nmesh, Point-to-Point (P2P), and the Low-Power\
    \ Network (LPN), Low-Power Wide Area\nNetwork (LPWAN). Further GSM standard is\
    \ divided into GSM EDGE Radio Access Net-\nwork (GERAN) and Universal Mobile Telecommunication\
    \ System (UMTS) and Universal\nTerrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) [88].\
    \ Many wireless devices are produced in\ncompliance with different wireless standards.\
    \ One prominent problem is the interference\nbetween devices that run on the same\
    \ band (for example Bluetooth, ZigBee, and WiFi) or\nadjacent bands [89].\nTable\
    \ 1 summarizes the IoT wireless networking which offers a wide range of band-\n\
    width, operating frequency, range, and power consumption. The various technologies\
    \ and\nspeciﬁcations as well as the discrepancies between IoT projects and their\
    \ unique criteria\nimpede network interoperability. Two very common phenomena\
    \ are high temperatures\nand high humidity when it comes to agricultural deployments.\
    \ Based on observations by\nBannister et al. [90], when the temperature increases\
    \ from 25 ◦C to 65 ◦C, it has a major\neffect on the signal intensity obtained.\
    \ Boano et al. [91] presented similar ﬁndings. In\naddition, humidity in agricultural\
    \ deployments can also be very high. For open ﬁelds,\nthe wireless nodes are exposed\
    \ directly to rain or irrigation systems. Relative humidity in\ngreenhouses can\
    \ also reach 80% for long periods. Dampness has been shown to greatly\nimpact\
    \ the distribution of radio waves [74,92]. It is necessary to take the specs of\
    \ the\nnumber of nodes into account, i.e., the distance between them, the antenna\
    \ height, and\nthe operating frequency based on the appropriate size of the messages\
    \ when selecting\na wireless transceiver for the agricultural purpose. The next\
    \ subsection discusses the\nsensors which are used or have the potential to be\
    \ deployed over agricultural ﬁelds for soil\nassessment and monitoring soil pollutants\
    \ such as heavy metal toxics. In addition, the next\nsubsection also highlights\
    \ the various wireless nodes and the associated microcontroller\nand transceiver.\n\

    \ Used Sensors for Smart Farming and Heavy Metal Identiﬁcation\nSensors for Soil\
    \ Moisture (SM) have been used in crop ﬁelds for decades to measure\nwater content.\
    \ The use of handheld/manual soil moisture technology is increasingly being\n\
    replaced by automated technologies, since there were difﬁculties in manual soil\
    \ moisture\nreadings in remote production areas. In the past decade, technology\
    \ has been developed for\nwireless data collection, providing managers and users\
    \ with real-time access to soil moisture\ndata, resulting in more successful water\
    \ management decisions. Some of the prominent\nsensing devices to measure soil\
    \ moisture comprise gravimetric sampling, resistive sensors,\ncapacitive sensors,\
    \ and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) [93]. Gravimetric sampling is a\ndirect and\
    \ normal SM measurement tool [94]. SM is determined by a proportion of dry\nsoil\
    \ mass to wet soil mass including pores. It needs the manual drying of soil samples\n\
    taken from the ﬁeld and oven sampling [94]. The electrical conductivity of water\
    \ and\nthe measuring of resistance changes based on soil water content are primarily\
    \ resistive\nsensors, such as granular matrix sensors. This method includes sensor\
    \ calibration for\nprecise SM reading.\nIntelligent irrigation-based measurement\
    \ to maintain soil moisture levels is signiﬁcant\nto improve plant productivity\
    \ and quality. On the other hand, soil moisture sensors these\ndays are expensive,\
    \ i.e., the ECHO-EC5 soil moisture sensor costs around USD 169 [95].\nIn order\
    \ to overcome the cost constraint factor, Wang et al. [95] proposed an RFID-based\n\
    GreenTag sensor to maintain and improvise plant productivity and quality.\nIn\
    \ addition, RFID sensors can be combined with biosensors comprising aptamer and\n\
    DNA-based properties which can be used to detect heavy metals at nanoscale and\
    \ large\nscale levels pertaining to food safety monitoring. A heavy metal detection-based\
    \ biosensor\nis composed of genetically modiﬁed bacterial cells and a green ﬂuorescent\
    \ signal ampliﬁer\nwhich detects the presence of arsenite in foods [96,97]. Its\
    \ arsenic detection lasts for an\nhour with a detection range of 5–140 µg/L. Other\
    \ methodologies pertaining to biosensors,\ni.e., aptamers and graphene electrodes,\
    \ have also been used to detect arsenic with the\npossibility of being developed\
    \ as simple and easy-to-use low-cost devices [97,98].\nThe EC-5 series sensors\
    \ were also used by Wu et al. [99] for ﬁeld-speciﬁc calibration\nand evaluation\
    \ in sandy soils. Nonetheless, EC-5 sensors have turned out to be helpful to\n\
    reveal soil water content dynamics in different soil depths post rainfall conditions.\
    \ The\nECHO series has other variants of sensors; i.e., ECHO-EA10 can be used\
    \ for medium\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n13 of 37\ntextured soil type with low\
    \ electrical conductance conditions. In addition to this, there is\nECHO-10HS\
    \ soil moisture sensor which is a new addition in the soil moisture sensor family\n\
    and possesses high-frequency oscillation, which enables the sensors to accurately\
    \ measure\nsoil moisture in any of the soil or soilless media with minimum salinity\
    \ and textural effects.\nIn order to measure soil water content and salinity,\
    \ Zemni et al. [100] used 5TE sensors\nat different soil depths to assess dielectric\
    \ permittivity (Ka) and electrical conductivity\n(ECa). It is to be noted that\
    \ 5TE sensors are based on frequency domain reﬂectometry\n(FDR); therefore, they\
    \ use a ﬁxed frequency wave of broadband signal which makes the\ndevice cheaper\
    \ and more compact. Nolz et al. [101] deployed hydro probe2 sensors to\nevaluate\
    \ near surface soil water and determine in situ water retention function. Hydro\n\
    probe sensors are advantageous due to their linear signal response. On the contrary,\
    \ hydro\nprobe sensors are not suitable for sandy soils [102]. Udukumburage et\
    \ al. [103] used an\nMP406 soil moisture sensor to verify the saturated condition\
    \ of the expansive soil layer.\nThey also used this sensor to measure volumetric\
    \ water content values in the soil column\nduring the wetting and drying process\
    \ [104]. In order to maintain the indoor ecosystem\nservices, air quality plays\
    \ an essential role. In this regard, MIKROE gas sensors are used to\nmonitor the\
    \ air quality [105,106]. To evaluate and assess the vegetation change and study\n\
    physiological and metabolic response of corn ﬁelds and paddy ﬁelds, the Pogo II\
    \ VWC has\nbeen widely used [107,108].\nHu et al. [109] used Portable X-ray Fluorescence\
    \ Spectroscopy (PXRF) to assess the\nheavy metal content in soil for which they\
    \ covered 301 farmland soils from Fuyang in\nZhejiang Province, in the southern\
    \ Yangtze River Delta, China. Conventional methods for\nheavy metal detection\
    \ such as Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS), Atomic Fluores-\ncence Spectrometry\
    \ (AFS), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy\n(ICP-OES),\
    \ are expensive and lengthy procedures which are executed in laboratories. There-\n\
    fore, these methods are not taken into consideration for rapid testing and high-density\n\
    evaluation of soil heavy metals contamination. As an alternative method for rapid\
    \ heavy\nmetal detection, Portable X-ray Fluorescence (PXRF) was used to assess\
    \ cumulative con-\ncentrations of soil heavy metals based on linear regression\
    \ models between ﬂuorescence\nintensity and speciﬁc heavy metal concentration.\
    \ Due to its ease of use and rapid testing\nability using non-destructive quantiﬁcation,\
    \ PXRF has been widely used by researchers\nin numerous domains [110–113]. For\
    \ the heavy metal assessment in agricultural soil con-\nducted by Hu et al. [109],\
    \ VNIR sensor was used to anticipate soil properties comprising\npH, soil nitrogen,\
    \ and carbon [114,115]. In addition to PXRF, NixPRO color sensor can also\nbe\
    \ used to identify hotspots and total spatial area in excess of environmental\
    \ thresholds in\nlandﬁll soils [116].\nLately Zhao and Liu [117] have developed\
    \ a Portable Electrochemical System (PES)\nfor on-site heavy metal detection on\
    \ farmland. Their system was composed of a three-\nelectrode conﬁguration which\
    \ comprised a signal acquisition system integrated with a\nmicrocontroller-based\
    \ potentiostat to perform square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry.\nTheir system\
    \ was assessed by testing the detection of pd(II) and cd(II) in acetic acid soil\n\
    extracts and acetate buffer solution [117]. However, their system did not include\
    \ any\nwireless sensor module to transmit heavy metal composition data.\nOther\
    \ than the aforementioned sensors, there are several other wireless sensors ded-\n\
    icated to: photosynthesis, i.e., Beta Therm temperature sensor; leaf wetness sensor,\
    \ i.e.,\nSLWA-M003; precision sensor for leaf temperature, i.e., ∆LA-C; light\
    \ intensity sensor,\ni.e., BH1750FUI sensor [118–122]. With the advent of these\
    \ sensors, CO2 sensors also\nplay an essential role, especially in greenhouse\
    \ systems [123]. CO2 sensors have also\nbeen widely used to measure the subsequent\
    \ level in peat soil, landﬁll, and forest control\nsite [124,125]. In the smart\
    \ farming ecosystem, the growth and quality of the fruit bunch\ncannot be neglected.\
    \ In this regard, there are dedicated fruit growth monitoring sensors\nwhich researchers\
    \ have used in their domain of plantation. Thalheimer [126] designed\nan optoelectronics\
    \ sensor for monitoring fruit and stem radial growth. Their developed\nsensor\
    \ was lightweight and easy to install with low maintenance. Nonetheless, the sensor\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n14 of 37\nwas well tested in open ﬁeld conditions.\
    \ In addition to this, the effect of gas concentration\nduring the fruit growth\
    \ was studied by Ma et al. [127], for which a smart ethylene elec-\ntrochemical\
    \ sensor was established to investigate ethylene emission from fruits. Lately,\n\
    Hanssens et al. [128] came up with a heat ﬁeld deformation sensor to measure sap\
    \ ﬂow\ndynamics through the tomato peduncle. Heat griddling of the peduncle was\
    \ performed to\ndifferentiate ﬂow of xylem and phloem with respect to developing\
    \ fruits.\nCapacitive sensors calculate SM on the basis of changes in soil capacitance\
    \ due to\ndifferences in water content [129]. Commercial UTs use capacitive sensors,\
    \ which are\nusually more accurate than resistive sensors but cost more [130].\
    \ Ground Penetrating\nRadars (GPR) [131] are based upon electromagnetic wave absorption\
    \ and reﬂection. SM\nsensing uses impulses, frequency sweeping, and frequency-modulated\
    \ technologies. This\nmethod is used for measuring soil moisture near the surface\
    \ (up to 10 cm). The most\nreliable soil humidity samples used in ﬁelds are neutron\
    \ scattering samples [132] and\nscattering samples use radiation methods for calculating\
    \ SM by estimating changes to the\nneutron ﬂux density due to water content of\
    \ the soil [133,134]. However, in such cases,\nspeciﬁc licenses are required to\
    \ carry out its implementation.\nNumerous research studies have been performed\
    \ to develop electrochemical devices\nfor various applications, which are known\
    \ as potentiostat [135–141]. Lately, an Arduino-\nbased potentiostat was fabricated\
    \ from cost-efﬁcient components and was able to execute\nsimple electrochemical\
    \ experiments, whereby the results were recorded and analyzed in a\nWindows operating\
    \ system via USB interface [136–138]. As an addition to Arduino-based\npotentiostat,\
    \ Raspberry Pi (RPi) controller was also used to execute the electrochemical\n\
    experiments, whereby the results were displayed on the LCD touch panel connected\
    \ to the\ncontroller [139]. Both Arduino- and Raspberry Pi-based potentiostat\
    \ have the potential to\nincorporate wireless sensors for data transmission; however,\
    \ these controllers do not con-\ntain a built-in Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)\
    \ and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)\nwhich make the overall design more sophisticated.\
    \ In this regard, Hanisah et al. [142] came\nup with a portable Heavy Metal Potentiostat\
    \ (HMstat) to detect heavy metal composi-\ntion on-site. Their potentiostat comprised\
    \ a digital Control Signal Component (CSC) and\nthe electronic component, which\
    \ is the analog Potentiostat Read-out Circuit Component\n(PRCC), as shown in Figure\
    \ 5 [142]. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that both the Arduino\nand RPi controller\
    \ board do support the incorporation of various sensor modules. There-\nfore,\
    \ researchers have room to incorporate soil moisture and temperature sensors along\n\
    with other sensors depending on the slots available in the controller; thus, an\
    \ integrated\nsystem for soil moisture and heavy metal analysis can be developed.\n\
    Figure 5. (a) The HMstat consists of Control Signal Component (CSC) and Potentiostat\
    \ Read-out\nCircuit Component (PRCC) connected to the electrochemical cell (consisting\
    \ of Screen Printed\nElectrode Gold (SPGE) and (b) overall connection of HMstat\
    \ [142].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n15 of 37\nOther soil physical properties\
    \ can be calculated to populate the map of the soil with\nother soil properties\
    \ such as soil organic content, pH, sand, silt particles percentage, and\nnutrients\
    \ such as Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation\n\
    Ca, CEC, and K/Mg [143–145]. In situ, calculating these properties in real time\
    \ also faces\nchallenges due to scale, cost, and technology limitations.\nIn precision\
    \ farming, some of the long-lasting decisions can be taken using yield\nmonitoring.\
    \ This method helps in providing spatial distribution of crop yields at the end\n\
    of the growing season [146,147]. Yield sensors are normally mounted on farm equipment\n\
    and capture yield data automatically in the course of the harvest. In particular,\
    \ mass\nﬂow sensors on grain containers are mounted to record grain inﬂows along\
    \ with the\nposition [148]. The collected data are analyzed with tools such as\
    \ ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and\nEnvironment System Analysis International [149].\nIn\
    \ order to get an insight into the crop yield combined with ﬁeld topography, Electrical\n\
    Conductivity (EC) sensors are used [150]. Soil’s ability to conduct current is\
    \ measured\nby electrical conductivity. EC assessment is used to assess the use\
    \ of phosphorus, cations\nin water, drainage, and rooting depths [150]. EC maps\
    \ are used for zoning the area. The\nzoning is also used to incorporate precision\
    \ agricultural practices such as variable rate irri-\ngation, variable rate seeding,\
    \ and drainage management. Electromagnetic Induction (EMI)\nmethods can be used\
    \ for the mapping of the EC by apparent Electrical Conductance (ECa)\nand Visible\
    \ Near Infrared Reﬂectance (VNIR) [151]. There are a number of commercial\ntools\
    \ available, i.e., Veris 3100, EC400 sensors in conjunction with GPS systems [149,152].\n\
    In the domain of soil sensing, macronutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, and\
    \ phos-\nphorus are essential to the growth of crops. The evaluation of these\
    \ nutrients helps to\nassess the effects of fertilizer and potential applications.\
    \ The optical detection is based\non reﬂectance spectroscopy to measure the macrosimulation’s\
    \ reﬂection and absorp-\ntion [153,154]. A sensing system using planar electromagnetic\
    \ sensors has been developed\nin the detection of nitrate and sulphate concentration\
    \ in natural water resources [155].\nThis approach is used to detect the amounts\
    \ of nitrate and sulphates by correlating\nthe impedance of the sensor array with\
    \ their concentration. The key approaches to soil\nmacronutrients include electrochemical,\
    \ VIS-NIRS, and ATR spectroscopy [149,152,156].\nThese approaches to soil macronutrients\
    \ are limited to sensing a single desired ion because\nthe membrane used in these\
    \ methods only reacts to one ion [157]. To achieve a simultane-\nous multi-ion\
    \ sensing, it is necessary to build a detector array for the sensing of soil macro\n\
    nutrients [158].\nThere are several opportunities to advance the state of precision\
    \ farming through\nthe utilization of the above discussed sensors. The following\

    WSNs typically consist of a large number of nodes that run in a particular conﬁgura-\n\
    tion. Usually, autonomous and spatially dispersed sensor nodes collaborate to\
    \ track and\ncollect environmental conditions. Data can be processed in central/decentralized\
    \ mode by\nsending data to a sink that transfers them to other networks (e.g.,\
    \ through a gateway). A\nbroad variety of application-speciﬁc limitations is included\
    \ in the project, design, prototype,\nand use of a WSN.\nThe BTnode is a Bluetooth-based\
    \ radio module and microcontroller for autonomous\nwireless communication [159].\
    \ BTnode is equipped with general purpose interfaces which\ncan be conﬁgured on\
    \ the basis of application speciﬁc requirement. BTnode can be utilized\nwith several\
    \ peripherals, i.e., sensors, actuators, RFID, and GPS receivers. A promising\n\
    factor of BTnode is its compact size of 6 × 4 cm with standard wireless interface.\
    \ A pictorial\ndescription of BTnode is shown in Figure 6. The device comprises\
    \ an Atmel ATmega128L\nmicrocontroller with on-chip memory and peripherals [160].\
    \ The microcontroller demon-\nstrates an 8-bit RISC core delivering up to 8 MIPS\
    \ at a maximum of 8 MHz. The on-chip\nmemory comprises a programmable in-built\
    \ 128 KB of ﬂash memory along with 4 KB of\nstatic RAM. Other integrated peripherals\
    \ consist of JTAG for debugging, timers, counters,\npulse-width modulation, and\
    \ 10-bit analog-to-digital converter.\nFigure 6. (a) Pictorial description of\

    \ Epic\nis shown in Figure 7. SensorNet platforms, like most embedded systems,\
    \ are tightly\ncoupled to their applications and this can also be incorporated\
    \ over parallel programming\nparadigm to enhance processing and reduce execution\
    \ time [161,162]. A key aspect of Epic\nis the support of prototyping and reusability\
    \ using composable hardware architecture.\nThe research and development of Epic\

    \ it suitable to implement user-centric studies. The research and development\n\
    of Irene Mote was carried out at Computer Science Division, University of California,\n\

    \ of\nIrene Mote.\nFigure 8. Pictorial description and illustration of Irene Mote\

    \ and is equipped\nwith a universally usable sensor and actuator platform [169,170].\
    \ Figure 10 pictorially\nrepresents the Preon32 sensor. Preon32 is incorporated\
    \ with Cortex-M3 controller which is\ncompatible with IEEE 802.15.4 radio frequency\
    \ module. In addition, this module enables\ndevelopers to develop the wireless\
    \ module codes using an object-oriented programming\nlanguage like Java [169].\
    \ It also demonstrates the functionalities of external interfaces, i.e.,\nUSB,\
    \ CAN, and SPI, etc. [164,169].\nFigure 10. Preon32 sensor [170].\nThe Mica2 Mote\
    \ is shown in Figure 11. These motes are CrossBow Technology’s mote\ntechnology\
    \ of the second and third century. In combination with the CC1000/CC2420\nRF Module,\
    \ Mica2 and MicaZ use the Atmega128L controllers [171]. With the interface\nAgriculture\
    \ 2021, 11, 475\n19 of 37\nsupport for the link to the mote, the Mica2/MicaZ are\
    \ ﬁtted with moisture, temperature,\nand light sensors [162]. These motes also\
    \ measure barometric pressure, seismic waves,\netc. [172–174].\nFigure 11. Mica2\
    \ Mote sensor [174].\nUsually, the sensor nodes of a WSN consist of three basic\
    \ building blocks: sensors,\ncomputer units, and communication units. The sensor\
    \ nodes need a working device, a\nrouting protocol, and eventually a simulator\
    \ to allow a WSN to function properly.\nThe most critical issues concerning WSN\
    \ include the lack of standardization of the\nhardware nodes, limited consumption\
    \ of energy, communication latency, out-of-order\nand loss of packets, distributed\
    \ reconﬁguration and scalability factors. In this regard, the\nOperating System\
    \ (OS) acts at the helm to arbitrate the resource access. It is worth noting\n\
    that the primary OS’s for WSNs are TinyOS, MANTIS, Contiki, Nano-RK, and LiteOS\
    \ [175].\nTinyOS (TOS) is open source, modular, component-based, module-speciﬁc\
    \ and built\nfor wireless sensor networks [176]. Nonetheless, this OS complies\
    \ with programs which\nrequire very low memory and also comprises numerous libraries\
    \ that manage network\nprotocols, distributed services, transducer drivers, and\
    \ data collection tools. TinyOS uses a\nmonolithic architecture class to construct\
    \ a static image on the node using the component\nmodel. TOS offers multithreading\
    \ support from version, named TOS Threads, using a\ncooperative threading approach.\
    \ In order to come up with a lightweight open source\nOS, Contiki was developed\
    \ by the Swedish Institute of Computer Science [177]. The\npromising factor of\
    \ Contiki is its portability factor which is based on an event-driven kernel.\n\
    Contiki includes so-called protothreads, which can be used at the individual process\
    \ level.\nNonetheless, Contiki includes many applications supporting features\
    \ like the multitasking\nkernel, preventive multithreading, prototype threads,\
    \ TCP/IP protocol, IPv6 protocol,\nlight telnet client, and quick web server etc.\
    \ [178]. It is worth noting that Contiki supports\ndynamic memory management;\
    \ it does not support applications in real time [179].\nWith the advent of cross\
    \ platform requirements, the multi-threaded WSN models were\ndeveloped. The MultimodAl\
    \ system for in situ wireless sensor (MANTIS) NeTworks [164]\nis a multi-threaded\
    \ WSN operating system. MANTIS is an easy-to-use OS that includes\nkernel, scheduler,\
    \ and network stack, and is compatible to be used across various platforms,\n\
    i.e., PDA or a PC.\nIn addition, Nano-RK was built for WSNs based on multitasking\
    \ [175]. The design\nobjectives for Nano-RK include multihop networking, effective\
    \ power management to ex-\ntend WSN lifetime, limited resources lighting applications,\
    \ and priority scheduling. LiteOS\nbased in Unix was developed by the University\
    \ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [164] in\norder to support the programming paradigm\
    \ for WSNs. LiteOS offers a familiar Unix,\nthread, and C programming environment\
    \ and is built using a hybrid programming model\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n20\
    \ of 37\nwhich allows programming, both event-driven and thread-driven. Some of\

    \ support\nNow, the question is how the previously discussed sensors could be\
    \ deployed over an\nIoT-based High-Performance Computing (HPC) framework with\
    \ optimized scheduling. In\nthis regard, the next subsection discusses the signiﬁcance\
    \ of Edge Computing.\n3.2. Role of Edge Computing\nIt is essential to look at\
    \ data that can be processed immediately close to where the\ndata originate with\
    \ the help of edge. So, at the edge there is a requirement of some kind\nof storage,\
    \ computing ability to be able to take care of real-time processing needs. For\n\
    long-term retention for data analysis realistically, some planning activity is\
    \ to be done\nin the cloud. Therefore, if that is the case, then what kind of\
    \ storage solutions are we\nlooking at? In this regard, an edge needs to be designed\
    \ in such a way that it could possess\nlocal processing power needed in decision-making\
    \ ability and largely it is going to be\nright intensive. Thus, some storage is\
    \ required at the edge level which is going to be fast,\ni.e., largely of course\
    \ solid-state drive to overcome the issues of low latency. However, in\nthe current\
    \ scenario, data analysis and long-term planning are essential; therefore, users\n\
    may compromise with lower degrees of latencies, but the factor of storage remains\
    \ a\npriority. The prominent challenge in edge computing is with respect to the\
    \ volume of\nthe data. Having so many sensors deployed for computing, the heterogeneity\
    \ of data\nthemselves is another challenging issue. The coherency of data always\
    \ exists at the edge\nlevel and it is essential for the user to correlate the\
    \ data to discrete points, and without this\ncorrelation, one cannot get insights\
    \ for the generated data. Now, to maintain correlation\nof high-speed data becomes\
    \ another bottleneck in edge computing. To overcome this\nissue, the workﬂow optimization\
    \ along with energy aware scheduling criteria becomes\na necessity for edge computing.\
    \ In this regard, ﬂexibility and agility could be achieved\nwith lower cost, whereby\
    \ rapid provisioning of data could be enabled with continuous\ninnovation, free\
    \ ﬂow of data transmission could be observed to and from sensors without\nbeing\
    \ clogged, on demand analytics with hybrid cloud and multicloud deployments could\n\
    be met, and distributed storage could be created in order to manage high-volume\
    \ generated\ndata. Having mentioned the aforementioned parameters, it could be\
    \ asserted in a nutshell\nthat agility and ﬂexibility need to be maintained at\
    \ the seconds or subseconds level of\ncomputing to manage the real-time complex\
    \ problems. Nonetheless, this has become\npossible with the help of IoT device\
    \ sensors. Since at the edge level, a ﬁnite amount of\nstorage is being maintained,\
    \ therefore the workﬂow optimization is to be designed in such\na way that it\
    \ can meet the real-time computing demands in seconds or subseconds level, i.e.,\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n21 of 37\nthe deﬁned system needs to be able to address\
    \ this problem of getting the data that come in\nquickly and starting to process\
    \ them to gain some insights into certain correlation and then\nkeep that storage\
    \ free for the next set of data that is coming in. Therefore, with respect to\n\
    workﬂow optimization, we need to look at the set of devices which needs to be\
    \ employed\nto be able to address all the data that are coming in. In this context,\
    \ if a High-Performance\nComputing (HPC) framework could be set over the edge\
    \ level, then the aforementioned\nissues are feasible to be resolved. It is essential\
    \ for the working of HPC framework attached\nto the edge to smoothen the workﬂow\
    \ optimization and scheduling criteria.\nVarious edge nodes require various types\
    \ of resources. To this end, it is necessary\nto select an appropriate scheduling\
    \ approach to ensure the consistency of resources and\nthe availability of services.\
    \ Researchers have suggested resource continuity management\napproaches, such\
    \ as the layered model Fog to Cloud (F2C) and OpenFog Reference Archi-\ntecture\
    \ (OpenFog RA) [180,181].\nThe F2C layered model is a novel architecture focused\
    \ on data sharing and data inte-\ngration that can achieve service parallelization\
    \ and less service execution time. OpenFog\nRA has been designed to meet the same\
    \ F2C objective [181]. Therefore, researchers are\nproposing a distributed management\
    \ system incorporating edge and cloud tools to efﬁ-\nciently achieve resource\
    \ consistency within a traditional hierarchical architecture [181,182].\nLi et\
    \ al. [183] came up with EveryLite, a lightweight scripting language for resource-\n\
    constrained, heterogeneous edge devices. Such tasks which are both time-limited\
    \ and\nspace-complex are referred to as microtasks by interfaces in the migration\
    \ process. In edge\ncomputing, EveryLite can perform microtasks. Kang et al. [184]\
    \ designed a lightweight\nscheduler that can automatically schedule tasks of different\
    \ layers of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNN) between mobile devices and the cloud data\
    \ center without proﬁling each program.\nBy becoming adapted to the lightweight\
    \ scheduler, working professionals can be adapted to\na range of low-latency and\
    \ energy-efﬁcient DNN architectures, hardware systems, wireless\nnetworks, and\
    \ server workloads.\nBy embracing cooperative competition and game theory, Zhang\
    \ et al. [122] established\nCoGTA, a system for allocation of tasks. For edge\
    \ computing systems, CoGTA aims at\ndelay-sensitive and social-sensing applications.\
    \ CoGTA may tackle a few crucial problems,\nsuch as Bottom-up Game-theoretic Task\
    \ Allocation (BGTA). Similarly, the Markovian\nstochastic channel was used by\
    \ Zhang et al. [185] to provide an optimal solution and\nofﬂoad strategy for collaborative\
    \ operation between cloud and edge devices. This problem\nof minimal energy scheduling\
    \ tasks can be formulated on directed acyclic graphs as a\nrestricted, shortest\
    \ path problem. This problem is then solved using the regular Lagrange\nRelaxation-dependent\
    \ Aggregated Cost (LARAC) algorithm.\nKwak et al. [186] suggested a dynamic allocation\
    \ algorithm for CPU/network resource\nor task in the mobile networking context.\
    \ To scale the CPU/network speed, they used\nthe Lyapunov optimization technique.\
    \ Meanwhile, Liang et al. [187] proposed a new\napproach to resource management\
    \ by taking into account both bandwidth availability and\nsource selection.\n\
    Data are distributed in edge computing which requires distributed data processing,\n\
    storage, and networking resources [0]. In addition, edge devices tend to be heterogeneous,\n\
    leading to a heterogeneous runtime environment and heterogeneous data on-edge\
    \ device.\nFurthermore, resources are limited on edge apps. As such, proposing\
    \ an optimum, complex,\nand energy-aware scheduling strategy in edge computing\
    \ is complicated. If resource\nabstraction and edge OS management would allow\
    \ developers to focus on their applications\nwithout trying to think about hardware,\
    \ connectivity, and code written for speciﬁc devices,\nthis would be a huge leap\
    \ forward for complex projects to be realized. This will reduce\ncomplexity, simplify\
    \ growth, and reduce edge computing costs for the ecosystem.\n3.3. HPC on Edge\
    \ (HPCE)\nThis new High-Performance Computing (HPC) solution seeks to move beyond\
    \ the\nagricultural services offered on edge and provide a comprehensive platform\
    \ for precision\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n22 of 37\nfarming and animal husbandry\
    \ and furnish with utility not only for farmers but also for\nstakeholders. The\
    \ HPCE architecture is adapted from CYBELE conceptual framework [2].\nThe HPCE\
    \ model uses open and proprietary vast amounts of datasets, including sensor\n\
    readings, as well as satellite data and historic climatic and environmental information\
    \ for\nready reference. While this would be the most effective way to use HPC\
    \ technology, it\nonly uses the latest software platforms and projects that are\
    \ being developed by HPCE’s e-\ncontrolled services, as well as increased HPC\
    \ e-infrastructure to enable huge heterogeneous\ndata processing to be done and\
    \ ﬁnd modern solutions to complex problems using dedicated\nalgorithms. Due to\
    \ the interconnection of large-oriented approaches, varying datasets,\nand available\
    \ big data techniques, it is possible to scale distributed big data research to\n\
    enormous scales when holding many types of datasets together in one place [2].\
    \ In doing\nso, it enables the aggregated data and metadata to be aligned semantically\
    \ to a standard\nscheme and data model and enables advanced data analytics to\
    \ take secret information\ninto account. In addition to this, the HPCE architecture\
    \ will also help in gaining insights\nfrom adaptive data visualization services.\n\
    With reference to CYBELE [2], the architectural approach of the HPC on edge is\n\
    illustrated in Figure 12. By organizing a product component based on interdependencies,\n\
    this is intended to highlight the importance of pipelines being constructed to\
    \ promote\ncompatibility and show how to maintain the integrity of interdependent\
    \ services. It is worth\nnoting that CYBELE resonates well with the EdgeX platform\
    \ architecture. EdgeX platform\ncomprises four core services, i.e., device services,\
    \ core services, supporting services, and\napplication services to enable smooth\
    \ workﬂow optimization [188]. In addition, it will be\ninteresting to see a synchronization\
    \ of EdgeX with a dedicated HPC framework for faster\nbatch processing of data\
    \ over edge.\nFigure 12. High Performance Computing on Edge.\nBig, heterogeneous\
    \ data are made available through repositories powered by HPC\nwhich is responsible\
    \ for the processing at the edge layer. In this regard, as can be seen in\nFigure\
    \ 11, HPC frameworks such as Spark, Hadoop, YARN, Big Deep Learning (BigDL),\n\
    Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and Kubernetes are deployed for the batch processing\
    \ of\ndata using distributed framework attached to the edge layer [189]. It is\
    \ worth noting that\nSpark and BigDL are the widely used frameworks in many organizations\
    \ for their open\nsource and high degree of interoperability features. Spark and\
    \ BigDL are based on MapRe-\nduce framework which has high room for tuning for\
    \ smooth workﬂow optimization [190].\nThe transmission of the application process\
    \ interface along with data from the cloud layer\nto the edge layer is conducted\
    \ using 4G/5G or ﬁber/DOCSIS/DSL communication system.\nThis is seen on the middle\
    \ section of the architecture as shown in Figure 12. At ﬁrst,\nAgriculture 2021,\
    \ 11, 475\n23 of 37\nthe data are processed in the background prior to being passed\
    \ on to the check-in stage\nfor data validator or timestamp validator for resolution\
    \ of data veriﬁcation and timing\nproblems. Once data are obtained in edge layer,\
    \ quality checks are conducted to identify\nanomalies and any other data irregularities,\
    \ maintaining their accuracy and validity, which\nare accompanied by a series\
    \ of measures aligned with processes of data cleansing.\nFinally, the HPE data\
    \ provenance service provides the mechanisms required for\nrecording all relevant\
    \ information concerning incoming data of interest. With HPE, the\ndata provenance\
    \ platform is inherently connected to the data policy and asset brokerage\nengine\
    \ that enables the platform to bind data providers and data users with data share\n\
    and business features. In addition to facilitating interoperability and reuse\
    \ of data, the\ninspected data are annotated and harmonized semantically. Since\
    \ the data come from a\nvariety of physically distributed data sources, a standard\
    \ data model will be created for\nthe semantic deﬁnition and annotation of the\
    \ data. To facilitate the pipeline and allow the\nvarious heterogeneous components\
    \ to communicate seamlessly, the model will be used as\na common language to annotate\
    \ data and exchange messages between the components.\nClean and semantically uplifted\
    \ data are then available, i.e., open and proprietary data to\nbe queried, analyzed,\
    \ and viewed. An exempliﬁcation of how ground sensors have their\ndata stored\
    \ and analyzed at cloud data base is shown in Figure 13. The on-ﬁeld data are\n\
    continuously assessed by a real-time monitoring system to ensure triggering effects\
    \ if any\nthreshold point is crossed. Simultaneously, the on-ﬁeld data are also\
    \ stored in the cloud\ndatabase from where the user can download the required\
    \ data and at the same time, data\nanalysis could be applied using the machine\
    \ learning tools stored over the cloud database.\nFigure 13. Illustration for\
    \ storage and analysis of data from ground sensors to cloud database.\nTo facilitate\
    \ simulation execution, a deﬁned experimental composition setting is de-\nsigned,\
    \ as shown in the top right part of the architecture (cloud layer) in Figure 12.\
    \ The\ncomposition framework of experiments aims to support the separate design,\
    \ development,\nand execution of big data research procedures, the support of\
    \ embedded scientiﬁc compu-\ntation and reproductive tests. In the analysis method,\
    \ its subsequent template is selected\nto provide each analytical template with\
    \ its own software and execution endpoint and\nallow the user to modify the appropriate\
    \ conﬁguration variables (i.e., input algorithm,\nexecution parameters, netting\
    \ parameters, and output parameters). The results of each\nanalytical template\
    \ are presented. The composition system for experiments will promote\nthe design\
    \ and implementation of data analysis workﬂows consisting of a number of data\n\
    analysis procedures, interconnected in terms of data sources and input and output\
    \ artifacts.\nThe outcome will constitute the input to another research template\
    \ when a template is\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n24 of 37\nexecuted. The output\
    \ of the research model is an object for session that contains all the\nmemory\
    \ output values.\nIn addition to big data, advanced analysis must be implemented\
    \ when selecting input\ndatasets and developing workﬂows. For HPCE, advanced analytical\
    \ algorithms are avail-\nable to stakeholders that allow them to explore various\
    \ forms of data visually and to ﬁnd\nand solve new trends. In order to achieve\
    \ improved delivery and monitoring, machining\nand predictive modelling methods\
    \ should be modiﬁed so as to handle the predictive life\ncycle of data planning,\
    \ detection, and analysis. However, the implementation of advanced\nanalytics\
    \ along with huge, complex data increases the need for strong computing power\n\
    and a higher processing memory, so that information can be collected within a\
    \ realistic\ntimeframe. When the test cases are executed, multiple HPC attributes\
    \ are needed, including\nstorage power, speed of the device, memory capacity,\
    \ and quick turnaround time.\nThe next section discusses the IoT-based communication\
    \ methodologies in edge\ncomputing used for precision farming developed by several\
    \ researchers.\n3.4. Edge Computing in Precision Farming\nIoT incorporation in\
    \ precision farming has brought about changes in the communica-\ntions of actuators\
    \ and sensors with remote servers. With respect to networking technologies,\n\
    modern IoT-capable nodes provide new energy-saving transceivers and network topologies\n\
    that are tailored to ﬁeld conditions where mobile and WiFi base stations are rare\
    \ [191].\nMultiple topologies that use wireless sensor networks can route data\
    \ messages via commu-\nnication nodes to reach a gateway with the internet connectivity,\
    \ as shown in the proposal\nfrom Akka and Sokullu [192].\nMore recent developments\
    \ with IoT involve network protocols to communicate\nthrough the internet with\
    \ remote devices via applications designed for data reduction. For\nmonitoring\
    \ purposes, for example [191,193,194], researchers used the MQTT protocol for\n\
    data collection from sensor nodes at greenhouses. These protocols allowed the\
    \ gathering\nand analysis by Shukla et al. of data at intermediate cloud middleware\
    \ [195]. A further\nexpanded analysis of this topic can be found in the work of\
    \ Kalox et al. [196]. A gateway\nusing ZigBee collects data from a real deployment\
    \ of sensors, which are then sent to a\ndata cloud driven by FIWARE through web-based\
    \ protocols. The work takes advantage\nof open interfaces to build a number of\
    \ client applications that can access the cloud mod-\nule. However, no IoT protocols\
    \ are used, and only an early version of FIWARE is used.\nMartinez et al. [197]\
    \ presented research on how to handle crops in PA environments using\nthe cloud\
    \ plane. The FIWARE core is used here, along with a collection of additional en-\n\
    ablers, to communicate with IoT gateways through a variety of protocols, such\
    \ as Message\nQueuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol\
    \ (CoAP), where\ncurrent and historical data are stored in the cloud for analytics.\
    \ The output of FIWARE\nis assessed for PA using a collection of synthetic tests,\
    \ but no real implementation of the\nproposal is provided. As per Zyrianoff et\
    \ al. [198], a reﬁned optimization has to be made in\nFIWARE to get it implemented\
    \ over fog computing domain.\nThe incorporation of intermediate processing stages\
    \ in the data path is an evolution\nof mainly cloud-based platforms. Before sending\
    \ monitored data to the cloud, Liu [199]\nperformed local preprocessing at data\
    \ collection gateways. Ferrandez-Pastor et al. [200]\nexpanded on this concept\
    \ by evaluating a range of IoT protocols and technologies in a\nreal hydroponic\
    \ implementation to achieve effective computation-ofﬂoading. Moreover, a\nsimilar\
    \ method for computation ofﬂoading was also implemented by Chang et al. [201]\n\
    in the domain of aeroponics. However, in these works, a lack of ﬂexibility is\
    \ noticeable\nin the way edge computing is implemented, and this layer is exclusively\
    \ oriented to data\nfusion. Guillen et al. [202] proposed a hybridization of Artiﬁcial\
    \ Intelligence (AI) with IoT\nin precision agriculture. However, it was found\
    \ that there is still a big gap between AI and\nIoT due to computational resources.\
    \ In this regard, they proposed an inclusion of Graphical\nProcessing Unit (GPU)\
    \ in the edge device to enhance the computational services [202]. For\nan efﬁcient\
    \ computation ofﬂoading, Chen et al. [203] proposed ThriftyEdge which has the\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n25 of 37\nsubstantial potential to support computational\
    \ intensive tasks by proper ofﬂoading across\nlocal device and edge cloud in proximity.\
    \ ThriftyEdge is well suited to be deployed in ad\nhoc networks for precision\
    \ agriculture [203].\nThe IoT-based generic monitoring system was deﬁned by Oliver\
    \ et al. [204]. It was\ndeployed and validated on ﬂoriculture domain, with a setup\
    \ of monitoring weather and\nsoil conditions. Strategically, the goal was to foresee\
    \ such diseases which could impede\nplantations proactively. For example, bacterial\
    \ leaf spots, damp-off root rots, soft rots, and\nbacterial spots are among such\
    \ diseases. HPE’s overall architecture is cloud-centric and\nuses an edge computer\
    \ node to gather information from the distributed sensor network.\nMySense is\
    \ a generic framework for the rapid development and use of precision wine sce-\n\
    narios monitoring application [205]. It consists of four layers, including sensors/actuators,\n\
    WSN/gateway, web, and cloud applications. For local tasks and real-time alarm\
    \ generation,\nfog computing is used on the WSN/gateway layer. The platform was\
    \ used in a winery to\nstudy the dynamics of diseases in the current microclimatic\
    \ setting.\nThe necessary ingredient that makes farming operations work is consistent,\
    \ productive\nsoil. Lavanya et al. [206] came up with an Internet-of-Things-based\
    \ sensing framework\nfor assessing nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium (NPK) concentrations\
    \ in soil. In order to\nallow a colorimetric approach in the sensor, Light Dependent\
    \ Resistors (LDR) and Light\nEmitting Diodes (LEDs) were used. A fuzzy rule-based\
    \ method implemented on an edge\ncomputer using Raspberry Pi was used to assess\
    \ the sensed values pertaining to nutrient\ndeﬁciency. To assess other nutrient\
    \ shortages, additional rules were added to this rationale.\nThis method was low-cost\
    \ and provided a quick alternative compared to laboratory testing\nmethods, which\
    \ take a longer time and are also costly. Soil fertility is optimized by assisting\n\
    farmers in effectively managing their soil nutrition, resulting in cost savings,\
    \ improved\nﬁeld management, and increased environmental conservation by eliminating\
    \ runoff and\nleaching pollution. Park et al. [207] presented an exemplary case\
    \ study in the domain\nof tomato production that demonstrated how edge computing\
    \ generated scalable data\nanalytics. In this case, a Raspberry Pi served as a\
    \ sensor setup base station and a network\nedge node. On the edge node, a prediction\
    \ analysis was implemented for the growth state\nof cherry tomato, and the data\
    \ generated were sent to a cloud-based central server for\nmodel integration and\
    \ analytical interpretation to gain insights to predict results. This\nstrategy\
    \ not only reduces data ﬂow, but it also allows farmers to preserve their data.\n\
    Atmospheric temperature is a critical factor for the productivity of plants, and\
    \ in\nthis regard, it plays a prominent role in irrigation planning and greenhouse\
    \ management.\nKrintz et al. [208] used Single Spectrum Analysis (SSA) along with\
    \ linear regression to\nintroduce a temperature forecast system using low-cost\
    \ microcontrollers and single board\ncomputer. The introduction of edge computing\
    \ in their methodological paradigm drasti-\ncally reduced the factor of latency.\
    \ The advantageous part of their developed system is\nthat the farmers can opt\
    \ for a microclimate monitoring network rather than installing a\nsophisticated\
    \ weather station.\nFan and Gao [209] also looked at task parallelism in mobile\
    \ edge computing. An\nofﬂoading delay may arise because of the transmission characteristics.\
    \ In addition, com-\nputation delay normally happens over cloud transactions while\
    \ determining when to\ncontinue with the operation. Merelli et al. [210] looked\
    \ at edge computing as a foundation\nfor metagenomics research in agriculture,\
    \ and found feasibility for remote microbial studies\nof water, air, and soil.\
    \ Traditional methods for metagenomics research necessitate a large\namount of\
    \ data transfer to the cloud. However, with the advent of advanced edge tech-\n\
    nologies, remote analyses can be performed, and the results can be sent to the\
    \ cloud using\na combination of System-on-a-Chip (SoC) and edge computing. A mix\
    \ of edge and cloud\nprovides a highly appealing approach to provide complete\
    \ analysis workﬂows. The results\nof the experiments revealed a 95 percent reduction\
    \ in data streaming, thereby demonstrat-\ning the feasibility of metagenomic research\
    \ at a remote level. For singular analyses, an edge\nsolution is feasible. On\
    \ the other hand, a subsequent work by the authors in the domain of\nmetagenomics\
    \ revealed that shifting computation to the cloud improves cost and efﬁciency\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n26 of 37\nas the frequency of analyses increases [211].\
    \ Nonetheless, if AI and blockchain can be\nincorporated over IoT services, then\
    \ the farmers and the stakeholders will obtain a better\nunderstanding of the\
    \ crops along with a fast and easy way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed crops\
    \ [212]. In addition, with the help of AI, water usage can be optimized and it\n\
    will also be possible to determine whether the treated wastewater is suitable\
    \ for irrigation at\na given point in time and what are the relevant crops on\
    \ which the treated wastewater can\nbe used, depending upon its composition [212].\

    \ technologies which can provide economically competitive domain to farm-\ning\
    \ sector along with ﬁnancial viability whilst enhancing environmental efﬁciency\
    \ and\nbeing socially acceptable are the need of the hour in terms of sustainability.\
    \ However, given\nthe availability of capital, meeting these sustainability targets\
    \ would often entail trade-offs.\nFurthermore, the objectives are “moving goals”\
    \ that must adapt to new problems and pri-\norities. Technological advancements\
    \ are rapid; however, their deployment in the farming\nsector remains incomplete.\
    \ It is quite common practice with the farmers in developing\nnations that they\
    \ tend to opt for trial-and-error methods in technology adoption rather than\n\
    following a systematic way. This could have signiﬁcant consequences for farm structure\n\
    and the number of farmers who will be able to make a living in the future.\n4.1.\
    \ Awareness Regarding the Latest Ongoing Technology\nAn initiative toward better\
    \ farmer education and training along with the help of\nﬁnancial resources, non-government\
    \ organizations, the media, and the general public\ncan contribute to making sustainable\
    \ farm technology adoption easier. Dedicated laws\ncan be put forward by the government\
    \ which may comprise incentives and disincentives\nfor the adoption of the latest\
    \ technology. Environmental laws along with zoning codes,\nanimal welfare guidelines,\
    \ and public health policies, are increasingly constraining farmers’\nactions.\
    \ In this regard, there is a deemed requirement for tailored digital technology\
    \ which\nthe farmers should get acquainted with. However, because of the numerous\
    \ parameters\ncomprising policy factors and economic situation at the helm in\
    \ different contexts, there is\nno adequate explanation for why farmers implement\
    \ speciﬁc technologies. Therefore, it\nbecomes necessary for the respective governments\
    \ to furnish substantial knowledge and\ninfrastructure to farmers to uplift their\
    \ respective agriculture segments.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n27 of 37\n4.2.\
    \ Government Support to Provide Adequate Infrastructure\nIt is important to determine\
    \ which innovations are most effective in particular situa-\ntions in respective\
    \ agricultural segments and it is also important to ensure an appropriate\nmechanism\
    \ to provide incentives to promote the achievement of sustainability goals for\
    \ the\nbeneﬁt of global welfare. Rationale for priorities of food production in\
    \ an environmentally\nfriendly way is often accomplished by the use of suitable\
    \ technologies. To achieve these\nobjectives, some goals need to be tweaked in\
    \ agricultural activities by aligning interests\nwith those goals. Additional\
    \ perks can be allocated to the farmers who understand the\nbeneﬁts from technology\
    \ and practice them.\nMore follow-up is needed in monitoring the implementation\
    \ of innovations in order\nto ensure transparency in policy factor and research\
    \ activities pertaining to the adoption\nof new technology in the agrisector.\
    \ Post implementation evaluations of results will\nhelp to correct mistakes before\
    \ too much money is pumped into the wrong segment.\nThis is critical because agricultural\
    \ innovations come from a variety of places. Rating\ntechnologies and predicting\
    \ potential future patterns will aid policymakers in moving\ntoward sustainable\
    \ agriculture.\nA broader participatory approach involving a variety of stakeholders\
    \ would promote\nthe implementation of innovations for sustainable farming systems.\
    \ Farmers along with\nconsumer groups and the associated agricultural food industry\
    \ who are inclined towards\nsustainable farming should be included as stakeholders.\
    \ Since sustainable technologies\nare applied at the farm level, therefore the\
    \ farmers must be involved in the technology\nadoption discussion. In an ideal\
    \ world, there will be a stronger sense of ownership in\nthe selection of technology\
    \ in the entire agricultural food chain. Farmers’ adoption of\ntechnology is inﬂuenced\
    \ by the associated industries. However, the industrial segment\nshould learn\
    \ from the farmers’ requirements, which will help them to standardize the latest\n\
    technology, which in turn will make a substantial impact on the farming sector.\n\
    4.3. Soil Analysis to Promote Variety of Crop Growth\nIn countries where farming\
    \ is still done in the conventional way, farmers grow crops\nby planting without\
    \ understanding the properties of soil and its quality. As a result of this,\n\
    in the long run, farmers will not beneﬁt from the amount of money they will earn\
    \ from\ntheir farming. The current soil testing process uses a manual method which\
    \ ﬁrst involves\nthe sampling of soil and then the submission of samples to laboratories\
    \ for analysis. Due\nto the lengthy and laborious process, this manual process\
    \ is inefﬁcient. Because of human\ninterference, there is a risk of human error.\
    \ As a result, farmers could obtain inaccurate\ninformation. In that case, there\
    \ is a need for an automated method for soil testing and crop\nprediction. Soil\
    \ testing is crucial because soil testing assists in understanding the fertility\n\
    of soil and this allows predictions to be made about the potential crop yield.\
    \ Therefore,\na system could be proposed that consists of a handheld device which\
    \ will provide a pH\nreading and will help estimate the quantity of nitrogen (N),\
    \ phosphorus (P), and potassium\n(K) in the soil. In addition, a classiﬁcation\
    \ algorithm can be developed to determine\ncrops suitable for speciﬁc applications\
    \ based on the data obtained from the system, and\naccordingly the appropriate\
    \ fertilizers for the ﬁeld can be provided.\n4.4. Providing Meteorological Services\
    \ to the Farmers\nBringing weather and climate knowledge into agricultural decision\
    \ making has con-\ntributed to an increase in agricultural production in many\
    \ countries. However, in develop-\ning countries where several small farms are\
    \ rain-fed, it is difﬁcult to get access to weather\nand climate information to\
    \ help direct decision making. Government ofﬁcials should\nconsider this critical\
    \ knowledge which is useful to farmers and others dealing with poverty\nand hunger.\
    \ This situation continues because national meteorological and hydrological\n\
    services in developing countries do not receive adequate funding to cover the\

    \ information\nabout the signiﬁcant role of meteorological services which contribute\
    \ to the socioeconomic\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n28 of 37\ndevelopment of the\
    \ nation. This state of obliviousness prevails even though governments\nconfront\
    \ multiple challenging issues in the realm of agriculture, water resources manage-\n\
    ment, health, and disaster risk mitigation, all of which are heavily affected\
    \ by weather\nand environment.\nDespite repeated periods of drought and crop failure,\
    \ as well as occasional famines,\nﬂooding often leads to losses of human life\
    \ and major property destruction. In addition,\nit also causes wide-ranging impacts\
    \ on socioeconomic growth. Therefore, it is only with\nthe advent of recent development\
    \ that there has been substantial study into quantifying\nthe beneﬁts of weather\
    \ and climate knowledge-related services. It is deemed necessary to\ntake small\
    \ steps by undertaking pilot projects to research the socioeconomic gains of using\n\
    weather and climate information-related services in agriculture.\n4.5. Yield Production\n\
    The feasibility of smart farming relies on internet connectivity and a panel to\
    \ accom-\nmodate the sensor hub. Using these features, it has become easier for\
    \ the farmers to monitor\nthe process of cultivation using their smart devices.\
    \ With the aid of sensors and intercon-\nnectivity, the smart farming initiative\
    \ helps farmers to optimize the consumption of water,\npesticide, and fertilizers\
    \ to maintain the yield quality by maintaining several parameters\nsuch as soil\
    \ condition, level of pesticide, temperature, and humidity. The system can be\n\
    made more successful by combining the fertilization and pesticide spraying systems,\
    \ all of\nwhich can be managed with an IoT application. Farmers may decide which\
    \ variety of crop\nis compatible for cultivation with their respective farm. Accordingly,\
    \ the farmers can opt\nfor innovative technologies such as drone-based farming\
    \ and various weather prediction\ntools, etc.\nYoung agropreneurs involved in\
    \ cultivation business can beneﬁt from smart farming\nin terms of farm maintenance,\
    \ irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application. The\nsensors in the smart\
    \ farming paradigm are tailored to report various readings, including\nmeasurements\
    \ pertaining to the number of pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation pump\nstatus,\
    \ humidity, and temperature. The readings also provide details pertaining to the\n\
    growth timeline of the crop, as well as the crop type, i.e., when it was grown,\
    \ the date it\nwas cultivated, and how much was harvested. In agriculture, IoT\
    \ is seen as a prominent\nand promising factor in the agricultural domain which\
    \ can boost the yield in a quick\nmanner. In addition, the smart farming paradigm\
    \ can also serve as an avenue for the\nstartup companies to invest in.\n4.6. Sustainable\
    \ Land Use\nThere have been empirical studies that have attempted to quantify\
    \ the effect of agri-\ncultural policies associated with land use sustainability;\
    \ however, these studies turned out\nto be inconclusive. Although different opinions\
    \ on the relationship between prices and soil\ndeterioration derive from differences\
    \ in discount rates and risk aversion preferences, it is\nimportant to deﬁne these\
    \ differences as this allows for better clariﬁcation when participat-\ning in\
    \ discussions with others. To understand the impacts of changes in relative prices\
    \ on\nagricultural resource distribution, four different responses can be distinguished:\
    \ (i) expan-\nsion of the total agricultural area (extensiﬁcation); (ii) rise\
    \ in the number of agricultural\ninputs used, also known as intensiﬁcation; (iii)\
    \ change in technology; and (iv) change in\ncrop choices. A differentiation is\
    \ to be made among recurring costs that are capable of\nraising productivity and\
    \ ﬁxed asset investments that work to enhance soil quality in the\nlong term.\n\
    If greater agricultural production occurs as a result of increased area, impact\
    \ on the\nenvironment in terms of deforestation, overgrazing, ﬂooding, and sedimentation\
    \ is a likely\nresult. If there are changes in cropping activities at the same\
    \ time as the expansion of\nthe land area, then the new cropping activities will\
    \ have an effect due to the soil quality\nthat depends on the negative impacts\
    \ of previous cropping activities on the resource.\nTherefore, it is unclear whether\
    \ the interplay among agricultural policies, along with\nAgriculture 2021, 11,\
    \ 475\n29 of 37\nthe supply response of farmers and the implications for sustainable\
    \ land use has been\nadequately explored.\n5. Conclusions\nThe scope of the current\
    \ paper is to introduce and pave the way for smart sensing\nwith edge computing\
    \ technology in the developing nations, whose gross domestic product\nrelies substantially\
    \ on agriculture. In this regard, the applicability of various sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ with an ease of edge computing has been put forward in this paper. Smart\nsensors\
    \ offer intriguing possibilities for precision agriculture. As of now, ongoing\
    \ research\nin edge computing and smart sensing for agricultural domain is only\
    \ in its initial stage.\nNonetheless, prototypes of edge computing systems have\
    \ already been developed by\nmany researchers for speciﬁc agricultural domains;\
    \ however, the interpretability of edge\ncomputing techniques with various sensing\
    \ units still remains a challenge. There is a\nneed to set up and deploy cost-effective\
    \ high-performance computing-based edge nodes\nto enable smooth data ﬂow operations\
    \ for precision agriculture. Implementing these\nsophisticated and efﬁcient edge\
    \ technologies will solve these issues and in a broader\nperspective, this will\
    \ open up a new segment for farmers in developing nations. In\naddition to this,\
    \ a major problem to be dealt with in this context is inadequate internet\nconnectivity,\
    \ which is seen as a global issue and which affects the growth of developing\n\
    and underdeveloped nations because not every region of the world has access to\
    \ the\ninternet. In a nutshell, to uplift the agricultural domain in developing\
    \ nations, a dedicated\ncost-effective infrastructure is required which can completely\
    \ digitize the farming sector in\nthe best possible way.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    to an Internet of Things (IoT) framework share the common goals of a consistent
    and structured data format that can be applied to any device, given the vast application
    scope of IoT. Additional goals include minimizing channel traffic and system energy
    consumption. In this paper, we propose to dismiss the requirement of certain seemingly
    crucial identifier fields from packets arriving through various sensor nodes in
    an agricultural IoT deployment. The proposed approach reduces packet size, thereby
    reducing channel traffic and energy consumption, as well as retaining the capability
    of identifying these originating nodes. We propose a method of a blind agricultural
    IoT node and sensor identification, which can be sourced and operated from a master
    node as well as a remote server. Additionally, this scheme has the capability
    of detecting the radio link quality between the master and slave nodes in a rudimentary
    form, as well as identifying the sensor nodes. We successfully trained and tested
    various multilayer perceptron-based models for blind identification, in real-time,
    using our implemented agricultural IoT implementation. The effect of changes in
    learning rate and momentum of the optimizer on the accuracy of classification
    is also studied. The projected cumulative energy savings across the network architecture,
    of our scheme, in conjunction with TCP/IP header compression techniques, are substantial.
    For a 100 node deployment using a combination of the proposed blind identification
    reduced sampling strategies over regular IPv4-based TCP/IP connection, an estimated
    annual saving of ≈99% is projected. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction The use of Internet of Things (IoT) has
    gradually permeated all walks of life, such as monitoring various macro-aspects
    of human habitations—cities, pollution mapping, and monitoring, agriculture, irrigation
    management, health-care, power supply management, transportation, education, and
    security—as well as the micro-aspects—smart home automation, child and elderly
    care, fire detection, and vehicle monitors. The evolution of simple wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) to IoT has significantly reduced end-to-end human intervention
    in routine tasks, such as agriculture, home automation, industrial monitoring,
    and environmental monitoring. The use of low-cost wireless sensors and robust
    addressing strategies are helping in the reuse and redeployment of sensors in
    various IoT applications and scenarios [1]. Starting from narrowly focused and
    homogeneous primitive sensor-based local processing and actuation methods, present-day
    networked systems have evolved into widely dispersed, heterogeneous sensor, and
    actuator systems with remote or distributed processing. These systems are becoming
    popular due to their scalability, ease of integration, and reduced cost of implementation.
    Additionally, domains such as big-data processing and cloud computing [2], integrated
    with IoT platform and addressing schemes are enabling large-scale fusion and automated
    analysis of data [3]. A. Implementation Overview In this paper, as outlined in
    the architecture in Fig. 1, we use an ensemble of multilayer perceptron (MLP)
    [4] models on a master node as well as a remote server to automatically detect
    link errors, identify sensor nodes, and then, identify each sensor from the packets
    received from various field sensor nodes. MLP has proved to be a powerful tool
    for pattern differentiation tasks [5]. The solar-powered, field-deployed sensor
    nodes (slave nodes) transmit their data to a nearby master node by means of short-range
    wireless communication radios, which in our case are ZigBee S1 radio modules.
    The aggregated data from the master node is then transmitted to a remote server
    through the Internet by making use of long-range wireless radios from a gateway
    device, which in our deployment is a cellular network supporting GSM module. The
    remote server acts as a data storage unit as well as an analytical engine prepped
    with the trained MLP models. Subscribers/users of this system can access the raw
    data as well as visualize the data arriving at the server via the Internet. In
    the field, we focus on our system deployed for monitoring various agricultural
    field parameters—soil moisture ( S m ), soil temperature ( S st ), humidity (
    S h ), rainfall ( S r ), solar-radiation ( S sr ), ambient temperature ( S at
    ), battery voltage of each node ( S vb ), and solar voltage generated at the solar
    panel of each node ( S sv )—the architecture of which is shown in Fig. 1. Practices,
    such as precision agriculture, irrigation management, and agricultural management
    are rapidly shifting their focus on information and communication technologies.
    These modern methods rely on the use of customized sensors for weather, soil,
    water, and plant monitoring for enabling the use of agricultural IoT [6]. The
    vast domains and agricultural expanses over which a multitude of sensors are deployed
    generate huge amount of data D such that for n sensor nodes, each generating data
    d per unit time, the overall data traffic generated in the network per unit time
    is represented in the form of a tuple as D={ d 1 , d 2 , d 3 ,…, d n } . The data
    from slave nodes N i ,∀i∈(1,n) can be either from a soil parameter monitoring
    node or a weather monitoring station. Therefore, d i ,∀i∈(1,n) can be either from
    a soil sensor node or a weather station in our implementation. Further, each of
    these constituent data from individual sensor nodes d can be again represented
    as a tuple such that d soil ={ S head , S m1 , S m2 , S m3 , S m4 , S st , S bv
    , S sv , S foot } and d weather ={ S head , S h , S r , S sr , S at , S bv , S
    sv , S foot } . S head , S foot , d soil , and d weather represent the packet
    header, footer, data from soil parameter sensor node, and data from weather monitoring
    station, respectively. Data of this magnitude cannot be locally processed and
    analyzed, albeit at the cost of making these implementations costly. The use of
    low-cost sensors with reconfigurable radios, and an easily accommodating architecture
    can only be sustained and made cheaper if the processing is performed remotely
    at a master node as well as a remote server, and not on the field-deployed sensor
    nodes themselves. To further enhance the usefulness of this approach, reduction
    in operating costs and channel traffic are required for seamless operation of
    this architecture. Fig. 1. Architecture of the implemented agricultural IoT-based
    field monitoring system. Show All Assumption 1:The slave nodes N , which are placed
    at the boundary of the master node’s radio range, fail to transmit data due to
    link loss only. Assumption 2:The consolidated readings from each node ( N 1 ,
    N 2 ,… ), which consist of soil moisture, soil temperature, battery voltage, and
    solar voltage sensors, have very minute variations. These are due to variations
    in depth of the soil moisture sensor, terrain type, temperature conditions, and
    soil moisture heterogeneity [7], [8]. Fig. 1 shows the characteristics of links
    between the master and slave nodes of our deployed system. The nodes are assumed
    to be fixed and well optimized, due to the use of low power solutions such as
    ZigBee or 6LoWPAN. Without changes in the existing radio standards, modifications
    in the radio links are not an option without increasing the cost of deployment.
    Two approaches are undertaken to reduce the network data-load as outlined in Fig.
    1—master-node data compression and header compression over the TCP/IP network.
    Energy conservation within the domain of a master-node make use of schemes, such
    as compressive sensing, sink placement, and cluster-based routing [9], whereas
    energy conservation follows techniques, such as header compression [10], edge
    computing [11], fog computing, and other paradigms [12] when the data is in the
    realm of TCP/IP. Within the domain of the master node, to reduce D , the sampling
    instants of the sensor nodes themselves are changed to achieve reduced network
    data load D opt . For an original sensor sampling frequency of ω original , a
    reduced sensor sampling frequency ω reduced , and a scaling factor k , D opt (
    ω reduced )<D( ω original ) , such that ω reduced =(1/k) ω original ,∀k>1 . This
    is possible only for applications such as agriculture, as they deal with data
    which is not of temporal criticality and can be deemed as noncritical data. Delays
    in transmission of agricultural field data do not affect the purpose of deployment—monitoring
    changes in field and weather parameters, which tend to change slowly over time—as
    compared to time-critical systems such as fire monitors and health monitoring
    systems. The additional improvement is proposed in the communication link between
    the master node and the remote server. Prior to transmission to the remote server,
    the master node packetizes data in the correct order so that data from the individual
    nodes as well as sensors can be identified. A sample packet of the data from the
    master node to the server is shown in Fig. 2(a). Here, we propose a blind identification
    method using pretrained MLPs, where the master node periodically uploads data
    to the server with just the sensor data, data index, and date fields, as shown
    in Fig. 2(b). The learning algorithms in the remote server are responsible for
    identifying link errors, node identifiers, as well as sensor identifiers, from
    the incoming optimized data packets. The blind identification approach is evaluated
    at the remote server as well as the master node to reduce the unnecessary network
    transmission latency between the master node and the remote server. Fig. 2. Format
    of packets sent from slave to master nodes. (a) Original packet format. (b) Optimized
    packet format. Show All Within the purview of each master node, we intentionally
    implement sensor nodes with low-computational capability, in order to allow for
    an economical large-scale sensor-node implementation. Any approach which increases
    the computational complexity of the slave nodes, such as compressive sensing,
    and intelligent routing, automatically increases the overall cost of the field
    implementation. Hence, our proposed scheme implements slave nodes, which simply
    collect data from various locations in a field and forward it to a master node,
    which inturn removes the local packet identifiers and tags, prior to forwarding
    it over the Internet. Once the sensed data leaves the master node, header compression
    is applied on it to further reduce the network data-load of the implementation
    on the Internet. Robust header compression (ROHC) is one of the most popular techniques
    dealing with packet header compression over the Internet [10]. In lieu of our
    implementation, ROHC accentuated 3G/LTE telecommunication uplinks connecting the
    master node to the remote server is considered in addition to our proposed scheme,
    for compression of the packets gathered from the master nodes. This paper is organized
    as follows. Section II explores the state of the art in this domain. Section III
    provides the system overview and describes the dataset, followed by the details
    of the experimental setup in Section IV. Section V provides the performance analysis
    of our proposed scheme, followed by the conclusion of this paper in Section VI.
    SECTION II. Related Work The involvement of IoT with various ancillary technologies
    such as cloud, machine learning, big data, and others has resulted in rapid development
    of societally beneficial and impactful solutions boasting of a multitude of features—intelligence,
    scalability, automation, virtualization, and others. IoT platforms integrated
    with cloud-based infrastructure for load provisioning and execution of applications
    provide the additional advantages of virtualization of infrastructure as demonstrated
    by Truong and Dustdar [13]. Similar works on IoT-cloud framework for cooperation
    between cloud and smart devices was demonstrated by Kum et al. [2], whereas Nastic
    et al. [14] demonstrated the use of IoT-based software-defined units for controlling
    cloud systems. The use of reconfigurable smart sensors for IoT in industrial environments
    was demonstrated by Chi et al. [15]; whereas, Lazarescu [16] demonstrated the
    use of IoT and WSN in long-term environmental monitoring. Offloading data to a
    more powerful remote computing facility allows for processing intensive tasks
    such as automated analytics, learning, and automation, which is yet another important
    aspect of IoT [17]. Agriculture is a domain which is actively transitioning toward
    the use of IoT and machine learning for monitoring, analysis, prediction, and
    automation in tasks, which was previously manual and intuition-based. Transcending
    from traditional implementations of IoT, Kaloxylos et al. [6] described the implementation
    of an IoT-cloud-based precision farming system, achieving an Agri-IoT-cloud-based
    framework. More recently, IoT-based agricultural solution pilots are deployed
    across multiple countries in order to usher in food-security, reduce wastage of
    food, and scientifically optimize agricultural practices [18]. Similarly, IoT
    platforms are developed for precision agriculture as well as ecological monitoring
    [19]. The surging plethora of data types, architectures, and applications associated
    with IoT face the bottleneck of network bandwidth, which for most cases is established
    using legacy technologies, such as IPv4 over TCP or UDP. Various approaches for
    optimizing network bandwidth usage of in-place network infrastructure are proposed
    over the years. Approaches ranging from reduction of transmitted packet size [10]
    and judicious use of edge devices [20] to edge mining [11] have reported various
    degrees of successes in network bandwidth optimization. Header compression solutions
    such as ROHC [10], ROHCv2 [21], and others [12] build upon the fact that headers
    are static/constant in an IP stream. Synthesis: Solutions addressing the problem
    of payload minimization of the gathered data from the local networks connected
    to an IoT infrastructure is lacking, especially in agricultural scenarios. As,
    the bulk of the nodes and sensors deployed in these scenarios are resource and
    energy constrained, strategies must be devised to minimize their energy consumption
    in the long run. Additionally, these nodes are expected to house multiple heterogeneous
    sensors, which increases the payload size generated from each of these nodes.
    The payload, being uploaded to the cloud through the Internet reaches gargantuan
    proportions, in cases of large IoT deployment with frequent data sampling. SECTION
    III. System Overview The architecture of our implemented agricultural IoT is divided
    into four parts: 1) slave nodes; 2) master node; 3) IoT framework; and 4) the
    remote stochastic learning (RSL) module. The architecture of this implementation
    is shown in Fig. 1. Each slave node N i hosts ATmega328P processor with a processing
    speed of 16 MHz, and is equipped with four soil moisture sensors S m1 to S m4
    , placed at depths of 15 cm, 30 cm, 45 cm, and 60 cm. Additionally, the slave
    nodes are equipped with a soil temperature sensor, battery voltage detector, and
    solar voltage detector circuitry which is connected to the battery and a solar
    panel. The radio used is a ZigBee module, which is configured to work in a mesh
    network. The customized mini-processor in the slave node also control relays,
    which may be connected to pumps for automatic irrigation by triggering them from
    the remote server. Some of the deployed slave nodes in our implementation are
    shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Our implemented agricultural IoT slave nodes. (a) Weather
    station, (b) soil sensor node, and (c) weather station. Show All The master node
    communicates to the slave nodes via ZigBee radio links. The master node hosts
    a quad-core ARM Cortex A53 (ARMv8), with a processing speed of 1.2 GHz. It also
    acts as the local gateway for its networked slave nodes, providing them with locally
    identifiable addresses within its operational domain. The communications from
    and to the remote server to the slave nodes are redirected through this gateway,
    which also happens to be the master node for this IoT framework. Multiple such
    gateways can be easily incorporated into the IoT framework to send their data
    to the remote server via the Internet. Our implemented server runs a Windows 8
    operating system with an Intel i3 processor, and clock speed of 3.72 GHz. The
    RSL module is hosted on the remote server. The data from all nodes D opt in the
    field are continually uploaded to the remote server by means of Web-sockets through
    the gateway. The pretrained models (Algorithm 1) in the server are used for classifying
    the incoming data. The data, after being sorted by the RSL module are analyzed
    for determining the field stress conditions and water requirements of crops. The
    actuators controlling the irrigation pumps can be accordingly activated from the
    server based on the soil parameter threshold conditions programmed in the server
    module. The whole field-side, slave node placement is divided into two parts based
    on the radio range R of the slave nodes from the master node—normal range and
    boundary range. The nodes in the boundary range tend to lose connection to the
    master node occasionally due to bad weather conditions and other unavoidable circumstances.
    Algorithm 1 RSL Show All procedure CREATE MODEL Q Show All procedure CREATE MODEL
    N Show All procedure CREATE MODEL S Show All A. Data The data obtained from various
    sensors affixed to a slave node d i is sent to the master node, from where it
    is uploaded to a remote server via the Internet using the IoT platform. Initially,
    the packets are uploaded in the format given in Fig. 2(a). Each slave sends d
    i =14 bytes of data per second. The data logging interval ω can be increased or
    decreased on-demand by means of text messages from its registered users/owners,
    which changes the values of the scaling factor k accordingly. We, additionally,
    reduce some of the fields from the data packets, and henceforth, refer to it as
    the optimized packet [Fig. 2(b)]. The reduction of 4 bytes of data per slave,
    per second, is a significant reduction in data volume, in case of long-term monitoring
    using large-scale sensor networks. Specific to our implementation, nodes 1 and
    3 are placed in the boundary zone, as depicted in Fig. 1. They have a high probability
    of link errors (Assumption 1). Nodes 2 and 4 are in the normal range of the master
    node and suffer from relatively, minuscule errors due to link failure. Subsequently,
    even after reducing the packet size, we can further reduce the data load to the
    server by reducing the data polling interval to twice per hour. As the sensors,
    in this case, are used for noncritical data measurement and the soil parameters
    tend to change slowly over time, this drastic reduction in data sampling does
    not significantly affect the overall decision-making process. This strategy would
    have been unthinkable in case of critical data, such as those obtained from health-care,
    traffic [22], or disaster management implementations of IoT. However, we find
    that the packet size reduction works fine with all applications of this framework.
    Assumption 3:The individual sensors in a sensor node have negligible fingerprints,
    even if they are of the same type. This may be due to insufficient hardware calibration
    [23] or even due to atomic level irregularities induced at the time of device
    fabrication. Assumption 4:The soil moisture sensors depend on the variation in
    dielectric constants between air, soil, and water to measure soil moisture content.
    This varies slightly due to varying electromagnetic interference (EMI) at various
    locations. Proof:The changes in dielectric properties of a substance, due to the
    introduction of an electromagnetic field, depends on the polarization effect of
    molecules. For a relative dielectric permittivity of E , the variation of E with
    frequency ω as described by Romano et al. [24] is given as E(ω)= E ′ (ω)−j[ E
    ′′ (ω)+ σ DC ω E 0 ] (1) View Source where: AbbreviationExpansion E ′ (ω) real
    component and signifies the energy stored in the system due to alignment of dipoles
    and EMI; E ′′ (ω) imaginary component and accounts for the dissipation of energy;
    σ DC signifies DC electrical conductivity and depends on actual transport of charge
    carriers; ω angular frequency of the imposed electromagnetic field. Changes in
    E ′ (ω) due to unnecessary EM interference or soil properties give rise to variations
    in sensor readings from the same type of soil moisture sensors. However, these
    changes are very small [24], and are neglected from consideration in this paper.
    SECTION IV. Experimental Setup This section discusses the experimental setup used
    in this paper. This covers the methodology used, remote server-based learning,
    and the computation of the carbon footprint for the implementation. Four assumptions
    are taken into account while applying the methodologies on the discussed architecture
    and learning modules in the server, as given by Assumptions 1–4. A. Overview of
    the Experiments As discussed in Section III, the placement of nodes is mainly
    divided into two groups: 1) normal range and 2) boundary range. We classify the
    unlabeled data arriving at the server and fit against the models generated using
    historical data from both normal and boundary range slave nodes. The method of
    classifying the data is outlined in Algorithm 1. On the training dataset, we first
    choose the ideal learning rate and momentum values (described in the next section)
    of the MLP-based classifier. Upon finally arriving at an optimum value, which
    can be used for the three cases—link error detection, node identification, and
    sensor identification—we demonstrate the accuracy of detection and loss minimization
    by a mean squared loss estimator (MSE), for our method. As a typical master node
    is resource constrained in terms of computation power, we modify the MLP architecture
    at the remote server to make its execution feasible on the master node. We term
    the original MLP model at the remote server as the Heavy model and the modified
    one on the master node as the Light model. Finally, we calculate the carbon footprint
    of our approach against the previous unoptimized approach. The carbon footprint
    of a system is calculated in terms of emission of CO2 released in the atmosphere
    in order to generate the power consumed by the system. The emission factor for
    an electric system is 6.89551× 10 −4 metric tons of CO2/kWh, as per e-GRID of
    the United States Environment Protection Agency, from the year 2010 data. In other
    words, consumption of 1 kWh of electricity releases 0.16 kg of CO2 in the atmosphere.
    This quantity may seem insignificant, but it tends to build up in cases of large
    sensor network deployments, running over prolonged periods of time. B. Methodology
    The data from Normal range nodes are grouped in a class and the Boundary range
    nodes are grouped into another class for training the MLP-based classifier. Our
    approach of dropping node and sensor identifiers from the packets makes it necessary
    to have an identification process in place which will categorize the uploaded
    data accordingly. Algorithm 1 identifies link errors as well as categorizes the
    incoming data into the various node and sensor classes according to their fingerprints.
    Although the sensors may be the same in all nodes, they do have minute variations
    of their own due to insufficient sensor and hardware calibration, a mismatch in
    placement depth [23], varying land topology and heterogeneity in soil moisture
    profiles [7], [8]. Similarly, the individual sensors are also differentiated from
    each other due to the inherent presence of minute calibration mismatch, fabrication
    irregularities and nonlinearity; this irregularity proves beneficial for our individual
    sensor identification. Fig. 4 shows the overall collective scheme of using the
    three trained models—Model Q, Model N, and Model S—in detecting link errors, identifying
    sensor nodes, and then identifying the individual sensors in each node. Fig. 4.
    Dataflow representation of the server-side packet restructuring module or the
    RSL module. Show All C. Remote Learning The following three modules—Model Q, Model
    N, and Model S—comprise the RSL algorithm in the server. The working of these
    modules is shown in Fig. 4. These models are trained based on the previously collected
    data. New data from the sensor nodes coming into the server are classified based
    on these pretrained models. The ensemble of these three models is used for blind
    identification of packets and its features from a restructured and reduced packet,
    arriving at the remote server. 1) Optimizer Selection: The optimizer selection
    ensures precise and speedy decision making for any machine learning-based algorithm.
    A stochastic gradient descent (SGD) [25] approach over back-propagation is chosen
    due to its high variance, low running cost, low-memory requirements, and ability
    to handle large data sizes over the entire training set. SGD operates by updating
    an objective J(θ) , where θ is one of its parameters, as θ:=θ−α ∇ θ E[J(θ)] (2)
    View Source where E[J(θ)] is the expectation of the objective and is calculated
    over the entire training set. However, in an SGD update, the expectation term
    is eliminated and is represented as θ:=θ−α ∇ θ J(θ; x (i) , y (i) ) . The values
    of ( x (i) , y (i) ) are obtained from the ith iteration of the training set.
    The objective updates are calculated based on small training data. 2) Activation
    Function Selection: A proper activation function selection is critical to our
    operation as it defines the distribution of the data to pass. For our approach,
    a regularized linear unit (ReLU) [26] is used as the activation function, instead
    of the traditional Sigmoid function, as the output of the Sigmoid function lies
    in the range [0, 1] and tends to saturate beyond this. The ReLU, on the other
    hand, has a range of [0,∞] and can be used for modeling real numbers, instead
    of just probability (as is done by Sigmoid functions). A Sigmoid function is represented
    as σ(x)=(1+ e −x ) −1 . In contrast to the Sigmoid function, the ReLU function
    is denoted as f(x)= Σ ∞ i=1 σ(x−i+0.5) . f(x) is similar to f(x)=log(1+ e x )
    , which is also referred to as a Softplus function and is approximated as f(x)=log(1+
    e x )≈max(0,x+N(0,1)). (3) View Source This is often referred to as rectified
    linear function (ReL). The gradient of the ReL function does not vanish, unlike
    the Sigmoid-based activation functions. 3) Learning: The data is generally shuffled
    prior to training in order to avoid biasing due to unforeseen, repetitive patterns
    in the dataset. Another function, the momentum ( γ ), is used to speed up the
    convergence of the objective. The update of momentum is given by v= θ= γv+α ∇
    θ J(θ; x (i) , y (i) )∀size(v)=size(θ) θ−v (4) (5) View Source where v is the
    current velocity and γ∈(0,1] . Section V shows the learning rate ( α ) and momentum
    value ( γ ) selection for the given agricultural sensor dataset. It also demonstrates
    the superiority of the ReLU-based activation over Sigmoid-based functions in SGD
    implementation of our system. D. Calculating the Carbon Footprint The carbon footprint
    of the architecture and our proposed improvement is calculated as S S−M = S S−M
    = S payload−14 + S ZigBee−API bytes S payload−14 +24bytes (6) (7) View Source
    where S S−M is the size of data received at the master node from the slave, S
    payload−14 is the data collected from the sensors and other parameters of the
    slave node using the original packet format ( ≃14 bytes, in this case), as shown
    in Fig. 2(a). S ZigBee-API is the ZigBee API’s frame format, which is fixed at
    24 bytes [27]. Again, it takes P 1-bit =184.9μW /bit to transmit 1 bit of data;
    ZigBee takes 1 s to transmit 24 bytes of data [27]. As we focus only on reducing
    the payload of the ZigBee data, from the slave to the master node. Henceforth,
    we shall consider only the payload part for our carbon footprint computation.
    Moreover, the slave and master nodes run on solar power and can be safely considered
    as zero-carbon footprint devices. The part of the architecture, starting from
    the gateway to the remote server (as shown in Fig. 1) have high energy requirements
    and rely on traditional and mostly nonrenewable energy sources. However, the use
    of approaches such as ROHC-based header compression significantly reduces the
    energy consumption of this part of the network architecture. The remaining part
    of the architecture consisting of sensor nodes is dependent on solar energy for
    regular operation and does not generate a carbon-footprint. Hence, only the path
    from gateway to the remote server is considered for carbon footprint computation
    of our approach. Since the master node discards the ZigBee-API frames, we represent
    the effective packet size sent to the remote server as S U = S payload−14 , where
    S U is the unoptimized packet size. Furthermore, S O and S OR are assigned to
    indicate optimized packet size and optimized packet size with reduced sampling,
    respectively. For S payload−10 and S payload−10−r denoting the reduced payload
    and the reduced payload with reduced data sampling, we assign, S O = S payload−10
    and S OR = S payload−10−r . Subsequently, for P (kWh) signifying the power consumed
    (in kW ) for transmitting S payload bytes of data per hour, and C P denoting the
    carbon footprint in kg-CO2 released into the atmosphere, we denote P(kWh)=185.9×
    10 −6 × S payload ×3.6 and calculate C P =P(kWh)×0.16  Kg-CO 2 . SECTION V. Performance
    Analysis This section discusses the output obtained from the experimental setup.
    The MLP is trained over the dataset, for both Sigmoid and ReLU activations. The
    learning rate ( α ) and momentum ( γ ) are varied to check the accuracy of classification
    for all three RSL modules— Model Q , Model N , and Model S —for determining the
    optimum MLP parameters. To sum-up the MLP results. Fig. 5(a) and (d) shows the
    performance of the Sigmoid and ReLU-based activation functions in determining
    link errors. The ReLU-based parameters, with α=[0.01,0.001] and 0.7≥γ≤0.9 , consistently
    perform better than all other cases. Fig. 5(b) and (e) shows that ReLU with α=[0.1,0.01]
    and 0.8≥γ≤0.9 , show superior performance over Sigmoid activation for classifying
    various nodes, from the incoming dataset. Fig. 5(c) and (f) shows the performance
    of the MLP in classifying the various sensors in a node. Here, ReLU activation
    for α=0.1 and 0.7≥γ≤0.9 give the best performance, for classifying individual
    sensors, from the incoming data. The optimum hyper-parameters, determined for
    the training of the three heavy RSL modules at the remote server— Model Q , Model
    N , and Model S —are evaluated using an ReLU activation, SGD optimizer, MSE loss
    function with α=0.01 and γ=0.9 for the Decay, Epoch, and Batch-size of the MLP
    set to 1× 10 −6 , 50, and 16, respectively. The model specific MLP parameters
    for the three models are 2 inputs, 2 outputs, and 2 hidden layers with 64,128
    neurons each for Model Q , 7 inputs, 4 outputs, and 2 hidden layers with 128,128
    neurons each for Model N , and 4 inputs, 5 outputs, and 64,128 neurons in 2 hidden
    layers for Model S , respectively. The corresponding accuracy of classification,
    achieved by using these parameters are 96% for Model Q , 92.5% for Model N , and
    95.6% for Model S units of the RSL module at the remote server. Fig. 6(a) and
    (b) shows the changes in accuracy and the minimization of loss (using MSE) for
    the RSL modules during training of the dataset. The dataset was trained over 50
    epochs, as beyond this the learning curve saturates and no further improvement
    in learning is achieved. Fig. 5. Effect of γ and α variations on the accuracy

    packet over TCP/IP, (G2) optimized packet over TCP/IP, (G3) optimized packet with
    reduced sampling (sampled every alternate second) over TCP/IP, (G4) optimized
    packet with reduced sampling (sampled every fourth second) over TCP/IP, and (G5)
    unoptimized packet over ROHC TCP/IP—calculated with respect to varying nodes for
    a year. For a 100 node deployment, it is estimated that, as compared to the proposed
    scheme, the use of ROHC instead of compressionless TCP/IP achieves an overall
    reduction in carbon footprint by 50% for the same datasize as shown in Fig. 7(a)
    G1 and G5. Additionally, comparison between approaches G1 with G2, G3, and G4
    shows that our proposed scheme achieves savings of over 99% CO2 generated annually
    over regular IPv4 TCP/IP transmission. Again, comparing G1 with G5 (ROHC with
    comparable dataload), we observe that ROHC manages to attain further savings of
    50% of the CO2 generated annually for the same datasizes. It is to be noted that
    header compression schemes such as ROHC do not affect the payload size of the
    transmitted data. Additionally, as both uncompressed IPv4 packets over TCP/IP
    and ROHC work beyond the purview of the master node, massive savings in generated
    data within the master node’s domain affects the carbon footprint beyond its operational
    boundaries by dictating the payload size. Our proposed scheme manages to massively
    reduce the payload size of the data to be transmitted over the network to the
    remote server. The additional use of compression methods such as ROHC, which is
    primarily a header compression scheme, further helps in the reduction of carbon
    footprint [as shown in the inset plot in Fig. 7(a)] in domains such as agriculture,
    where the need for real-time data is not necessary. Fig. 7. Carbon footprint of
    the agricultural deployment with 100 nodes, projected for all the 5 approaches
    for a year, and comparison between master-node and remote server-based learning
    approaches within the same implementation. (a) Carbon footprint for 100 nodes
    over a year. (b) Metrics for learning at the master node versus at the remote
    server. Show All It is to be noted that having the learning models integrated
    directly with the master node would reduce the network load, and the latency caused
    thereof. However, we found that the latencies produced due to the operation of
    MLP models hosted at master node [as shown in Fig. 7(b)], were much higher than
    the 1 min mark, rendering them useless for operation in a real-time manner. These
    models and their parameters are similar in all respects to the ones hosted at
    the remote server, which we label as Heavy Model in Fig. 7(b). Upon modifying
    the MLP model architectures to make them extremely lightweight for faster service
    at the master nodes [light model in Fig. 7(b), which has 2 hidden layers each
    with 5,5 neurons], albeit at the cost of detection accuracies, we found that the
    latencies were almost double of the ones incurred at the server. Additionally,
    it is worthwhile to mention that the detection accuracies of the three trained
    models fell below 70% in case of Model N and Model S , whereas it fell below 30%
    for Model Q . In summary, Fig. 7(b) highlights the importance and need of remote
    learning at the server in comparison to learning at the master nodes for the same
    MLP architectures. SECTION VI. Conclusion This paper proposes an optimized method
    for detecting simple link failures between slave and master nodes. Additionally,
    the method for identifying slave nodes from data packets, even in the absence
    of node identifiers in the payload packet and identifying individual sensors in
    a node, in the absence of sensor identifier in the payload packet has also been
    designed and tested. This approach is tested on a remote server as well as a constrained
    master node, much nearer to the implementation site. Outsourcing the error detection
    and other identification tasks, which are computation intensive, to a remote server,
    allows the use of low-cost, low-specification and low-energy processors for IoT
    deployment. This method of minimizing packet size of traffic between slave to
    master node and to the remote server, via the Internet results in substantial
    reduction of network traffic, reduction of data, and conservation of node energy.
    The choice of hosting the proposed scheme at a master node severely hampers the
    performance of the scheme by increasing the on-node execution time. Even implementing
    lighter MLP models incur higher execution time at a master node. We conclude that
    the benefits of hosting these MLP models at the remote server far outweigh the
    benefits of minor savings in network bandwidth offered by hosting these models
    at the master node. In the future, we plan to implement unsupervised learning
    methods and other online learning methods to accommodate for heterogeneous data
    from sensor networks of similar or different types. Authors Figures References

    Abstract: Smart Farming (SF) is an emerging technology in the current agricultural
    landscape. The

    aim of Smart Farming is to provide tools for various agricultural and farming
    operations to improve

    yield by reducing cost, waste, and required manpower. SF is a data-driven approach
    that can

    mitigate losses that occur due to extreme weather conditions and calamities. The
    inﬂux of data from

    various sensors, and the introduction of information communication technologies
    (ICTs) in the ﬁeld

    of farming has accelerated the implementation of disruptive technologies (DTs)
    such as machine

    learning and big data. Application of these predictive and innovative tools in
    agriculture is crucial

    for handling unprecedented conditions such as climate change and the increasing
    global population.

    In this study, we review the recent advancements in the ﬁeld of Smart Farming,
    which include novel

    use cases and projects around the globe. An overview of the challenges associated
    with the adoption

    of such technologies in their respective regions is also provided. A brief analysis
    of the general

    sentiment towards Smart Farming technologies is also performed by manually annotating
    YouTube

    comments and making use of the pattern library. Preliminary ﬁndings of our study
    indicate that,

    though there are several barriers to the implementation of SF tools, further research
    and innovation

    can alleviate such risks and ensure sustainability of the food supply. The exploratory
    sentiment

    analysis also suggests that most digital users are not well-informed about such
    technologies.

    1. Introduction

    Agriculture is an indispensable ﬁeld of study, as the continued survival of the
    human

    race depends on it. New and updated technology has been implemented throughout
    the

    ages in order to improve agricultural output and sustainability. The world’s population
    is

    expected to grow to approximately 9.7 billion by the year 2050 [1]. To keep up
    with this

    increase in population, food production needs to go up by 70%. However, the resources

    available to produce the required food output are steadily decreasing due to climate
    change

    and an increase in the number of settlements. Water levels are receding, arable
    lands are

    shrinking, and the environment is being rapidly degraded. The agricultural industry
    is

    also one the biggest contributors of greenhouse gases. The strain on the availability
    of

    food across the world is predicted to increase drastically with the increase in
    the world

    population over the next few decades [2,3]. Agriculture 4.0, or the fourth agricultural

    revolution, was discussed by the World Government Summit in 2018 in the report
    titled

    ‘Agriculture 4.0—The Future of Farming Technology’ [4]. The report highlights
    the need for

    more efﬁcient food production practices that can overcome the increasing food
    demand in

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4, 424–460. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriengineering4020029

    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriengineering

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    coming years. It would be nearly impossible to keep up with this increase in demand
    with-

    out the integration of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and disruptive

    technologies (DTs) such as remote sensing, Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning,
    big

    data, etc., into the agricultural industry. Smart Farming is of great interest
    to researchers

    and scientists as it has yielded great results in reducing the ecological footprint
    of farm-

    ing [5], improving production efﬁciency [6], reducing human labor through unmanned

    vehicles [7,8], detecting diseases through image processing [9,10], and more.

    Precision farming is an approach that utilizes ICTs to monitor resources such
    as

    crops, ﬁelds, and animals [11]. It aims to maximize resource usage and crop yield
    while

    minimizing associated costs. The agricultural sector consumes a signiﬁcant amount
    of

    resources in the form of water, land, fertilizer, and energy. Precision farming
    is concerned

    with calculating the exact amount of resources required to grow plants and sustain
    livestock.

    Smart Farming (SF), which could be considered an extension of precision farming,
    focuses

    on utilization of data obtained from precision farming in an intelligent way and
    making crop

    production more efﬁcient by predicting crop yield [12,13], reducing wastage of
    resources,

    automating tasks [14], and providing agricultural management support [15]. It
    can also

    be used to perform soil analysis [16], so that crops of optimal quality can be
    grown. There

    have been several calamities in recent years that occurred due to climate change
    [17]. In

    light of these calamities, there is great need for smart farming to help manage
    agricultural

    activities. Due to the various risks and external factors associated with farming,
    such as

    weather extremities and plant diseases, implementation of data-driven predictive
    tools,

    which can be used to provide insights into farming operations such as crop yield,
    feed

    intake, weather conditions, soil conditions, etc., is crucial for mitigation [18].
    Decisions can

    thereby be made based on real-time data rather than heuristic, thumb-rule data.

    The availability of huge amounts of data from Internet of things (IoT) devices
    has

    allowed for application of big-data tools. The development of Artiﬁcial Intelligence
    (AI)

    tools has impacted the efﬁciency of a number of tasks associated with farming,
    suggesting

    that data-driven agriculture is a good approach to ensure agricultural sustainability.
    Cli-

    mate change is predicted to disproportionately impact smallholder farmers [19].
    Even a

    temperature variation of a few degrees will drastically affect smallholder farmers
    who are

    not adequately prepared for the situation. A substantial amount of crop losses
    occur due to

    weather events, which can be greatly mitigated through predictive weather modeling.
    This

    approach can help farmers navigate the agricultural risks that arise from the
    unprecedented

    deterioration of the environment, social and economic changes in the industry,
    and the

    increase in demand for food production. The availability of big data has the potential
    to

    revamp the entire food supply chain [20]. A global connectivity chain in farming
    will allow

    for the use of correctly priced products, better market positioning, and improved
    means of

    production. The use of ICT in farming will provide greater insight and advice
    on agricul-

    tural practices to farmers. The increase in visibility that comes with inter-connectivity
    of

    the supply chain is also likely to improve the productivity and conﬁdence of farmers
    in

    such practices.

    Agricultural tasks such as fertilizer and pesticide spraying, crop monitoring,
    seed

    planting, etc., can be automated through the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)

    and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) [21]. Robots can be trained to autonomously

    plant saplings and move heavy pots, thus complementing human effort in the agricultural

    industry and reducing the farmer’s workload [22]. Autonomous vehicles never tire
    and can

    work around the clock. They also provide better accuracy and speed to improve
    the size of

    yields. With computer vision, autonomous vehicles can identify if the crops are
    ripe, ready,

    and disease-free. Lightweight sensors can be deployed on aerial vehicles to collect
    detailed

    information about crops and soil parameters through hyper-spectral imaging [23].
    Sensors

    can also be used to map various parameters such as type of land, crop, vegetation
    index,

    chlorophyll index, and water index [24]. Drones can help to create a precision
    map of a ﬁeld

    so that each part can precisely receive the resources it needs [25]. IoT is a
    major enabling

    technology that allows communication between the various sensors installed on
    the farm.

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    426

    IoT makes use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), which can collect a large amount
    of

    data about the environment, crop production, cattle monitoring, and more [26].
    Information

    generated by IoT devices allows farmers to track farm operations and performance,
    and

    make informed decisions to improve farm productivity and yield. The massive amounts
    of

    data collected from the WSNs can be analyzed through technologies such as big
    data and

    deep learning. These technologies provide the added advantages of predictive modeling,

    real-time decision making, and adaptability to external factors. With the number
    of smart

    devices increasing steadily, the implementation of IoT in farms will increase
    interoperability,

    decrease losses due to human errors, and provide seamless uniﬁcation of information.

    Vertical farming, which is the practice of growing crops in a vertically stacked
    layer within

    a controlled environment for maximum growth, is one way to grow crops independently

    of local soil and climate conditions [27].

    The widespread implementation of smart farming tools faces several limitations

    and challenges depending on the geographical location of the project. One prominent

    barrier is the lack of internet connectivity, especially in rural areas. Such
    technology is not

    affordable for everyone. Without a stable internet connection agricultural sensors
    cannot

    communicate with each other. The initial cost of installation is high for any
    SF project,

    making it especially difﬁcult for smallholder farms to accept the risks. Further,
    the farmers

    implementing smart farming technologies may not fully understand the operation,
    ﬁnd the

    system too complex to use, or may be skeptical about its beneﬁts. Older farmers
    usually

    prefer traditional farming and are unwilling to learn to operate new technology
    [28]. The

    security and privacy of the data generated by sensors is also a concern, as there
    has to be

    an accountable party in case of mishandling or misuse [6]. This review paper highlights

    the current state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs that are applicable to the agricultural
    sector. The

    practical implementation of these technologies in particular projects across the
    world has

    also been covered, along with the limitations of the approaches and their potential
    to

    alleviate signiﬁcant concerns faced by farmers. Exploratory sentiment analysis
    has also

    been performed on comments collected from YouTube videos relevant to smart farming

    in order to determine public opinion regarding the implementation of these tools.
    This

    work aims to serve as a reference and motivation for further research in the adoption
    of

    technological tools in the agricultural industry.

    2. Motivation

    In this study, an in-depth exploration of recent advancements in the ﬁeld of smart

    farming is performed. It has always been a human endeavor to revolutionize agriculture

    by domesticating animals, planting crops in rotations, using pesticides and fertilizers,
    etc.

    The advent of ICTs has brought about the fourth agricultural revolution, or Agriculture

    4.0, which focuses on the use of limited resources on targeted areas. As discussed
    in

    the previous section, this is achievable with the help of sophisticated technologies
    such

    as unmanned vehicles, satellite imagery, sensors, and more. DTs such as AI have
    also

    greatly impacted the agricultural sector by improving efﬁciency, providing predictive

    analysis of yield, and mitigating production and market risks. Studies have shown
    several

    beneﬁts of using smart solutions in farming practices, such as reduction of necessary

    manpower, increase in yield, effective management of livestock, monitoring of
    crops and

    weather conditions, predictive analysis, and cost reduction. Several initiatives
    have been

    undertaken across the world that support the use of precision farming and smart
    farming

    while also providing insight on the speciﬁc limitations that were encountered.
    It is crucial

    that the ever-increasing global food demand is met, as the survival of the human
    race

    depends on it. Smart farming is capable of providing essential assistance to farmers
    to

    ensure sustainable food production. It can help farmers manage risks by providing
    speciﬁc

    weather forecasts, yield projections, likelihood of diseases, and more. It can
    thereby also

    increase proﬁts for the farmer, as the availability of data on risk assessment
    and external

    conditions can allow for optimal cultivation of crops. The motivation for conducting
    this

    study is to streamline the current state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs applicable to
    the farming

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    427

    sector, analyze components of various smart farming projects, discuss potential
    uses of

    such components, and list the common challenges that face the large-scale adoption
    of such

    techniques. The considerations for using smart farming in different geographical
    regions

    also needs to be discussed. The general attitude of people towards the adoption
    of any

    new technology is a great indicator of its perceived beneﬁts. To determine the
    consensus of

    the opinion on smart farming, we have performed a surface-level sentiment analysis
    on

    comments collected from YouTube channels relevant to smart farming. Thus, this
    work can

    serve as a point of reference for future research in the area of smart farming
    and can help

    researchers explore diverse technologies that are relevant to the topic.

    During this exploratory study, we formed the following two hypotheses, each with

    their respective research questions for further investigation:

    Hypothesis 1. ICTs and DTs can be used in the agricultural sector to make signiﬁcant
    improve-

    ments in several farming applications. The following research question was crafted
    to accept or

    reject the hypothesis:

    1.

    What are the state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs currently used in smart farming?

    Hypothesis 2. There are certain signiﬁcant challenges to the widespread adoption
    of smart farming

    tools, such as lack of awareness about the topic amongst the general population.
    The following

    research questions are explored in this context:

    1.

    What are the challenges associated with the widespread adoption of smart farming
    tools?

    2.

    What are the current opinions and expectations of the digital user with regards
    to smart

    farming?

    For this study, Google Scholar was used to perform exploratory analysis. Speciﬁc
    key-

    words, such as ‘plant disease detection’, ‘unmanned ground vehicles’, ‘precision
    livestock’,

    ‘big data’, etc., were selected. The searches were performed in the format [technology][smart

    farming]. For example, in order to search for articles that provided an overview
    of big-

    data applications in farming, the search phrase was ‘big data smart farming’.
    A total of

    30 keywords were grouped into six groups to analyze the number of citations for
    the top

    ﬁve results for each search. We attempted to exclude review papers that covered
    a few or

    all of the keywords. The number of citations for the top ﬁve results for each
    keyword is

    graphed in Figure 1 in six groups. The average number of citations for the top
    ﬁve results

    was calculated. The documents where the number of citations was greater than the
    average

    for that keyword were considered for the study.

    The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 3 covers the various
    ICTs and

    DTs, such as big data, IoT, cloud computing, AI, unmanned vehicles, blockchain,
    and

    decision support systems, that enable smart farming initiatives. Research efforts
    and

    projects that utilize such technologies in the agricultural sector are also discussed.
    Section 4

    covers state-of-the-art smart farming projects that have been launched and completed
    in the

    European Union and across the world. A brief overview of user sentiment towards
    smart

    farming technologies is conducted through comments collected from YouTube videos
    about

    smart farming in Section 5, in order to better encapsulate user perception towards
    such

    tools. Section 6 highlights the various challenges present in the widespread adoption
    of

    precision and smart agricultural practices. In Section 7, we discuss the ﬁndings
    of our study

    with respect to the two hypotheses formulated, followed by the conclusion in Section
    8.

    The structure of the paper is displayed in Figure 2.

    3. Technologies

    This section provides a thorough discussion of the key technologies that assist
    in the

    evolution of smart farming. These technologies include sensing systems, wireless
    sensor

    networks, IoT, unmanned vehicles, decision support systems, blockchain, and more.
    One

    or more of these tools has been used in collaboration for smart farming projects
    worldwide.

    The development of new sensors with improved sensitivity has allowed for the collection

    of higher-quality spatial and temporal data, which can be be analyzed for more
    timely and

    efﬁcient decision making. The advancements in remote sensing translate to reducing
    human

    time and effort, as less human intervention is required. Over the past few years,
    UAVs

    and UGVs have drastically improved in precision and have become more lightweight
    and

    cheaper, allowing for their easy adaption on large-scale farms. Wireless sensor
    networks

    can help the seamless functioning of sensors, autonomous vehicles, and decision-support

    systems to impact production at all stages. IoT platforms can allow control of
    daily farm

    activities through remote devices. Figure 3 classiﬁes the technologies implemented
    in smart

    farming, along with their most common applications. Table 1 provides a brief description

    of each technology along with some related works and applications.

    3.1. Sensors

    The implementation of ICTs and DTs in farming is dependent on the availability
    of

    wireless connectivity. Remote sensing is crucial for IoT devices to function.
    Sensors serve

    as the basic building block in a wireless sensor network (WSN), which then handles
    the

    seamless communication between IoT devices. The advancements in sensing technology

    translate to the use of additional wavelengths in the light spectrum to remotely
    monitor

    crops, manage weeds, capture imagery, and more. Satellites and UAVs are equipped
    with

    thermal, visual light (RBG), and near infrared (NIR) cameras to capture multi
    or hyper-

    spectral images of the crop ﬁeld [24]. Hyper-spectral imaging divides light into
    thousands

    of smaller bands, which captures a lot of detail. Lightweight, hyper-spectral
    cameras can

    be used to monitor crop health, water and nutrient levels, and symptoms of a disease
    over

    large areas, which can be difﬁcult to access by other means. The availability
    of detailed and

    precise data also allows for spot application of resources and better decision
    making.

    The choice of technology to be used in a project relies heavily on the available
    band-

    width, transmission distance, and energy requirements. Wireless technologies that
    have

    been utilized in smart farming operations over the years include Bluetooth Low
    Energy

    (BLE), ZigBee, WiFi, 3G/4G/5G, LoRa, and more. Cellular networks (3G/4G/5G) serve

    the purpose of aggregating data from various sensors in a smart farming environment.

    Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) provides coverage of 100 m and consumes less power
    than

    Bluetooth. It can be implemented in systems for livestock positioning [52], greenhouse

    monitoring [30], and more. BLE is not suitable for transferring large amounts
    of data [53].

    ZigBee is a WSN protocol that provides a smaller coverage area and low energy
    con-

    sumption. It can be used for scenarios such as solar power monitoring [54], greenhouse

    monitoring, etc. WiFi is beneﬁcial where high bandwidth and large amounts of data
    trans-

    fer is required. Cellular 3G/4G/5G networks offer wide coverage and low latency,
    but

    they drive up the cost and power consumption. LoRa can cover an area of 20 km
    and

    consumes less energy. Specialized sensors have been introduced for tasks such
    as pest

    identiﬁcation and control, plant health monitoring, resource level monitoring,
    etc. Bug

    detection and classiﬁcation can be performed using acoustic sensing devices and
    cameras,

    which capture factors such ﬂight behavior and humming sound [55]. Similarly, parasite

    detection was performed in study [56] using a spectral sensor that measures light
    waves.

    The difference in the reﬂected light pattern can be an indicator of infestation
    in the plant.

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    431

    López et al. [57] propose an autonomous monitoring system that uses a low-cost
    image

    sensor for visually inspecting bug traps deployed across the ﬁeld. Bioacoustic
    sensors

    have also been deployed to detect red palm weevil infestation in palm trees [58].
    Wireless

    sensors can be installed on leaves to monitor parameters such as humidity, water
    content,

    temperature, etc., to estimate the plant’s health and required amount of resources
    [59]. The

    growth rate of the plant stem and trunk can also be used to determine its health.
    Various

    sensors, such as the stem micro variation sensors, sap ﬂow relative rate sensors,
    stem ﬂux

    relative rate sensors, auxanometers, and trunk dendrometer, are used for this
    purpose [60].

    Environmental factors such as atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, wind speed,
    rainfall,

    temperature, and humidity can also be measured by wind speed and direction sensors,

    ambient seismic energy sensors, precipitation sensors, etc. [61]. Global navigation
    satellite

    systems (GNSS) can help increase efﬁciency in smart dairy farming. Smart collars
    can be

    worn by cows and can be used to collect data on the health and well-being of livestock
    [29].

    Farmers can program GPS collar trackers to keep cattle in a certain area. The
    cattle can then

    be sent to autonomous milking robots when their udders are full. The amount and
    quality

    of milk is then analyzed by the robots. Virtual fences can also prevent cattle
    from getting

    hurt on electric fencing and allow for rotational grazing [62].

    3.2. IoT Platforms

    IoT can enable devices and sensors to collect data about physical parameters of
    a

    farm. The functionalities provided by IoT, such as smart processing of data and
    real-time

    communication between devices, enable it to optimize agricultural practices [63].
    IoT

    blends the usage of physical devices such as actuators and sensors with a WSN
    to allow for

    seamless communication [26]. Sensors can serve as the peripheral devices that
    can gather

    information over a WSN which can then be analyzed with an IoT platform. There
    are

    currently several commercially available IoT platforms that aim to greatly reduce
    manual

    labor. They are utilized in various functions of crop monitoring. Zhang et al.
    [31] propose

    a monitoring system for wheat diseases, pests, and weed. The system collects data
    from

    IoT terminals and attempts real-time monitoring and management of crops. Lee et
    al. [64]

    implement a predictive system for effective pest control and proper utilization
    of pesticides

    and fungicides. Correlation is calculated between the pests and weather data relevant
    to

    the control of pests. Chieochan et al. [32] implement IoT sensors to monitor the
    humidity

    of a mushroom farm. The system controls sprinklers and fog pumps and provides
    push

    notiﬁcations to the user. Benaissa et al. [33] implement Wireless Body Area Networks

    (WBANs) in conjunction with IoT to monitor the health of dairy cows. Timely detection
    of

    health issues in the cattle is a costly and challenging task that was automated
    in the study

    through the use of a Long-Range (LoRa) off-body wireless channel and IoT. Garcia
    et al. [65]

    implement WSNs to monitor the presence of pests such as snails. The system is
    also capable

    of predictive analysis based on environmental factors such as temperature and
    humidity.

    Giri et al. [34] introduce an automation framework called AgriTech for adequate
    uti-

    lization of water, fertilizer, and pesticides. AgriTech allows the farmer to monitor
    the ﬁeld

    and perform actions such as spraying through the use of a mobile device. Kodali
    et al. [66]

    present the model of an IoT-based smart greenhouse that automatically carries
    out irri-

    gation, temperature and air humidity control, and water management with the help
    of

    sensors. In the study done by Na et al. [35], an IoT-based remote monitoring system
    is

    implemented to monitor soil characteristics such as pH, temperature, and moisture
    content

    using a DS18B20 sensor. Accurate measurement of such parameters can enable better

    analysis and decisions regarding fertilizer usage and crops sown. Kamilaris et
    al. [36]

    introduce Agri-IoT, a framework for analyzing real-time data streams from heterogeneous

    sensors that also supports decision making. It supports integration for data streams
    from

    multiple domains, data analytics, and interoperability for smart farming applications.

    Akkas et al. [37] implement a prototype of a wireless sensor network made up of
    MicaZ

    motes that monitor environmental variables such as temperature, light, pressure,
    and

    humidity in a greenhouse. The study highlights the advantages of implementing
    a WSN

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    432

    over traditional cabling within an IoT platform, such as costs, vulnerability,
    and inability to

    relocate the wiring system. Nayyar and Puri [67] propose the use of an IoT-based
    agricul-

    tural stick integrated with Arduino technology and Solar technology to capture
    live data

    on physical factors such as temperature and soil moisture. The system provided
    accuracy

    of 98% in live feeds when tested on live agricultural ﬁelds.

    3.3. Decision Support Systems (DSS)

    Decision support systems (DSSs) add value to the smooth functioning of farming

    practices by providing support to farmers, guiding them to correct information,
    assist-

    ing in decision making, and laying out the best course of action for a given scenario.

    The farm-wide availability of production rules and expertise can drastically improve
    efﬁ-

    ciency. Canadas et al. [38] propose a real-time decision support system implemented
    for

    greenhouse tomatoes that facilitates better decision making by identifying sensor
    faults,

    maintaining climate variables, and performing disease identiﬁcation on crops.
    The study

    highlights the effectiveness of the DSS in climate control and minimizing crop
    wastage

    due to diseases. Taylor et al. [68] perform a case study on web of things that
    highlights

    other useful applications of support systems such as environmental and livestock
    moni-

    toring. Dos Santons et al. [39] present AgriPrediction, an IoT-based support system
    that

    utilizes LoRa wireless network range system and the ARIMA predictive model to
    better

    manage crop dysfunctions. The system presents promising results, and is also shown
    to

    be applicable in rural areas with sparse connectivity. Kukar et al. [40] present
    AgroDSS,

    a novel cloud-based decision support system that allows farmers to perform predictive

    analysis on their own farm data. The system was implemented to study pest population

    and provide a better understanding of interdependencies of various parameters
    in a sim-

    ulated environment. The study done by Antonopoulou et al. [41] provides an approach

    for continued sustainability by allowing farmers to select alternate crops for
    a region. The

    system can be accessed through mobile devices to increase adoptability amongst
    farmers,

    and supports the farmer throughout the cultivation process. Thakare et al. [69]
    provide

    a DSS for remote monitoring that integrates smart sensing and smart irrigation
    systems

    to monitor parameters such as temperature, moisture content, and efﬁcient water
    use.

    The study emphasizes the importance of smart farming with hydroponics, which allows

    farming in unsuitable soil and water conditions.

    3.4. Unmanned Vehicles

    The advancement in robotics has led to the development of autonomous vehicles,

    which are used extensively in farming for mechanical weeding, fertilizer spraying,
    and

    harvesting. Unmanned vehicles have shown to decrease human labor, improve productiv-

    ity, reduce costs, and increase accuracy of measurements. They could be further
    classiﬁed

    into UAVs and UGVs. UAVs are aircraft embedded with wireless sensors, transmitters,

    and/or cameras that can function autonomously or be controlled remotely. UGVs,
    on

    the other hand, are autonomous machines that operate while in contact with the
    ground.

    The use of lightweight cameras with autonomous aerial vehicles can allow for remote

    monitoring of crops, which can allow for better decision making. Bareth et al.
    [70] per-

    formed a study to examine the usability of UAV-based multi-temporal crop surface
    models

    for estimating plant height, estimating the biomass through height measurement,
    and

    combining vegetation indices for more accurate estimation. The results obtained
    from

    ﬁeld experiments imply that UAV-based RGB imaging can provide accurate modeling
    of

    physical parameters of the plant. The review study done by Roldan et al. [71]
    highlights

    the advancement of robots in smart farming for automation of labor-intensive tasks
    such as

    planting, harvesting, monitoring, inspection, and treating crops. Unmanned vehicles
    are

    able to collect information about the environment and navigate it by using machine
    vision

    systems. They implement Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technologies
    [72] to

    navigate precisely. UAVs provide an added advantage for remote sensing in the
    form of

    timely control and high spatial ground resolution. Remote imaging can capture
    several

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    433

    characteristics through different types of cameras, such as multispectral, thermal,
    and high

    spatial resolution RGB camera, as demonstrated in the study done by Matese et
    al. [73] to

    measure intra-vineyard variability and leaf temperature and to perform analysis
    of missing

    plants. UAVs possess the potential to obtain high spatial resolution imagery without
    being

    too affected by weather conditions.

    Lu et al. [74] perform species classiﬁcation in tall grassland with the use of
    high spatial

    resolution imagery obtained from a UAV, and show that the method obtains higher
    accuracy

    than other data from satellites. Tripicchio et al. [75] present a novel implementation
    of an

    RGB-D sensor integrated with UAVs to differentiate between different plowing techniques

    used on a ﬁeld. The system provides the functionality of computer vision, navigation,

    and data analysis and was shown to be a feasible technique for determination of
    soil

    characteristics. Moribe et al. [76] provide an effective and synchronized technique
    for

    measuring leaf temperature. Infrared thermometers attached to drones and sensor
    nodes

    integrate seamlessly with the WSN. Lottes et al. [77] propose a system that utilizes
    a UAV

    to detect vegetation, such as sugar beets, and performs feature extraction and
    maps the

    distribution of weeds and crops. UAVs provide an autonomous solution for monitoring

    large areas of agricultural land covering crops, livestock, and more. Unmanned
    vehicles

    function through the use of technologies such as robotics, IoT, remote sensing,
    and big

    data, and can automate labor-intensive tasks such as spraying, data collection,
    water

    management, weed mapping, irrigation, fertilization, crop monitoring and management,

    and ﬁeld-level phenotyping.

    3.5. Cloud/Edge Computing

    Given the vast amount of incoming data from various sources, a centralized approach

    to storing and managing large amounts of data is essential. A cloud-based architecture

    can allow for the necessary computation power to analyze the plethora of data
    obtained

    from the different types of sensors installed on a farm. Cloud computing facilitates
    ﬂexible

    storage and availability of data and resources, making them suitable for real-time
    implemen-

    tation. Rupanagudi et al. [42] propose a novel solution to pest control in tomatoes
    by crop

    monitoring using video processing, cloud computing, and robotics. Zhou et al.
    [43] present

    a cloud-computing-enabled spatio–temporal cyber–physical infrastructure (CESCI)
    to per-

    form comprehensive surface soil moisture monitoring, which can help reduce costs,
    increase

    agricultural productivity, and boost farmers’ net income. FIWARE is an open-sourced
    cloud

    platform that has shown potential in many smart farming applications. Kaloxylos
    et al. [44]

    present a cloud-based farm management system that utilizes the FIWARE architecture
    and

    was shown to be acceptable by farmers during evaluation. Corista et al. [45] introduce

    an IoT-based smart farming system built upon FIWARE that aims to control fruit
    quality

    during the entire fruit production chain. The system is developed using the vf-OS
    (virtual

    factory Operating System) platform, which integrates various applications and
    allows

    external producers and consumers to interact.

    Another IoT platform based on cloud and edge computing is proposed by

    Zamora et al. [46] and works in three tiers: the local plane collects data on
    crops, the

    edge plane monitors and manages the main precision agriculture (PA) tasks, and
    the cloud

    platform maintains records and performs data analytics. Fog computing, also called
    edge

    computing, is a decentralized computing architecture between the cloud and connected
    pe-

    ripheral devices and aims to enhance speed and performance [78]. Edge computing
    systems

    provide a decentralized approach to automation of tasks by using pre-loaded ﬁeld
    data

    from edge locations [79]. Thus, fog computing is a promising architecture for
    smart farming

    solutions, since it provides low latency and increased reliability for support
    systems [80].

    In case of real-time operational decision making, time is of the essence. Malik
    et al. [47]

    introduce a simulation platform that leverages fog computing to allow users to
    under-

    stand sensor deployment and data collection in a complete farming ecosystem. Thus,

    a cloud platform is essential if real-time analysis is to be performed. Use of
    additional

    data-driven approaches can be invaluable depending on the application. Cloud computing

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    434

    architecture can be used to manipulate large amounts of heterogeneous data arising
    from

    several sources. It can provide the necessary storage and computation resources,
    making it

    complementary to big data tools.

    3.6. Blockchain

    Blockchain technology provides new modes of interaction between parties in a supply

    chain. It is a distributed, immutable ledger that keeps a record of all transactions
    of digital

    assets over a network. It also has the capacity to improve food safety by providing
    traceabil-

    ity for purchased food products and monitoring for contamination. In order to
    avoid bias in

    the data collected from ICT and DT devices, it is important that data manipulation
    is made

    difﬁcult or impossible. The addition of a new record in a blockchain requires
    veriﬁcation

    from a peer-to-peer network, ensuring its legitimacy. Similarly, the majority
    should agree

    while making changes to records, making it difﬁcult for unauthorized individuals
    to alter

    the data. Thus, blockchain-based technologies for smart farming ensure that the
    data is

    correct, transparent, and traceable. In conjunction with smart contracts, which
    are protocols

    that are activated without human intervention when the terms of an agreement are
    met,

    blockchain technology can ensure timely payments [81]. Vangala et al. [48] propose
    an

    authenticated key agreement mechanism for smart farming that is based on smart
    contracts.

    The system is shown to provide more security and functionality than other authentication

    protocols. Patil et al. [50] present a security framework that combines blockchain
    technol-

    ogy with IoT devices and allows sharing of a digital ledger of transactions among
    the nodes

    on an IoT network. Lin et al. [51] introduce an ecological food traceability system
    that

    incorporates blockchain technology and IoT and aims to improve food safety while
    also

    establishing trust between the parties involved. The use of smart contracts is
    also consid-

    ered for the timely management of problems in the system. An ICT and DT e-agricultural

    system with blockchain technology that distributes water quality data over a network

    is proposed by Lin et al. [49]. They also present an evaluation tool that can
    be used to

    determine the speciﬁc requirements and suitability of this technology. A simulated
    model

    of blockchain technology is proposed by Widi Widayat et al. [82] and can be implemented

    in a smart farming environment. The parties in a smart farming system, namely
    farmers,

    food suppliers, and customers, are connected to a global blockchain network and
    appear

    as a node account in the smart contract. Another potential application of blockchain
    tech-

    nology is for providing agricultural insurance. Nguyen et al. [83] present a smart
    contract

    developed on NEO to provide drought-based crop insurance. This could be invaluable

    to farmers who work in extreme weather conditions, as it can reduce their damages
    and

    vulnerability while also avoiding excess evaluation costs.

    3.7. Big Data and Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    IoT devices and sensors capture various types of data from all over the ﬁeld that
    can

    then be analyzed through big data tools. Big data refers to larger and more complex
    datasets

    that consist of a greater variety of data from multiple data sources and can also
    be mined

    for opinions and information [84]. Data modeling techniques such as machine learning
    and

    deep learning can help enhance the entire food production cycle by performing
    predictive

    analysis, providing real-time decision making, and reﬁning the business model
    of the farm

    to cut loses. AI is a research sub-ﬁeld of computer science that utilizes robust
    datasets to

    solve problems by performing classiﬁcation or predictions based on the input data
    [85].

    Machine learning is a sub-ﬁeld of AI that allows models to learn from experience
    without

    being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a sub-ﬁeld of machine learning that
    further

    eliminates some of the human intervention required in training by automating feature

    extraction from larger datasets [86]. Currently, there are also several types
    of state-of-the-

    art conversational systems being used to assist farmers in agricultural operations
    [87].

    Table 2 summarizes some notable research works in smart farming that have performed

    image processing using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are a class
    of

    Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs) that are used to perform classiﬁcation tasks
    on images

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    435

    by adjusting learnable weights and biases [88]. Table 3 provides a summary of
    various

    studies that have utilized other AI models in smart farming, along with their
    respective

    outcomes.

    AI can help reduce resource wastage through monitoring and predictive modeling.

    Varghese and Sharma [89] propose a hardware-based system that helps monitor factors

    such as moisture content in soil, humidity, and atmospheric conditions. The system
    also

    determines the appropriate crops for given soil and environmental conditions through
    the

    use of IoT and machine learning. Arvindan et al. [90] introduce an automated irrigation

    system that measures moisture content in the soil and provides remote control
    through

    an Android smart phone. This can help with the sustainable and automatic farming
    of

    certain crops that require different degrees of irrigation depending on their
    growth stage.

    Khaki et al. [91] introduce WheatNet, which is a CNN that collects ﬁeld observational
    data,

    such as wheat head counts. The system achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and
    Root

    Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 3.85 and 5.19, respectively, in the wheat head counting
    task

    with fewer parameters, implying that the approach is robust and crucial for observation
    and

    decision making. Deep learning algorithms are used extensively to reduce crop
    wastage

    and optimize crop yield. The development of systems for accurate prediction of
    crop yield

    is essential, especially in developing countries, as it can secure food availability,
    prevent

    famine, and provide further assistance to the sustainable development of agriculture.
    Crop

    yield can depend on several factors, such as genotype, environment, etc. Wang
    et al. [12]

    present a deep-learning-based system for predicting soybean crop yields based
    on data

    collected from remote sensing. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells were trained
    and

    tested on 4 years of Argentinian soybean harvest data. The model’s transferability
    was

    then tested by using soybean harvest results from Brazil. Khaki et al. [13] implemented

    Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for yield prediction of maize. The dataset consisted
    of

    the genotype and yield performance of 2267 maize hybrids. The best-performing
    model

    provided an RMSE of 12% of the average yield and 50% of the standard deviation
    for the

    validation dataset in imperfect weather conditions.

    Alfred et al. [92] provide a survey of the implementation of big data and machine
    learn-

    ing on paddy rice production in the Asia–Pacific region. The integration of sensors,
    satellites,

    and drones complements machine learning tools in improving productivity. Machine
    learn-

    ing tools utilize the big data collected from these devices for estimating rice
    yield [93,94],

    monitoring growth [94], and providing a smart irrigation system [95]. Kiruthika
    et al. [96]

    propose a system to detect paddy rice crop diseases such as leaf blast disease,
    brown spot

    disease, and bacterial blight disease. A Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)
    is used to

    recognize disease from the input image; two classifiers are used for recognition:
    ANN and

    Support Vector Machine (SVM). ANN performs better than SVM, with a precision of
    90.60%

    and accuracy of an 93.33%. Dahane et al. [97] propose a novel EDGE–fog–IoT–cloud-based

    architecture that utilizes WSNs to support farming activities in three steps:
    data collection

    from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, water level, etc.), data cleaning
    and

    storage, and predictive analysis through AI tools. Performance of Gated Recurrent
    Unit

    (GRU) and LSTMs on live data from three parameters is compared, with varying results.

    Jhuria et al. [9] propose a tool that utilizes ANNs to identify diseases in grapes
    and apples.

    Image processing is performed on an image dataset, and an accuracy of 90% is obtained
    based

    on color and texture. The study also provides a tool to determine the quality
    of fruit by

    weight. Bhange et al. [98] present a web-based tool for identification of fruit
    diseases trained

    on images of pomegranate fruit. The system processes an image uploaded by the
    user for

    parameters such as color and morphology, and classifies it as infected or non-infected
    using

    SVMs. Accuracy of 82% was recorded using the ‘morphology’ parameter in the experiment.

    Guo et al. [10] propose a system for identification of plant diseases through
    the use of deep

    learning. The model identifies black rot, bacterial plaque and rust diseases by
    implementing

    a Region Proposal Network (RPN) for leaf localization, the Chan–Vese algorithm
    for leaf

    segmentation, and VGG-13 [99] architecture for disease identification. This method
    provides

    an accuracy of 83.57%. In the study by Ferentinos [100], image classification
    through a VGG

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    436

    CNN is performed on a database of 87,848 photographs of leaves of healthy and
    infected

    plants in a set of 58 distinct classes of [plant, disease] combinations, and a
    success rate of

    99.53% is achieved. Similarly, smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis is performed
    by

    Mohanty et al. [101] on the PlantVillage dataset consisting of 54,306 images of
    plant leaves.

    The GoogleNet architecture performed the best out of all models tested, resulting
    in an

    accuracy of 99.35% on 14 crop species and 26 diseases. The prevention of fruit
    tree diseases

    can also significantly impact overall agricultural production. Li et al. [102]
    conducted a study

    comparing the performance of three ensemble learning classifiers and two deep
    learning

    classifiers. The stacking ensemble learning classifier provides the highest validation
    accuracy

    of 98.05% and test accuracy of 97.34% on a dataset of 10,000 images of pear black
    spot, pear

    rust, apple mosaic, and apple rust. Figure 4 displays a generalized example of
    plant disease

    identification through the use of CNNs. The network takes input in the form of
    segmented

    images and classifies them as ‘Diseased’ and ‘Not Diseased’.

    Figure 4. Disease identiﬁcation through image processing.

    Due to the rapid increase in global meat consumption, technologies such as precision

    livestock farming [103] have become essential to ensure the quality of meat products
    and

    reduction of the environmental impact. AI tools can also prove beneﬁcial in livestock

    management by monitoring cattle health and behavior. Xu et al. [104] propose a
    system for

    individual identiﬁcation of cattle through face detection, performed using the
    RetinaNet

    object detection algorithm. Fine-tuning was performed on seven different CNN models,

    and transfer learning was used for this study. RetinaNet incorporating the ResNet
    50

    provided the highest average accuracy of 99.8% and an average processing time
    of 0.0438 s.

    Gjergji et al. [105] evaluated the following neural networks for the regression
    task of cattle

    weight prediction: CNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)/CNN networks, recurrent

    attention models, and recurrent attention models with CNNs. CNNs were shown to

    provide the best performance with MAE of 23.19 kg, signiﬁcantly outperforming
    the top

    linear regression models, which reached an error of 38.46 kg. Jung et al. [106]
    present a

    deep learning-based system for classiﬁcation of cattle vocals and real-time monitoring
    of

    livestock. The voice parameter of cattle can signal valuable information such
    as gender

    of cattle, distress, and disorders in the cattle [107]. The voice was converted
    to Mel-

    frequency cepstral coefﬁcients (MFCCs) and given as input to a CNN for classiﬁcation

    with an accuracy of 91.36%. The accuracy increased to 94.18% when short-time Fourier

    transform-based noise ﬁltering was used to reduce background noise. In the context
    of

    smart farming practices, deep learning has also been shown to be widely beneﬁcial
    in

    the ﬁeld of aquaculture. Fish production contributes to a great portion of the
    food source

    in any area. Zhang et al. [108] propose the use of DNNs for ﬁsh identiﬁcation,
    species

    classiﬁcation, analysis of ﬁsh behavior, feeding decisions, and water quality
    prediction. The

    method provided an accuracy of 96% and recognition rate of 98% when trained on
    the Fish 4

    knowledge dataset, which contains 8487 images of ﬁsh with different conditions.
    The study

    done by Rohani et al. [109] proposes a model consisting of multi-layer perceptron
    (MLP)

    and SVM for classiﬁcation of rainbow trout as dead or alive. Both classiﬁers provided

    an average accuracy of 100% during the training phase and average of 99.45% during

    the testing phase. Zambrano et al. [110] propose the use of machine learning tools
    to

    forecast water quality variables such as dissolved oxygen, pH, and pond temperature.
    A

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    437

    comparison is performed between Random Forests (RF), ANNs, and multivariate linear

    regression, out of which RFs performed the best.

    CNNs can also be used to perform object detection and pattern recognition on images

    collected by aerial vehicles to detect anomalies such as weed clusters, standing
    water, etc.

    Chiu et al. [111] introduce ‘Agriculture-Vision’, a large-scale dataset of aerial
    farmland

    images, designed for semantic segmentation of agricultural pattern recognition.
    The dataset

    consists of 94,986 high-quality aerial images consisting of RGB and near-infrared
    (NIR)

    channels. The study proposed a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)-based model with
    a

    ResNet encoder to classify 9 ﬁeld anomaly patterns. The mean intersection-over-union

    (mIoU) was 43.40% for the validation set and 43.66% for the test set. The ﬁrst
    Agriculture-

    Vision Challenge [112] encouraged further development of novel algorithms for
    pattern

    recognition in agriculture. The challenge dataset consists of 21,061 aerial and
    multi-spectral

    farmland images, and six anomaly patterns were to be recognized in the task. The
    best-

    performing model, Residual DenseNet with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, introduced

    by Team DSCC, achieved a modiﬁed mIoU of 63.9%. The study by Kussul et al. [113]

    performs classiﬁcation of crops using MLPs, RFs, and CNNs. The dataset consisted
    of

    19 multitemporal scenes acquired by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1A RS satellites, and
    the

    highest classiﬁcation accuracy of 94.6% was achieved by 2-D CNNs. Another crop
    vision

    dataset for species classiﬁcation and detection is the CropDeep [114] dataset,
    which consists

    of 31,147 images and at least 1500 samples for each of the 30 classes. A baseline
    study

    showed the best performing model was ResNet50, with an accuracy of 99.81%. The
    study

    further suggests the YOLOv3 network with modiﬁcation to achieve higher accuracy
    on

    the dataset. Anand et al. [115] present ‘AgriSegNet’, which is a multi-scale hierarchical

    attention network for semantic segmentation using UAV-acquired aerial images for
    IoT-

    assisted precision agriculture. The mIoU on the test set of the Agriculture-Vision
    dataset

    for the six anomaly classes are: Background: 78.10%; Double Plant: 46.40%; Planter
    Skip:

    8.60%; Standing Water: 61.20%; Waterway: 44.90%; Weed Cluster: 50.20%.

    In this subsection, we emphasize several points regarding the opportunities provided

    by AI in the ﬁeld of smart farming. Image processing is of great importance to
    the agricul-

    tural sector. Images captured by UAVs, UGVs, satellites, and sensors need to be
    analyzed so

    that relevant insight can be extracted from them to assist in farm operations.
    Depending on

    the requirements, different types of cameras, such as visible spectrum, NIR, hyperspectral,

    or multispectral may be used. In conjunction with several ICTs, AI can efﬁciently
    perform

    functions such as crop monitoring, livestock monitoring, disease detection, pest
    detection,

    etc. Predictive modeling can help farmers to prepare for extreme weather conditions
    and

    market ﬂuctuations, thereby lowering their vulnerability. Current state-of-the-art
    models

    have provided promising results, implying that further research in the area with
    more

    advanced AI tools can help to bridge the gap in food production.

    4. Initiatives Worldwide

    This section includes the various research initiatives that have been undertaken
    in

    smart farming in the European Union [119] and across the world. The initiatives
    usually

    employ several of the ICTs and DTs discussed in Section 3. The European Union
    has

    funded many projects to allow for the integration of ICTs and DTs into the agricultural

    sector. Crop monitoring is one of the major functions performed in farms that
    utilize

    smart farming tools. Table 4 provides an overview of the recent projects concerning
    the

    implementation of SF tools for crop monitoring that have been undertaken in the
    European

    Union. Table 5 lists the projects that perform other functions such as harvesting,
    water

    management, satellite imagery, and more. The corresponding technologies for each
    project

    have also been listed along with their application. The Echord++ [120] project,
    which

    lasted from 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2018, involved various ﬁeld operations
    such as

    monitoring, harvesting, and grafting for crops such as tomatoes, asparagus, and
    peppers.

    Cloud computing is utilized by many projects that require monitoring operations.
    These

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    439

    include Vinbot [121] (crop monitoring and yield prediction in a vineyard), Ermes
    [122] (crop

    monitoring for rice), Fractals [123] (monitoring, disease detection, and fertilization
    of olive

    trees), and more. The importance of UAVs and UGVs is apparent, as they have been
    utilized

    in several projects. Implementations of UGVs include Vinerobot [124] for a vineyard,

    Sweeper [125] for harvesting peppers, Flourish [126] for monitoring and spraying
    sugar

    beets and sunﬂowers, PANtHEOn [127] for monitoring hazelnuts and water management,

    and Romi [128] for crop monitoring and weed management. UAVs are utilized for
    crop

    monitoring of rice in Ermes [122], potatoes and vineyard in Mistrale [129], and
    more.

    Seamless communication between different technologies has been executed through
    the use

    of WSNs, such as Water-Bee [130] and Figaro [131], for the purpose of water management.

    There have been several research projects on smart farming taken up all over the

    world, in part inspired by the positive outcomes of the EU projects. Table 6 provides
    a

    summary of government projects and start-ups that focus on the development of
    innovative

    solutions for smart farming. Some projects, such as the Villages of Excellence
    (VoE),

    have been launched in collaboration between two governments to ensure the sharing
    of

    technology and expertise and provide better outcomes for both. Smart irrigation
    plays

    an important role in ensuring crop sustainability in dry areas. Startups such
    as Madar

    Farms [141] and Responsive drip irrigation [142] aim to provide smart irrigation
    solutions

    to tackle water challenges and food security in the United Arab Emirates and the
    United

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    440

    States respectively. SunCulture [143] is a Kenyan AgriTech company that provides
    solar-

    powered irrigation systems for smallholder farms, and also provides the option
    of a drip

    irrigation system. In Morocco, the government introduced the Green Generation
    2020–2030

    strategy [144], which focuses on the digitization of agriculture through initiatives
    such as

    the installation of solar pumps for irrigation. Food security and sustainability
    are of great

    concern worldwide. Startups such as AbyFarm [145] in Singapore aim to implement
    urban

    farming by employing ICT and DT tools such as IoT and blockchain. Lack of resources

    in rural areas could be a hindering factor in crop yield. Ossian Agro Automation
    [146] is

    an Indian company working towards rural automation and the development of wireless

    automation systems. All year round production of crops can be achieved by vertical

    farming, which is the practice of growing crops in many layers in a controlled
    environment.

    Ground vertical farming [147] in Lebanon implements vertical farming and aims
    to reduce

    water wastage by re-circulation. Figure 5 displays the various smart farming projects
    taken

    up across the world, classiﬁed according to their primary function.

    Figure 5. Smart Farming initiatives worldwide

    In several developing countries, there is a lack of government-funded projects.
    The

    initiative is rather taken up by individual startups, with the goal to provide
    assistance to

    farmers, conduct further research, and educate farmers and learners about the
    potential

    of agricultural technology. There is an increased interest amongst consumers,
    who want

    to ensure that the end product they receive is unadulterated. Public opinion in
    Europe

    skews in favor of healthy products grown with minimum pesticides. Consideration
    of the

    socio–economic impact of smart farming projects is also necessary. Certain participating

    farms have reported average cost savings of over €5000 and reduction of climate
    impact by

    10% [148]. Thus, these initiatives have been greatly beneﬁcial to farming operations
    by de-

    creasing costs, reducing greenhouse emissions, and improving soil conditions.
    The projects

    contributed signiﬁcantly to their objectives of reducing resource wastage, environmental

    impact, and energy consumption, and demonstrated measures to mitigate issues resulting

    from climate change and the shortage of skilled labor.

    5. Sentiment Analysis

    In order to ensure successful integration of new tools and technologies available
    for

    smart farming, it is necessary to understand how knowledgeable the general public
    is

    about the topics and how the innovations are perceived. Public sentiment can be
    a strong

    determinant of whether or not a project is approved for implementation in an area
    [166].

    It can also be indicative of the various socio–economic, behavioral, and cultural
    issues

    that arise by the advancement and implementation of such technology [28,167].
    In light of

    this, we performed sentiment analysis on the comments of YouTube videos pertaining
    to

    smart farming technologies. This section provides details about the dataset, experimental

    methodology, and the results and analysis of the experiment.

    5.1. Dataset

    The dataset was constructed by scraping YouTube comments left by users on 16 YouTube

    videos that were relevant to our study [168–172]. The videos were selected by
    searching

    the relevant keywords, such as ‘smart farming IoT’, and then ﬁltering the ones
    with most

    views and comments. Table 7 provides a list of the video titles, the channels,
    upload date,

    and the total number of likes and views on each video. For this study, only comments

    in English were considered. A total of 7311 comments were included in the dataset
    from

    videos about smart farming.

    5.2. Experiment

    Two approaches were used for performing sentiment analysis. In the first approach,
    two

    annotators assigned one of the following six labels to the comments: ‘Praising’,
    ‘Queries’,

    ‘Suggestions’, ‘Undefined’, ‘Hybrid’, and ‘Opinion’. Cohen’s kappa coefficient,
    which is a

    measure of inter-rater agreement, was calculated on the ratings of the two annotators.
    The

    value of the kappa statistic ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 implying only a chance
    agreement and 1

    implying perfect agreement between the two annotators. The formula to calculate
    Cohen’s

    kappa for two raters is:

    κ = po − pe

    1 − pe

    = 1 − 1 − po

    1 − pe

    (1)

    where: po = the relative observed agreement among raters, and pe = the hypothetical

    probability of chance agreement.

    A brief description of these labels is given in Table 8, along with the total
    number of

    comments for each label, and an example of the label from the dataset. Table 9
    gives the total

    counts of each of the six labels that were assigned to the comments collected

    The second approach was to apply transfer learning to perform surface level sentiment

    analysis using the pre-trained Pattern library for Python. Pattern library can
    be used to

    perform various natural language processing tasks such as parsing, N-gram generation,

    and more. Polarity of a given text ranges from 1 to −1, with 1 representing a
    highly positive

    sentiment and −1 representing a highly negative sentiment. The subjectivity ranges
    from

    0 (Objective) to 1 (Subjective). It provides a measure of factual information
    or personal

    opinion in the comments, with 1 being subjective and 0 being objective. For example,
    for

    the following comment in our dataset: ’Fantastic. We need a lot of that here in
    Australia;

    suffering from drought; really bad water management by those in authority etc.’
    , the

    polarity was calculated as −0.1499 and subjectivity was 0.7833. The negative value
    of

    polarity indicates that the sentiment expressed by the comment was negative, whereas
    the

    value of subjectivity is closer to 1 suggesting that the comment was mostly subjective.

    5.3. Results and Analysis

    In this section, we detail the results of our experiment and analyze our ﬁndings.

    Evaluation has been conducted separately for the two approaches through user-based

    analysis and transfer-learning-based analysis. Table 10 records the number of
    comments

    under a video and the results obtained from sentiment analysis. The value of mean
    polarity,

    mean subjectivity, and Cohen’s kappa coefﬁcient is listed for each corresponding
    video

    serial number.

    5.3.1. User-Based Analysis

    In user-based analysis, the mean Cohen’s kappa was calculated to be 0.9617, which

    shows high inter-rater reliability. Figure 6 displays the Cohen’s kappa coefﬁcient
    for each

    video with respect to the mean value. The value is highest at 1 for videos no.
    5, 9, and 12,

    indicating perfect agreement between the labels assigned by both annotators. The
    value

    is lowest at 0.8141 for video no. 2 titled ‘Europe has the best regenerative farmers
    in the

    world’, implying a slight disagreement between the assigned labels. The high value
    of

    kappa coefﬁcient implies that the categories assigned by the annotators are correct.

    Figure 7 plots the correlation matrix between the frequency of the six labels.
    We can

    see the highest degree of correlation is 0.96 between the following labels: ‘Opinion’
    and

    ‘Suggestion’, and ‘Queries’ and ‘Hybrid’, indicating that the frequency of one
    increases

    with the other. The lowest degree of correlation is 0.81 between ‘Hybrid’ and
    ‘Undeﬁned’,

    suggesting that all labels show a relatively positive correlation amongst each
    other.

    A word cloud is a data visualization technique used for representing text data
    where

    the frequency or importance of each word is indicated by its size. It can help
    us highlight

    and analyze signiﬁcant textual data points. Pre-processing of the comments was
    performed

    to remove stop words and punctuation from the text. Figure 8 displays the word
    clouds

    for the comments collected from videos of serial number 1–8. We can see that on
    the word

    cloud in Figure 8a, which is for the video titled ‘How Japan Is Reshaping Its
    Agriculture By

    Harnessing Smart- Farming Technology’, ‘Japan’ is one of the most frequent and
    important

    words in the text. Similarly, for Figure 8g for video no. 7 on the bottom left
    titled ‘7 Israeli

    Agriculture Technologies’, the most signiﬁcant word is ‘Israel’. Figure 9 displays
    the word

    clouds for the comments collected from videos of serial number 9–16. The word
    9b on the

    top left for the video titled ‘Singapore’s Bold Plan to Build the Farms of the
    Future’ has

    ‘Singapore’ as the most prominent word. This indicates that several comments for
    these

    videos included some text about the country in which the technology was implemented.
    For

    videos demonstrating a particular technology, such as No. 7: ‘Solar Panels Plus
    Farming?

    Agrivoltaics Explained’; No. 8: ‘The CNH Industrial Autonomous Tractor Concept
    (Full

    Version)’; and No. 14: ‘RIPPA The Farm Robot Exterminates Pests And Weeds’, the
    name of

    the technology (solar, tractor, robot, respectively) is of great prominence. Table
    11 provides

    a list of the top ﬁve most-relevant words in the comments dataset for each video,
    along

    with their respective frequencies.

    5.3.2. Transfer-Learning-Based Analysis

    The results of sentiment analysis using the Pattern library are discussed in this
    sub-

    section. Mean polarity and mean subjectivity are plotted opposite each other in
    Figure 10.

    The overall polarity for all 7311 comments is 0.2092, suggesting that the overall
    sentiment

    is slightly positive. The overall subjectivity of all comments is 0.4352, implying
    that the

    comments were close to being neutral. Subjective statements generally contain
    personal

    opinion, emotion, or judgment, whereas objective comments are factual information.
    Po-

    larity determines the degree of positive or negative sentiment in the text. The
    highest

    mean subjectivity score was 0.5480 for video no. 13 titled ‘Simply Fresh—India’s
    Largest

    State Of The Art Precision Farm’, followed by 0.5369 for video no. 11 titled ‘Smart
    Vertical

    Farms in Sharjah’. This shows that the comments were of a more opinionated nature,
    rather

    than being factual. The lowest mean subjectivity score was 0.2915 for video no.
    9 titled

    ‘IOT Smart Plant Monitoring System’, indicating that mostly facts were discussed
    in the

    comments for this video. The score suggesting higher objectivity could be because
    the video

    is discussing technical details about an IoT platform rather than explaining widespread

    innovative concepts such as precision farms and vertical farms. The comments collected

    from video no. 8 titled ‘The CNH Industrial Autonomous Tractor Concept (Full Version)’

    resulted in the lowest mean polarity of 0.0919, indicating that the user sentiment
    was

    generally neutral. The highest mean polarity of 0.4460 was achieved for video
    no. 13 titled

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    447

    ‘Simply Fresh—India’s Largest State Of The Art Precision Farm’, showing that user
    attitude

    was generally positive towards the state-of-the-art precision farm highlighted
    in the video.

    Figure 8. Word clouds for videos serial no. 1–8 corresponding (a–h) respectively.

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    448

    Figure 9. Word clouds for videos no. 9–16 corresponding (a–h) respectively.

    In the investigation of user sentiment towards smart farming and precision agriculture,

    the main objective was to analyze user opinion, which is the voice of masses.
    During

    compilation of the dataset, it was observed that videos providing more in-depth
    and

    case-study-based information about smart farming tools did not receive many views
    and

    comments. This could be because the general public is not well-informed about
    novel

    technology in the farming sector, as asserted in Section 6. The majority of the
    comments

    were collected from videos about broader topics. The Cohen’s kappa coefﬁcient
    indicated

    that the labels assigned by the two annotators were mostly in agreement and valid.
    The

    mean values of polarity and subjectivity in the comments was calculated through
    the

    Pattern library, and the results suggest that there is a varying degree of subjectivity
    amongst

    the comments. The polarity suggests that user opinion was mostly positive in the
    comments

    analyzed. Thus, it can be safely inferred that training and education programs
    can increase

    the visibility of innovations in smart farming, allowing the general population
    to form a

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    449

    well-informed opinion on the risks and beneﬁts. Positive user sentiment can then
    serve as

    a catalyst towards faster adoption of such tools.

    6. Challenges

    There has been a signiﬁcant increase in the number of smart farming initiatives
    being

    taken up around the world, with promising results. However, with the advent of
    new,

    innovative technologies there are always some unseen risks and associated challenges.

    The agricultural sector has greatly impacted the environment by taking up about
    40% of

    the world’s available land [173] and consuming approximately 70% of the water
    [174].

    Climate change and the growing population further exacerbate food and water scarcity,

    making sustainable food production a challenging task. Thus, it is critical that
    current

    agricultural practices need to evolve to ensure the efﬁcient use of land and water
    resources.

    To elaborate further on Research Question 2, we discuss the various challenges
    that hamper

    the adoption of smart farming in the following bullet points:

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    450

    1.

    Training and awareness: Lack of technical expertise by the farmers implementing

    new technology is a major setback to smart farming. Das et al. [28] conducted
    a

    study to understand the views of Irish farmers towards adoption of cloud computing

    and smart farming technologies. Surveys and interviews conducted with 32 farmers

    revealed that the rate of adoption was higher among younger farmers and lower

    amongst older farmers, who were hesitant to use new technology and preferred

    traditional farming. The digital divide has to be reduced by providing guidance

    and training to the farmers [175]. Lack of knowledge about the technology results

    in greater skepticism towards its adoption amongst farmers, who may not realize

    the value of the tool or consider it an unsuitable ﬁt for their farm. In this
    current

    study, we formed a dataset of YouTube comments related to smart farming operations

    and performed surface level sentiment analysis of them. During the data collection

    process, it was observed that very few comments were left under videos that provided

    a technical and detailed framework for a smart farming project. Comments were

    mostly collected from videos explaining broader topics, such as ‘Vertical Farming’.

    This indicates that there is a general lack of awareness about these technologies
    and

    their applicability to farming.

    2.

    Technical considerations: Fixed and moving sensing technologies require further

    improvements to be able to withstand extreme weather conditions in order to remain

    fully functional [176,177]. Edge node devices may be battery dependent and run
    out

    of power during operation [178,179]. Data is collected from various sensors and
    can be

    analyzed through IoT platforms. There is a requirement for data storage, as there
    is a

    huge amount of data being generated from IoT devices. IoT has improved connectivity

    of all operations by leaps and bounds, but it does come with the added concern
    of

    data privacy and security [180]. It also exposes the smart farming environment
    to

    cybersecurity threats, which could result in signiﬁcant loses [181]. Data encrypting

    in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) also presents a signiﬁcant challenge
    for

    farmers [182].

    3.

    Costs: The costs associated with sensors needs to reduced so that they can be
    imple-

    mented in small-scale farms as well. The solution needs to be designed speciﬁcally

    for the project in question, and also needs regular updates and management. Farmers

    may hesitate in implementing such technologies as they could create issues and
    cause

    further losses instead of providing beneﬁts. Research and development costs for
    the

    implementation of such tools are also steep. There is also a signiﬁcant amount
    of cost

    associated with data transmission within a smart farm [183]. Market uncertainty
    adds

    substantial risk to ensuring a sustainable income for farmers, as proﬁt margins
    are

    getting increasingly smaller. Farmers in small-scale agricultural ﬁelds are hesitant

    to use upgraded technology because of the high initial costs, perceived risks,
    and

    complexity of the system.

    4.

    Government support: The laws and regulations in the area where smart farming is

    being considered for implementation play a huge role in its eventual success or
    failure.

    The local governments are responsible for taking initiatives and providing funding

    and support training programs for the adoption of such tools [184]. Several successful

    initiatives taken up in the European Union [119] and across the world [144] have

    highlighted the importance of the effort taken up by regulatory bodies.

    5.

    Ethical considerations: Human safety is also a concern in the operation of unmanned

    vehicles [185]. Collisions with the ground or other objects may also cause damage

    to the vehicle. It is also essential that the UAVs be ﬂown in unrestricted areas.
    Cur-

    rently, it is not clear where the accountability for the actions taken by autonomous

    vehicles lies. Data need to be uploaded to cloud systems in a secure manner, keeping

    regulations in mind. It is necessary for smart farming operations to be transparent
    so

    that they are more trusted and accepted. The ownership of agricultural data is
    a huge

    liability that needs to be kept in mind. There are also legal and ethical considerations

    with the potential mishandling and misuse of these data [186]. Animal welfare
    is

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    451

    also a concern while making use of autonomous robots to perform functions such
    as

    milking [187].

    6.

    Regional considerations: Lack of proper infrastructure, such as roads, can be
    a major

    hurdle towards the advancement of smart farms, as the necessary resources and

    technology will not be successfully transported. There is limited availability
    of inter-

    net in rural areas, where smart farming could be of greater signiﬁcance. Standard

    protocols and frameworks for wireless communication cannot be deﬁned, as the

    requirements rely heavily on the speciﬁc use case [188]. Further, communication

    protocols implemented within the smart farm may only provide coverage over small

    areas [189].

    7. Discussion

    This review study was conducted to assess the challenges and opportunities in
    smart

    farming by exploring current state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs, analyzing global projects,
    and

    understanding the perception of the general public towards such innovative practices.
    The

    two hypothesis stated at the beginning of the study have been supported by the
    ﬁndings of

    the research questions, which have been answered as follows:

    Hypothesis 3. ICTs and DTs can be used in the agricultural sector to make signiﬁcant
    improve-

    ments in several farming applications.

    The following research question were crafted to accept or reject the hypothesis:

    1.

    What are the state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs currently used in smart farming?

    Over the last decade, several smart farming projects have been launched across
    the

    world that were powered by technologies such as IoT, wireless sensor networks,

    unmanned vehicles, etc., as detailed in Section 3. The potential use cases for
    each

    technology are discussed in Section 4, although several projects utilize more
    than one.

    Several research projects in the European Union [18] and worldwide have also been

    discussed. The development of precise sensors enables the capture of data with
    higher

    accuracy, thus enabling better quality analysis and decision making [14]. Decision

    support systems can guide the farmer with operational decisions about choice of
    crop,

    frequency of fertilizer use, better utilization of resources, and more [69]. Autonomous

    vehicles take care of labor-intensive tasks, thus freeing up farmers for other
    important

    tasks [77]. Communication between various IoT devices through a WSN can allow

    for effective monitoring of the farm throughout the day, making it easier for
    the

    farmer to make operational decisions [36]. Blockchain technology can ensure that
    the

    supply and raw materials purchased are of good quality and there is no adulteration

    taking place [48]. DTs such as artiﬁcial intelligence also have an array of potential

    applications in smart farming, building upon the availability of massive amounts

    of heterogeneous data from sensors [20]. We have discussed the use of machine

    learning and deep learning for disease identiﬁcation in crops, fruits, and cattle
    in

    Section 3.7. AI has also shown great potential in optimizing resource utilization
    by

    automating timely irrigation, performing preemptive actions if a certain parameter

    crosses a threshold, and predictive analysis of weather and crop conditions [188].
    AI

    can also be used to identify optimal conditions for growing crops and preventing
    crop

    wastage. Image processing is of great relevance in smart farming, as there have
    been

    several studies that implement CNNs [98]. Image processing can be used for livestock

    management, guiding the decision-making processes of harvesting robots and pest

    and weed elimination drones. It can also enable precision farming by collecting
    data

    from sensors and deploying resources accordingly [9].

    Hypothesis 4. There are certain signiﬁcant challenges to the widespread adoption
    of smart farming

    tools, such as lack of awareness about the topic amongst the general population.

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    452

    The following research questions are explored in this context:

    1.

    What are the challenges associated with the widespread adoption of smart farming

    tools?

    Despite the increasing number of smart farming projects being launched all over

    the world, there still exist many factors that hinder the widespread implementa-

    tion of such tools [6,188]. As we have discussed in Section 6, the limitations
    can be

    broadly categorized as lack of training and awareness, technical considerations,
    costs,

    government support, ethical considerations, and regional considerations. Technical

    difﬁculties arise due to the inability of current systems to withstand extreme
    weather

    and atmospheric conditions, being too bulky and costly to implement, and not provid-

    ing up-to-the-mark accurate data [176]. Another challenge is the proper infrastructure

    required for storing and processing large amounts of data collected from sensors
    [181].

    The privacy and security of this data is of great importance. Regional limitations

    could be the lack of infrastructure and connectivity. Smaller farms in rural areas
    could

    beneﬁt greatly from the use of smart farming tools. However, most smart farming

    practices require the use of internet connectivity, which is sparse in rural areas.
    Other

    factors that hamper the development of smart farming may include lack of techni-

    cal expertise by farmers, insufﬁcient incentives provided by the government for
    the

    implementation of such practices, and skepticism of farmers towards the beneﬁts
    of

    smart farming [28]. General awareness amongst farmers is generally low and can
    be

    increased through training programs. Although smart farming tools are generally

    black-box techniques, farmers making use of them still need to understand their

    operations so that they can consider the process reliable. Cost considerations
    could

    also make farmers skeptical towards installing new tools, as the upfront expenditure

    may be too much [183].

    2.

    What are the current opinions and expectations of the digital user with regard
    to

    smart farming?

    In order to better understand user perception of smart farming technologies [166],

    we performed sentiment analysis on relevant English comments collected from

    YouTube [168], as detailed in Section 5. The comments were collected from 16 different

    videos that detailed innovative farming solutions. Then, two different approaches

    to observe user sentiment were utilized. In the ﬁrst approach, comments were man-

    ually labeled by two annotators into one of the following six categories: Praising,

    Queries, Suggestions, Undeﬁned, Hybrid and Opinion. Cohen’s Kappa coefﬁcient,

    which is the measure of inter-rater reliability, was calculated as 0.9617. This
    shows a

    high rate of agreement between the labels assigned by both annotators. The labels

    also show high positive correlation with each other, as depicted in Figure 10.
    Word

    clouds created for each video in Figures 8 and 9 highlight signiﬁcant words, such
    as

    ‘technology’, ‘farming’, ‘solar’, etc. In the second approach, polarity and subjectivity

    were calculated for each comment using Pattern library for Python. The polarity

    score ranges from −1 (negative) to 1 (positive) and indicates whether the sentiment

    is positive or negative. The overall polarity was calculated as 0.2092, indicating
    a

    slightly positive sentiment. The subjectivity score ranges from 0 (objective)
    to 1 (sub-

    jective) and indicates the degree of factual information or opinion in the statement.

    The overall subjectivity was calculated as 0.4352, suggesting that the comments
    were

    slightly objective. This implies that the comments discussed were fact-based rather

    than opinionated. However, only a rudimentary study was performed to determine

    user sentiment, and better results can be achieved using state-of-the-art models
    for

    sentiment analysis. In the brief overview of user sentiment conducted in the study,

    we noticed lack of user comments on informative and technical videos about smart

    farming platforms, indicating that a knowledge gap and a digital divide exists
    for

    such technologies [175], which can be detrimental to their widespread adoption.
    The

    general attitude of users towards smart farming technologies is superﬁcial, as
    the

    public is not well-informed about these topics.

    8. Conclusions

    Ensuring a sustainable food supply for the ever-increasing global population has

    become a necessity due to the unprecedented changes in the environment. The agricultural

    sector must update its practices in light of the worsening strain on land and
    water resources,

    and data-driven approaches provide such an opportunity to ensure sustainability.
    This

    study provided an overview of ICTs and DTs in automating and streamlining farming

    operations, and demonstrated how smart farming can improve crop yields by monitoring,

    disease prevention, automation of sowing and harvesting, etc. Examples of primary

    technological tools available for smart farming are IoT, unmanned vehicles, remote
    sensing,

    predictive analysis through big data, and so on. This shift towards data-driven
    approaches

    enables farming facilities to utilize available resources for maximum yield. The
    study also

    presents various challenges that are associated with large-scale implementation
    of smart

    farming practices, such as poor connectivity in rural areas, insufﬁcient funds
    and skilled

    labor, skepticism from farmers, concerns with data privacy, and more. To analyze
    the

    attitude of the public towards implementation of smart farming, we performed sentiment

    analysis on comments from YouTube channels related to smart farming. Preliminary

    ﬁndings in both user-based and transfer-learning based opinion mining suggest
    that a

    better understanding of smart farming tools would help the public in forming an
    informed

    opinion. Further advances are required to improve precision, cost, and efﬁciency
    of robots,

    sensors, and unmanned vehicles before they are readily adopted. Keeping the barriers

    to adoption for smart farming techniques in mind, the future scope of research
    would

    be to develop techniques that provide greater adaptability, ensure food sustainability,

    reduce cost, and counter the harmful affects of climate change on agriculture.
    Greater

    connectivity in rural areas could accelerate the integration of ICTs in smallholder
    farms,

    allowing them to prepare for unprecedented changes in farming conditions. Further

    research and investigation of the possible uses of DTs and ICTs is necessary to
    understand

    the challenges and opportunities in smart farming. A detailed sentiment analysis
    using

    advanced language models and inclusion of non-English comments can also provide
    greater

    insight into the expectations and opinions of digital users towards innovative
    farming

    solutions. Multidisciplinary research also needs to be conducted to elucidate
    other socio–

    economic, environmental, and technical factors that impede development and adoption
    of

    such innovations.

    \ and a collection of heterogeneous interconnected devices. It\nproduces large-scale\
    \ distributed, and diverse data called big data. Big Data Management (BDM) in\
    \ IoT is used for\nknowledge discovery and intelligent decision-making and is\
    \ one of the most signiﬁcant research challenges today. There\nare several mechanisms\
    \ and technologies for BDM in IoT. This paper aims to study the important mechanisms\
    \ in this area\nsystematically. This paper studies articles published between\
    \ 2016 and August 2022. Initially, 751 articles were identi-\nﬁed, but a paper\
    \ selection process reduced the number of articles to 110 signiﬁcant studies.\
    \ Four categories to study BDM\nmechanisms in IoT include BDM processes, BDM architectures/frameworks,\
    \ quality attributes, and big data analytics\ntypes. Also, this paper represents\
    \ a detailed comparison of the mechanisms in each category. Finally, the development\n\
    challenges and open issues of BDM in IoT are discussed. As a result, predictive\
    \ analysis and classiﬁcation methods are\nused in many articles. On the other\
    \ hand, some quality attributes such as conﬁdentiality, accessibility, and sustainability\
    \ are\nless considered. Also, none of the articles use key-value databases for\
    \ data storage. This study can help researchers develop\nmore effective BDM in\
    \ IoT methods in a complex environment.\nKeyword Big data management \x02 Internet\

    1 Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging information\ntechnology\
    \ model and a dynamic network that enables\ninteraction between self-conﬁguring,\
    \ smart, and intercon-\nnected devices and humans [1]. The IoT’s ubiquitous data\n\
    collection devices (such as Radio-Frequency Identiﬁcation\n(RFID) tags, sensors,\
    \ Global Positioning Systems (GPS),\nGeographical Information Systems (GIS), drives,\
    \ Near-\nField\nCommunication\n(NFC),\nactuators,\nand\nmobile\nphones) collect\
    \ and share real-time, mobile, and environ-\nmental data for automatic monitoring,\
    \ identiﬁcation, pro-\ncessing, maintenance, and control in real-time [2–4]. The\n\
    IoT ecosystem has ﬁve main components generally: IoT\ndevices, including sensors\
    \ and actuators that collect data\nand perform actions on things; IoT connectivity,\
    \ including\nprotocols and gateways, that is responsible for creating\ncommunication\
    \ in the IoT ecosystem between smart devi-\nces, gateways, and the cloud; an IoT\
    \ cloud that is respon-\nsible for data storage, processing, analysis, and decision-\n\
    making;\nIoT\nanalytics\nand\ndata\nmanagement\nare\n& Nima Jafari Navimipour\n\

    \ data; and end-user devices\nand user interfaces help to control and conﬁgure\
    \ the system\n[5]. The most important applications of IoT include envi-\nronmental\
    \ monitoring, disaster management, smart homes/\nbuildings, smart farms, healthcare,\
    \ smart cities, urban,\nsmart manufacturing, intelligent transport systems, smart\n\
    ﬂoods, ﬁnancial risk management, supply chain manage-\nment, water management,\
    \ enterprise culture, cultural her-\nitage,\nsmart\nsurveillance,\nmilitary\n\
    tracking\nand\nenvironment, digital forensics, underwater environments,\nand understanding\
    \ social phenomena [6–22]. The IoT\ndevices and sensors in the Wireless Sensor\
    \ Networks\n(WSN) generate large data. According to the international\ndata corporation1\
    \ forecast, the number of IoT devices will\nbe 41.6 billion and generate 79.4\
    \ zettabytes of data in 2025.\nThis massive structured, semi-structured, and unstructured\n\
    data, which is expanding rapidly with time, results in ‘‘Big\nData’’ [23]. ‘‘Big\
    \ data’’ technologies are a new generation\nof distributed architectures and technologies\
    \ that provide\ndistributed data mining capabilities to inexpensively,\nvaluable,\
    \ and effectively extract value from a huge dataset\nwith characteristics such\
    \ as volume, velocity, variety,\nvariability, veracity, and value [24]. Big data\
    \ provides both\nopportunities and problems for organizations and enter-\nprises.\
    \ Big data can improve data precision, be used for\nforecasting and decision-making,\
    \ and give stakeholders\nmore in-depth analytical ﬁndings [2]. Traditional data\n\
    processing systems cannot collect, process, manage, and\ninterpret data effectively\
    \ using conventional mechanisms.\nTherefore, it requires a scalable architecture\
    \ or framework\nfor effective capture, storage, management, and analysis\n[25].\n\
    A major challenge in implementing IoT in real and\ncomplex environments is analyzing\
    \ heterogeneous data\nvolumes that contain a wide variety of knowledge content\n\
    [26]. Various platforms, tools, and technologies have been\ndeveloped for big\
    \ data monitoring, collecting, ingesting,\nstoring, processing, analysis, and\
    \ visualization [10, 27].\nThese platforms and tools are Apache Hadoop, MapRe-\n\
    duce, 1010data, Apache Storm, Cloudera, Cassandra, HP-\nHAVEn, SAP-Hana, Hortonworks,\
    \ MongoDB, Apache\nKafka, Apache Spark, Infobright, etc. Industries and\nenterprises\
    \ use Big Data Analytics (BDA) with IoT tech-\nnologies to handle the timely analysis\
    \ of information\nstreams and intelligent decision-making [28–30]. BDM in\nthe\
    \ IoT involves different analytic types [31]. Marjani et al.\n[29] discussed analytical\
    \ types in real-time, ofﬂine, mem-\nory, business intelligence, and at massive\
    \ levels. Singh and\nYassine [28] divided analytical types into preprocessing,\n\
    pattern mining, and classiﬁcation. Gandomi and Haider\n[32] divided big data processing\
    \ into two major phases:\ndata management and data analytics. Also, Ahmed et al.\n\
    [33] provided ﬁve aspects of big data: acquisition and\nstorage; programming model;\
    \ benchmark process; analysis;\nand application. Finally, ur Rehman et al. [34]\
    \ divided\nBDA into ﬁve main steps: data ingestion, cleaning, con-\nformation,\
    \ transformation, and shaping.\nHowever, despite the importance of BDM in the\
    \ IoT and\nthe rising challenges in this area, as far as we know, there is\nnot\
    \ any complete and detailed systematic review in this\nﬁeld. Hence, this paper\
    \ tries to analyze the mechanisms of\nBDM in the IoT. The main contributions of\
    \ this paper are\nas follows:\n•\nPresenting a study of the existing methods for\
    \ BDM in\nthe IoT.\n•\nDividing BDM methods in the IoT are divided into four\n\
    main categories: BDM processes, BDM architectures/\nframeworks, quality attributes,\
    \ and big data analytics\ntypes.\n•\nDividing the BDM process in the IoT into\
    \ six main\nsteps, including data collection, communication, data\ningestion,\
    \ data storage, processing and analysis, and\npost-processing.\n•\nDividing the\
    \ BDM architecture/framework in the IoT\ninto two main subcategories: BDM architectures/frame-\n\
    works in IoT-based applications and BDM architec-\ntures/frameworks in the IoT\
    \ paradigms.\n•\nExploring the primary challenges, issues, and future\nworks for\
    \ BDM in the IoT.\nThe following subsection discusses related work to show\nthe\
    \ main differences between this review and similar\nstudies. Also, the abbreviations\
    \ used in this paper are\npresented in Table 1.\n1.1 Related work and contributions\
    \ of this\nreview\nThis section studies some reviews and survey articles that\n\
    work on BDM in the IoT to highlight the need for\nreviewing them. In addition,\
    \ this section describes the main\nadvantages and disadvantages of this article\
    \ to distinguish\nthis one.\nAhmed et al. [27] analyzed several techniques for\
    \ IoT-\nbased big data. This article categorizes the literature based\non parameters,\
    \ including big data sources, system compo-\nnents, big data enabling technologies,\
    \ functional elements,\nand analytics types. The authors also discussed connec-\n\
    tivity, storage, quality of services, real-time analytics, and\nbenchmarking as\
    \ the critical requirements for big data\nprocessing and analytics.\nConstante\

    \ is a research method-\nology that examines data and ﬁndings of the researchers\n\
    relative to speciﬁed questions [46, 47]. It aims to ﬁnd as\nmuch relevant research\
    \ on the deﬁned questions as possible\nand to use explicit methods to identify\
    \ what can reliably be\nsaid based on these studies [48, 49]. This section provides\n\
    an SLR to understand the BDM techniques in the IoT. The\nfollowing subsection\
    \ will explain the research questions\nand the article selection process.\n2.1\
    \ Research questions\nThis study focuses more explicitly on the articles related\
    \ to\nBDM in the IoT, focusing on their advantages and disad-\nvantages, architectures,\
    \ processing and analysis methods,\nstorage systems, evaluation metrics, and tools.\
    \ To achieve\nthe goals mentioned above, the following research ques-\ntions are\

    IoT and provides open issues for future research. Section 4\nwill discuss this\
    \ answer.\n2.2 Article selection process\nIn this study, the article’s search\
    \ and selection process\nconsists of three stages. These stages are shown in Fig.\
    \ 1.\nIn the ﬁrst stage, the articles between 2016 and August\n2022 were searched\
    \ based on the keywords and terms\n(presented in Table 3). These articles are\
    \ the results of\nsearching popular electronic databases. These electronic\ndatabases\
    \ include Google Scholar, Elsevier, ACM, IEEE\nExplore, Emerald Insight, MDPI,\
    \ Springer Link, Taylor\nand Francis, Wiley, JST, Dblp, DOAJ, and ProQuest. The\n\
    articles include journals, chapters, conference papers,\nbooks, notes, technical\
    \ reports, and special issues. 751\narticles were found in Stage 1. In Stage 2,\
    \ there are two\nsteps to select the ﬁnal number of articles to review. First,\n\
    the articles are considered based on the inclusion criteria in\nFig. 2. There\
    \ are 314 articles left at this stage. Next, the\nreview articles are removed;\
    \ of the remaining 314 articles\nin the previous stage, 85 (27.07%) were review\
    \ articles.\nElsevier has the highest number of review articles (31.76%,\n27 articles).\
    \ EMERALD and Taylor and Francis have the\nlowest number of reviewed articles\
    \ (2.35%, one article).\nThe highest number of published review articles is in\
    \ 2019\n(24.71%), and the lowest is in 2022 (8.24%). The number\nof remaining\
    \ articles at this stage is 229. In Stage 3, the\ntitle and abstract of the articles\
    \ are reviewed. Also, to\nensure that the articles are relevant to the study,\
    \ we\nreviewed the methodology, evaluation, discussion, and\nconclusion sections.\
    \ The number of selected articles\nretained at this stage is 110. Elsevier publishes\
    \ most of the\nselected articles (30.91%, 34 articles). The lowest number\nis\
    \ related to ACM (0.91%, one article). 2018 has the\nhighest number of published\
    \ articles (26.36%, 29 articles).\nThe Future Generation Computer Systems journal\
    \ pub-\nlishes the highest number of articles (11.82%, 13 articles).\n3 Big data\
    \ management approaches\nin the IoT\nThis section presents four different categories\
    \ for the\nreviewed articles. These categories include the BDM pro-\ncess in the\
    \ IoT (Sect. 3.1), BDM architectures/frameworks\nfor IoT applications (Sect. 3.2),\
    \ quality attributes (Sect.\n3.3), and big data analytics types (Sect. 3.4). Each\
    \ category\nhas subcategories that will be considered in its relevant\nsection.\
    \ Figure 3 shows this taxonomy.\n3.1 Big data management process in the IoT\n\
    This section categorizes articles based on BDM process\nmechanisms and presents\
    \ a comprehensive framework for\nBDM in the IoT. The comprehensive framework for\
    \ BDM\nin the IoT is shown in Fig. 4. The steps of BDM in IoT\ninclude data collection,\
    \ communication, data ingestion,\nstorage, processing and analysis, and post-processing.\n\
    3.1.1 Data collection\nA variety of sources generates IoT data. There are different\n\
    mechanisms for IoT data collection, but there is still no\nfully efﬁcient and\
    \ adaptive mechanism for IoT data col-\nlection [50]. This paper divides IoT sources\
    \ into sensors,\napplications, devices, and other resources. Figure 5 shows\n\
    the classiﬁcation of the sources based on these four\ncategories.\n• Automatic\

    \ stage\nWireless Networks (2023) 29:1085–1144\n1091\n123\n3.1.2 Communication\n\
    The data sources are located on various networks, such as\nIoT sensor networks,\
    \ wired and wireless sensor networks,\nﬁber-optic\nsensor\nnetworks,\nand\nmachine-to-machine\n\
    communications.\nCommunication\ntechnologies\nare\nrequired to process and analyze\
    \ these data sources [51, 52].\nThere are several communication technologies and\
    \ proto-\ncols in the IoT. The communication protocols used in the\narticles are\
    \ IPV6, RPL, MQTT, CoAP, SSL, AMQP,\nWebsocket, 6LowPANIPV6, Alljoyn, TCP/IP,\
    \ HTTP/IP.\nCommunication technologies are compared based on fre-\nquency, data\
    \ rate, range, power usage, cost, latency, etc.\nThere are several categories\
    \ of these communication\ntechnologies. This paper divides big data communication\n\
    technologies in the IoT based on distance criteria into three\ncategories: pan,\
    \ local, and WAN. Table 4 shows the arti-\ncles’ classiﬁcation based on these\
    \ three categories. Wi-Fi,\nZigBee, Bluetooth, and 4G LTE are of the utmost impor-\n\
    tance in communication technology, with a total number of\n29, 19, 17, and 17\
    \ articles, respectively.\n3.1.3 Data ingestion\nData ingestion is the process\
    \ of importing and transporting\ndata in different formats from various sources\
    \ (shown in\nFig. 4) to a storage medium, processing and analyzing\nplatform,\
    \ and decision support engines [93, 94]. The\nquality of the dataset used by ML-based\
    \ prediction models\n(classiﬁcation) plays a vital role in BDM in the IoT. A\n\
    prediction model requires a lot of correctly labeled data for\ncorrect construction,\
    \ assessment, and accurate result gen-\neration [95]. Therefore, the data ingestion\
    \ layer should\nhandle the enormous volume, high speed (velocity), vari-\nety,\
    \ value, variable, and validated data for the processing\nand analysis step. In\
    \ different articles, this layer has mul-\ntiple tasks. The data ingestion layer\
    \ in [96] includes iden-\ntiﬁcation, ﬁltration, validation, noise reduction, integration,\n\
    transformation, and compression. The data ingestion layer\nin [97] provides data\
    \ synchronization, data slicing, data\nsplitting, and data indexing. Also, the\
    \ data ingestion layer\nin [98] includes data stream acquisition, data stream\n\
    extraction, enrichment, integration, and data stream distri-\nbution. Finally,\
    \ the data ingestion layer in [99] includes\ndata cleaning, data integration,\
    \ and data compression.\nThere are three categories of data ingestion technolo-\n\
    gies: real-time data ingestion, batch data ingestion, and\nboth. Real-time data\
    \ ingestion is used for time-sensitive\ndata and real-time intelligent decision-making.\
    \ Batch data\ningestion is used for data collection from sources at regular\n\
    intervals (daily reports and schedules) [100]. There are\nmany tools and platforms\
    \ for data ingestion, such as\nApache Kafka, Apache NIFI, Apache Storm, Apache\n\
    Flume, Apache Sqoop, Apache Samza, Apache Miniﬁ,\nConﬂuent Platform, and Elastic\
    \ Logstash. These tools can\nbe compared based on throughput, latency, scalability,\
    \ and\nsecurity [98]. The data ingestion layer in this paper\nincludes data cleaning,\
    \ data integration, data transforma-\ntion/ discretization, and data reduction.\
    \ Each of these steps\nuses special tools, methods, and algorithms. Table 5 shows\n\
    the categorization of articles based on the tools that are\nTable 3 Search keywords\

    NiFi/MiNiFi, Apache Kafka, Apache Storm, and Druid\ntools. As you can see in Table\
    \ 5, Apache Kafka is of utmost\nimportance to the data ingestion tool, with a\
    \ total of 8\narticles. Also, Table 6 shows the categorization of articles\nbased\
    \ on the big data preprocessing stage in the IoT.\n3.1.4 Data storage\nThis subsection\
    \ categorizes articles based on storage\nmechanisms. The articles use various\
    \ methods and tools to\nstore big data. This study divides these mechanisms into\n\
    four categories: relational, NoSQL, Distributed File Sys-\ntems (DFS), and cloud/edge/fog/mist\
    \ storage. Each of these\ncategories has subcategories. One of the most critical\
    \ big\ndata challenges is the categorization and scalability that\ntraditional\
    \ relational databases such as MySQL, SQL Ser-\nver, and Postgres cannot overcome.\
    \ Therefore, NoSQL\ndatabases are used to store big data. NoSQL technologies\n\
    are divided into four categories: key-value, column-ori-\nented, document-oriented,\
    \ and graph-oriented [102]. These\nNoSQL technologies have many platforms to support\
    \ their\noperations. Key-value storage is the most straightforward\nand highly\
    \ ﬂexible type of NoSQL database and stores all\nthe data as a pair of keys and\
    \ values. A document-oriented\ndatabase stores data as a set of columns. In a\
    \ relational\ndatabase, data is stored in rows and read row-by-row. A\ngraph database\
    \ focuses on the relationships between data\nelements, and each element is stored\
    \ as a node. Tables 7\nand 8 show the types of storage methods used in articles.\n\
    Table 7 shows the classiﬁcation of articles based on rela-\ntional databases,\
    \ NoSQL databases, and DFS. As you can\nsee, any of the 110 selected articles\
    \ do not use the key-\nvalue databases. In relational databases, Hive, NoSQL\n\
    databases, Hbase, and distributed ﬁle systems, HDFS is\nmost commonly used. Table\
    \ 7 compares these storage tools\nand platforms based on in-memory database/storage\
    \ or\ndisk-based, data type, scalability, security, availability,\nﬂexibility,\
    \ performance, fault-tolerant, easy to use, and\nreplication.\nTable 8 shows the\
    \ classiﬁcation of articles based on\ncloud/edge/fog/mist storage. Cloud computing\
    \ provides\nscalable computing, high data storage, processing power,\nand ensures\
    \ the quality of the applications. However, it has\nmain challenges such as latency,\
    \ network overhead,\nbandwidth, data privacy, lower real-time responsiveness,\n\
    location awareness, security, reliability, data availability,\nand accessibility\
    \ [103]. Network architectures came into\nFig. 3 Taxonomy of the selected articles\n\

    \ that move the data and computation\ncloser to the consumer and reduce some of\
    \ the workloads\nfrom the cloud [104].\nFog computing is a type of decentralized\
    \ computing that\nis between cloud storage and IoT devices. Fog computing\nreduces\
    \ service latency, bandwidth, energy consumption,\nstorage, and computing costs\
    \ and improves the QoS [149].\nThe fog computing for the IoT model supports real-time\n\
    services, mobility, and geographic distribution [150].\nAnother alternative approach\
    \ to cloud computing is edge\ncomputing. Data storage and processing in edge computing\n\
    occur closer to the device or data source to improve data\nlocality, performance,\
    \ and decision-making [151]. Edge\ncomputing is less scalable than fog computing\
    \ but provides\nnear real-time analytics and high-speed data access and\nreduces\
    \ data leakage during transmission [104, 152]. Mist\ncomputing is an intermediate\
    \ layer between fog/cloud and\nedge computing. It can improve the fog/cloud challenges,\n\
    such as response time, location awareness, data privacy,\nlocal decision-making,\
    \ network overhead, latency, and\ncomputing and storage costs. Mist nodes had\
    \ low pro-\ncessing power and storage [153]. In some articles, in\naddition to\
    \ using cloud/edge/fog/mist storage, HDFS and\nNoSQL databases are used alongside\
    \ these technologies.\nbFig. 4 Big data management framework in IoT\nTable 4 Classiﬁcation\

    \ of these tech-\nnologies by using them together.\n3.1.5 Processing and analysis\n\
    Big data processing and analysis in the IoT are techniques\nor programming models\
    \ for extracting knowledge from\nlarge amounts of data for supporting and providing\
    \ intel-\nligent decisions [154]. Efﬁcient big data processing and\nanalysis in\
    \ IoT can help mitigate many challenges in event\nmanagement, action management,\
    \ control and monitoring,\nimproved customer service, cost savings, improve business\n\
    relationships [155], etc. This paper divides the big data\nprocessing and analysis\
    \ step in IoT into a set of sub-steps:\nbatch and stream processing, query processing,\
    \ statistical\nand numerical analysis, graph processing, ML, resource\nmanagement,\
    \ and infrastructure/containers. Table 9 shows\nthe articles’ classiﬁcation and\
    \ comparison of the tools\nbased on criteria: throughput, reliability, availability,\n\
    latency, scalability, security, ﬂexibility, ease of use, and\ncost-effectiveness.\
    \ Big data processing in the IoT is gen-\nerally done at both batch and stream\
    \ levels. Many tools,\nplatforms, and frameworks exist for batch and stream\n\
    processing. The tools used in the articles are Apache\nHadoop, Apache Spark, Map\
    \ Reduce, Apache Storm,\nApache Flink, Anaconda, Apache S4, Weka, streaming\n\
    analytics manager, and CEP.\nAs you can see in Table 9, Apache Hadoop, MapRe-\n\
    duce, and Apache Spark are the most critical quality\nattributes, with a total\
    \ number of 45, 32, and 31 articles,\nrespectively. Some of these tools include\
    \ a set of libraries\nand procedures for efﬁcient processing and analysis. In\
    \ the\nstudy, the libraries and functions used by the articles are\nHadooppcap-lib,\
    \ Hadoop-pcap-serde, Hadoop-pcap-input\n(Apache Hadoop), MLlib, GraphX, Spark\
    \ Streaming,\nSpark SQL, Spark Core (Apache Spark), Map, FlatMap,\nFilter, Reduce,\
    \ Shufﬂe (Map Reduce), Gelly, FlinkML,\nTable and SQL, FlinkCEP (Apache Flink),\
    \ NumPy [132],\nKeras [108], Pandas [59], and Scikit-Learn, Paho-MQTT\n(Anaconda).\
    \ Also, various algorithms and methods are\nused to process and analyze data,\
    \ such as classiﬁcation,\nclustering, regression, optimization algorithms, and\
    \ SVM.\nMost of these tools have these algorithms.\n3.1.6 Post-processing\nThe\
    \ post-processing step is another vital task in knowledge\ndiscovery from big\
    \ data in the IoT. This paper divides the\npost-processing step into evaluation\
    \ and selection (data\ngovernance), virtualization/dashboard, intelligent decision,\n\
    and service and application. The evaluation and selection\nstage evaluates results\
    \ obtained using test methods on\ndifferent types of datasets. There are various\

    \ are cate-\ngorized based on the methods they used for the test. These\nmethods\
    \ are divided into four categories, including test\nmethods, classiﬁcation, clustering,\
    \ and regression. Each of\nthem uses various criteria for evaluation. Table 10\
    \ shows\nthe articles’ classiﬁcation based on these four categories.\nThe virtualization/dashboard\
    \ stage uses tools, graphs,\ntables [75], graphical user interface [59], and charts\
    \ [92] to\ndisplay the results. Intelligent decisions can be made using\nstochastic\
    \ binary decisions [156], ML, pattern recognition,\nsoft computing, and decision\
    \ models [51, 53, 74]. These\ntools are Kibana, Plotly, Tableau, Microsoft Power\

    \ datasets are divided into\ntwo categories: 1) categorized based on characteristics\n\
    including dataset name, repository, dataset characteristics,\nattribute characteristics,\
    \ number of instances/size, and\nnumber of attributes 2) categorized based on\

    \ data management architectures/frameworks\nin the IoT applications\nThe architectural\
    \ models used in the selected articles are\nlayered, component-based, and cloud/fog-based\
    \ architec-\nture. A layered architecture is organized hierarchically, and\neach\
    \ layer performs a service. The layered architecture\nensures the system is more\
    \ adaptable to emerging tech-\nnologies at each layer and improves the acquisition\
    \ and\nintegration of data processes [167]. Component-based\narchitecture is a\
    \ framework that decomposes the system\ninto reusable and logical components.\
    \ The advantages of\ncomponent-based architecture are increased quality, relia-\n\
    bility, component reusability, and reduced time. Operations\nand components related\
    \ to processing or storage in cloud-\nbased or fog-based architectures are placed\
    \ in the cloud or\nfog. Most of the proposed architectures are layered, and the\n\

    123\nmost common types of BDM architectures in the IoT are\n3-layer and 4-layer\
    \ (22 and 20 articles). Also, most of the\nproposed architectures are in IoT-based\
    \ healthcare,\nequivalent to 33.33%, followed by IoT-based smart\ncities, which\
    \ equals 22.22%. The selected articles in this\nstudy used nine different OS for\
    \ BDM in the IoT. Ubuntu\nis the most important OS, with 18 articles. Articles\
    \ used\nprogramming languages to analyze and process big data\nin the IoT. Java,\
    \ Python, and MATLAB are the major\nprogramming languages. In the following, these\
    \ archi-\ntectures and frameworks will be examined. For a better\npresentation,\
    \ we have divided these architectures and\nframeworks into seven categories in\
    \ terms of IoT\napplications (healthcare, smart cities, smart home/build-\ning,\
    \ intelligent transport, trafﬁc control and energy,\nurban planning, and other\
    \ IoT applications (smart IoT\nsystems, smart ﬂood, smart farms, disaster management,\n\
    laundry, digital manufacturing, and smart factory)). Then\nwe review the attributes\
    \ of the architectures and frame-\nworks, including layers, the functions of the\
    \ layers, the\noperating system, the programming language, and the\nadvantages\
    \ and disadvantages of each.\n3.2.1.1 BDM\narchitectural/framework\nfor\nIoT-based\n\
    healthcare\nPredicting health and disease and prevent-\ning deaths are essential\
    \ in our modern world [168, 169].\nHealthcare IoT (e.g., electronic and mobile\
    \ health) uses\nwireless body sensor networks for monitoring the\npatients’ environmental,\
    \ physiological, and behavioral\nparameters [170]. Wearables and other IoT devices\n\
    within the healthcare industry generate a large amount of\ndata. The health data\
    \ must be collected, stored, pro-\ncessed, and analyzed for future intelligent\
    \ decision-\nmaking. BDA plays a vital role in minimizing compu-\ntation time,\
    \ predicting the future status of individuals,\nproviding reliable health services,\
    \ prevention, healthy\nliving, population health, early detection, and optimal\n\
    management [133, 158, 171]. There are the BDM\nmechanisms’ objectives and requirements\
    \ for different\ntypes of medical data [172]. Various research has pre-\nsented\n\
    many\nmechanisms\nfor\nBDM\nin\nIoT-based\nhealthcare that have advantages and\
    \ disadvantages.\nTherefore, this subsection examines the articles (21\narticles;\
    \ 33.33%) that discussed the architectures or\nframeworks of BDM in IoT-based\
    \ healthcare.\nRathore et al. [58] proposed Hadoop-based intelligent\nhealthcare\
    \ using a BDA approach. This system collected\nthe big data and directed them\
    \ to a 3-unit smart building\nfor storing and processing. The units of this system\
    \ are\nbig data collection, Hadoop processing, and analysis and\ndecision. This\
    \ system used the 5-layer architecture for\nparallel, real-time, and ofﬂine processing.\
    \ The layers of\nthis architecture are the data collection, communication,\nTable\

    \ processed in parallel using HDFS and\nMapReduce, and stored. The management\
    \ layer uses\nmedical expert systems for processing the results and rec-\nommending\
    \ corresponding actions.\nChui et al. [126] proposed a 6-layer architecture for\n\
    patient behavior monitoring based on big data and IoT.\nMessage queue, Apache\
    \ Hadoop, behavior analytics,\nMongo database, distributed stream processing,\
    \ and expo-\nser are the layers of this architecture. This architecture uses\n\
    Hadoop for processing (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive,\nand prescriptive\
    \ analytics), MongoDB for storing, Spark/\nFlink/Storm for stream processing,\
    \ and Apache Kafka for\nbreaking up the data stream into several partitions. Also,\n\
    the authors have discussed the challenges of trust, security,\nprivacy, and interoperability\
    \ in the healthcare research\nﬁeld.\nUllah et al. [140] proposed a lightweight\
    \ Semantic\nInteroperability Model for Big-Data in IoT (SIMB-IoT).\nThe SIMB-IoT\
    \ model has two main components: user\ninterface and\nsemantic\ninteroperability.\n\
    The\nsemantic\ninteroperability component is divided into three subcom-\nponents:\
    \ semantic interoperability, cloud services, and big\ndata analytics. IoT data\
    \ is collected and directed into an\nintelligent health cloud for online storage\
    \ and processing.\nAfter processing, it sends suitable medicines to the\npatient’s\
    \ IoT devices. This article used the SPARQL query\nto ﬁnd hidden patterns.\nElhoseny\
    \ et al. [173] presented a Parallel Particle\nSwarm Optimization (PPSO) algorithm\
    \ for IoT big data\nanalysis in cloud computing healthcare applications. This\n\
    article aims are: optimize virtual machine selection and\nstorage by using GA,\
    \ PSO, and PPSO algorithms; real-time\nprocessing; and reducing the execution\
    \ time. This archi-\ntecture has four components: stakeholders’ devices; tasks;\n\
    cloud broker; and network administrator. The cloud broker\nsends and receives\
    \ requests to the cloud. The network\nadministrator ﬁnds the optimal selection\
    \ of virtual machi-\nnes in the cloud for task scheduling.\nManogaran et al. [141]\

    \ The meta fog-redirection architec-\nture has three phases: data collection,\

    \ Also, this architecture used MapRe-\nduce to predict.\nGarcı´a-Magarin˜o et\
    \ al. [156] is an agent-based simula-\ntion framework for IoT BDA in smart beds.\
    \ This frame-\nwork has two layers: the primary mechanism for simulating\nsleepers’\
    \ postures and the information’s analyzer. The ﬁrst\nlayer provides the simulation\
    \ of the poses of sleeper\nmechanisms. The second layer analysis collected data\
    \ from\nthe ﬁrst layer. The agent types in this framework are\nsleeper agent,\
    \ weight sensor agent, bed agent, observer\nagent, analyzer agent, stochastic\
    \ sleeper agent, bed sleeper\nagent, restless sleeper agent, and healthy sleeper\
    \ agent.\nThis framework helps researchers to test different sleeper\nposture\
    \ recognition algorithms, discusses other sleeper\nbehaviors,\nand\nperforms\n\
    online\nor\nofﬂine\ndetection\nmechanisms.\nYacchirema et al. [59] proposed a\
    \ 3-layer architecture\nfor sleep monitoring based on IoT and big data at the\n\
    network’s edge. The layers of this architecture are the IoT\nlayer, the fog layer,\
    \ and the cloud layer. The IoT layer\ncollected and aggregated the big data and\
    \ directed them to\nthe fog layer. The fog layer is responsible for connectivity\n\
    and interoperability between heterogeneous devices, pre-\nprocessing the collected\
    \ data, and sending notiﬁcations to\nreact in real-time. The big data is stored,\
    \ processed, and\nanalyzed in the cloud layer for intelligent decision-making.\n\
    This layer has three modules: data management, big data\nanalyzer, and web application.\
    \ This architecture used\nHDFS for data storage and Spark for ofﬂine and real-time\n\
    processing.\nBigReduce [137] is a cloud-based IoT framework for\nbig data reduction\
    \ for health monitoring in smart cities that\nfocuses on reducing energy costs.\
    \ This framework has two\nschemes: real-time big data reduction and intelligent\
    \ big\ndata decision-making. The big data reduction is made in\ntwo phases: at\
    \ the time of acquisition and before trans-\nmission using an event-insensitive\
    \ frequency content\nprocess.\nMa et al. [33] proposed a 3-layer architecture\
    \ for the IoT\nbig health system based on cloud-to-end fusion. The layers\nof\
    \ this architecture are the big health perception layer,\ntransport layer, and\
    \ big health cloud service layer. In the\nbig health perception layer, data are\
    \ collected and prepro-\ncessed. The transport layer sends data to sensor nodes\
    \ and\nreceives data from the perception layer using network\ntechnologies. The\
    \ big health cloud service layer has two\nsub-layers: the cloud service support\
    \ and the cloud service\napplication.\nThe\ncloud\nservice\nsupport\nsub-layer\n\
    is\nresponsible for compressing, storing, processing, and ana-\nlyzing the real-time\
    \ data. The cloud service application\nsub-layer is the interface between users\
    \ and health net-\nworking. This sub-layer controls the sensor nodes and\nvisualizes\
    \ the big data.\nRathore et al. [61] proposed the 5-layer architecture for\nbig\
    \ data IoT analytics-based real-time medical emergency\nresponse systems. The\
    \ data collection layer is responsible\nfor data sensing, acquisition, buffering,\
    \ ﬁltration, and\nprocessing. This layer collected and aggregated data using\n\
    a coordinator or relay node and transmitted them to a\npolarization mode dispersion.\
    \ The communication layer\nprovides device-to-device communication to various\
    \ smart\ndevices. The processing layer divides big data into small\nchunks. Each\
    \ chunk is processed separately, aggregated,\nand stored. This article used MapReduce,\
    \ HDFS, and Spark\nfor data processing and analysis. The management layer is\n\
    responsible for managing all types of outcomes using a\nmedical expert system.\
    \ The service layer is the interface\nbetween end-users and health networking.\
    \ This architecture\nminimized\nthe\nprocessing\ntime\nand\nincreased\nthe\nthroughput.\n\
    El-Hasnony et al. [84] proposed a hybrid real-time\nremote patient monitoring\
    \ framework based on mist, fog,\nand cloud computing. This article provided the\
    \ 5-layer\narchitecture for near real-time data analysis. The layers are\nthe\
    \ perception layer, the mist layer, the fog layer, the cloud\nlayer, and the service\
    \ provider layer. The mist layer is\nresponsible for data ﬁltering, data fusion,\
    \ anomaly detec-\ntion, and data transmission to the fog layer. The fog layer\n\
    has done local monitoring and analysis, data aggregation,\nlocal storage, data\
    \ pre-analysis, and data transmission to\nthe cloud layer. The cloud layer implemented\
    \ several data\nanalytics techniques for intelligent decision-making and\nstorage.\
    \ This article presented a case study comparing\ntraditional data mining techniques,\
    \ including REPtree,\nMLP, Naive Bayes (NB), and sequential minimal opti-\nmization\
    \ algorithms. The results showed that the REPtree\nalgorithm achieved better accuracy,\
    \ and the NB achieved\nthe least time.\nHarb et al. [106] proposed the 4-layer\
    \ architecture for\nreal-time BDA for patient monitoring and decision-making\n\
    in healthcare applications. The layers of this platform are\nreal-time patient\
    \ monitoring, real-time decision and data\nstorage, patient classiﬁcation, and\
    \ disease diagnosis, and\ndata retrieval and visualization. The ﬁrst layer is\
    \ respon-\nsible for data ingestion using Kafka and Sqoop tools. The\nsecond layer\
    \ processes and stores data using Spark and\nHadoop HDFS. This layer preprocesses\
    \ data and ﬁnds the\nmissing records using MissRec (a script for Spark). The\n\
    third layer is responsible for classiﬁcation data using sta-\nbility-based K-means,\
    \ an adapted version of K-means\nclustering, and disease diagnosis using a modiﬁed\
    \ version\nof the association rule mining algorithm. The last layer\nretrieves\
    \ and visualizes data to understand the patient’s\nsituation using Hive, SparkSQL,\
    \ and Matplotlib.\nZhou et al. [62] proposed a data mining technology\nbased on\
    \ the IoT. The layers of the proposed functional\n1108\nWireless Networks (2023)\
    \ 29:1085–1144\n123\narchitecture are the data acquisition layer, data transmis-\n\
    sion layer, data storage layer, and cloud service center\nlayer. This article\
    \ used the WIT120 system for data col-\nlection, the adaptive k-means clustering\
    \ method based on\nthe MapReduce framework for data preprocessing, HDFS\nfor storing,\
    \ and the GM (1,1) grey model for users’ health\nstatus prediction.\nHong-Tan\
    \ et al. [90] proposed a real-time Ambient\nIntelligence assisted Student Health\
    \ Monitoring System\n(AmIHMS). The data required by time ambient intelligence\n\
    environments are collected from the WSN and sent to the\ncloud for handling. Their\
    \ work developed a framework for\nreal-time effective alerting of student health\
    \ information.\nThe AmIHMS architecture has three layers. The IoT layer\ncollects\
    \ health data from medical devices and sensors and\nsaves it on one mobile computer\
    \ or smartphone. The cloud\nlayer receives the data through internet platforms\
    \ such as\n4G, 5G, LTE, etc., and executes the mining algorithms to\nextract relevant\
    \ data for processing. The student health\nmonitoring layer performs four stages\
    \ to provide infor-\nmation and warnings about student health status. These\n\
    stages include data retrieval, preprocessing, normalization,\nand classiﬁcation/health\
    \ status recognition.\nLi [30] designed the fog-based Smart and Real-time\nHealthcare\n\
    Information\nProcessing\n(SRHIP)\nsystem.\nSRHIP architecture has three layers.\
    \ IoT body sensor net-\nwork layer performs data collection (health, environment,\n\
    and locality), aggregation, compression, and encryption.\nFog processing and computation\
    \ layer use Spark and\nHadoop ecosystem for information extraction, data nor-\n\
    malization, rule engine, data ﬁltration, and data processing.\nThis layer performs\
    \ the classiﬁcation using the NB clas-\nsiﬁer. The cloud computation layer performs\
    \ in-depth data\nanalysis, storage, and decision-making. SRHIP minimizes\nthe\
    \ delay, transmission cost, and data size. This article uses\nhierarchical symmetric\
    \ key data encryption to increase\nconﬁdentiality.\nThe Improved Bayesian Convolution\
    \ Network (IBCN)\nwas proposed for human activity recognition [87]. The\nsystem\
    \ architecture includes Wi-Fi and clouds onboard\napplications. The combination\
    \ of a variable autoencoder\nwith a standard deep net classiﬁer is used to improve\
    \ the\nperformance of IBCN. This article used the convolution\nlayers to extract\
    \ the features and Enhanced Deep Learning\n(EDL) for security issues. IBCN provided\
    \ the ability to\ndownload data via traditional radio frequency or low-\npower\
    \ back-distribution communication. According to the\nexperimental analysis, the\
    \ proposed method allows the\nnetwork to be continuously improved as new training\
    \ sets\nare added and distinguishes between data-dependency and\nmodel-dependency.\
    \ This architecture has high accuracy,\nversatility, ﬂexibility, and reliability.\n\
    Sengupta and Bhunia [88] implemented a 3-layer IoT-\nenabled e-health framework\
    \ for secure real-time data\nmanagement using Cloudlet. The IoT layer uses IoT\
    \ Hub\nfor communicating with IoT devices. The Cloudlet layer is\nan intermediate\
    \ layer between the IoT and cloud layers.\nThis layer performs in-depth healthcare\
    \ data analytics and\nprocesses. The cloud layer performs various analytics\n\
    applications and processes queries. This framework uses\nSQLite for data storage\
    \ in IoT Hub and Cassandra for\nfuture storing of sensed data. The result demonstrated\
    \ that\nthis framework has high efﬁciency, low data transmission\ntime, low communication\
    \ energy, data-packet loss, and\nquery response time.\nIBDAM [133] is an Intelligent\
    \ BDA Model for efﬁcient\ncardiac disease prediction in the IoT using multi-level\n\
    fuzzy rules and valuable feature selection. This article used\nthe open-source\
    \ UCI database. First, it performs prepro-\ncessing on the UCI database, and the\
    \ next step uses multi-\nlevel fuzzy rule generation for feature selection. IBDAM\n\
    uses an optimized Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to\ntrain the features. Finally,\
    \ the features are classiﬁed into\nlabeled classes according to the risk of evaluation\
    \ by a\nmedical practitioner. The results of this article demonstrate\nthat this\
    \ architecture has high performance and is quick and\naccurate.\nAhmed et al.\
    \ [158] proposed an IoT-based health\nmonitoring framework for pandemic disease\
    \ analysis,\nprediction, and detection, such as COVID-19, using BDA.\nIn this\
    \ framework, the COVID-19 data set is collected from\ndifferent data sources.\
    \ Four data analysis techniques are\nperformed on these data, including descriptive,\
    \ diagnostic,\npredictive, and prescriptive. The experts opine on the\nresults,\
    \ and then users receive the results of these analyses\nthrough the internet and\
    \ cloud servers. This article uses a\nneural network-based model for diagnosing\
    \ and predicting\nthe pandemic. The results of this article indicated that the\n\
    accuracy, precision, F-score, and recall of the proposed\narchitecture are better\
    \ than AdaBoost, k-Nearest Neighbors\n(KNN), logistic regression, NB, and linear\
    \ Support Vector\nMachine (SVM).\nAhanger et al. [71] proposed an IoT-based healthcare\n\
    architecture for real-time COVID-19 data monitoring and\npredicting based on fog\
    \ and cloud computing. This archi-\ntecture has four layers. The data collection\

    \ four classes: health data,\nmeteorological data, location data, and environmental\
    \ data.\nThe COVID-19-mining and extraction layer is responsible\nfor splitting\
    \ information into two groups using a fuzzy\nC-means procedure in the fog layer.\

    \ for smart healthcare in IoT. This architecture\nhas two domains. The software-deﬁned\
    \ networking-based\nWSN and RFID technology are used in the vertical domain,\n\
    and data analytics tools, including Kafka, Spark, Mon-\ngoDB, and NodeJS, are\
    \ used in the horizontal domain. The\ncollected data from WSN using RFID transmit\
    \ to the Kafka\nplatform using TCP sockets. The Kafka sends data to three\nconsumers:\
    \ The Apache Spark analysis engine that ana-\nlyzes data in real-time; the NodeJS\
    \ web application that\nvisualizes patient data; and the MongoDB database that\n\
    stores data. This article uses logistic regression and Apache\nspark MLlib for\

    cities\nAccording to the United Nations forecasting, about 67%\nof the world population\
    \ will live in urban areas by 2050,\nresulting in environmental pollution, ecosystem\
    \ destruc-\ntion, energy shortage, emission reduction, and resource\nlimitation\
    \ [36, 174, 175]. Smart cities are large-scale dis-\ntributed systems that could\
    \ be a solution to overcoming\nthese problems and improving intelligent services\
    \ for res-\nidents [112, 176]. Smart cities have many implemented\nsensing devices\
    \ that generate large amounts of data. These\ndata must be stored, processed,\
    \ and analyzed to extract\nvaluable information [177]. BDM plays a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in\nthis context and facilitates better resource management and\ndecision-making\
    \ [176]. Many research focused on BDM\nmechanisms in IoT-based smart cities with\
    \ different\nobjectives, including improving monitoring and commu-\nnication,\
    \ real-time controlling, and increased quality attri-\nbutes (such as reliability,\
    \ throughput, energy conservation,\naccuracy,\nscalability,\ndelay,\nbandwidth\n\
    usage,\netc.).\nTherefore, this subsection examines the articles (14 arti-\ncles;\
    \ 22.22%) that have discussed the architectures or\nframeworks of BDM in IoT-based\
    \ smart cities.\nJindal et al. [85] propose a tensor-based big data pro-\ncessing\
    \ technique for energy consumption in smart cities.\nThis article aims to reduce\
    \ the dimensionality of data and\ndecrease the overall complexity. The proposed\
    \ framework\nhas two phases. The ﬁrst phase is the 3-layer data gathering\nand\
    \ processing architecture. The layers of this architecture\nare data acquisition,\
    \ transmission, and processing. In the\nsecond phase, the collected data was represented\
    \ in tensor\nform, and SVM was used to identify the loads to manage\nthe demand\
    \ response services in smart cities. The technique\nreduces data storage by 38%.\n\
    ESTemd [105] is a distributed stream processing mid-\ndleware framework for real-time\
    \ analysis using big data\ntechniques on Apache Kafka. The layers of this framework\n\
    are the data ingestion layer, the data broker layer (source),\nthe stream data\
    \ processing engine and services, the data\nbroker layer (sink), and the event\
    \ hub. The data broker\nlayer is responsible for data processing and transformation,\n\
    with the support of multiple transport protocols. The third\nlayer does stream\
    \ processing and consists of the predictive\ndata analytics model and Kafka CEP\
    \ operators. This\nframework helps with performance improvement through\ndata\n\
    integration\nand\ndistributed\napplications’\ninteroperability.\nCPSO [115] is\
    \ a self-adaptive preprocessing approach\nfor big data stream classiﬁcation. This\
    \ approach handles\nfour mechanisms: sub-window processing; feature extrac-\n\
    tion; feature selection; and optimization of the window size\nand feature picking.\
    \ CPSO uses clustering-based PSO for\ndata stream mining; the sliding window technique\
    \ for data\nsegmentation; statistical feature extraction for variable\npartitioning;\
    \ correlation feature selection, and information\ngain for feature selection.\
    \ The proposed approach improves\nits accuracy.\nRani and Chauhdary [72] proposed\
    \ a novel approach for\nsmart city applications based on BDA and a new protocol\n\
    for mobile IoT. They presented the 5-layer architecture\nwhere the layers are:\
    \ data source, technology, data man-\nagement, application, and utility programs.\
    \ The data source\nlayer collects, compresses, and ﬁlters data. The technology\n\
    layer is responsible for communication between sensor\nnodes, edge nodes, and\

    \ layers of this architecture are the small things\nlayer, the infrastructure\
    \ layer, the platform layer, and the\napplication layer. The ﬁrst layer collected\
    \ data by using the\nLoRa gateway from LoRa devices. The infrastructure layer\n\
    provides connectivity to devices by using the Internet. The\nplatform layer is\

    the Least Slack Time algorithm (LST), the divide-and-\nconquer approach for aggregation,\

    \ The API directs the published data streams\nfrom different sources. Ahab uses\
    \ the component, stream,\npolicy, and action repositories for storing data streams,\n\
    management policies, and actions. Ahab uses distributed\nmessaging for handling\

    \ components to\nchoose an appropriate communication point freely. The\nAhab architecture\
    \ has two layers: the streaming and service\nlayers. The streaming layer is implemented\
    \ as a lambda\narchitecture. This layer has three sub-layers for data stream\n\
    processing: the batch layer, the speed layer, and the serving\nlayer. The HDFS\
    \ and Apache Spark are used for data\nstoring and stream processing. The service\

    \ based on fog and cloud computing. The components\nof the proposed platform are\
    \ smart home components, IoT\nmanagement and integration services, fog computing\n\
    nodes, and cloud systems. The smart home component is\ndivided into three tiers.\
    \ The three tiers are: 1) the cyber-\nphysical tier is responsible for interacting\
    \ with the outside\nworld through the second tier; 2) the connectivity tier is\n\
    responsible for communicating with the smart home; and\n3) the context-aware tier\

    \ conﬁguration.\nThe IoT management and integration services component\nis\nin\n\
    charge\nof\nproviding\ninteroperability,\nhandling\nrequests, authentication,\
    \ and service registration. The fog\ncomputing nodes performed preprocessing,\
    \ pattern mining,\nevent detection, behavioral and predictive analytics, and\n\
    visualization functions. The cloud system is responsible for\nstoring and performing\

    \ layer\nperformed data cleaning and storing. The model’s smart\ncore is in the\
    \ analytics support layer, where Artiﬁcial\nNeural Network (ANN) and k-means clustering\
    \ are used\nfor identifying features in weather proﬁle patterns. The\nservice\
    \ layer is an interface between the proposed model\nand the smart building management\

    ture has eight layers: data monitoring, sourcing, ingestion,\nstorage,\nanalysis,\n\
    visualization,\ndecision-making,\nand\naction. People, processes, technology,\
    \ information, and\nfacility are the components of the metamodel phase. The\n\
    core component of the metamodel is people (IoT policy-\nmakers, developers, and\

    \ divide-and-conquer technique for data\naggregation, the Min–Max method for data\
    \ transformation,\nand the Kalman ﬁlter technique for data cleaning. The\nsecond\
    \ phase used Hadoop for big data processing, HDFS,\nHive, and Hbase for data storage,\

    \ data processing. The\nmain levels of this system are sensor, edge, and cloud\n\
    levels. This article has two purposes: reducing the required\nresources and the\
    \ volume of data before transfer to the\ncloud for storage. The collected data\
    \ is ﬁrst aggregated,\nﬁltered, and classiﬁed at the gateway level. This causes\
    \ a\nsaving in bandwidth and minimizes the network trafﬁc.\nThis approach used\
    \ semantic rules for data ﬁltering. It also\nemployed a complex event processing\
    \ module to analyze\ninput events and detect processing priority.\nWang et al.\

    \ uses GPRS/CDMA,\nwireless RFID, or Ethernet channels for communication\nand\
    \ data uploading in the data mining layer. The data\nmining layer utilizes the\
    \ ML method for data analysis. The\napplication layer is responsible for data\
    \ visualization based\non extracted information from the data mining layer. The\n\
    article also proposed a collaborative ﬁltering algorithm to\nimprove the prediction\

    \ The IoT\nlayer is responsible for IoT device installation and data\ncollection.\
    \ The fog computing layer reduces the latency of\napplication execution when predicting\
    \ the real-time ﬂood.\nThe data analysis layer received, stored, and analyzed\
    \ the\ncollected data. This layer used Singular Value Decompo-\nsition (SVD) for\
    \ data reduction and a K-mean clustering\nalgorithm to estimate the ﬂood situation\
    \ and rating. Also,\nHolt-Winter’s forecasting method is utilized to forecast\
    \ the\nﬂood. The last layer is the presentation layer, which gen-\nerates information\
    \ for decision-making. The results showed\nthe proposed architecture reduced latency,\

    \ using a\nlightweight lossless compression algorithm based on Dif-\nferential\
    \ Encoding (DE) and Huffman techniques. The\nsecond level is the edge gateway\
    \ level. This level is\nresponsible for processing, analyzing, ﬁltering, storing,\

    \ modeling phase has four\nstages: PCA model training, streaming anomaly detection,\n\
    contribution analysis, and alarm sequence analysis.\nKahveci et al. [183] proposed\
    \ a secure, interoperable,\nresilient, scalable, and real-time end-to-end BDA\
    \ platform\nfor IoT-based smart factories. The platform architecture\nhas ﬁve\
    \ layers and several components that perform data\ncollection, data integration,\
    \ data storing, data analytics, and\ndata visualization. The layers of architecture\
    \ are the control\nand sensing layer, the data collection layer, the data inte-\n\
    gration layer, the data storage and analytics layer, and the\ndata presentation\
    \ layer. All kinds of sensing and control\nactivities are performed in the ﬁrst\
    \ layer. The data collec-\ntion layer communicates with the ﬁrst layer through\
    \ a\nmulti-node client/server architecture. The data integration\nlayer uses the\
    \ RESTful application program interface to\ntransfer data collected to the data\
    \ storage layer. The data\nstorage layer uses InﬂuxDB for industrial metrics and\n\
    events. Using this architecture, production line perfor-\nmance is improved, bottlenecks\
    \ are identiﬁed, product\nquality is improved, and production costs are reduced.\n\
    Table 19 shows the result of the analysis of the articles.\nThis table shows the\
    \ architecture or framework name, OS\nname, programming language, advantages,\
    \ and disadvan-\ntages for each article. As you can see, layered architecture\n\
    is the most important, with 14 articles.\n3.2.2 BDM architectural/framework for\
    \ IoT paradigms\nAnother category presented in this article is BDM archi-\ntectures\
    \ and frameworks in two important IoT paradigms,\ni.e., Social Internet of Things\
    \ (SIoT) and Multiple Internet\nof Things (MIoT). SIoT is the integration of the\
    \ IoT with\nsocial networking that leads to improved scalability in\ninformation\
    \ and service discovery, trustworthy relation-\nships, security, performance,\
    \ and high network navigability\n[91, 184]. The SIoT establishes relationships\
    \ and interac-\ntions between human-to-human, human-to-object, and\nobject-to-object\
    \ social networks in which humans are\nconsidered intellectual and relational\
    \ objects [185, 186].\nThe types of relationships.\nbetween smart, complex, and\
    \ social objects in SIoT are\nparental object relationships, co-location object\
    \ relation-\nships, co-work object relationships, ownership object\nrelationships,\
    \ social object relationships, stranger object\nrelationships, guest object relationships,\
    \ sibling object\nrelationships, and service object relationships [187, 188].\n\
    A MIoT is a collection of connected things that are dif-\nferent kinds of relationships\
    \ and objects.\nIn contrast to SIoT, the number of relationships in MIoT\nis not\
    \ predeﬁned. Therefore, SIoT is a speciﬁc case of\nMIoT where the number of possible\
    \ relationship types is\nlimited [187]. The MIoT paradigm has advantages over\
    \ the\nIoT and SIoT. IoT can be divided into multiple networks of\ninterconnected\
    \ smart objects through MIoT. The MIOT can\nhandle situations where the same objects\
    \ behave differently\nin different networks and allows objects from various\n\
    networks to communicate without being directly connected\n[189]. Social objects\
    \ in the SIoT and MIoT can perform\ntasks, including physical condition detection,\
    \ data collec-\ntion, information exchange, big data processing and anal-\nysis,\
    \ and visualization for decision-making, predicting\nhuman behavior, and increasing\
    \ efﬁciency and scalability.\nDue to the heterogeneous nature of communication\
    \ and\nsocial networks, which generate high volume, multi-\nsource, dynamic, and\
    \ sparse data from SIoT and MIoT\nobjects, the BDA is a vital issue in these paradigms.\
    \ For\nBDA in SIoT and MIoT, a large amount of memory, power\nprocessing, and\
    \ bandwidth are required to store, deﬁne,\nprocess, predict, and assist humans\
    \ for a limited time\nWireless Networks (2023) 29:1085–1144\n1123\n123\nTable\

    [64, 91]. Different researchers have examined BDA in\nthese paradigms in various\
    \ ways.\nPaul et al. [91] proposed a system called SmartBuddy\nthat performs the\
    \ BDA for SIoT-based smart city data to\ndeﬁne real-time human dynamics. This\
    \ architecture has\nthree domains: the object domain, the SIoT server domain,\n\
    and the application domain. The object domain collects the\ndata and sends them\
    \ to the SIoT server for balancing,\nstoring, querying, processing, deﬁning, and\
    \ predicting\nhuman behavior. The application domain has four main\ncomponents:\
    \ security, cloud server, results in storage\ndevices, and data server. This domain\
    \ compilation is the\nresult of the SIoT server domain. This article uses\nMapReduce\
    \ programming for ofﬂine data analysis and\nApache Spark for real-time analysis.\
    \ SmartBuddy has high\nthroughput and applicability.\nHABC [52] is a Hadoop-based\
    \ architecture for social\nIoT big data feature selection and analysis. This architec-\n\
    ture has four layers: data collection, communication, fea-\nture selection and\
    \ processing, and service. The data\ncollection layer collected, registered, and\
    \ ﬁltered data. The\ncommunication layer provided end-to-end connectivity to\n\
    various devices and used the Kalman ﬁlter to remove noise.\nThe feature selection\
    \ and processing layer used MapRe-\nduce for data analysis and HDFS, HBSE, and\
    \ HIVE for\nmanipulation and storing. The Artiﬁcial Bee Colony (ABC)\nis used\
    \ for feature selection. The results indicate that the\narchitecture increases\
    \ throughput and accuracy and is more\nscalable.\nLakshmanaprabu et al. [64] proposed\
    \ a hierarchical\nframework for feature extraction in SIoT big data using the\n\
    MapReduce framework and a supervised classiﬁer model.\nThis framework has ﬁve\
    \ steps: SIoT data collection, ﬁl-\ntering, database reduction, feature selection,\
    \ and classiﬁ-\ncation. This article used the Gabor ﬁlter to reduce the noisy\n\
    data, Hadoop MapReduce for database reduction, Elephant\nHerd Optimization (EHO)\
    \ for feature selection, and a linear\nkernel SVM-based classiﬁer for data classiﬁcation.\
    \ The\nresult showed the proposed architecture has high maximum\naccuracy, speciﬁcity,\
    \ sensitivity, and throughput.\nSocio-cyber network [66] is the 4-layer architecture\
    \ that\nintegrates the social network with the technical network for\nanalyzing\
    \ human behavior using big data. This architecture\nuses the user’s geolocation\
    \ information to make friendships\nand graph theory to examine the trust index.\
    \ The data\ngeneration layer is responsible for data collection, aggre-\ngating,\
    \ registration, and ﬁltration. The communication\nlayer provides end-to-end connectivity\
    \ to various devices.\nThis layer creates a graph of data, and when new data are\n\
    added to the system, this graph is updated. The data storage\nand processing layer\
    \ perform the load balancing algorithm\nand graph processing. This layer uses\
    \ MapReduce for data\nprocessing, the Spark GraphX tool for real-time analysis,\n\
    and HDFS for data storage. This article uses the Knowl-\nedge Pyramid for knowledge\
    \ extraction. The service layer\nshows the result to users.\nShaji et al. [120]\
    \ presented a 5-phase approach for big\ndata classiﬁcation in SIoT. The phases\
    \ of this approach are\nthe data acquisition phase, data ﬁltering phase, reduction\n\
    phase, feature selection phase, and classiﬁcation phase.\nThis article uses an\
    \ adaptive Savitzky–Golay ﬁlter for ﬁl-\ntering and eliminating noisy data; the\
    \ Hadoop MapReduce\nframework for data reduction; a modiﬁed relief technique\n\
    for optimal feature selection; and a deep neural network-\nbased marine predator\
    \ algorithm for classiﬁcation. This\narticle has high accuracy, precision, speciﬁcity,\
    \ sensitivity,\nthroughput, and low energy consumption.\nFloris et al. [67] proposed\
    \ a 4-layer architecture based\non SIoT to deploy a full-stack smart parking solution.\
    \ The\nlayers of this architecture are the hardware layer, virtual-\nization layer,\
    \ aggregation layer, and application layer. The\nhardware layer collected data\
    \ and consisted of a vehicle\ndetection board, Bluetooth beacon, data transmission\n\
    board, and concentrator. The SIoT paradigm is implements\nin the virtualization\
    \ layer using device virtualization. ML\nalgorithms are implemented in the aggregation\
    \ layer for\ndata aggregation and data processing. The application layer\nincludes\
    \ the management platform that supports the control\ndashboard for smart parking\
    \ management and the Android\nApp for the citizens.\nCauteruccio et al. [166]\
    \ presented a framework for\nanomaly detection and classiﬁcation in MIoT scenarios.\n\
    This framework investigated two problems: the anomaly\neffects analysis on the\
    \ MIoT and the source of the anomaly\ndetection. The anomalies in MIoT are divided\
    \ into three\ncategories: presence anomalies versus success anomalies,\nhard\n\
    anomalies\nversus\nsoft\nanomalies,\nand\ncontact\nanomalies versus content anomalies.\n\
    Lo Giudice et al. [189] proposed a deﬁnition of a thing’s\nproﬁle and topic-guided\
    \ virtual IoT. The proﬁle of a thing\nhas two components: a content-based component\
    \ (past\nbehavior) and a collaborative ﬁltering component (princi-\npal characteristics\
    \ of those things it has previously inter-\nacted with the most). This article\
    \ uses a supervised and\nunsupervised approach to build topic-guided virtual IoTs\
    \ in\na MIoT scenario. Table 20 shows the result of the analysis\nof the articles.\
    \ The architecture or framework name, the OS\nname, programming language, advantages,\

    Wireless Networks (2023) 29:1085–1144\n1127\n123\nnon-functional attributes. This\
    \ section considers the quality\nattributes of the selected articles. Quality\
    \ attributes indicate\nthe system’s characteristics, operating conditions, and\n\
    constraints. There are different software quality models,\nsuch as McCall [190],\
    \ Bohem [191], ISO/IEC9126, and\nFURPS [192]. As far as we know, no systematic\
    \ article has\ncompletely categorized articles based on qualitative char-\nacteristics.\
    \ Therefore, this paper categorized the selected\narticles based on 18 qualitative\
    \ attributes presented in\nTable 21. In this table, the ﬁrst column shows the\
    \ names of\nthese 18 quality attributes. The reviewed articles used these\nquality\
    \ attributes to show the characteristics, quality attri-\nbute analysis, and performance\
    \ analysis of the proposed\napproaches, architectures, and frameworks and comparison\n\
    with other works. Performance attributes have been ana-\nlyzed in different articles\
    \ based on different criteria. The\nreviewed articles utilized 12 quality attributes\
    \ for perfor-\nmance attribute analysis. These quality attributes are load\nbalancing,\
    \ energy conservation, network lifetime, pro-\ncessing/execution time, response\
    \ time, delay, CPU usage,\nmemory usage, bandwidth usage, throughput, latency,\
    \ and\nconcurrency. In Table 21, ; indicates the reduction of that\nquality characteristic\
    \ and : indicates the increase of that\nquality\ncharacteristic.\nThe\nsecond\n\
    column\nin\nthis\ntable shows the articles that have used these features. The\n\
    performance, efﬁciency, accuracy, and scalability attributes\nare the most critical\
    \ quality attributes, with 79, 62, 58, and\n47 articles, respectively. From another\
    \ point of view, the\nreference model of standard software quality attributes,\
    \ i.e.,\nISO 25010, has been used to classify articles based on\nquality attributes.\
    \ Table 22 shows the articles’ classiﬁca-\ntion according to this standard. In\
    \ the following, some\nquality attributes and their importance will be deﬁned.\n\
    –\nPerformance: Performance refers to the ability of BDM\ntechniques in the IoT\
    \ to provide results and services\nwith high load balancing, energy conservation,\
    \ through-\nput, concurrency, low processing/execution time, delay,\nCPU/memory/\
    \ bandwidth usage, and latency.\n–\nFeasibility: Feasibility refers to the ability\
    \ to perform\nsuccessfully or study the current mode of operation,\nevaluate alternatives,\
    \ and develop BDM techniques in\nthe IoT.\n–\nScalability: Scalability refers\
    \ to the ability of BDM\ntechniques in the IoT to exploit increasing computing\n\
    resources effectively to maintain service quality when\nthe real data volumes\
    \ increase. BDM techniques in IoT\nmust be scalable in performance and data storage.\
    \ Some\nmethods and advanced systems are used to improve the\nscalability of big\
    \ data analysis, like parallel implemen-\ntation, HPC systems, and clouds [193].\n\
    –\nAccuracy: Accuracy refers to the ability to describe\ndata and represent a\
    \ real-world object or event correctly\n[194]. In the reviewed articles, various\
    \ deﬁnitions of\naccuracy are provided, including clustering accuracy,\nclassiﬁcation\
    \ accuracy, the accuracy of features select-\ning/extracting, and the accuracy\
    \ of the prediction\nmodel. Each of these cases is evaluated in different\nways.\n\
    –\nEfﬁciency: Efﬁciency refers to BDM techniques in IoT\nwith minimum energy and\
    \ response time and high\nthroughput, accuracy, and performance.\n–\nReliability:\
    \ Reliability refers to the ability of BDM\ntechniques in the IoT to apply the\
    \ speciﬁed functions\nunder speciﬁed conditions and within the expected\nduration.\n\
    –\nAvailability: The main goal of many researchers is the\navailability of information\
    \ and their analysis from\nheterogeneous data sources. Availability is one of\
    \ the\ncomponents of service trust and is part of reliability.\n–\nInteroperability:\
    \ Interoperability refers to the ability to\ninterconnect and communicate among\
    \ smart objects,\nheterogeneous IoT devices, and different operating\nsystems.\
    \ Low-cost device interoperability is a vital\nissue in IoT [53, 54, 195].\n–\n\
    Flexibility: Flexibility refers to the capacity of BDM\ntechniques in the IoT\
    \ to be adapted for different\nenvironments and situations to face external changes\n\
    [196].\n–\nRobustness: Robustness refers to a stable BDM system\nin the IoT that\
    \ can function despite erroneous, excep-\ntional, or unexpected inputs and unexpected\
    \ events.\n3.4 Big data analytics types in IoT\nThere are different types of analytics.\
    \ This study uses\nGartner’s classiﬁcation,2 which includes four types of\nanalysis:\
    \ descriptive analysis (‘‘what happened?’’), diag-\nnostic analysis (‘‘why did\
    \ it happen?’’), predictive analysis\n(‘‘What could happen?’’), and prescriptive\
    \ analysis (‘‘What\nshould we do?’’). In descriptive analytics, historical busi-\n\
    ness data is analyzed to describe what happened in the past.\nDiagnostic analytics\
    \ investigates and identiﬁes the causes\nof trends and why they occurred. The\
    \ goal of predictive\nanalytics is to forecast the future using a variety of statis-\n\
    tical and ML techniques. Prescriptive analytics proposes\nthe best action to take\
    \ to accomplish a business’s objective\nusing the data collected from descriptive\
    \ and predictive\nanalytics for decision-making based on future situations\n[197].\n\
    This paper investigates the applied methods for data\nanalysis and categorizes\
    \ them based on the type of analysis\nthese methods provide. Organizations need\
    \ statistics, AI,\n2 http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/predictive-analytics/.\n\

    \ etc.,\nfor BDA and to evaluate the data [198]. The articles used\nML algorithms\
    \ to perform various analyses in the steps of\nBDA. ML algorithm is an appropriate\
    \ approach or tool for\nBDA; decision-making; meaningful, precise, and valuable\n\
    information extraction; and detecting hidden patterns in big\ndatasets [199, 200].\
    \ Utilizing the ML algorithms in BDA\nhas advantages such as improving and optimizing\
    \ BDM\nprocesses; heterogeneous big data analysis; sustainability;\nfault detection,\
    \ prediction, and prevention; accurate and\nreliable real-time processing; resource\
    \ management and\nreduction; and increased quality prediction, visual inspec-\n\
    tion, and productivity in IoT applications [83, 201]. These\nalgorithms are divided\
    \ into four types: supervised, semi-\nsupervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement\
    \ ML algo-\nrithms [53, 202]. Table 23 shows the categorization of\narticles based\
    \ on BDA types. The most common tactics\nthat the selected articles use for BDM\
    \ in the IoT include\nclassiﬁcation (51 articles), simulation (38 articles), opti-\n\
    mization (30 articles), and clustering (25 articles).\nThe reason for using more\
    \ classiﬁcation algorithms is\nthat they help to categorize unstructured and high-volume\n\
    data. Therefore, BDM in the IoT is faster and more efﬁ-\ncient. Before classiﬁcation\
    \ begins, it must optimize the\nclassiﬁcation algorithm’s inputs. Data reduction\
    \ strategies\nextract optimal and required data from a large amount of\ndata.\
    \ These strategies include dimensionality reduction,\nnumerosity\nreduction,\n\
    and\ndata\ncompression.\nSome\nreviewed articles used Principal Components Analysis\n\
    (PCA) to standardize, reduce the data redundancy and\ndimensionality, reduce the\
    \ cost and processing time, and\nmaintain the original data [69, 114, 118, 135,\
    \ 136]. Also,\nthe authors in [160] used the fuzzy C-means algorithm to\nreduce\
    \ the amount of data. Feature selection methods\nimprove classiﬁcation accuracy\
    \ and reduce the number of\nfeatures in BDA. The collected data from IoT applications\n\
    and monitoring systems are usually anomalous, and it is\ndifﬁcult to distinguish\
    \ between the original data and the\nanomaly [201]. The anomaly and outlier data\
    \ reduce the\naccuracy of the classiﬁcation and prediction models. For\ninstance,\
    \ NRDD-DBSCAN [114], DBSCAN-based outlier\ndetection\n[83],\nGA,\nand\nOne-Class\n\
    Support\nTucker\nMachine (OCSTuM) [122, 124] are some of the high-ro-\nbust,\n\
    high-performance,\nand\nanti-noisy\nmethods\nfor\nanomaly detection that are presented\
    \ in reviewed articles.\nSVM is the most common method based on classiﬁca-\ntion\
    \ (10 articles) for BDM in the IoT in supervised clas-\nsiﬁcation. SVM is a non-parametric,\
    \ memory-efﬁcient,\nerror-reduction classiﬁcation method that performs well in\n\
    theoretical analysis and real-world applications. It can\nmodel non-linear, complex,\
    \ and real-world problems in\nhigh-dimensional feature space [2, 69, 203]. However,\n\
    SVM is difﬁcult to interpret, has a high computational cost,\nTable 22 Classiﬁcation\

    \ issues and challenge\nThis section offers a variety of vital issues and challenges\n\
    that require future work. IoT faces many challenges and\nopen\nissues,\nincluding\n\
    security,\nprivacy,\nhardware,\nheterogeneity, data analysis, and virtualization\
    \ challenges.\nIoT devices produce big data that must be monitored and\nmanaged\
    \ using particular data patterns. For efﬁcient deci-\nsion-making, BDA in the\
    \ IoT is applied to large datasets to\nreveal unseen patterns and correlations.\
    \ So the key chal-\nlenge in big data in the IoT is analyzing that data for\n\
    knowledge discovery and virtualization. Various types of\nresearch have presented\
    \ different categories for challenges\nand open issues for BDM in the IoT. Romero\
    \ et al. [212]\ndivided challenges into principal worries, security and\nmonitoring,\
    \ technological development, standardization,\nand privacy. Santana et al. [213]\
    \ divided challenges into\nprivacy, data management, heterogeneity, energy man-\n\
    agement, communication, scalability, security, lack of\ntestbed, city models,\
    \ and platform maintenance. Ahmed\net al. [27] divided challenges into four categories:\
    \ diversity,\nsecurity, data provenance, data management, and data\ngovernance\
    \ and regulation. This study divides challenges\ninto BDM in the IoT and quality\
    \ attributes challenges.\n4.1 Big data management in the IoT challenges\nIn many\
    \ reviewed articles, IoT big data management\ndepends on centralized centers,\
    \ including cloud-based\nservers, and has technical limitations. These architectures\n\
    are platform-centric and have costly customized access\nmechanisms. A centralized\
    \ architecture can have a single\npoint of failure, which is very inefﬁcient in\
    \ terms of\nscalability and reliability. Also, in these architectures,\nunauthorized\
    \ access to the server might easily result in the\nmodiﬁcation, leak, or manipulation\
    \ of critical data [215]. In\nsome research, authors used blockchain technology\
    \ to\novercome these problems [215, 216]. But this technology\nhas some challenges.\
    \ For example, blockchain platforms\ncan consume IoT devices’ computational resources\
    \ exten-\nsively. During the review in Sect. 3.1, the process of BDM\nin the IoT\
    \ includes data collection, communication, data\ningestion, data storage, processing\
    \ and analysis, and post-\nprocessing, each of which faces a variety of challenges\
    \ and\nproblems. This section examines the challenges involved in\neach of these\
    \ steps.\n4.1.1 Data collection\nBig data in the IoT is generated from different,\
    \ distributed,\nand\nmultisource\nheterogeneous\nunsupervised\ndomain\n[217, 218].\
    \ Collecting this large amount of diverse data\nfaces challenges such as energy\
    \ consumption, limited\nbattery life in sensors and other data collection devices,\n\
    different hardware and operating systems, multiple and\ndisparate resources, and\
    \ combining them. It can be difﬁcult\nto obtain complete, accurate, and maintain\
    \ quality data. IoT\nand WSN encompass a large number of distributed mobile\n\
    nodes. Mobile nodes [219] must increase the amount of\ndata collected while minimizing\
    \ the power consumption of\nboth the mobile node and IoT devices. Therefore, the\
    \ main\nchallenge is mobile data collection management, deter-\nmining and planning\
    \ mobile sink trajectories for collecting\ndata from nodes. Most existing mobile\
    \ data collection\napproaches are static and only ﬁnd a solution for a scenario\n\
    with ﬁxed parameters [220]. These solutions do not con-\nsider the change in the\
    \ amount of data generated by the IoT\nnodes or devices when an IoT device can\
    \ move from one\nsituation to another. For future work, we propose using AI\n\
    techniques, including ML or deep learning, for intelligent\nmanagement of mobile\
    \ data collection.\n4.1.2 Communication\nTransferring data from different sources\
    \ to the data pro-\ncessing and analysis stage is one of the steps in BDM in the\n\
    IoT. Communication protocols and technologies must\nshare data at high speeds\
    \ and on time. The connectivity\nchallenges include interoperability, bandwidth,\
    \ reducing\ntrafﬁc, energy consumption, security, network, transport\nprotocols,\
    \ delivery of services, network congestion, and\ncommunication cost. Another connectivity\
    \ challenge is\nnodes accessing other nodes’ information under different\nnetwork\
    \ topologies with different channel fading [221].\nConcerning advances in mobile\
    \ information infrastructure,\nintegration\nof\nthe\n6G\ntechnologies,\nmobile\n\
    satellite\n1134\nWireless Networks (2023) 29:1085–1144\n123\ncommunications, and\
    \ AI can increase frequency band,\nnetwork speed, and network coverage and improve\
    \ the\nnumber of connections [222]. Different approaches are\nproposed for data\
    \ transmission optimizing and overcoming\nthese limitations, such as parsimonious/compressive\
    \ sens-\ning [223, 224]. Compressive sensing technology is a theory\nof acquiring\
    \ and compressing signals that use the sparsity\nbehavior of natural signals at\
    \ the sensing stage to minimize\npower consummation and data dimensionality reduction\n\
    [225]. In compressive sensing technology, the collected\ndata from different sensors\
    \ are ﬁrst compressed and then\ntransmitted. Therefore, the complexity is transferred\
    \ to the\nreceiver side from the sensors, which are usually resource-\nconstrained\
    \ and self-powered [226]. For future work, we\npropose combining compressive sensing\
    \ with AI tech-\nnologies to present a lightweight, real-time, and dynamic\ncompressive\
    \ sensing method for overcoming the commu-\nnication challenges in BDM in the\
    \ IoT.\n4.1.3 Data ingestion\nBig data in the IoT have various features such as:\
    \ enor-\nmous, high-speed, heterogeneity of data formats, com-\nplexity, different\
    \ data resolutions, abnormal and incorrect,\nambiguity, unbalanced, massive redundancy,\
    \ multidimen-\nsional, granularity, continuously, inconsistencies, proba-\nbilistic,\
    \ sparse, sequential, dynamical, timeliness, non-\nrandomly\ndistributed,\nand\n\
    misplaced\n[56, 63, 89, 117, 119, 125, 135, 137, 173, 227]. Each data\ningestion\
    \ step discussed in Sect. 3.1.3 has challenges.\nThese issues are anomaly detection,\
    \ missing data, outlier\ndetection,\nfeature\nselection/extraction,\ndimensionality\n\
    reduction, redundancy, standardization, rule discovery,\ncomputational\ncost,\n\
    and\nnormalization\nthat\ndifferent\nmechanisms use for these challenges. Missing\
    \ data could\nlead to the loss of a large amount of valuable and reliable\ninformation\
    \ and bad decision-making. Many articles utilize\nthe delete, ignore, mean/median\
    \ value, or constant global\nmethods for handling missing data. These dangerous\n\
    methods may yield biased and untrustworthy results [228].\nTherefore, adding new\
    \ techniques by considering more\nefﬁciency, high accuracy, minimal computational\
    \ com-\nplexity, and less time consumption is interesting in the\nfuture. For\
    \ this purpose, we can use ML and nature-in-\nspired optimization algorithms or\
    \ a combination thereof.\nThe parallel technology has made data ingestion and\
    \ pro-\ncessing more efﬁcient in recent years, and it saves space\nand time by\
    \ eliminating the need to decompress data [229].\nAlso, BDA types in the IoT are\
    \ used in this stage, which is\ndiscussed in Sect. 3.4. Each of these methods\
    \ has chal-\nlenges. For example, clustering has challenges such as real-\ntime\
    \ clustering, local optima, determining the number of\nclusters, updating the\
    \ clustering centers, and determining\nthe initial clustering centers. ANN faces\
    \ many issues,\nincluding how to determine the number of layers, the\ntraining,\
    \ and test samples, the number of nodes, choosing\nan operable objective function,\
    \ and how to improve the\ntraining speed of the network in a big data environment.\n\
    Various articles solve these problems using meta-heuristic\nalgorithms. However,\
    \ these algorithms cannot handle big\nIoT data sets within the speciﬁed time due\
    \ to high com-\nputation costs, limited memory, and processing units, and\npremature\
    \ convergence [145, 230]. For future work, we\npropose using new optimization\
    \ meta-heuristic algorithms\nand AI methods based on these techniques by utilizing\
    \ the\nstrengths of MapReduce and Apache Spark.\n4.1.4 Data storage\nData storage\
    \ is another major challenge in BDM in the IoT.\nThe big data storage mechanisms\
    \ in the IoT were discussed\nin Sect. 3.1.4. The challenges in this regard can\
    \ be cate-\ngorized as IoT-based big data storage systems in cloud\ncomputing\
    \ and complex environments such as industry 4.0\napplications and data storage\
    \ architecture. The main data\nstorage challenges are IoT data replication and\
    \ consistency\nmanagement. Many researchers have proposed strategies\nfor determining\
    \ the best location for copy storage in geo-\ndistributed storage systems based\
    \ on cloud and fog com-\nputing. But many of them, due to the geographical distance\n\
    between distributed storage systems, cannot handle the\nproblems of high data\
    \ access latencies and replica syn-\nchronization costs [231]. Also, data consistency\
    \ manage-\nment strategies must manage the massive amounts of data\nwith different\
    \ data consistency requirements and system\nheterogeneity.\n4.1.5 Processing and\
    \ analysis\nThe big data processing and analysis in BDM in the IoT\nhas different\
    \ challenges, including task scheduling, real-\ntime data analysis, developing\
    \ the IoT data analysis\ninfrastructure, data management in the cloud-IoT envi-\n\
    ronments, and query optimization. The authors used data\nmining and AI algorithms\
    \ to overcome these challenges.\nThe challenges of using AI technologies for data\
    \ analytics\nin the IoT are to balance the computational costs (or\nresponse time)\
    \ and improve the accuracy of the prediction\nand analysis results [232]. Also,\
    \ many multi-objective\noptimization problems have more than three objective\n\
    functions, which present challenges, including the diversity\nand convergence\
    \ speed of the algorithm [152]. However,\ndetermining an algorithm to process\
    \ a dynamic IoT dataset\nbased on some application-speciﬁc goals for better accu-\n\
    racy remains a challenge. Also, most current methods\ncannot meet user demands\
    \ for the fundamental features of\nWireless Networks (2023) 29:1085–1144\n1135\n\
    123\ncloud-IoT environments, including heterogeneity, dyna-\nmism, reliability,\
    \ ﬂexibility, responsiveness, and elasticity.\nFor future work, we propose studies\
    \ of various optimiza-\ntion algorithms, including metaheuristic algorithms (many-\n\
    objective) and ML algorithms, and combined versions of\nthese algorithms for big\
    \ data processing and analysis in the\nIoT. Regarding the limitations of wireless\
    \ nodes (low\npower and computational) and cloud servers (high latency,\nprivacy,\
    \ performance bottleneck, context unawareness,\netc.) for processing and analysis\
    \ computing tasks, using\nmobile edge or fog computing to overcome these problems\n\
    is helpful.\n4.1.6 Post-processing\nProviding insight from processed and analyzed\
    \ data in the\nIoT requires selecting appropriate visualization techniques.\n\
    Most of the reviewed methods use simulator tools such as\nCloudSim [143, 173],\
    \ TRNSYS [131], Cooja [82], and\nExtend-Sim [8] for evaluation. Additional studies\
    \ are\nneeded to evaluate the mentioned approaches in real-world\nsystems and\
    \ datasets.\n4.2 QoS management\nQoS is one of the critical factors in BDM in\
    \ the IoT and\nneeds research, management, and optimization (discussed\nin Sect.\
    \ 3.3). The reviewed articles used these parameters\nand metrics for evaluation.\
    \ No article considers these\nparameters\nthoroughly\nfor\nits\nproposed\narchitecture.\n\
    Therefore, it is exciting to compare various architectures\nby considering the\
    \ different QoS parameters and quality\nattributes in the future. Security, privacy,\
    \ and trust are\ncritical issues in IoT BDA that most reviewed articles did\n\
    not address, and the proposed architectures or frameworks\ndid not involve the\
    \ data perception layer. The security\nframe\ngenerally\nconsists\nof\nconﬁdentiality,\n\
    integrity,\nauthentication, non-repudiation, availability, and privacy\n[233].\
    \ We concede that no comprehensive and highly\nsecure scheme or platform for all\
    \ types of data collection,\nanalysis, and sharing meets all security requirements.\
    \ The\nother main challenges are integrating privacy protection\nmethods with\
    \ data sharing platforms and selecting the best\nprivacy protection algorithms\
    \ to use during data processing\n[172]. Therefore, it is suggested for the future\
    \ to utilize\ncryptographic mechanisms in different layers of architec-\ntures\
    \ or frameworks, add a data perception layer, and\ndevelop security protocols\
    \ speciﬁcally for IoT devices\nbecause of their heterogeneity and resource limitations.\n\
    The blockchain framework is widely used in IoT to\nimprove protection, trust,\
    \ reputation, management, control,\nand security. The blockchain framework provides\
    \ decen-\ntralized security, authentication rules, and privacy for IoT\ndevices.\
    \ However, there are major challenges, such as high\nenergy consumption, delay,\
    \ and computational overhead,\nbecause of the resource constraints in IoT devices.\
    \ Many\ntypes of research have been suggested as solutions to these\nproblems.\
    \ For instance, Corradini et al. [234] proposed a\ntwo-tier Blockchain framework\
    \ for increasing the security\nand autonomy of smart objects in the IoT by implementing\n\
    a trust-based protection mechanism. The tiers of this\nframework are a point-to-point\
    \ local tier and a community-\noriented global tier. Pincheira et al. [235] proposed\
    \ a cost-\neffective blockchain-based architecture for ensuring data\nintegrity,\
    \ auditability, and traceability and increasing trust\nand trustworthiness in\
    \ IoT devices. This architecture has\nfour components: the cloud module, mobile\
    \ app, connected\ntool, and blockchain module. Tchagna Kouanou et al. [236]\n\
    proposed a 4-layer blockchain-based architecture to secure\ndata in the IoT to\
    \ increase security, integrity, scalability,\nﬂexibility, and throughput. The\
    \ layers of this architecture\nare tokens, smart contracts, blockchain, and peers.\
    \ In future\nresearch, we suggest using AI techniques and a lightweight\nblockchain\
    \ framework to increase protection, trust, repu-\ntation, and security in the\
    \ IoT.\nTrust and reputation management are vital issues in the\nSIoT and MIoT\
    \ scenarios. In [237], the authors deﬁned\ntrust and reputation in the MIoT as\
    \ the trust of an instance\nin another one of the same IoT; the trust of an object\
    \ in\nanother one of the MIoT; the reputation of an instance in an\nIoT; the reputation\
    \ of an object in a MIoT; the reputation of\nan IoT in a MIoT; the trust of an\
    \ IoT in another IoT; and\nthe trust of an object in an IoT. Security in the SIoT\
    \ aims to\ndifferentiate between secure and malicious things and\nincrease the\
    \ safety and protection of SIoT networks [185].\nInvestigating trust and reputation\
    \ in SIoT and MIoT has\nmany beneﬁts, such as identifying, isolating, managing\n\
    malicious objects, supporting collaboration, and identifying\nand evaluating the\
    \ objects’ QoS parameters. Also, the lack\nof trust and reputation management\
    \ in SIoT and MIoT\ncauses problems such as loss of accessibility, privacy, and\n\
    security [237]. To overcome these issues, we suggest uti-\nlizing trust and reputation\
    \ with AI methods to develop\ndetection techniques for anomalous and malicious\
    \ behav-\niors of things in the MIoT and SIoT in future works.\n5 Conclusion\n\
    This paper presented a systematic review of the BDM\nmechanisms in the IoT. First,\
    \ we discussed the advantages\nand disadvantages of some systematic and review\
    \ articles\nabout BDM in the IoT and then explained the purpose of\nthis paper.\
    \ Then, the research methodology and details of\n110 selected articles were presented.\
    \ These articles were\ndivided\ninto\nfour\nmain\ncategories,\nincluding\nBDM\n\
    1136\nWireless Networks (2023) 29:1085–1144\n123\nprocesses, big BDM architectures/frameworks,\
    \ quality\nattributes, and data analytics types in IoT. Some of these\ncategories\
    \ have been divided into some subcategories:\nBDM process in IoT was divided into\
    \ data collection,\ncommunication, data ingestion, data storage, processing\n\
    and analysis, and post-processing; big data architectures/\nframeworks in the\
    \ IoT were divided into BDM architec-\ntures/frameworks in the IoT-based applications\
    \ and BDM\narchitectures/frameworks in the IoT paradigms; big data\nanalytics-types\
    \ were divided into the descriptive, diag-\nnostic, predictive, and prescriptive\
    \ analysis; and big data\nstorage systems in the IoT were divided into relational\n\
    databases, NoSQL databases, DFS, and cloud/edge/fog/\nmist storage. Also, the\
    \ advantages and disadvantages of\neach of the BDM mechanisms in the IoT were\
    \ discussed.\nThe tools and platforms used for BDM in the IoT in the\narticles\
    \ were reviewed and compared based on criteria. The\nmost common type of analysis\
    \ that articles use is predictive\nanalysis, with 57.27%, which uses ML algorithms.\
    \ The\nclassiﬁcation, optimization, and clustering algorithms are\nthe most widely\
    \ used for big data analysis in the IoT. Some\narticles present architectures\
    \ mostly in IoT-based health-\ncare, with 33.33%, and IoT-based smart cities,\
    \ with\n22.22%. These architectures have two to eight layers, each\nperforming\
    \ a set of functions. In the review of qualitative\ncharacteristics, we observed\
    \ that most articles evaluated\ntheir evaluations based on criteria, including\
    \ performance,\nefﬁciency, accuracy, and scalability. Meanwhile, some\nfeatures\
    \ are less used, including conﬁdentiality, sustain-\nability, accessibility, portability,\
    \ generality, and maintain-\nability. The NoSQL database and DFS are used more\
    \ to\nstore data than other databases. The BDM process in the\nIoT uses different\
    \ algorithms and tools with various fea-\ntures. Various programming languages\
    \ and operating sys-\ntems are used to evaluate and implement the proposed\nmechanisms.\
    \ The Java and python programming languages\nand the UBUNTU operating system are\
    \ used more.\nThis paper tries to review the BDM mechanisms in the\nIoT. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ it considers studies published in high-\nquality international journals. The\
    \ most recent works on\nBDM mechanisms in the IoT have been compared and\nanalyzed\
    \ in this paper. We hope that this study will be\nhelpful for the next generation\
    \ of studies for developing\nBDM mechanisms in real-complex environments.\nReferences\n\

    Abstract: Precision agriculture is a breakthrough in digital farming technology,
    which facilitates the appli-

    cation of precise and exact amount of input level of water and fertilizer to the
    crop at the required time for

    increasing the yield. Since agriculture relies on direct rainfall than irrigation
    and the prediction of rainfall

    date is easily available from web source, the integration of rainfall prediction
    with precision agriculture

    helps to regulate the water consumption in farms. In this work, an edge computing
    model is developed for

    predicting soil moisture in real time and managing the water usage in accordance
    with rain prediction. A

    soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) has been developed that revolves
    around the decision-

    making techniques with live environmental parameters including weather parameters
    for the prediction of

    soil moisture through the impact of precipitation. Numerous algorithms with the
    combination of regression

    + clustering are estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost + k-means outperforms
    other algorithmic com-

    binations that is deployed in edge model. This model is used as an intermediary
    between the end IoT

    devices and cloud that results in the saving of computationally intensive processing
    performed on cloud

    servers. The servers located on a local edge network perform the developed algorithmic
    computations.

    Avoiding transmission over the cloud results in signiﬁcant latency, response time,
    and computation power

    savings and therefore increases the eﬃciency of data transfer. The proposed edge
    computing model is

    implemented in Raspberry Pi as an edge, Heroku as cloud, and edge nodes as the
    combination of Pi with

    actuators and sensors. The monitored data from Pi are stored in MongoDB webserver
    that is controlled by

    Web dashboard. Finally, the developed model is implemented in cloud and edge where
    the edge server

    implementation performs better in terms of latency, bandwidth, throughput, response
    time, and CPU

    memory usage.

    1 Introduction

    It is evident that agriculture always has a specialized role in the anthrophonic
    evolution and has been

    serving as an important economic factor for the growth of a country [1]. Around
    58% of the population

    depend on agriculture as the chief source of livelihood in India. The quality
    and productivity of agricultural

    products have declined over these years as several factors have inﬂuenced the
    crop productivity both

    directly and indirectly. Some major factors that aﬀect the crop production are
    climatic changes, global

    warming, and water scarcity [2]. The agricultural land’s productivity is aﬀected
    by the direct and indirect

    changes in climate [3,4]. The crop growth has been already aﬀected by the changes
    in climate incurred by

    global warming. The nutrition quality of soil, ground water level, sea, and ocean
    are aﬀected by the

    modiﬁcations in average temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather conditions
    such as hail storms, dust

    storms, heatwaves, etc. due to global warming [5,6]. Degradation of soil is primarily
    created by various

    methods including 93.7% by water erosion, 9.5% by wind erosion, 5.9% by salinity
    and alkalinity, etc.

    Further changes in climate would inﬂuence adversely the crop production [7]. Since
    water is an indispen-

    sable requirement for plants and cultivation, the high level of soil is eroded
    and thereby the fertility is also

    declined. Due to the ever-changing climate, water scarcity has become a huge problem.
    Drought-like

    conditions is already formed in several areas and thereby the present and conventional
    farming practices

    are not suitable. New and unique environment preserving techniques are the need
    of the hour [8].

    The conventional approaches in agriculture are enhanced by the advent of several
    advancements in

    technology [9]. These new improved methodologies ensure optimized utilization
    of resources, accurate

    forecast of water needs and environmental parameters, reduction of human intervention,
    etc. [10]. Conse-

    quently, the outcomes of crops in terms of yield and quality are higher with cost-eﬀective
    methods. One

    such booming technology is the Internet of things (IoT) [11].

    IoT is the collection of components embedded in the sensor for measuring and transferring
    data via

    network devices as sensed from pumps and tractors to weather stations. Primarily,
    IoT deals with the

    transmission and reception of data related to farms through devices using the
    Internet for prediction

    and providing decisions to the farmers. IoT-based methodologies has brought a
    changeover in agricultural

    patterns and farming approaches [12]. IoT devices can gather information about
    soil moisture, chemical

    properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather details in real time. The
    information acquired from IoT

    devices facilitates the farmers in tracking farms periodically. Farmers can save
    time and money by

    responding faster to farm conditions. Cloud computing models integrated with on-ﬁeld
    agricultural sensors

    need to be incorporated for tackling the issue of processing huge voluminous data.

    One of the major challenges of IoT is the processing of huge datasets in a sequential
    way. Some of the

    key factors that need to be focused on this process are as follows: information
    about the type and nature of

    data, the way of acquiring the data, etc. The preliminary stage comprises acquiring
    the data and ingesting

    the data to the system. Substantial cognizance of data are achieved as the data
    pass through all the

    gateways where it is cleansed and transformed before entering into the system.
    In the near future, dynamic

    prediction of soil moisture and precipitation techniques are to be developed for
    smart irrigation systems.

    Therefore, a system is developed for eﬃcient and optimal utilization of fresh
    water in irrigation along with

    drip irrigation system. It aids in ﬁnding which one of the plants fails to get
    suﬃcient water. When the water

    supply is provided the next day, this delay should not disturb the system. It
    becomes important for the

    farmers to understand the optimal usage of water and fertilizers to bring out
    sustenance in the agricultural

    industry. Therefore, processing must be done for analyzing the data, so that patterns
    can be analyzed and

    planning can be done for the long term, accordingly. Hence, it gives a broad vision
    in deciding where the

    processing is to be done exactly. Therefore, it is obvious that not all data are
    crucial, and it provides a clear

    view of which data need to be stored, discarded, and retained for both long-term
    and short-term purposes.

    Thus, all these challenging issues require to be addressed and that is where storage
    technologies are

    actually highlighted. The poor quality of Internet access in developing nations
    makes the implementation

    quite challenging. An applicable solution to solve this problem is through edge
    computing where the

    essential data could be oﬄoaded from the cloud over the edge of the cloud, and
    this is the exact point

    where the approach of smart sensing with edge computing gets in.

    With the purpose of broadening the potential of edge computing and using it in
    the agriculture domain,

    a novel approach using machine learning (ML) methods is proposed for analyzing
    the data acquired by the

    IoT devices deployed at the farm. Here, the data acquired from IoT components
    undergo preprocessing and

    ML models on the edge nodes to analyze and assess the appropriate results for
    providing the best instruc-

    tions for controlling the actuators (e.g., light, pumps at diﬀerent locations)
    in the farms.

    This article presents an automated system, as shown in Figure 1, to predict the
    soil moisture using the

    ﬁeld information acquired from the self-designed sensor node deployed at the ﬁeld
    and the forecast

    information of weather via Internet. A unique algorithm has been developed that
    revolves around the

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    633

    machine learning techniques for the prediction of soil moisture. Here, many algorithms
    with the combina-

    tion of regression + clustering was estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost
    + k-means outperforms other

    algorithmic combinations, and therefore, it is deployed for the prediction of
    soil moisture in the proposed

    work. The proposed algorithm makes eﬀective irrigation decisions with optimized
    usage of water in a more

    accurate and reliable manner. The eﬀective decision-making refers to the process
    of predicting the rainfall,

    thereby reducing the water usage in advance by the proposed algorithm in accordance
    with the predicted

    rainy days. Through this automatic decision-making, over watering is avoided by
    saving the soil. The

    server-side software is developed with node-side connectivity using the information
    for visualization and

    decision support features. This proposed algorithm is implemented in edge to prove
    the eﬃciency of the

    edge server handling the automated system better than the cloud control. The performance
    of the decen-

    tralized edge-based architecture has been evaluated for downloading the hybrid
    algorithm from cloud in

    real time execution. The performance can be enhanced by adopting edge computing
    architecture and

    measured with the help of network parameters like latency, bandwidth, and response
    time. Edge computing

    capacity is also estimated using the CPU processor and memory consumption while
    executing the proposed

    algorithm with irrigation scheduling.

    In ref. [13], a smart irrigation system not aﬀected by communication disconnection
    and delay is developed

    using edge nodes deployed at the farms. Environmental parameters have an intricate
    impact on the plant

    growth. It becomes necessary for evaluating multiple AI models simultaneously
    in an actual cultivation

    environment for comparing AI models under the same conditions. Due to the working
    of existing irrigation

    systems on the cloud, communication is instable in the concurrent evaluation of
    AI models. However, the

    instability does not induce an edge node in its performance.

    The factors such as type of plant, soil, climate, humidity, temperature, and soil
    moisture need to be

    considered for the irrigation system packed with potential smart decisions. The
    nature and type of plant,

    soil, and climate are queried by ontology (branch of metaphysics dealing with
    the nature of being), whereas

    other factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture are sensed by the
    sensor network. The

    trained ML model predicts the watering decisions based on ontology and other factors
    as mentioned earlier.

    Smart irrigation has three modules: (i) sensor network modules that sense the
    parameters impacting the water

    requirement by using sensors DHT22, light sensor BH1750, and HL-69 hygrometer
    for sensing the temperature,

    soil moisture, light, and humidity in air. (ii) Edge and IoT server’s module to
    send and receive data through

    HTTP requests. (iii) Training module in which KNN is applied on the sample dataset
    for training and decision-

    making regarding the water needs. Based on the input values, the trained model
    categorizes the input into ﬁve

    possible classes: highly not needed, not needed, average, needed, and highly needed
    [14].

    A decentralized smart irrigation approach is proposed for strawberry greenhouses
    in contrast to con-

    ventional cloud-based solutions for keeping the agricultural data at the edge
    of the network. A full-scale

    smart irrigation system in an actual strawberry greenhouse environment is developed
    after a small-scale

    smart irrigation networking prototype system and a reference architecture targeting
    edge data distribution

    for strawberry greenhouse applications are framed. A three-step industrial approach
    is formed for

    designing, implementing, and validating a solution for smart strawberry irrigation
    in greenhouses and

    keeping the corresponding data at the edge of the network at the same time: (i)
    A small-scale smart

    irrigation prototype solution with oﬀ-the-shelf hardware and software equipment
    is tested and evaluated

    on various types of plants for gaining useful insights for deployments on a large
    scale. (ii) A reference

    network architecture is designed for targeting smart irrigation and edge data
    distribution speciﬁcally for

    strawberry greenhouses. (iii) A large-scale system in an actual strawberry greenhouse
    environment is

    developed in Greece, incorporating the proposed reference architecture [15].

    Edge computing is proposed for addressing the issues by taking advantage of computing
    resources in

    the edge of the network. The issues such as an edge mobile device make it easier
    to achieve low end-to-end

    latency, high bandwidth, and low jitter to services located on the edge network.
    An edge can enforce the

    privacy policies of its owner prior to the release of the data to the cloud through
    edge analytics. If a cloud

    service becomes unavailable due to network failure, cloud failure, or a denial-of-service
    attack, a fallback

    service on a nearby edge can temporarily mask the failure. Cloud services, partial
    analysis, and control

    functions are extended to the edge nodes from the cloud data center. Edge nodes
    facilitate the timely

    monitoring of sensors in smart farming by the reduced latency and enhanced data
    transmission. Due to

    these factors, edge computing is applied through farming [16,17]. A three-tier
    open-source software plat-

    form we proposed by authors, and the platform enhanced the precision agriculture
    by introducing edge

    computing and fog computing. An network functions virtualization (NFV)-based approach
    is deployed for

    performing the local operational decisions at the edge level for mitigating the
    inﬂuence of network failures

    while using cloud data centers [18]. For control processing in smart farming,
    a platform enabling cost-

    eﬀective sensor/actuator network based on IoT, utilizes edge computing [19,20].

    The authors in ref. [21] predicted the soil moisture using a mathematical model
    that measures the

    values given by a sensor matrix on the ground. Due to the huge interval in measurements
    (10 minutes), the

    model presented estimated error by more than 10%. This methodology has incorporated
    the online

    approach by making the sensors to send data every minute to edge devices without
    time-based interruption.

    The authors of ref. [22] applied a combinative approach of using ﬁeld sensor network’s
    data along with

    weather forecast station’s data for the management of optimality in water conditions
    for the enhanced

    growth of grapes. The generated data are forwarded to a web server, which displays
    graphics without

    statistical analysis of such data. The analysis must be performed a posteriori
    by the user.

    The watering mechanism for a plant via IoT methodology is devised by the proposed
    smart irrigation

    model without acquiring any pre-processed data. A prototype application is developed,
    which gets adapted

    to the parameters needed in irrigation after a couple of human-made irrigations.
    With the usage of various

    ML algorithms, several tests are devised for manual and automated irrigations
    for the performance evalua-

    tion. After the evaluation using four diﬀerent ML algorithms such as logistic
    regression (LR), K-nearest

    neighbors (KNN), Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), and gradient boosting regression
    trees (GBRT), it is found

    that GBRT outperforms other algorithms. To analyze the overall performance, a
    test bed for the sensor edge,

    mobile client, and the decision service on the cloud is established. Two diﬀerent
    indoor species are selected

    as test items for the prototype, namely, Peace lily and Sardinia. The outcomes
    were quite good, and it is

    inferred that the prototype has learned the patterns of irrigation and making
    decisions automatically with a

    high rate of accuracy [23].

    The authors from ref. [24] adopted the deep learning methodology for detecting
    the type and the

    category of the plant using an automated plant irrigation system. The water necessity
    of the plant is

    determined using the recognition of predeﬁned set of plant images and data set
    acquired from farm. It

    utilizes the database for fetching the irrigation information after the recognition
    process is completed.

    Modeling the training processes are time consuming as voluminous set of images
    needs to be stored.

    The authors in refs [25,26] incorporated ML methods in the irrigation decision
    support model using a

    pre-processed irrigation data set. A model is developed for learning the irrigation
    needs of any plants

    progressively rather than using a readily available dataset. Several ML algorithms
    are evaluated with their

    precision for concluding the irrigation decisions. Manual irrigations are performed
    two times before making

    precise decisions. Due to the dynamicity in model, data processing is done progressively,
    and it can be

    applied to several plants having varying irrigation conditions. There is a need
    for the learning model that

    can be trained by itself using a comparatively lighter learning process using
    environmental parameters that

    do not need larger storage in the system but need higher computation. From the
    aforementioned survey for

    making a precise decision with instant computation locally, edge computing needs
    to be integrated into the

    irrigation system. This article is directed towards presenting a platform that
    implies IoTs and edge com-

    puting in monitoring soil moisture via sensors, data communication between sensors
    and edge devices, and

    an Analytics-as-a-Service cloud. It analyzes the collected data in the form of
    a density map of soil moisture

    for denoting the areas in need of greater or lesser frequency of irrigation. Here,
    density map does not refer to

    the geographical point data by satellite mapping, and it actually denotes the
    point of dry area and watery

    area through soil moisture detection point. This point is averaged among areas
    of irrigation to be done and

    the irrigation process is controlled with prediction of rainfall using the proposed
    system.

    3 The proposed system

    The proposed learning model for irrigation is implemented in a prototype IoT system
    that has four compo-

    nents: (i) Edge node layer – This layer consists of sensors, actuator, and two
    microcontrollers. In this layer,

    edge node acquires the sensor data from the surroundings and controls the actuator
    for actuating water

    pumps to start irrigation. (ii) Edge server layer – This layer consists of Raspberry
    Pi that act as edge server

    and capable of multitask processing. Here, edge server controls the edge nodes
    for sending signal and

    receiving data at regular interval of time. It is also connected to the cloud
    server for receiving developed and

    trained machine learning model to be deployed and make irrigation decision for
    controlling edge nodes.

    (iii) Edge service layer – This layer is deployed in the edge server and it is
    responsible for controlling the

    whole system through a developed web dashboard. The dashboard has live feed data,
    control of edge

    nodes, and cloud services access. This service layer also has the control access
    of the proposed machine

    learning model. (iv) Cloud server layer – This layer composed of cloud services
    and cloud storage where its

    role is to train the machine learning model and store the data in database. It
    sends the trained proposed

    model to the edge server for decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling.
    The comprehensive inter-

    connections in the system are shown in Figure 2. The proposed IoT-based smart
    irrigation system includes

    ﬁve major components: ﬁeld deployed module, Web-based interface, Web API weather
    input, soil moisture

    prediction mechanism, and edge communication model.

    3.1 Field deployed module

    In the ﬁeld requirements, a wireless sensor network of the sensor nodes needs
    to be deployed as shown in

    Figure 3. Here, ﬁeld data collection device accommodates four diﬀerent sensors:
    Capacitive Soil Moisture

    Sensor V2.0, DS18B20 Water Proof Temperature Sensor Probe for soil temperature,
    ultraviolet (UV) Light

    Radiation, DHT11 – Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module, and GYML8511 Analog
    Output Ultra-Violet

    

    Light Sensor Module. An Arduino Mega connected to Raspberry Pi 4 Model-B read,
    the output of these

    sensors where the program is developed in Python for the Pi model to fetch the
    hourly data from sensors

    and store the data in MongoDB [27] database. It is then synchronized with the
    server database using the

    developed web service. A Wi-Fi-enabled Arduino controls the water pump connected
    to a relay switch.

    Figure 2: Components of the proposed system.

    Figure 3: Real-time prototype of the proposed edge model.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    637

    For the real time monitoring, a trigger is made for controlling the web service
    from the responsive web-

    based interface. The irrigation decisions are checked periodically by the proposed
    model performed in the

    server. The water pump is actuated, and irrigation process is started only if
    the server makes any irrigation

    decision. A wireless sensor network (WSN) [28] scenario with ZigBee [29] technology
    can be implemented

    for a large farming area in which several sensor nodes can be aﬃxed in the speciﬁed
    area and every sensor

    node possesses sensors similar to a standalone device. Then, the Arduino Mega
    reads the sensor output

    connected to ZigBee for transferring data to Gateway Node for aggregating the
    received data and storing it

    in MongoDB locally and also for transferring the data via web service to the edge
    server.

    3.2 Web-based interface

    The proposed framework consists of a web-based application to allow farmers visualize
    the growing data

    and interacting with the garden in real time. In addition, users can also be able
    to examine and analyze the

    historical growing data, if needed, through functionalities such as irrigation
    control, motor control predic-

    tion model deployment, and manual data entry implemented in this web application.
    Here, Node.js was

    chosen for developing the web application [30,31], while MongoDB [27] was utilized
    as the database system.

    Data stored in the database, which is deployed in the cloud, will be used for
    further data analysis in the

    future. The web application’s functions are designed following a software design
    pattern called model-

    view-controller (MVC) as shown in Figure 4. In the frontend, ChartJS is used to
    represent data through

    dynamic charts. The web application is also used as an interface to manage all
    the physical devices/

    actuators in the garden. To deploy the web-server to the cloud, a cloud platform
    as a service (PaaS), namely,

    Heroku, had been utilized. Heroku is a cloud platform that provides platform as
    a service (PaaS), facilitates

    the creation of applications and deploying these online rapidly [32,33]. It also
    enhances scalability and

    functionality by integrating several add-on services. The ﬁeld data are sent to
    the server by Raspberry Pi

    using this web service. This web service manages the network outage/ﬂuctuation
    during data synchroniza-

    tion from the ﬁeld device to the server by taking the help of ﬂag settings at
    the database level. The interface

    facilitates the scheduling of irrigation along with visualizing real time sensors
    and predicted soil moisture

    for upcoming days and precipitation information. By using the denoted threshold
    value of soil moisture

    suggested by agronomists, the irrigation can be scheduled by the user. The system
    maintains the threshold

    value depending on the predicted pattern of soil moisture and precipitation information.
    The process of

    irrigation is initiated automatically and stopped after the speciﬁed threshold
    value generated from the

    proposed algorithm of soil moisture when it is reached.

    Figure 4: Web interface for the irrigation system.

    3.3 Web API weather input

    The weather prediction data are collected by a web service developed in Python.
    The forecast data such as

    humidity, temperature, ultra violet index, precipitation, and cloudiness of web
    forecasting portals like

    Open Weather API are aggregated by the developed web service [34]. These portals
    provide the forecasted

    information in HTML, XML, or JSON format. The predicted data with JSON format
    are read by the developed

    web and stored in database at the edge server, which is concerned in the prediction
    algorithm. Also, these

    data are utilized as testing dataset in the ML model for predicting the soil moisture.

    3.4 Soil moisture prediction mechanism

    An algorithm for predicting the soil moisture based on data derived from ﬁeld
    sensors and weather fore-

    casting using the combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning
    techniques has been

    developed underpinned by regression algorithms and k-means clustering for estimating
    the diﬀerence/

    change in soil moisture owing to weather conditions. Many regression algorithms
    are compared against

    each other and infusing each of them with k-means to check the preciseness in
    mean square error (MSE),

    R2, accuracy and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for prediction of soil
    moisture of upcoming days

    with the help of sensor data and weather forecasting days. The information about
    soil moisture for the

    upcoming days and suggestions for irrigation in accordance with the prescribed
    levels of soil moisture and

    predicted precipitation values, thereby saving energy and water, is presented
    by the algorithm. The infor-

    mation generated from the device and the predicted values from the algorithm soil
    moisture prediction

    hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) are stored in the server.

    3.5 Edge communication model

    The communication protocols in the proposed framework are ﬂexible and transparent
    in nature for

    accepting both wired and wireless methodologies. For the maximum utilization of
    potentiality in edge

    computing components, the communication among various components in the edge-IoT
    system requires

    intense probing by using the versatility among the devices in network edges. For
    transferring the data

    gathered from pivot sensors, a communication technology such as Zigbee [35] is
    needed for the irrigation

    systems. Therefore, the communication component in the proposed work is classiﬁed
    into three main areas

    as shown in Figure 5. The Message Query Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is
    used for the

    Figure 5: Proposed edge communication model.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    639

    communication in the proposed system. The analysis in ref. [36] presented seven
    IoT messaging protocols

    (MQTT, CoAP, XMPP, AMQP, DDS, REST-HTTP, and WebSocket) as communication protocols
    that play a

    major role in smart farming. The authors have concluded that MQTT proved to be
    the most secure protocol

    after probing all the protocols with respect to latency, energy and bandwidth
    requirements, throughput,

    reliability, and security. Moreover, MQTT is secure in both end-to-end architecture
    and gateway server

    architecture. In an MQTT setup, a MQTT server termed as MQTT broker executes on
    the IoT solution [37].

    Under a common identiﬁer, a “publisher” and a “subscriber” link among themselves
    to this broker. In the

    IoT solution, publishers and subscribers are the IoT devices and IoT hubs or control
    devices, respectively.

    When the publishers have new data for recording, the data are published to the
    broker. The broker then

    ﬂags that it has new publisher data, and the corresponding data are read by the
    subscriber. Then, the

    subscriber analyzes the data and reacts accordingly.

    The ﬁrst level accomplishes with connecting the end users to system with the help
    of mobile or web-

    based applications through the Internet. The next level (cloud computing server)
    deals with the connection

    of web server and MQTT broker for directing the user requests and other components
    at the edge landscape

    or from the farms to the right cloud-based services like displaying the real time
    status of the farm for the

    users, triggering a new deployment of the updated ML model to the corresponding
    edge node. The third

    level (farming area) is directed toward the deployment of sensors and IoT devices
    (actuators) for commu-

    nicating with other components in the entire system.

    4 Deployment of soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm

    The watering mechanism of the plant has diﬀerent approaches in the proposed model.
    Primarily, the system

    is trained with manual irrigations datasets during the process of learning with
    respect to suggestions

    deﬁned by agronomists. The model is trained to learn the needs of irrigation in
    the ﬁrst level of deployment

    in cloud without the inclusion of pre-processed data. After acquiring the required
    data and training, the

    proposed system is initiated to grasp the plant’s watering needs by undergoing
    plenty of manual irrigations.

    Thereafter, manual irrigation is not required and the system makes automated decisions
    in watering using

    the gathered data and the application of ML methods. The proposed model then decides
    the irrigation

    strategies automatically using ML methods without the need including collected
    datasets in the automatic

    irrigation process. The proposed model can be improved through the learning process
    when the number of

    precise irrigation inputs is provided to the model at each stage of training.

    The decision-making procedure is developed with two modules for irrigation strategies
    according to the

    soil moisture prediction for upcoming days. The ﬁrst module deals with training
    the model in cloud with

    manual irrigation datasets through steps such as data collection, data preprocessing,
    training, and model

    development. The system acquires values of air temperature (TH), soil temperature
    (SMT), soil moisture

    (SM), humidity (HU), and ultraviolet rays (UV) periodically from the physical
    environment in the data

    collection stage, which is essentially required for arriving at the watering decisions.
    Also, the time of

    performing the manual irrigation is recorded in the database. These data are timestamped
    and stored in

    as datasets to aid in making decisions for knowing the time of irrigation. In
    the next step of pre-processing,

    inconsistencies are eliminated and outliers caused by sensor errors are detected
    from the irrigation dataset,

    thereby helping in the removal of broken data. The training stage involves the
    application of supervised

    machine learning (ML) algorithms. Here the regression algorithms such as support
    vector regression (SVR),

    multiple linear regression (MLR), lasso regression (LR), decision tree regressor
    (DTR), random forest

    regressor (RF), and XG-boost regressor (XB) techniques are used for the deployment.
    The regression algo-

    rithms are trained using the collected datasets. Finally, through training, regression
    models are created,

    namely, SVR model, MLR model, LR model, DTR model, RF model, and XB model that
    are been combined

    with the second module for decision-making.

    The second module caters to the prediction of irrigation for upcoming days by
    infusing the weather data

    as an input to the regression trained models. The live datasets from the weather
    API for future prediction of

    640

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    soil moisture variable are used. The dependent variables from weather forecast
    data like temperature (TH),

    humidity (HU), ultraviolet (UV), and precipitation (PC) are tested in the aforementioned
    model for soil

    moisture prediction. Then, the regression trained model is evaluated and deployed
    using the weather

    testing data for the prediction of soil moisture in accordance with the precipitation.
    After the prediction

    of data for the upcoming days, these developed regression models are combined
    with unsupervised ML

    algorithm named k-means clustering for estimating the changes incurred in soil
    moisture prediction due to

    the impact of weather conditions. Further, each regression models with k-means
    algorithm are evaluated

    for performances in terms of irrigation decision-making process as shown in Table
    1. The combined algo-

    rithms are estimated through MAPE, MSE, R2, execution speed, power consumption,
    and accuracy. The

    estimation and computation of these parameters are detailed by the authors in
    ref. [38].

    XGBoost + k-means (XB+k-means) approach provides more accuracy with less MSE comparatively
    and

    also the R2 with 98% in soil moisture prediction using combined approach is given
    in Table 1. It is evident

    that the proposed combination performs better when compared to other regression
    + k-means-based

    approaches. XB + k-means-based hybrid machine learning algorithm is applied in
    irrigation planning

    module on account of aforementioned performance metrices of ML. Although it performs
    moderately in

    terms of execution time and power usage, it is selected for the deployment in
    edge computing as it has

    better performed in terms of accuracy, R2, MSE, and MAPE metrices. It is observed
    that the prediction of soil

    moisture for the upcoming days from the proposed algorithm (XB+k-means) is nearer
    to the actual value as

    shown in Table 2, and hence, XB+k-means is selected for the implementation of
    SMPHA in edge-based

    irrigation scheduling.

    4.1 Hardware setup

    IoT system is crucial to handle, collect, and transfer the data to the computing
    nodes at the edge or in the

    cloud. These devices are connected to the edge nodes through wireless communication
    protocols like

    ZigBee. It is used in reducing the latency and loss of data. An Arduino micro-control
    unit controls the

    combined IoT sensors and actuators at the same part of a ﬁeld into a cluster,
    each connected to a Raspberry

    Figure 2 shows an edge architecture with a Raspberry Pi connected to two components:

    accordance with upper

    edge nodes provides the

    necessary instructions to the edge nodes.

    4.2 Web layer setup

    The deployment of web server assists the user in planning and managing the irrigation
    system. It visualizes

    the crucial information of factors like temperature of air and soil, UV, humidity,
    and soil moisture in live

    irrigation with real time updates in the form of various charts. In accordance
    with the selected ﬁeld, the web

    application redirects the user to the ﬁeld’s dashboard as shown in Figure 4. The
    dashboard consists of ﬁeld

    parameters as well as control signals for activating all the physical devices/actuators
    at the garden layer.

    These signals are denoted as switch buttons, and each switch controls (turn on/oﬀ)
    a particular kind of

    actuator (for instance, water pump to start and stop the irrigation). The user
    interface facilitates remote

    controlling of the ﬁeld by just clicking on the buttons as shown in Figure 4.

    4.3 Edge layer setup

    The edge node acts as a computing center where incoming data are analyzed and
    fed as the input vector to

    the ML model for processing and to return the control signals for activating or
    deactivating the actuators

    placed at the farm. Edge node processes the physical data (real time) at every
    end device such as the

    collected and processed data via the Raspberry Pi nodes presented in the proposed
    scheme. The prediction

    model is designed using TensorFlow API and trained, tested on Google Colab in
    this work. Amazon Web

    Service (AWS) oﬀers a library named Boto3 having many APIs to upload and download
    objects. After the

    development of model, it is transferred to Amazon S3, a service provided by AWS.
    The edge node utilizes the

    trained model from S3 for analyzing the sensed data acquired from garden’s sensors.
    The decision is

    delivered based on real time data analysis at the edge node and transmitted to
    Arduino nodes in the ﬁelds

    landscape immediately for controlling the actuators. In another ﬂow, the data
    collected from sensors are

    ﬁltered so as to keep only the modiﬁed data at the edge node before being sent
    back for mitigating the

    communication cost to the database in the cloud. These data are used in the updation
    of the ML model to

    enhance its eﬃciency.

    4.4 Analytics setup

    The main goal of this experiment lies in gathering the various physical parameters
    of a farming land via

    sensors and utilizing the fetched data along with weather forecast information
    for developing an algorithm

    using hybrid machine learning approach to infuse higher accuracy in predicting
    the soil moisture for the

    upcoming days. As discussed in Section 4, for the proper planning and provisioning
    of optimal irrigation,

    the algorithm provides a predictable estimate of soil moisture with the assistance
    of various statistical

    measures as shown in Table 1. The measures are adopted for estimating the appropriateness
    and error rate

    of the proposed algorithm. It is inferred from the experiment that, optimal irrigation
    is feasible using a good

    642

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    estimation (close to the actual value) of the soil moisture (Table 2), with the
    support of ﬁeld data and

    forecast information, thereby utilizing the natural rain eﬃciently.

    The SMPHA ML model is interdependent on dynamic changes in weather environment
    where the

    models deployed on edge nodes need to change the controls accordingly after model
    gets trained con-

    tinuously. For the process of retraining, the trained model needs to be updated.
    The parameters such as TM,

    HU, ST, UV, SM about grown plants are logged for the training purpose, and these
    generated datasets are

    recorded from the already developed manual mode system [39]. The growth of the
    Indian Mundu Chilli [40]

    is taken for the observation from the ﬁrst stage to the last grown stage for 95
    days. While retraining the

    model, the training is carried in cloud without causing eﬀect to the functionalities
    at edge nodes. A signal is

    transferred to the corresponding edge server for triggering the task of updating
    the SMPHA model from the

    web server. At that time, the newly trained model is downloaded to replace the
    existing one at the con-

    sidering edge server. From then, the ML model at the edge server is called to
    be updated with the real-world

    knowledge and is ready for its garden controlling tasks (to apply in the next
    farming season).

    4.5 Work ﬂow

    The ﬂowchart in Figure 6 depicts the working of the proposed system based on the
    decision support system

    that is beneﬁcial for irrigation needed for the growth of vegetables. The chilli
    plant is grown in a growbag

    attached with sensors and Pi as shown in Figure 3 and monitored for 95 days of
    data collection. To bring out

    optimality in the irrigation system, features relating to climate, soil, crop,
    and ﬁeld infrastructure are to be

    considered. To provide several recommendations in the production of vegetables,
    decision support systems

    (DSSs) are designed, which process voluminous information [39]. This proposed
    work is the extension of

    soil moisture diﬀerences (SMD) model [41] developed for soil moisture prediction.
    The threshold values of

    soil moisture are used in the SMD model where the system schedules the irrigation
    date based on the

    predicted soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation) information automatically
    using SVR+ k-means

    modeling. Therefore, in the extension of the aforementioned work, further more
    number of sensors are used

    to log soil moisture value, which is averaged in the proposed model. This model
    is developed in two

    divisions of ﬂowchart as shown in Figure 7, where both are interconnected. It
    is observed that the prediction

    of XB + k-mean approach provides better results as presented in Table 2.

    The ﬁrst phase of the ﬂowchart describes the hybrid algorithm for the soil moisture
    prediction (SMPHA)

    using the combination of XB + k-means algorithm. During the data collection step,
    the sensor data for the

    parameters, namely, TM, HU, ST, UV, and SM, are collected. During preprocessing,
    null values and outliers

    are removed and the preprocessed data are used to train the XG-Boost model. The
    developed model is then

    trained with variables of live weather features (TM, HU, UV, PC) obtained from
    Weather API for the

    prediction of SM data. These data are given as input to k-means clustering algorithm
    to predict the soil

    moisture, which is deﬁned as SMPHA value to be infused in the next phase of the
    ﬂowchart. The second

    phase of the ﬂowchart deﬁnes the automatic irrigation planning setup. The setup
    starts obtaining the soil

    moisture maximum (SMMax) and soil moisture minimum (SMMin) values in the dashboard
    for setting the

    maximum and minimum level of soil moisture. Then, the current soil moisture (CuSM)
    is sensed and

    compared against the threshold SMMin. If the resulting value is less than SMMin,
    the process proceeds

    with SMPHA. On the contrary, it stops the irrigation process by sending 0 to the
    relay. In SMPHA, the

    nearest precipitation date is selected and it is assigned to the predicted soil
    moisture (PSM). The SMMax is

    decided by ﬁnding the minimum of (PSM + SMMin, SMMax), and the predicted SMMax
    is further checked

    against CuSM with a condition if SMMax is greater the CuSM then it sends 1 to
    the relay as a signal to start

    irrigation. If the condition fails, then it sends 0 to stop irrigation. The process
    of automatic irrigation ends

    by forecasting the irrigation schedule in accordance with the live weather parameters.

    5 Experimental setup and evaluation

    The test bed is developed and deployed, and the data are collected for the analysis
    in irrigation manage-

    ment. Here, Heroku cloud platform is used to deploy the cloud web server. The
    same cloud is also installed

    at a local edge that is at two Raspberry Pi units equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11n
    connections to denote the edge

    nodes. JMeter application is used to get sequential accesses to the web page from
    various users for eval-

    uating the network parameters. The speciﬁcation of these servers is given in Tables
    3 and 4.

    We evaluated the performance of the proposed IoT-based smart farm on two diﬀerent
    platforms,

    namely, in the cloud and on the local computer to show the feasibility and the
    beneﬁt of the edge com-

    puting scheme. Further many parameters are considered for evaluation and discussed
    in the next section to

    show that edge deployment is better than cloud.

    5.1 Evaluation

    A hybrid machine learning methodology is used in evaluating the ﬁrst stage of
    the proposed model. The

    predicted value of the soil moisture is better in terms of their accuracy and
    error rate. From the comparison

    of the other ML algorithms as shown in Table 2, XB + k-means performs better and
    taken further to be

    deployed in edge and cloud to check its eﬃciency with each other. Therefore, for
    analyzing the eﬃciency of

    the edge server in accordance with the proposed hybrid algorithm SMPHA is evaluated
    in terms of the time

    taken to train the ML model in edge and cloud. In this experiment Raspberry Pi
    is used to train the SMPHA

    model with 196,400 rows, that is, input data sample size and takes around 1,710,000
    ms (approximately

    28.5 min). The same model when it is trained in Google Colab cloud environment,
    it takes 204,000 ms

    (approximately 3.4 min) as depicted in Table 5. The main purpose is to run the
    trained model on edge not to

    train the model at edge. So due to the lack of computing capability at the edge,
    it takes more time to train

    the model, but it can be ignored as it does not aﬀect the purpose of the proposed
    model. Here, edge is

    introduced to obtain the task of computing from the cloud (i.e., oﬄoading the
    task) by making the system

    more edge-oriented deployment. It can be accomplished rapidly as it requires only
    14 s to download a

    trained SMPHA model from the cloud to the edge node with a size of 3,101 kb as
    given in Table 5. The time to

    download varies according to the size of the trained model. So, from this process
    it can be inferred that

    downloading the trained model saves time when compared to training the model at
    the edge. Through this

    in real time, deployment of the trained SMPHA model in edge is better compared
    to deployment in cloud

    services. Furthermore, network parameters like latency, throughput, bandwidth,
    and response time are

    adopted to measure the performance improvements in edge computing.

    The performance metrices taken into account are latency, bandwidth, and response
    time [42]. The

    latency of an application is the product of two factors: computing latency and
    transmission latency. The

    time spent on data processing and transmission between end devices to cloud servers
    is termed as com-

    puting latency and transmission latency, respectively. The computational capacity
    of the system decides

    the computing latency as the network servers possess a considerable amount of
    capacity to make the data

    processing faster, whereas the sensors come with limited computing capacity. The
    latency in transmission

    is increased by the end devices and cloud servers. Bandwidth: As large number
    of sensors are deployed in

    IoT, data generated would be huge that consumes an intense range of bandwidth
    and leads to several

    problems such as delay in transmission and loss of packets. It becomes unacceptable
    for the data to be

    transferred directly to cloud servers without applying compression. Therefore,
    data preprocessing and

    aggregation are needed for IoT gateways before redirecting them to remote cloud
    servers. Then, the issue

    to be confronted is to control the traﬃc ﬂow by migrating data processing and
    aggregation tasks optimally

    to decrease the bandwidth needs of the end users while maintaining the data quality.
    Response time: The

    total response time is calculated by adding up transmission and processing time.
    The local deployment of

    the proposed model for controlling IoT-based irrigation are deployed on two modes:
    (i) Cloud mode: The

    developed SMPHA model is implemented in the cloud communicating with IoT sensors
    nodes directly to

    manage the irrigation process. The data are stored and processed at the cloud
    server itself where it uses

    Heroku platform. (ii) Edge mode – Raspberry Pi is deployed as an edge server that
    involves in processing of

    the SMPHA model controlling the IoT sensor nodes. Here, the data are stored and
    processed locally within

    the edge servers. This SMPHA model from both the edge and cloud does the job of
    controlling the actuators

    to initiate and quit the working of water ﬂow motors. Through this deployment
    in both the environments,

    performance of edge server and cloud server can be checked in terms of latency,
    throughput, bandwidth,

    and response time is shown in aforementioned graphs in Figures 6, 8, and 9. This
    performance metrices is

    not feasible to calculate while deploying in real time, so the aforementioned
    scenarios of two modes are

    virtually created by generating many request and response threads between the
    servers. This sampling,

    load test, and distributed testing are conducted through JMeter application [43]
    and also veriﬁed with

    Wireshark [44] in cloud servers. The test scenario is created here by data of
    sending and receiving sampling

    data between cloud to IoT sensors and between Edge to IoT sensors. The sampling
    data considered in this

    work refer to the approximate number of requests generated by Arduino to cloud
    and Arduino to Raspberry

    Pi that are calculated in real time. The test scenario is divided into 10 days
    of sampling data collected for

    each day. The evaluation results are depicted for latency and response times in
    10 days perspective. In

    latency parameter, edge service has decreased by an average of 77.85% time compared
    to the with cloud. In

    the same manner, the response time of edge service is also decreased by 74.09%
    time compared to cloud

    service. In throughput calculation, sampling data are calculated for an hourly
    basis for the 10 hours data in

    a day. From the hourly comparisons of throughput value, edge outperforms with
    67.17% high Mbps usage.

    Through this analysis as shown in Table 6, it is evident that the proposed edge
    computing methodology

    deployed in Raspberry Pi or in local computers outperforms the cloud-oriented
    approach.

    Finally, to illustrate the eﬃciency of resource management in edge computing,
    CPU and memory

    utilization are considered for the analysis as both factors rely on the service
    execution model and the

    computational needs of the services being ﬁred from oﬀ-loaders. Figure 10 depicts
    the utilization of CPU

    and RAM on the Raspberry Pi acting as an edge node in two cases: with and without
    the deployment of

    SMPHA model on it. As shown in Figure 10, the SMPHA model aﬀects the CPU of the
    Raspberry Pi node

    signiﬁcantly as it consumed around 41.2% of the CPU compared to only 3.5% when
    it does not host the

    SMPHA model. However, the memory (RAM) utilization in both the cases (with and
    without deployment of

    an SMPHA model) is nearly the same which is around 31%. Comparatively RAM utilization
    does not have

    much diﬀerence in with and without SMPHA. It is worthwhile to note that, the CPU
    utilization is still much

    lower than the 50% of total CPU capacity in Raspberry Pi. Therefore, it becomes
    feasible for adopting edge

    server implementation in the proposed irrigation system.

    6 Conclusion

    This article proposed a novel approach to edge-based irrigation system to facilitate
    decision-making on

    watering the plants on scheduled time. The proposed approach applying IoT with
    an edge computing

    framework enables the farming system to adapt to the changes in environmental
    conditions automatically

    and eﬃciently. The process of automatic irrigation regulates irrigation according
    to the live weather para-

    meters for forecasting the irrigation process. Soil moisture prediction was performed
    using major regression

    algorithms that are again combined with k-means clustering for estimating the
    changes incurred in soil

    moisture prediction. These techniques were compared through metrics such as MAPE,
    MSE, speed, and

    power consumption from which XB + k-means was found to perform better. The XB
    + k-means algorithm

    was further used for the implementation of decision mechanism on the developed
    edge computing model.

    The proposed edge model saves the data communication cost and reduces the response
    time of IoT services.

    It can be deployed on existing devices on the network edges serving as edge nodes,
    thereby reducing the

    overall implementation cost of a large-scale IoT system. The edge-based approach
    was found to perform

    better than the cloud-based approach in terms of response time, latency, throughput,
    and bandwidth

    usage. Finally, the edge model was analyzed through CPU and memory usage while
    running with and

    without the algorithm. In both cases, the memory utilization is almost lower to
    total available resource of

    the edge device. From this, edge device can allocate its remaining resource for
    other computing services,

    which increases the eﬃciency of edge computing device. The number of end edge
    nodes can be increased

    according to the ﬁeld area and then to check the potency of the system.

    attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation Xingyi Yang and
    1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling has been notably
    propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this progress, the cumbersome
    optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle to efficiency. In this
    paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for 3D generation without
    model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map redundancy is
    prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion time-steps in
    close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature maps across
    neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents redundant
    calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in 3D generation
    tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly, this
    feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances the
    smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications
    Of Text-T... Mijat Kustudic and 1 more April 02, 2024 SORA is a text-to-video
    model that can create videos based on simple user prompts. The model promises
    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory
    complexities, and dependence on technology. This research provides important recommendations
    to promote responsible deployment of the AI model. Advancements and Challenges
    in Robot Grasping and Manipulation for Aspiring Researche... Claudio Zito April
    02, 2024 Robot grasping and manipulation represent pivotal aspects of robotics
    research with profound implications for the future of autonomous systems. This
    report delves into the intricacies of designing robotic hands, the hurdles in
    creating robust manipulation actions, and the advancements in the field that poised
    to catalyze a new era of autonomy. Drawing inspiration from science fiction''s
    portrayal of robotics, we bridge the conceptual gap between fiction and ongoing
    real-world technical research, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview for
    students interested in robotics. Comprehensive 3GPP-Compatible Channel Model for
    FR2-2 Short-Range Communications for... Yusuke Koda and 3 more April 02, 2024
    This paper proposes a comprehensive 3GPPcnaompatible channel model with statistical
    enhancement tailored for indoor short-range device-to-device (D2D) communications
    operating in the frequency range (FR) of 52.6-71.0 GHz termed FR2-2. Regardless
    of the existence of various channel models at this band for indoor communications,
    there will be a need for developing a channel model compatible with and understandable
    from the current 3GPP stochastic channel model (SCM) to facilitate the discussion
    in the 3GPP for developing such FR2-2 short-range D2D communication framework
    based on the fifthgeneration (5G) new radio (NR). Indeed, such a futuristic vision
    can be foreseen from the fact that the 3GPP is discussing the evolution of sidelink,
    referred to as a D2D communication framework; however, there are no 3GPP SCM-compatible
    channel models applicable to FR2-2 short-range D2D communications. To fill this
    void, we propose the channel model coined 3GPPCompFR2-InS that allows us to generate
    channel impulse responses (CIR) for computer simulations, which is suitable for
    various indoor short-range D2D communication scenarios while retailing the similarity
    in terms of the implementation policy of the 3GPP SCM. 3GPPCompFR2-InS is verified
    based on the real-world measurements at the 60 GHz band from the viewpoint of
    both the validity of the channel model parameters and that of the statistical
    behavior of the generated CIRs. Effective media models for wave propagation in
    prestressed fractured rocks with nonli... Li-Yun Fu and 3 more April 02, 2024
    Stress-induced progressive deformations in fractured rocks with increasing effective
    pressure generally undergo nonlinear elastic (due to the closure of compliant
    pores), hyperelastic (due to residual stress), and inelastic (due to fracture
    growth) deformations prior to mechanical failure. Wave propagation in such rocks
    involves the complex interaction of fracture-and stress-induced changes in both
    velocity and anisotropy. With attention to nonlinear elastic and hyperelastic
    deformations, we incorporate acoustoelasticity into the traditional Hudson/Cheng
    models to describe the coupling of fracture-induced and stress-induced anisotropies.
    The resulting acoustoelastic Hudson model (AHM) is valid for the crack density
    smaller than 0.1 whereas the Padé AHM could handle higher crack densities. We
    extend the Padé AHM to consider the stress-induced crack closure with nonlinear
    elastic deformations by incorporating the dual-porosity model. These models approach
    the coupled anisotropies with different accuracies and computational complexities.
    The plane-wave analyses and effective-moduli calculations of stressed fractured
    rocks with varying crack densities determine the accuracy of these models under
    the isotropic (confining) and anisotropic (uniaxial and pure shear) prestress
    conditions. The relevant Thomsen parameters are applied to experimental data to
    validate the applicability. Finite-difference simulations are implemented to identify
    the contribution of different anisotropies through the variety of wavefronts,
    depending on fracture orientation, crack density, prestress mode and magnitude,
    and loading direction. Particular attention is paid to the anisotropic prestress,
    where the coupled anisotropies are constructive or destructive interference, strongly
    related to the relativity between fracture strike and loading direction. The stress-induced
    crack closure will reduce the fracture anisotropy so that the stress-induced background
    anisotropy dominates the shape of wavefronts with increasing prestress. Security
    and Reliability Performance of a Cooperative Network with Self-Sustaining No...
    Amit Patel and 1 more April 02, 2024 In this paper, we analyze the secrecy performance
    of a two-hop cooperative network consisting solely of energy-harvesting self-sustaining
    nodes drawing energy from a multi-antenna power beacon (PB). Performance of such
    networks is quite different from that with powered nodes. We consider optimal
    combining of the direct and relayed signals at the multi-antenna destination as
    well as the multi-antenna eavesdropper. Since availability of channel state information
    at the source is impractical in such networks, we assume fixed-rate signaling.
    To implement incremental signaling, we utilize feedback bits from the destination.
    Assuming practical nonlinear EH, exact and approximate expressions are derived
    for the secrecy outage probability of the selective decode-and-forward (SDF) and
    the incremental decode-and-forward (IDF) relaying schemes. It is demonstrated
    that IDF has much better secrecy performance than SDF just as with powered nodes.
    However, unlike with powered nodes, the secrecy performance is a convex function
    of the transmit power of PB. We propose a novel power back-off scheme to improve
    secrecy under different network operating conditions. The security-reliability
    trade-off (SRT) is analyzed to highlight the trade-off between outage and secrecy
    performance with the power back-off scheme. Simulation results validate the analytical
    expressions. Advanced Cardiovascular Health in a Quantum AI-driven Healthcare
    Framework Sarvapriya M Tripathi and 2 more April 02, 2024 With the advent of Healthcare
    4.0, there is increased interest from researchers the world over in the application
    of modern, cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum Artificial Intelligence
    (QAI) algorithms in solving healthcare challenges. The era of Quantum Computing
    (QC) promises to bring significant advancements in several areas of healthcare
    such that it may be sensible to give this hybrid Quantum/Classical paradigm its
    own name-Healthcare4Q. The potential of QC will extend the reach of Healthcare4Q
    with the help of diverse technologies such as quantum-enabled wearables, quantum-secure
    transfer and storage of data, and quantum computing at edge, fog, and cloud. All
    of these technologies promise to catapult Healthcare4Q to become the most capable
    healthcare framework in the advancement of medical innovations and improvement
    of patient care. An integral part of a person''s health lies in cardiovascular
    health, and thus prioritizing and optimizing cardiovascular health remains vital
    to the broader goals of public health and healthcare sustainability. In this study,
    under the paradigm of Healthcare4Q, we propose a framework called the Quantum
    AIdriven Heart Health Framework (QAIHHF) that can provide advanced predictive
    intelligence to healthcare providers by utilizing historical and real-time data
    and processing capabilities proposed in Healthcare4Q. We show that when applied
    to various diagnostics and health indicators such as ECG data, the Quantum AI
    provides accuracy at a level equal to or higher as compared to the classical methods
    thus proving itself to be the critical component that will herald the era of Healthcare4Q.
    QCDC-DR-GA: Optimizing Container Loading and Unloading through Dual-Cycling and
    Docky... Md. Mahfuzur Rahman and 4 more April 01, 2024 This paper addresses the
    optimization of container unloading and loading operations at ports, integrating
    quaycrane dual-cycling (QCDC) with dockyard rehandle minimization. We present
    a unified model encompassing both operations: ship container unloading and loading
    by quay crane, and the other is reducing dockyard rehandles while loading the
    ship. We recognize that optimizing one aspect in isolation can lead to suboptimal
    outcomes due to interdependencies. Specifically, optimizing unloading sequences
    for minimal operation time may inadvertently increase dockyard rehandles during
    loading and vice versa. To address this NP-hard problem, we propose a hybrid genetic
    algorithm (GA) QCDC-DR-GA comprising 1dimensional and 2-dimensional GA components.
    Our model, QCDC-DR-GA, consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art methods
    in maximizing dual cycles and minimizing dockyard rehandles. Compared to those
    methods, it reduced 15-20% of total operation time for large vessels. Results
    underscore the inefficiency of separately optimizing QCDC and dockyard rehandles.
    Fragmented approaches, such as QCDC Scheduling Optimized by bi-level GA and GA-ILSRS
    (Scenario 2), show limited improvement compared to QCDC-DR-GA. As in GA-ILSRS
    (Scenario 1), neglecting dual-cycle optimization leads to inferior performance
    than our proposed QCDC-DR-GA. A Two-Stage Passive Matrix Addressing Method for
    Large-Scale Beam-Steering Arrays PengYuan Wang April 01, 2024 This letter proposes
    a passive matrix addressing method to dramatically reduce the number of controlling
    (biasing) lines for large-scale beam-steering arrays. Phase shifting of each radiation
    element is accomplished in two stages by the row and column biasing lines located
    at two stacked layers, which offer a pair of orthogonal wave vectors. For an antenna
    array with M rows and N columns, conventional direct addressing designs need M
    * N biasing lines, while the proposed method needs only M+N biasing lines to complete
    the full-space beam-steering. The proposed method simplifies the routing of control
    lines and the design of driving circuits. Both theoretical and numerical analyses
    are provided to validate this method. Efficient Twiddle Factor Generation for
    Post Quantum Cryptography FALCON-based Number... Ghada Alsuhli and 4 more April
    01, 2024 Area and power-efficient hardware implementations are crucial for the
    widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms like FALCON.
    One of the main operations in FALCON is the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT),
    which needs to be performed with many prime numbers. Having one set of twiddle
    factors (TFs) for each prime makes storing all of these TFs impractical. In this
    paper, we propose an architecture for generating TFs on the fly for FALCON-oriented
    NTT, designed for area and power efficiency. Our approach dynamically generates
    TFs during NTT computations, significantly reducing on-chip memory requirements.
    The ASIC implementation results demonstrate significant improvements, with the
    proposed design reducing on-chip memory requirements by 99%, occupying 95% less
    area, and consuming 87.4% less power compared to the traditional ROM-based implementation.
    Furthermore, our design achieved a much higher maximum clock frequency, indicating
    superior performance in accessing twiddle factors. These findings highlight the
    potential of our proposed architecture for efficient hardware implementations
    of FALCON-based cryptographic systems. Enhancing Renewable Energy-Grid Integration
    by Optimally Placed FACTS Devices: The Ni... Nnaemeka Sunday Ugwuanyi and 5 more
    April 01, 2024 The global shift towards renewable energy (RE) sources, driven
    by climate change and fossil fuel depletion, encounters challenges in integrating
    intermittent sources like wind and solar power into existing grids. Developing
    countries, such as Nigeria, with weak grids, face significant limitations on RE
    penetration. This study focuses on enhancing RE grid integration in Nigeria by
    strategically deploying Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS)
    devices. Results obtained from the Nigerian grid indicate that FACTS devices,
    particularly STATCOMs, can extend the penetration limit by 40%, enabling an additional
    152 MW of wind energy to be integrated without jeopardizing system stability.
    Improved voltage profiles and enhanced stability highlight the effectiveness of
    FACTS devices in facilitating RE integration into weak grids. Thus, developing
    grids can accommodate more renewable energy without extensive reconfiguration
    of the power system architecture. Doppler Shift Distribution in Satellite Constellations
    Akram Al-Hourani April 01, 2024 Doppler shift has significant implications in
    Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations due to the rapid relative movement of satellites.
    This paper presents a novel approach based on stochastic geometry to capture the
    statistical distribution of Doppler shift in modern mega satellite constellations.
    We derive a simplified expression for both the Doppler shift s-curve and its maximum
    value, highlighting the dependency of Doppler shifts on the zenith angle of the
    closest approach during a satellite pass. Additionally, we present a stochastic
    model for the distribution of these zenith angles within the random constellation
    model. Furthermore, the statistical distribution of the Doppler bound is analytically
    formulated and validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations of two major
    satellite constellations currently in orbit. Effect of Presenting Stiffness of
    Robot Hand to Human on Human-Robot Handovers Junya Yamamoto and 2 more April 01,
    2024 In the present study, we focus on the object handover task as a major example
    of collaborative work between a human and a robot. To achieve a smooth handover
    between two different agents, their mutual communication is indispensable for
    understanding the other’s intentions. However, previous research has not dealt
    with a moment during handover in which a robot takes the object from a human grasp
    or in which a robot hands the object to the human. It should be noted that the
    performance during those phases is crucial to the success or failure of the tasks
    because slight changes in the kinematics of the relationship between hands or
    fingers and object result in significant changes in grasping status: the human
    may forcibly pull out the object while the robot is grasping it or drop the object.
    Therefore, this study aims to realize a smooth handover between a human and a
    robot, focusing on the moment of object handover. To this end, this paper proposes
    to present the stiffness of the robot hand to the human. We conducted the subject
    experiments to investigate the effect of this method on humans in the human-robot
    interaction. Experimental results show that this presentation method enables the
    worker to recognize the stiffness of the robot, which is difficult to recognize
    visually, thereby reducing the workload and allowing the worker to respond seamlessly
    to changes in the robot’s stiffness. VABAM: Variational Autoencoder for Amplitude-based
    Biosignal Augmentation within Morp... Junetae Kim and 2 more April 01, 2024 Pulsatile
    physiological signals, characterized by rhythmic fluctuations, are vital for assessing
    health conditions and are widely used in wellness devices and medical equipment.
    Despite their significance, models addressing domain-specific unmet needs and
    considerations have not been developed as much as in other fields. Therefore,
    building on the foundation of variational autoencoders, we introduce VABAM, a
    novel model for the amplitude-based synthesis of pulsatile physiological signals.
    The uniqueness of VABAM lies in its ability to maintain the morphological identity
    of signals throughout the synthesis process, achieved by integrating pass filter
    effects within the variational autoencoder architecture. To assess the effectiveness
    of the model, we developed three novel metrics based on joint mutual information.
    These metrics were aimed at evaluating the disentanglement of latent spaces, influence
    of ancillary information on signal morphologies, and controllability of amplitude-based
    synthesis within morphological identities. Comparative analyses demonstrated that
    VABAM and its variants were notably effective at preserving morphological integrity,
    highlighting their potential to minimize morphological distortions in physiological
    signal processing and their compatibility with artificial intelligence models
    employing frequency and amplitude features. Additionally, the proposed metrics,
    compatible with probabilistic models, were empirically proven to capture the characteristics
    of various models from multiple perspectives. In-and-Out Weight Box: A novel approach
    for better network compression and feature se... DaeYoung Kim April 01, 2024 Under
    the commonalities found in the goals of two areas, neural network compression
    and feature selection for dimension reduction, this research focused on finding
    a new method to address both issues: a method that can lead to easier feature
    selection, and an enhancement in the capacity of information flow control of neural
    network compression techniques, especially clustering based compression. Specifically,
    this research focused on creating a novel and effective framework to transform
    the weight matrix between the input layer and the first hidden layer in neural
    networks to be optimal. In other words, a method that can make the weight matrix''s
    structure itself optimal for information extraction. By proposing a simple, yet
    powerful weight clipping + GMM based method called an In-and-Out Weight Box that
    can intrinsically act similar to filtering while increasing the possibility of
    getting better results in compression, the main aim of research was found to be
    satisfied. Using Glioma Grading data from the UCI Repository for checking performance
    of the In-and-Out Weight box in fitting neural networks, it was found that significantly
    better compression results can be achieved in terms of weight sharing via clustering.
    This research also suggests a new feature selection method based on the In-and-Out
    Weight box constraint called IOW-FI, which can lead to solving limitations or
    problems of filtering techniques such as setting the number of components to be
    selected as efficient features or considering joint distributions of feature space.
    Is Complexity an Illusion? Michael Timothy Bennett April 02, 2024 Simplicity is
    held by many to be the key to general intelligence. Simpler models tend to “generalise”,
    identifying the cause or generator of data with greater sample efficiency. The
    implications of the correlation between simplicity and generalisation extend far
    beyond computer science, addressing questions of physics and even biology. Yet
    simplicity is a property of form, while generalisation is of function. In interactive
    settings, any correlation between the two depends on interpretation. In theory
    there could be no correlation and yet in practice, there is. Previous theoretical
    work showed generalisation to be a consequence of “weak” constraints implied by
    function, not form. Experiments demonstrated choosing weak constraints over simple
    forms yielded a 110 − 500% improvement in generalisation rate. Here we show that
    if one does not presuppose an abstraction layer, then all forms have equal complexity.
    However, in the context of a spatially and temporally extended abstraction layer,
    efficiency demands weak constraints take simple forms, and simplicity becomes
    correlated with generalisation. Simplicity has no causal influence on generalisation,
    but appears to due to confounding. ← Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 … 508 509 Next

    \ capability of 5G with low delay, high density, and large\nbandwidth provides\
    \ a communication guarantee for the application of other information\ntechnologies\
    \ in the smart agricultural Internet of Things. Smart agriculture has relied on\
    \ the\nﬁfth generation of information technology 5G, the Internet of Things, robotics,\
    \ drones, big\ndata, AI, machine learning, blockchain, and other key technologies\
    \ to transform modern\nagriculture. It realizes the deep integration of the physical\
    \ world and the information\nworld, changing the current mode of agricultural\
    \ production. Industry-oriented universal\nwide-area Internet of Things is becoming\
    \ the main force [9]. It can promote the expansion\nand upgrading of IoTs in smart\
    \ agriculture and expedite the landing application of big data\nin smart agriculture.\
    \ It is the key to the in-depth application of UAV in agriculture and is\nan important\
    \ booster for integrating artiﬁcial intelligence and robot blockchain in smart\n\
    agriculture [10].\nThe Internet of Things continues to evolve with the evolution\
    \ of information technol-\nogy and sensors. It should not only perceive and transmit\
    \ data but also have functions such\nas recognition, computation, service, semantics,\
    \ and even cognitive decision-making [11].\nThe detection, management, and maintenance\
    \ functions of the Internet of Things will\nalso gradually become intelligent\
    \ and unmanned. The in-depth integration of the Inter-\nnet of Things, big data,\
    \ and artiﬁcial intelligence will revolutionize the current form of\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2336\n5 of 46\nthe Internet of Things and generate huge social value\
    \ [12]. As an important part of new\ndigital infrastructure, the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) is deeply integrated with 5G, big data,\ncloud computing, artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ blockchain, digital twin, and other technologies,\nand is evolving into a smart\
    \ IoT system (IoTs 2.0) [13], which is profoundly changing\nthe process of the\
    \ modern agricultural industry and promoting the rapid development of\nsmart agriculture.\n\
    In the ﬁeld of smart agriculture, the Agricultural Internet of Things (AIoT) is\
    \ devel-\noping rapidly, but still faces many challenges. This includes the new\
    \ application of the\nagricultural scene, the transformation of the new agricultural\
    \ production mode, and the\ndeep integration with other technologies. As a basic\
    \ condition for the in-depth application\nof the agricultural Internet of Things,\
    \ 5G communication technology will promote the\nin-depth application of the agricultural\
    \ Internet of Things in smart agriculture. 5G can\nprovide MTC communication with\
    \ high reliability, low delay, and wide coverage, and its\nthree typical application\
    \ scenarios have broad prospects in smart agriculture [14]. 5G IoT\ntechnology\
    \ can be extended to the scope of current, which cannot be achieved with the\n\
    ﬁeld, making IoT depth perception of the intelligent environment perception, enlarging\n\
    the coverage of the Internet of Things of agriculture and the ascending scale,\
    \ expanding\nthe communication capacity, and realizing large-scale equipment interact\
    \ with each other\nand data sharing so as to realize the agricultural decision-making\
    \ process depth [15]. 5G-\nIoT is expected to provide real-time, on-demand, online,\
    \ reconﬁgurable, and end-to-end\ncoordinated capabilities for a variety of agricultural\
    \ applications. It can provide logically\nindependent network applications and\
    \ conﬁgure networks on demand. According to the\nfuture agricultural needs, the\
    \ integration of 5G with smart agriculture and the Internet of\nThings will be\
    \ able to achieve network characteristics, as shown in Figure 5.\nof the modern\

    \ rapid detection of crop diseases, pests, weeds, farmland\nwater quality, and\
    \ soil, provide ﬁne-grained nutrition, ventilation, and water supply for\ncrops,\
    \ and improve productivity [48,49].\nIn the 5G smart farm [50], the shading system,\
    \ fresh air system, cooling system,\nfertilization and watering system, data acquisition\
    \ system, and light supplement system\nachieved 5G control. For example, intelligent\
    \ glass greenhouse food production can also\nachieve substantial growth. Mobile\
    \ robots based on 5G can complete panoramic collection.\nAlong with the cultivation\
    \ tank of the greenhouse, it automatically completes inspection,\nﬁxed-point collection,\
    \ automatic return, automatic charging, and other actions. If there\nare obstacles\

    \ transmission based on edge computing devices and artiﬁcial intelligence, improve\n\
    quick response ability, and realize front-end intelligent decision-making [51].\

    \ With the continuous development of video acquisition equip-\nment, HD images\
    \ and videos are becoming increasingly popular. Optimizing data trans-\nmission\
    \ has always been a challenge. The integrated application of smart agriculture\
    \ based\non 5G is a big direction.\n2.2.2. Large-Scale Machine Type Communication\
    \ (mMTC) in Smart Agricultural IoT\nSmart agricultural IoT is the next generation\
    \ of agricultural IoT for smart agriculture.\nIt needs a depth perception of the\
    \ agricultural production process. Large-scale agricultural\nproduction scenarios\
    \ require large-scale sensing nodes to transmit data [56]. Traditional\nsensor\
    \ networks have some difﬁculties in networking reliability, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ and\ndeployment cost. However, large-scale machine-type communication based\
    \ on 5G can\nachieve a smart agricultural IoT with low cost, high reliability,\
    \ low power consumption,\nand convenient networking and deployment. For example,\
    \ NB-IoT can be deployed to\nquickly monitor soil, fertilizer, and plants in farmland.\
    \ In this way, the comprehensive\nperception and depth perception of agricultural\
    \ production can be realized, providing\nsupport for the deepening application\
    \ of smart agriculture [57].\n5G-oriented NB-IoT enables dense sensing network\
    \ deployment. Combining com-\nputer vision and other technologies can effectively\
    \ extract plant phenotypic variation\nand its related information. Moreover, machine\
    \ learning, artiﬁcial intelligence, and other\ncutting-edge technologies are used\
    \ for processing [58]. Deep learning convolutional neural\nnetworks were used\
    \ to evaluate crop phenotypic characteristics and soil conditions. Multi-\nspectral\
    \ imaging in agricultural areas is based on IoT sensors and small unmanned aerial\n\
    vehicles (UAVs). It identiﬁes plant quality and leaf diseases.\n2.2.3. Ultra-Reliable\
    \ Low Latency Communication (uRLLC) in Smart Agricultural IoT\nSuch ultra-reliable\
    \ low-latency communication applications are generally oriented to\nmission-critical,\
    \ real-time transmission of critical data and control of major agricultural\n\
    equipment [59]. Drones based on 5G networks can achieve precision operations.\
    \ The\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n12 of 46\nﬂight trajectory and situation data\
    \ of the UAV can be returned to the 5G network UAV\nmanagement and operation platform\
    \ in real-time through the 5G network. Flight status can\nbe monitored in real-time\
    \ [60]. Through the agricultural information collected by UAV and\nsatellite remote\
    \ sensing technology, the platform can intelligently and dynamically analyze\n\
    the crop situation in the monitoring region, make a macroscopic estimation of\
    \ the real-time\nseedling situation, environmental dynamics and distribution of\
    \ crops, and output scientiﬁc\nreports [61]. According to the report, farmers\
    \ can clearly grasp the growth situation of\ncrops and soil moisture and manage\
    \ production in response to problems so as to ensure\nmore scientiﬁc and efﬁcient\
    \ farming activities.\nThe universal application of 5G will provide the communication\
    \ basis for unmanned,\nintelligent, and intelligent agricultural machinery and\
    \ equipment because 5G technology\nhas the characteristics of high speed, short\
    \ delay, low power consumption, ubiquitous\nnetwork, and scalability. It will\
    \ shine in the ﬁelds of agricultural Internet of Things,\nprecision planting,\
    \ agricultural products circulation traceability, agricultural drones, smart\n\
    farming, agricultural industry services, and so on, and promote agriculture to\
    \ be more\ninformationalized and intelligent [62,63].\n2.3. Future Trends and\
    \ Key Technologies of 5G-IoT Application in Smart Agriculture\nIt can be seen\
    \ from the above analysis that the integration of 5G and IoT has a wide\napplication\
    \ prospect in the scenario of smart agriculture. Agricultural IoT can be used\
    \ to\ncollect environmental monitoring information on crop growth and process\
    \ this information\nto develop the production plan of precision agriculture. Precision\
    \ agriculture requires\nthe network to support the connection of massive devices\
    \ and a large number of small\ndata packets. Since agricultural IoT devices are\
    \ often deployed in areas where signals are\nchallenging to reach, such as mountains,\
    \ forests, and waters, 5G can meet the requirements\nwith stronger coverage capability,\
    \ ﬂexibility, scalability, and lower power consumption,\ndelay, and cost. The\
    \ future trends of intelligent agricultural IoT facing 5G mainly reﬂect\nthe following:\n\
    1.\nCloud edge collaboration: agricultural monitoring terminal and cloud collaboration.\n\
    2.\nCloud computing/AI/big data/Internet of Things/digital twin and other agricul-\n\
    tural integration.\n3.\nVirtualization and servitization of perception/access/communication\
    \ layer, software\ndeﬁned network.\n4.\nModel-driven, cloud-native new application\
    \ (APP) development environment for\nsmart Internet of Things.\n5.\nThe deep integration\
    \ of people, information space, and physical space will form\na deep intelligent\
    \ smart agriculture and achieve a harmonious ecology of human–\nmachine symbiosis.\n\
    The key technologies of IoT applications in smart agriculture include vital informa-\n\
    tion sensor technology, phenotype information acquisition technology, phenotype\
    \ group\ndata analysis technology, phenotype group big data management and database\
    \ building\ntechnology, etc. [64,65]. All these technologies need the support\
    \ of 5G. Among them,\nthe life information sensor technology collects information\
    \ about seeds and their propa-\ngation/seed production environment and obtains\
    \ the corresponding physiological and\necological information through signal transformation\
    \ and AI data processing. Phenotypic\ninformation acquisition technology automatically\
    \ extracts important phenotypic features\nand logical relationships from massive\
    \ amounts of information to realize automatic and\naccurate identiﬁcation of phenotypic\
    \ traits. Phenotypic data analysis technology covers the\ncomplete process from\

    \ Intelligent Agricultural IoT 2.0 for 5G\nIntelligent Internet of Things (IoT\
    \ 2.0) refers to a complex system that integrates “hu-\nman, information space\
    \ and physical space” [66] under the guidance of 5G and other\ncommunication technologies\
    \ and AI technologies and intelligently interconnects and serves\ncooperatively.\
    \ Among them, the new generation of AI technologies includes data-driven\ndeep\
    \ reinforcement learning intelligence, network-based swarm intelligence, hybrid\
    \ in-\ntelligence oriented by human–machine and brain–computer interaction technology,\
    \ cross-\nmedia inference intelligence, autonomous intelligent system, etc. The\
    \ “wisdom” of the\nsmart IoT system refers to the interconnection of people, information\
    \ space and physi-\ncal space, and the digitalization, IoT, servitization (cloud),\
    \ collaboration, customization,\nﬂexibility, greenness, and intelligence of the\
    \ layered and progressive system [67].\nThe Internet of Things is evolving into\
    \ the next generation. Under the role of 5G, the\nInternet of Things combined\
    \ with big data, machine learning, cloud services, and so on, will\nhave intelligent\
    \ characteristics. It can make the physical process and the information world\n\
    deep integration. The network level of the Internet of Things mainly includes\
    \ monitoring,\ndetection, computing, service, and control from bottom to top,\
    \ and these connotations will\nalso undergo profound changes.\n3.1. 5G Smart Agricultural\
    \ IoT 2.0 Architecture\nWith the rapid development of video business and various\
    \ vertical business applica-\ntions in smart agriculture, centralized data storage\
    \ and processing modes will face difﬁcult\nbottlenecks and pressures. The existing\
    \ Internet of Things architecture is difﬁcult to meet\nthe data return of big\
    \ data, which easily deteriorates network indicators and affects user\nexperience.\
    \ In this case, data processing capabilities and services need to be provided\n\
    near the edge of the network where the data are generated. With the development\
    \ of\n5G and the availability of relevant business requirements and network conditions,\
    \ edge\ncomputing has gradually achieved great development. Agricultural IoT is\
    \ evolving to\nSmart Agricultural IoT 2.0, where edge computing can alleviate\
    \ these defects of centralized\nIoT, and transfer computing tasks to the edge\
    \ service side to signiﬁcantly improve delay\nand energy consumption, especially\
    \ for delay and energy-sensitive IoT applications.\n5G IoT for smart agriculture\
    \ achieves optimal resource allocation through network\nslicing, SDN/VFN, and\
    \ other technologies. However, due to a large amount of sensing\ndata in the smart\
    \ agriculture scene, the real-time requirement is high. With the increase in\n\
    terminal computing power, the network architecture for smart agriculture will\
    \ also change.\nThe architecture of a smart IoT system is shown in Figure 11.\n\
    5G-based agricultural IoT can be implemented by deploying edge computing based\
    \ on\napplication needs. Edge computing migrates IT resources, such as computing\
    \ and storage,\nfrom traditional cloud data centers to users. IT shortens the\
    \ physical distance between\nusers and IT resources, achieves lower data interaction\
    \ delay, and saves network trafﬁc.\nThis provides users with low latency and high\
    \ stability of IT solutions. Edge computation\ndepends on edge nodes. The requirements\
    \ of edge nodes for smart agricultural IoT are\nnot strictly regulated. Compared\
    \ with the general sensor node thought and its computing\npower, the communication\
    \ ability is stronger. The deployment position is usually at the\nend of the network,\
    \ that is, the application site. After IoT edge applications are deployed,\nedge\
    \ nodes serve as extensions of remote IoT platforms on devices. Devices are managed\n\
    through cloud-edge collaboration. Edge nodes can provide computing and management\n\
    services for nearby devices, such as local management of low-latency services,\
    \ local control,\nand rule execution when disconnected from the cloud. The device\
    \ accesses the edge node\nand ﬁnally uploads data to the remote IoT platform through\
    \ the edge node, as shown in\nFigure 12.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n14 of 46\n\

    \ Monitoring Terminals\nA large number of sensing devices will be deployed in\
    \ the smart agricultural IoT for\nbreeding moisture monitoring, ﬁne agriculture,\
    \ and other scenarios. How to access massive\nterminals in LPWA for 5G low-power\
    \ wide area networks [85] is a challenging problem.\nWith the continuous improvement\
    \ of the capabilities of the air interface at the access end,\nthe performance\
    \ bottleneck of the whole system is gradually reﬂected in the core end, edge\n\
    end, and other areas. Therefore, there must also be corresponding innovative technologies\n\
    at the core or edge end to meet the nearly demanding requirements of 5G IoT applications\n\
    in the future [86]. However, the existing cellular network core architecture is\
    \ not suitable\nfor the development of the Internet of Things.\nThe deployment\
    \ of 5G has created the possibility for large-scale and intensive IoT\ndeployment,\
    \ but there are also challenges concerning reliable access and data transmission\n\
    and processing, as shown in Figure 21.\n3.3. Reliable Data-Driven Detection of\

    \ and unstructured types of data. They are\nwidely used in smart agriculture scenarios.\
    \ When the sensing data are rich enough, the\ncomplex event rules can be established\
    \ through various moisture data and crop growth\nmodels to determine whether drip\
    \ irrigation and fertilization are needed [88,89]. In ﬁsh\nfarming, data collected\
    \ by various sensor devices deployed in ponds are used to determine\nwhether there\
    \ is a lack of oxygen or other complex events, and so on.\nThe detection conditions\
    \ of complex events ﬁrstly need rich physical world data, and\nenough sensing\
    \ devices need to be deployed so that various relationships can be discovered.\n\
    Second, complex computational processing power is required. For pattern matching\
    \ and\nso on, we need quick calculation and judgment. In addition, some complex\
    \ event detection\nis real-time, and these requirements become feasible with 5G.\n\
    3.3.2. Depth Detection of Pests and Diseases Based on Machine Learning\nWith the\
    \ development of information technology, methods based on machine learning\nhave\
    \ been widely used in agricultural production in recent years. Many scholars combine\n\
    image processing with pattern recognition, and widely use it in crop disease and\
    \ pest\nrecognition. The color, shape, texture, and other parameters extracted\
    \ were screened and\noptimized. The linear classiﬁer, Bayesian decision theory,\
    \ fuzzy recognition, and other\npattern recognition techniques were used to identify\
    \ and classify various crop pests and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n22 of 46\n\
    diseases, which improved the recognition accuracy. Thus, the development of agricultural\n\
    informatization and precision was further promoted [90].\nAs an important branch\
    \ of machine learning, deep learning network is becoming\na hot technology with\
    \ its powerful data analysis ability. Deep learning networks can\ncontain hundreds\
    \ of hidden layers, and the features will be transformed a lot of times.\nDeep\
    \ learning can be applied to identify crop pests and disease targets. For achieving\n\
    the relationship ﬁtting of complex sample data, the core idea is not only to automatically\n\
    extract multi-layer feature representations from a large amount of data through\
    \ a variety of\nlinear and nonlinear transformations but also to complete the\
    \ task of feature extraction and\ntransformation using supervised and unsupervised\
    \ combined training methods [91]. Due\nto the structure of a deep neural network,\
    \ the error features extracted by the previous layer\nnetwork can be weakened\
    \ to a certain extent, and the complex function can be expressed\nwith fewer parameters.\
    \ The structure of the deep neural network will be more compact,\nwhich improves\
    \ the efﬁciency and performance of the network.\nIt is obvious that the current\
    \ methods with strong pattern recognition ability are\nparticularly dependent\
    \ on a large amount of data, which requires enough data to draw\nuseful conclusions.\
    \ The traditional agricultural IoT data are limited, which is challenging to\n\
    support the data collection needs of future smart agriculture development. The\
    \ introduction\nof 5G and smart agricultural IoT provides conditions for the collection\
    \ of massive data.\n3.4. Cloud Edge Fog Computing Fusion in 5G Intelligent Agricultural\
    \ Internet of Things\nIn future smart agricultural IoT, data will be extremely\
    \ abundant, and how to conduct\nanalysis and calculation from these data to guide\
    \ modern agricultural production is an\nimportant challenge.\nDue to the limitations\
    \ of volume and battery life, many mobile devices deployed in\nagricultural production\
    \ cannot meet the requirements of these applications in terms of\ncomputing, storage,\
    \ energy, and other resources. Therefore, Mobile Cloud Computing\n(MCC) technology\
    \ has been proposed. It provides reorganized computing resources for\nmobile devices\
    \ in the cloud platform, migrates data processing and storage to the cloud,\n\
    and reduces constraints on its own resources. With the development of smart agriculture,\n\
    massive data will be generated in the future to be analyzed, processed, and stored\
    \ in the\ncentral cloud [92]. At the same time, there may be a large number of\
    \ connections between\nsensing devices, and these MCCS cannot meet the demand.\
    \ New computing methods, such\nas edge computing and fog computing, will be integrated\
    \ into the intelligent agricultural\nIoT system [93]. Edge sensors no longer need\
    \ to continuously transmit various sensing\ndata to the data center. It can judge\
    \ the sensing data on its own, contacting the data center\nonly when there is\
    \ a signiﬁcant change in the reading to decide what action to take. Cloud\ncomputing\
    \ is suitable for non-real-time, long-period data, and business decision scenarios,\n\
    while edge computing plays an irreplaceable role in real-time, short-period data,\
    \ and local\ndecision-making. Edge computing and cloud computing are two important\
    \ supports for\nthe digital transformation of the industry. Their collaboration\
    \ in the network, business,\napplication, intelligence, and other aspects will\
    \ help support the agricultural IoT to create\ngreater value. Intelligent edge\
    \ computing based on 5G power can use the cloud for large-\nscale security conﬁguration,\
    \ deployment, the management of edge devices, and the ability\nto assign intelligence\
    \ based on device type and scenario, allowing intelligence to ﬂow\nbetween the\
    \ cloud and the edge. The edge computing model in smart agriculture is shown\n\
    in Figure 22.\nSecondly, with the continuous enrichment of data in smart agricultural\
    \ IoT, the tra-\nditional forms of computing will become richer and richer. Distributed\
    \ computing based\non cloud computing, fog computing, and other forms will be\
    \ deeply integrated with 5G\ncommunication capabilities and applied to smart agriculture.\
    \ Agriculture, for wisdom in\ngreenhouse cultivation, oriented precision fertilization,\
    \ aquaculture, animal husbandry,\nand aquaculture, the scene such as plant monitoring,\
    \ needs the edge of the Internet of\nThings system IoT terminal according to the\

    \ Agricultural IoT Application Paradigm under 5G\n4.1. Typical Application Scenarios\
    \ of 5G Smart Agricultural IoT\nThe development of 5G network will provide the\
    \ infrastructure needed for smart\nagriculture for agricultural production. The\
    \ main application scenarios include the follow-\ning aspects.\n4.1.1. Smart Farm\n\
    The two characteristics of 5G network, high speed and large connection, will help\n\
    the agricultural industry implement large-scale machine services. Centralized\
    \ control\nof environmental sensors, planters, UAVs, and other monitoring equipment\
    \ and real-\ntime data transmission. Finally, the purpose of intensive farming,\
    \ accurate fertilization,\nand reasonable irrigation is achieved [97]. Agricultural\
    \ machinery automatic agricultural\nmachinery equipment based on 5G was integrated\
    \ to achieve rapid, large-area, efﬁcient,\nand precise spraying operation [98].\n\
    4.1.2. Smart Forestry\nSmart forestry utilizes 5G network video, UAV, and other\
    \ monitoring equipment to\ncarry out forest inspection, realize the monitoring\
    \ of forest resources, forest pests and\ndiseases, wild animals and plants, forest\
    \ ﬁre prevention, and provide guide and rescue\nservices for staff and tourists\
    \ [99].\n4.1.3. Intelligent Animal Husbandry\n5G intelligent animal husbandry\
    \ can improve the production efﬁciency of animal\nhusbandry, reduce the cost of\
    \ breeding, prevent livestock epidemic and livestock loss, and\nprotect animal\
    \ husbandry ecology [100,101]. For example, the use of 5G drone technology,\n\
    wearing 5G terminals on the necks of cows, and the use of Internet of Things technology\
    \ to\nmanage yaks have brought great changes to the traditional herding work of\
    \ plateau herders.\n4.1.4. Smart Fishing Ground\n5G smart ﬁshing grounds use monitoring\
    \ equipment such as high-deﬁnition net-\nwork cameras and underwater camera systems\
    \ to carry out real-scene monitoring, aquatic\nproduct growth monitoring, and\
    \ precise bait casting to improve the safety of underwater\noperations and save\
    \ labor costs [102]. In the Marine ranch, 5G panoramic monitoring appli-\ncation\
    \ is realized through 5G coverage. The panoramic high-deﬁnition camera equipment\n\
    and 5G underwater camera system were set up to realize the 24-h panoramic monitoring\
    \ of\nthe ranch. Managers can observe the growth of aquatic products, including\
    \ underwater\nobservation, from their ofﬁces or homes through mobile phones [103].\
    \ Based on 5G technol-\nogy, the intelligent control of the production process\
    \ of Marine cash crops, including kelp\nand other seedlings, can also be realized,\
    \ making it possible to have unmanned Marine\nranching.\n4.2. Deep Sense of 5G\

    \ the existing\nagricultural machinery equipment and make it more intelligent.\
    \ Intelligent agricultural\nmachinery can perceive its position, surrounding environment\
    \ relationship, and the inter-\nnal working state of machinery by building machine\
    \ vision, multi-dimensional perception,\nand satellite positioning based on 5G\
    \ agricultural Internet of Things. It can achieve good\ncooperation and scientiﬁc\
    \ implementation, effectively improving the effect of agricultural\nmechanization\
    \ by controlling and operating each process. Intelligent agricultural machin-\n\
    ery 5G-based agricultural Internet of Things can realize real-time monitoring\
    \ of agricultural\nmachinery’s own condition, operating state of machinery and\
    \ tools, meteorological condi-\ntions, and operating environment. It can also\
    \ guide agricultural machinery to adjust the\noperation plan in time according\
    \ to the obtained information and effectively reduce the\nindustrial machinery\
    \ in the process of operation failure, such as machine damage, poor\nquality,\
    \ and other problems. In addition to the above, intelligent agricultural machinery\n\
    will reduce the amount of ineffective operation of industrial machinery. Energy\
    \ efﬁciency\nhas been signiﬁcantly improved. The precise operation also realizes\
    \ the precise applica-\ntion of pesticides and fertilizers and truly realizes\
    \ the requirements of energy-saving and\nenvironmental protection.\nIt is clear\
    \ that smart agriculture combined with the Internet of Things and machine\nlearning\
    \ algorithm big data can transform traditional agricultural machinery and equip-\n\
    ment, making them more intelligent. In addition, the operation of intelligent\
    \ detection\nand sensing equipment can realize the functions of agricultural machinery\
    \ positioning,\nreal-time statistics of agricultural machinery working area, and\
    \ real-time calculation of\noperation quality. The system supports a variety of\
    \ agricultural machinery operations such\nas sowing, transplanting, plant protection,\
    \ harvesting, deep loosening, and land prepara-\ntion, straw returning, and so\
    \ on. It can measure fuel consumption and obtain the working\ncondition information\
    \ of agricultural machinery in real-time. This facilitates the control\nof agricultural\
    \ production progress and facilitates the real-time control of the working\narea,\
    \ working quality, and working power consumption. Being based on geospatial remote\n\
    sensing technology, multi-sensor fusion technology, 5G technology, and big data\
    \ technology,\nthe system realizes the comprehensive upgrading of smart agricultural\
    \ machinery.\n4.3.2. Automatic Driving of Agricultural Machinery\nThe automatic\
    \ driving technology of agricultural machinery is to use high-precision\nsatellite\
    \ positioning and navigation information and controls the hydraulic system of\n\
    agricultural machinery by the controller so that the agricultural machinery can\
    \ drive\nautomatically according to the set route (straight line or curve). It\
    \ can effectively improve\nthe working accuracy, improve the land utilization\
    \ rate, reduce the labor intensity of\nmachine hands, and extend the working time\
    \ (ﬁeld work can also be carried out at night).\nMoreover, it is easy to operate\
    \ and reduces the requirement for the driving ability of the\nmanipulator [121,122].\
    \ Based on the Beidou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) [123,124], a\nglobal Positioning\
    \ system (GPS) can achieve intelligent driving of all kinds of agricultural\n\
    machinery, including rice transplanters, seed drills, combine harvesters, etc.\
    \ The high-\nprecision positioning and navigation technology, image recognition,\
    \ and transmission\ntechnology are applied to the intelligent driving of these\
    \ machines to realize the precise\nnavigation of agricultural machinery driving\
    \ and automatically complete the land tillage,\nsowing, ﬁeld management, and harvest,\
    \ as shown in Figure 32.\nIntelligent agricultural machinery automatic driving\
    \ system uses satellite positioning,\nmechanical control, inertial navigation,\

    \ \nAgricultural products have various production processes, long cycles, and\
    \ numerous \nfactors, so it is challenging to realize standardized production\
    \ and management [130]. The \nsupply chain of agricultural products is in all\
    \ stages of agriculture before, during, and \nafter production. Participants participate\
    \ in different roles of producers and consumers to \nrealize the supply and circulation\
    \ of agricultural products among agricultural producers, \nagricultural materials/agricultural\
    \ service enterprises, wholesale and retail markets, reg-\nulatory agencies, and\

    \ \nand information flow. It is important to establish a chain structure network\
    \ composed of \nagricultural product suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers,\
    \ and end consumers \n[131]. Traditional agricultural supply chain participants\
    \ mainly use the Internet of Things \ntechnology to achieve information collection,\

    independent, unable to quickly and effectively complete the exchange of information,\
    \ the\nreal realization of the whole process of sharing, presentation, and other\
    \ difﬁculties.\nThe traditional Internet is to reduce intermediate links, reduce\
    \ transaction costs,\nexpand the scope of service, improve service quality, and\
    \ so on. Embedding blockchain\ntechnology may deepen the meaning of the Internet.\
    \ It can form credit by recording, storing,\ntransferring, verifying, and analyzing\
    \ information data programmatically. Blockchain can\nsave a great deal of labor\
    \ costs and intermediary costs, and the recorded credit information\nis completer\
    \ and more difﬁcult to fake. The internal structure of the network architecture\

    \ smart agriculture Internet of Things.\nThese new problems bring new challenges\
    \ to the application of smart agriculture.\nMany of these key issues may be partially\
    \ solved with the introduction of 5G technology.\n5G is the infrastructure of\
    \ the intelligent era. Its characteristics of “extremely high\nspeed, enormous\
    \ capacity and extremely low delay” can provide basic support for meeting\nthe\
    \ development needs of smart agriculture in the future. Compared with the 2–4G\
    \ era,\nthe demand for base stations and network control equipment has increased\
    \ signiﬁcantly\nin 5G. The large-scale application of 5G technology not only increases\
    \ the cost of network\ninfrastructure, but also the cost of power and operation,\
    \ and maintenance is much higher\nthan that of 4G, which brings challenges to\
    \ the ﬁeld agricultural production with low added\nvalue. However, 5G technology\
    \ still has limits when it comes to applications such as virtual\nreality, intelligent\
    \ production, and driverless driving. First, the deployment of 5G base\nstations\
    \ is not balanced. As many 5G base stations are distributed in sparsely populated\n\
    areas, such as ﬁelds, agriculture, and farming, there may be only a few 5G base\
    \ stations\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n35 of 46\nin these areas, which cannot\
    \ effectively cover all of them, which brings challenges to the\npopularization\
    \ and application. Secondly, the introduction of 5G will bring a change of the\n\
    whole smart agriculture application paradigm. The architecture, perception, transmission,\n\
    computing, service, processing, and application mode of 5G Internet of Things\
    \ for smart\nagriculture will bring changes, and there will be challenges.\n5.1.\
    \ Fusion and Optimization of Sparse 5G Base Station and Heterogeneous Sensing\
    \ Network in\nSmart Agriculture\n5.1.1. Optimization of Hybrid Deployment of 5G\
    \ and Sensing Network\nAccording to the analysis, the characteristics of 5G network\
    \ in agriculture are sparse,\nuneven, and they have low coverage of network base\
    \ stations and slow deployment of\nfarm base stations in remote areas. This brings\
    \ challenges for the application of 5G in ﬁeld\nagriculture and plantation agriculture.\n\
    For this imbalance and sparsity feature, it can be conﬁgured from two aspects.\
    \ One is\nto optimize the deployment of sensing nodes, and the other is to deploy\
    \ in combination\nwith heterogeneous networks. The hybrid deployment strategy\
    \ for ﬁeld agriculture, for ex-\nample, 5G sensing nodes are deployed in key areas,\
    \ and other sensing nodes are deployed\nin other areas, and sensing deployment\
    \ optimization is realized through network resource\nvirtualization and other\
    \ technologies. When the communication nodes of large-scale in-\ntelligent agricultural\
    \ sensor networks are deployed in three-dimensional space under the\nbackground\
    \ of 5G, the traditional random node deployment mode has the problems of high\n\
    energy consumption, high cost, and node disconnection. Firstly, by taking advantage\
    \ of the\ncharacteristics of the high bandwidth of 5G communication, a hierarchical\
    \ communication\nscheme can be designed, and a hierarchical node optimal deployment\
    \ model, a communi-\ncation energy consumption model, and a fully connected sensor\
    \ information transmission\nnetwork model are established. On the premise of ensuring\
    \ the full connectivity of sensor\ncommunication network nodes in farmland, the\
    \ life cycle of communication network nodes\nis improved.\n(a) 5G sparse deployment\
    \ based on ﬁeld agricultural planting scenarios.\nCombined with the actual ﬁeld\
    \ agricultural planting scene, the 5G base station has a\nhigh working frequency\
    \ band and a large signal attenuation, and its coverage radius is only\n0.3–0.5\
    \ times that of the 4G base station. It is difﬁcult to meet the goal of low cost\
    \ and high\nbeneﬁt of network construction only by deploying a macro base station.\
    \ The micro-base\nstation has a small coverage radius and low construction cost.\
    \ In order to optimize the\ndeployment cost of 5G base stations, the heterogeneous\
    \ network architecture of “macro\nand micro collaboration” can be adopted. How\
    \ to combine smart agricultural business for\noptimal deployment is an important\
    \ issue. Heterogeneous networks can optimize the cost\nof 5G signal deployment\
    \ while realizing the coverage of agricultural operation areas and\noptimizing\
    \ the perceived cost.\n(b) Intensive deployment optimization of 5G and sensing\
    \ nodes in ﬁne agriculture.\nIn ﬁne agriculture, there are many parameters to\
    \ monitor, many types of business, and\nthe need for intensive sensing equipment,\
    \ which generates an explosion of mobile data.\nHow to realize intelligent and\
    \ efﬁcient green deployment planning of intelligent nodes such\nas base stations\
    \ and gateways with large area coverage for various intelligent agricultural\n\
    applications is one of the key issues. By deploying small base stations with lower\
    \ cost\nand closer to users, it becomes a feasible solution to construct ultra-dense\
    \ heterogeneous\nnetworks centered on monitoring objects.\n5.1.2. Optimization\
    \ of 5G and Sensing Network Gateway Deployment\nPreviously, the deployment optimization\
    \ of sensing nodes and 5G base stations were\nproposed in ﬁne agriculture. In\
    \ the integration of 5G and sensing devices in deployment, it\nis necessary to\
    \ combine the collaboration of the Internet of Things gateway to realize the\n\
    high-low speed switching and transmission of sensing data.\nElectronics 2023,\
    \ 12, 2336\n36 of 46\n(a) The deployment of edge gateway in the Internet of Things.\
    \ The conditions of edge\ngateway coverage and service terminal trafﬁc generator,\
    \ the factors affecting the ofﬂoad-\ning delay of computing tasks, and the constraints\
    \ of edge gateway capacity allocation.\nFollowing that, the edge gateway deployment\
    \ optimization model was established and\noptimized.\n(b) To solve the problem\
    \ of base station deployment in the Low Power Wide Area\nNetwork (LPWAN), the\
    \ received signal values of all terminal test points can be predicted\nby combining\
    \ the terminal receiving signal prediction module. Then, the prediction results\n\
    are transformed into the weight values of all terminal test points during clustering,\
    \ and\nthe terminal test points are clustered. In addition, the location of the\
    \ base station was\nadjusted to achieve the optimal coverage effect and realize\
    \ the deployment optimization in\nthe whole application scenario.\n5.2. Optimization\
    \ Control under Edge Computing in 5G Intelligent Agricultural Production\nThe\
    \ popularization and application of 5G intelligent agricultural Internet of Things\
    \ will\nbring major challenges to the traditional cloud computing model, such\
    \ as high latency and\njitter, no support for location awareness and mobility,\
    \ and non-adaptive communication\ntypes. The production of smart agriculture often\
    \ needs to deploy edge computing to\nachieve real-time computing and reasonable\
    \ allocation of resources.\n5.2.1. Automatic Phenotype Monitoring Based on 5G\
    \ Internet of Things\nBy monitoring and sensing plant growth phenotype, the analysis\
    \ of crop traits is\nof great reference signiﬁcance for cultivating crop varieties\
    \ with excellent traits such as\ndrought resistance, poison resistance, lodging\
    \ resistance, high nutrient rate, and salt and\nalkali resistance. It helps researchers\
    \ select seeds of good quality for the next generation of\nbreeding objects. There\
    \ are many common image-based phenotyping methods in the ﬁeld\nof plant phenotype.\
    \ Among them, the image recognition method based on visible light has\nlower requirements\
    \ on experimental equipment, higher practicability, and can collect large-\nscale\
    \ plant image data. Therefore, the current deep learning can be better applied\
    \ to those\nalgorithms that use visible light images. All these require high-speed\
    \ data transmission,\nand how to collect and control real-time data in multi-source\
    \ sensing devices is a problem\nworth studying. At present, the main concern of\
    \ plant leaf recognition methods based on\nvisible light images is that there\
    \ are not many kinds of recognition methods. There are many\nresearchers working\
    \ on automatic phenotypic sensing platforms, which require automatic\nsensing\
    \ data pickup. Combining the advantages of high bandwidth and dense deployment\n\
    of 5G to realize automatic measurement and real-time computation of phenotype\
    \ is a\nproblem worth studying.\n5.2.2. Intelligent Sensing Real-Time Control\
    \ for Intelligent Agricultural Machinery\nMore intelligent agricultural machinery\
    \ will participate in the future smart agriculture.\nThey can combine 5G Internet\
    \ of Things and edge computing to realize smart agricultural\nproduction. Among\
    \ them they face the real-time control of equipment, which requires\nrapid data\
    \ collection and processing.\nIn the operation of smart agricultural machinery,\
    \ sensors deployed on the roadside of\nfarmland can sense all kinds of environments\
    \ and obtain important trafﬁc information. For\nexample, ﬁxed sensors such as\
    \ vision sensors and millimeter wave sensors are installed\non the side of the\
    \ road, and the information collected by the sensors is sent to the edge\nserver\
    \ for processing to extract information such as vehicle location and vehicle trajectory.\n\
    According to the multi-source information obtained by roadside sensors, crop sensors,\n\
    and smart agricultural sensing equipment, real-time data processing is carried\
    \ out to\nanalyze the operation status and calculate the results. Mobile edge\
    \ computing provides\npowerful computing and storage capabilities. The side camera\
    \ and millimeter wave radar\nare fused based on the edge server. Through data\
    \ preprocessing, space synchronization,\ntime synchronization, and tracking algorithm,\
    \ they can cooperate with each other, jointly\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n37\
    \ of 46\nbuilding an intelligent agricultural machinery environment sensing system\
    \ to make it more\nstable and reliable.\nDuring the operation of intelligent agricultural\
    \ machinery, target tracking should focus\non the following points: (1) Object\
    \ association: radar detection should be associated with\ncamera detection, while\
    \ the current fusion detection must be associated with the existing\ntrajectory;\
    \ (2) Tracking link: appropriate ﬁlter should be selected for tracking; (3) Tracking\n\
    management: tracking object database needs to be maintained.\n5.3. Scheduling\
    \ Optimization of Heterogeneous Nodes under 5G Smart Agriculture\nHow to optimize\
    \ the scheduling of sensing nodes in different rates, resources, and\nnetworks\
    \ is a problem to be studied in the intelligent agricultural IoT under 5G.\n5.3.1.\
    \ Sense Scheduling for 5G Smart Agriculture\nUnder such circumstances, how to\
    \ optimize the deployment of network resources and\nnodes to achieve better overall\
    \ network performance is a problem worth studying.\n(a). Sensing task collaboration\
    \ based on 5G: Sensing task collaboration is a hot issue in\nsensor networks.\
    \ Based on the connectivity, coverage, survivability, and task completion\nrequirements\
    \ of the network, this paper proposes a collaboration mechanism based on\nthe\
    \ limited energy, computing, and storage capacity of the sensing nodes and the\
    \ task\ncompletion requirements. The network topology is reconstructed by adjusting\
    \ the transmit\npower of nodes, neighbor selection, sleep scheduling, or mobile\
    \ node location. The decom-\nposition, assignment, scheduling, and execution of\
    \ tasks are accomplished cooperatively by\ncoordinating the behavior of mobile\
    \ sensor nodes. Topology reconstruction optimization is\nmainly carried out in\
    \ edge nodes and load balancing. In smart agriculture, the perception\nequipment\
    \ is more diverse, and the perception task is more complex.\n(b). Cooperative\
    \ scheduling of large agricultural machinery equipment: agriculture-\noriented\
    \ large agricultural machinery includes unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), mutual\n\
    sensing, and task coordination of multi-aerial robots. For example, building the\
    \ social\nInternet of Things creates a dynamic social network for each object\
    \ connected to the Internet\nof Things. Social networks are extended through node\
    \ proﬁles and trust levels to ﬁnd\nobjects that contribute to IoT applications\
    \ and solve resource management problems. Assign\nsensitive tasks fairly to objects\
    \ in the social network. How to optimize the sensing task\nof massive heterogeneous\
    \ sensing devices in the Internet of Things for smart agriculture.\nIt is still\
    \ a challenge to realize the efﬁcient collection of sensing data and the maximum\n\
    efﬁciency of network resources by abstracting network resources.\n5.3.2. Optimization\
    \ of 5G Network Signal Coverage Scheduling for Agricultural UAV\nIn addition to\
    \ the upstream and downstream rate, end-to-end delay of services, end-\nto-end\
    \ delay of control, and positioning accuracy, the coverage height of wireless\
    \ signals is\none of the most important requirements for 5G networks in agriculture.\n\
    According to the requirements of UAV network indicators in each scenario in IMT-\n\
    2020 (5G), Advance Group—White Paper on 5G UAV Application, the coverage height\n\
    requirements of wireless signals of networked UAV in the application ﬁeld are\
    \ shown in\nTable 9.\nOn the basis of the existing network, it is technically\
    \ feasible to deploy a small number\nof base stations for the 5G communication\
    \ requirements of agricultural UAVs. However,\nthe actual network planning still\
    \ needs to focus on several issues.\n(a) Adjacent area planning.\nIn order to\
    \ make connected UAVs ﬂy continuously in the air, in addition to seamless\n5G\
    \ wireless network signals, civil UAVs also need to be able to switch smoothly\
    \ between\ndifferent cells and different base stations. In this way, it is necessary\
    \ to cover the high\nlevel of the community to have a reasonable neighborhood\
    \ relationship. In addition, the\nUAV communication terminal needs to switch from\
    \ the low-level 5G wireless network\nto the high-level 5G wireless network when\
    \ taking off. This also requires reasonable\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n38 of\
    \ 46\nneighborhood planning between the 5G cell covering the high-rise and its\
    \ neighboring 5G\ncell. Similarly, the UAV communication terminal needs to switch\
    \ from the high-level 5G\nwireless network to the low-level 5G wireless network\
    \ when landing. It is also necessary to\nmake reasonable neighborhood planning\
    \ between the 5G cell covering the low layer and\nits adjacent high-rise 5G cell.\
    \ Its switching band is controlled at about 100 m in the air.\n(b) Interference\
    \ problem.\n5G wireless networks are also self-interfering systems. All base stations\
    \ share a band-\nwidth of 100 MHz. Therefore, it is necessary to control the coverage\
    \ of the signal through\nreasonable planning and optimization. In this way, it\
    \ is necessary to avoid discontinuous\ncoverage or blind coverage caused by insufﬁcient\
    \ signal, and to avoid interference in other\ncommunities due to over coverage.\
    \ At the same time, the mutual interference between\nthe 5G cell covering the\
    \ lower layer and the 5G cell covering the upper layer should be\navoided. Of\
    \ course, this will require a long period of experimentation and exploration.\n\

    \ Agricultural Platform\nSmart agriculture 5G-IoT faces increasing network scale\
    \ and density, dense terminal\nconnections, and higher intelligence, and the failure\
    \ rate will increase. The production\nefﬁciency of large-scale smart agriculture\
    \ is an important issue. With the integration of\n5G, many intelligent applications\
    \ will be gradually popularized. These apps are built\naround the 5G Internet\
    \ of Things. How to quickly identify the faulty node or device and\nthe self-healing\
    \ ability of the platform are important research issues.\n5.4.1. Node Fault Identiﬁcation\
    \ and Early Warning Based on Heterogeneous Sensing\nData Fusion\nCombining the\
    \ collected sensing data for computational analysis and network topol-\nogy to\
    \ identify node faults is a problem worth studying. Due to the mixed deployment\n\
    of 5G and various sensing devices, mixed data sources, multi-hop communication,\
    \ and\ntransmission route changes, how to realize the fault identiﬁcation of sensing\
    \ nodes and\npossible fault detection is an important research issue.\n5.4.2.\
    \ Research on Fault Tolerance Based on 5G Heterogeneous Fusion Sensing Network\n\
    Traditional perceptual networks generally assume unreliable perception. The actual\n\
    agricultural production will appear to be all kinds of failures. Because of the\
    \ intensive\ndeployment, the cost of ensuring all reliable operations is high.\
    \ Therefore, it is worth\nstudying that fault tolerance can guarantee the normal\
    \ operation of the whole agricultural\nproduction in a certain period of time\
    \ under limited fault.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n39 of 46\n5.4.3. Self-Healing\
    \ Mechanism Based on 5G Heterogeneous Fusion Sensing Network\nIn smart agriculture,\
    \ production is blocked due to the failure of the sensing equipment\nnetwork,\
    \ which affects efﬁciency. Therefore, it is necessary to study how to self-heal\
    \ after\nfaults occur, such as network topology self-healing, to guarantee node\
    \ pathways. For\nexample, perceptual repair under dense nodes. An additional example\
    \ is 5G gateway\ncoverage self-healing.\n5.5. AI Application Optimization for\
    \ 5G Intelligent Agricultural Internet of Things\nThe application of 5G brings\
    \ new opportunities for smart agriculture, which is ex-\npected to solve the problem\
    \ of data transmission and storage. With the development of\nartiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ it is an important issue to study lightweight deep artiﬁcial intelligence\n\
    algorithms or platforms combined with various scenarios of smart agriculture.\n\
    Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms represented by deep learning have laid the foundation\n\
    for many scenarios of smart agriculture applications. With the popularization\
    \ of 5G, the\nrange of application scenarios of smart agriculture will be greatly\
    \ expanded. However, the\ncurrent existence represented by deep learning will\
    \ face the important challenge of how to\nachieve reliable and effective operation\
    \ under the condition of small cost in the scenario of\nsmart agriculture, relying\
    \ on massive data and powerful computing power.\n5.5.1. Lightweight Deep Learning\
    \ Algorithm Based on 5G-IoT Edge Computing\nEdge computing equipment has some\
    \ computing ability, but its computing ability is\nnot enough for massive data\
    \ model training. The challenge is how to design deep learning\nor machine learning\
    \ algorithms suitable for agricultural production. Better results can\nbe obtained\
    \ by training on small sample data, reducing the amount of data transmission,\n\
    reducing the cost of communication resources, and improving the real-time accuracy,\
    \ which\nis a problem worth studying.\n5.5.2. Multi-Source Data-Sensing Machine\
    \ Learning Algorithm for Smart Agriculture\nIn the 5G scenario, sensing nodes\
    \ are densely deployed, and heterogeneous sensing\ndata need to be calculated\
    \ and analyzed to serve the upper layer. However, there are\noften low data quality,\
    \ multi-source, heterogeneous, and multi-modal sensing data, and\nchanges in network\
    \ topology. How to calculate these mixed and redundant low-quality\ndata by clustering,\
    \ statistics, Bayesian, and other machine learning methods is an important\nresearch\
    \ problem.\n5.6. 5G-IoT System Service Model for Smart Agriculture\nAn important\
    \ means to promote the implementation of smart agriculture is the in-\nformation\
    \ physical fusion system based on 5G. The typical application mode of smart\n\
    agriculture is to comprehensively perceive agricultural information through the\
    \ agricul-\ntural Internet of Things. Massive sensing devices for agricultural\
    \ IoT are deployed in the\nwhole process of agricultural production and processing.\
    \ Various information (environ-\nmental temperature and humidity, soil moisture,\
    \ carbon dioxide, images, etc.) is collected\nthrough various networks, including\
    \ 5G. Traditional agricultural models will be changed\nby means of cloud computing,\
    \ big data, edge computing, and artiﬁcial intelligence. It can\nrealize intelligent\
    \ perception, intelligent warning, intelligent decision-making, intelligent\n\
    analysis, and expert online guidance of agricultural production environment to\
    \ provide\nprecise planting, visual management, and intelligent decision-making\
    \ for agricultural\nproduction. This is to realize the intelligent management\
    \ of agricultural visual remote\ndiagnosis, remote control, disaster warning,\
    \ and so on, and gradually establish the visual\ncommunication and application\
    \ mode of agricultural information services. Relying on\nthe knowledge of agricultural\
    \ experts stored in the knowledge base, reasoning, analysis,\nand other mechanisms\
    \ were used to guide the production and circulation of agriculture\nand animal\
    \ husbandry. It promotes the transformation of traditional agriculture, which\
    \ is\nhuman-centered and relies on isolated machinery production mode, to modern\
    \ smart agri-\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n40 of 46\nculture, which is based on\
    \ information and software production mode. How to construct\nan appropriate application\
    \ service paradigm and model for intelligent agriculture 5G-IoT\nis an important\
    \ issue to be studied.\n5.7. Security Issues of 5G Internet of Things for Smart\
    \ Agriculture\nThe future of intelligent agriculture is highly intelligent, informationized,\
    \ and un-\nmanned, and security issues should be a concern. Due to the application\
    \ of 5G technology,\nthere are many data ﬂows and information ﬂows which are prone\
    \ to data deception, etc.,\nwhich will lead to serious consequences, such as the\
    \ death of crops or the poor quality of\nanimal husbandry objects caused by incorrect\
    \ pesticide spraying.\nAt present, there are many research results on the security\
    \ of the Internet of Things.\nIn general, attacks in IoT applications are classiﬁed\
    \ using the following two criteria: (1)\ninternal or external attacks and (2)\
    \ passive or active attacks. Therefore, the threat model can\nbe classiﬁed into\
    \ attacks targeting privacy, authentication, conﬁdentiality, availability, and\n\
    integrity attributes based on the characteristics of attacks that attempt to compromise\
    \ IoT\nagricultural nodes, namely IoT devices, fog nodes, and cloud nodes. 5G\
    \ itself is relatively\nsecure. However, due to the speciﬁc application scenarios,\
    \ the security problems of smart\nagriculture have their speciﬁc characteristics,\
    \ which require joint analysis and research.\n5.7.1. Information Traceability\
    \ of the Whole Process of Intelligent Agricultural Production\nBased on 5G Blockchain\n\
    Food safety has always been a matter of great concern to the public. The traditional\n\
    tracing system has some shortcomings, such as information opacity, data easy to\
    \ be tam-\npered with, poor security, and relative closure. In the future, the\
    \ development of 5G,\ncombined with blockchain technology and its unique advantages,\
    \ will provide a new\nsolution for the reliable traceability of the agricultural\
    \ supply chain. In combination with\nthe communication capability of 5G, blockchain\
    \ technology can be combined with the\nsensing equipment of the agricultural Internet\
    \ of Things for semantic segmentation and\ntracking to achieve high security.\n\
    5.7.2. Intrusion Detection for Intelligent Agricultural Production Based on 5G\n\
    With the popularization of 5G Internet of Things in smart agriculture, the degree\n\
    of intelligent and networked agricultural production is getting higher and higher,\
    \ and\nmore and more security issues need to be paid attention to. Unique security\
    \ issues and\nvulnerabilities may arise, including network, control, communications,\
    \ services, etc. How\nto combine the agricultural production process and the structural\
    \ characteristics of 5G IoT\nto establish a security mechanism, rapid detection,\
    \ and early warning of the intrusion of\nkey steps in the production process is\
    \ an important challenge in the future.\n6. Summary\nIn the future, smart agriculture,\
    \ after 5G technology transformation and upgrading,\nwill show the following characteristics:\
    \ unmanned operation, precise production, reﬁned\ncultivation, standardized production,\
    \ and intelligent supervision. Due to its low latency,\nmassive data transmission,\
    \ and massive connectivity, 5G is contributing to the development\nof IoT in agriculture.\
    \ The combination of 5G with other technologies has spawned a number\nof agricultural\
    \ applications to reduce the environmental impact of pesticides, protect natural\n\
    resources, improve animal welfare and help farmers increase yields and save costs.\
    \ This\npaper summarizes the impact of 5G on the Internet of Things, smart agriculture,\
    \ and related\ntechnologies. The key technologies and scientiﬁc issues affecting\
    \ the development of 5G-IoT\nwere analyzed to provide some ideas for the development\
    \ of 5G in smart agriculture. The\nscope of smart agriculture is relatively large,\
    \ and many details have not been discussed\nin-depth. Further efforts will be\
    \ made in the future.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.L., L.S. and\

    of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02, 2024 Hodge conjecture
    is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based on its algebraic
    attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation Xingyi Yang and
    1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling has been notably
    propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this progress, the cumbersome
    optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle to efficiency. In this
    paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for 3D generation without
    model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map redundancy is
    prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion time-steps in
    close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature maps across
    neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents redundant
    calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in 3D generation
    tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly, this
    feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances the
    smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications
    Of Text-T... Mijat Kustudic and 1 more April 02, 2024 SORA is a text-to-video
    model that can create videos based on simple user prompts. The model promises
    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory
    complexities, and dependence on technology. This research provides important recommendations
    to promote responsible deployment of the AI model. Advancements and Challenges
    in Robot Grasping and Manipulation for Aspiring Researche... Claudio Zito April
    02, 2024 Robot grasping and manipulation represent pivotal aspects of robotics
    research with profound implications for the future of autonomous systems. This
    report delves into the intricacies of designing robotic hands, the hurdles in
    creating robust manipulation actions, and the advancements in the field that poised
    to catalyze a new era of autonomy. Drawing inspiration from science fiction''s
    portrayal of robotics, we bridge the conceptual gap between fiction and ongoing
    real-world technical research, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview for
    students interested in robotics. Comprehensive 3GPP-Compatible Channel Model for
    FR2-2 Short-Range Communications for... Yusuke Koda and 3 more April 02, 2024
    This paper proposes a comprehensive 3GPPcnaompatible channel model with statistical
    enhancement tailored for indoor short-range device-to-device (D2D) communications
    operating in the frequency range (FR) of 52.6-71.0 GHz termed FR2-2. Regardless
    of the existence of various channel models at this band for indoor communications,
    there will be a need for developing a channel model compatible with and understandable
    from the current 3GPP stochastic channel model (SCM) to facilitate the discussion
    in the 3GPP for developing such FR2-2 short-range D2D communication framework
    based on the fifthgeneration (5G) new radio (NR). Indeed, such a futuristic vision
    can be foreseen from the fact that the 3GPP is discussing the evolution of sidelink,
    referred to as a D2D communication framework; however, there are no 3GPP SCM-compatible
    channel models applicable to FR2-2 short-range D2D communications. To fill this
    void, we propose the channel model coined 3GPPCompFR2-InS that allows us to generate
    channel impulse responses (CIR) for computer simulations, which is suitable for
    various indoor short-range D2D communication scenarios while retailing the similarity
    in terms of the implementation policy of the 3GPP SCM. 3GPPCompFR2-InS is verified
    based on the real-world measurements at the 60 GHz band from the viewpoint of
    both the validity of the channel model parameters and that of the statistical
    behavior of the generated CIRs. Effective media models for wave propagation in
    prestressed fractured rocks with nonli... Li-Yun Fu and 3 more April 02, 2024
    Stress-induced progressive deformations in fractured rocks with increasing effective
    pressure generally undergo nonlinear elastic (due to the closure of compliant
    pores), hyperelastic (due to residual stress), and inelastic (due to fracture
    growth) deformations prior to mechanical failure. Wave propagation in such rocks
    involves the complex interaction of fracture-and stress-induced changes in both
    velocity and anisotropy. With attention to nonlinear elastic and hyperelastic
    deformations, we incorporate acoustoelasticity into the traditional Hudson/Cheng
    models to describe the coupling of fracture-induced and stress-induced anisotropies.
    The resulting acoustoelastic Hudson model (AHM) is valid for the crack density
    smaller than 0.1 whereas the Padé AHM could handle higher crack densities. We
    extend the Padé AHM to consider the stress-induced crack closure with nonlinear
    elastic deformations by incorporating the dual-porosity model. These models approach
    the coupled anisotropies with different accuracies and computational complexities.
    The plane-wave analyses and effective-moduli calculations of stressed fractured
    rocks with varying crack densities determine the accuracy of these models under
    the isotropic (confining) and anisotropic (uniaxial and pure shear) prestress
    conditions. The relevant Thomsen parameters are applied to experimental data to
    validate the applicability. Finite-difference simulations are implemented to identify
    the contribution of different anisotropies through the variety of wavefronts,
    depending on fracture orientation, crack density, prestress mode and magnitude,
    and loading direction. Particular attention is paid to the anisotropic prestress,
    where the coupled anisotropies are constructive or destructive interference, strongly
    related to the relativity between fracture strike and loading direction. The stress-induced
    crack closure will reduce the fracture anisotropy so that the stress-induced background
    anisotropy dominates the shape of wavefronts with increasing prestress. Security
    and Reliability Performance of a Cooperative Network with Self-Sustaining No...
    Amit Patel and 1 more April 02, 2024 In this paper, we analyze the secrecy performance
    of a two-hop cooperative network consisting solely of energy-harvesting self-sustaining
    nodes drawing energy from a multi-antenna power beacon (PB). Performance of such
    networks is quite different from that with powered nodes. We consider optimal
    combining of the direct and relayed signals at the multi-antenna destination as
    well as the multi-antenna eavesdropper. Since availability of channel state information
    at the source is impractical in such networks, we assume fixed-rate signaling.
    To implement incremental signaling, we utilize feedback bits from the destination.
    Assuming practical nonlinear EH, exact and approximate expressions are derived
    for the secrecy outage probability of the selective decode-and-forward (SDF) and
    the incremental decode-and-forward (IDF) relaying schemes. It is demonstrated
    that IDF has much better secrecy performance than SDF just as with powered nodes.
    However, unlike with powered nodes, the secrecy performance is a convex function
    of the transmit power of PB. We propose a novel power back-off scheme to improve
    secrecy under different network operating conditions. The security-reliability
    trade-off (SRT) is analyzed to highlight the trade-off between outage and secrecy
    performance with the power back-off scheme. Simulation results validate the analytical
    expressions. Advanced Cardiovascular Health in a Quantum AI-driven Healthcare
    Framework Sarvapriya M Tripathi and 2 more April 02, 2024 With the advent of Healthcare
    4.0, there is increased interest from researchers the world over in the application
    of modern, cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum Artificial Intelligence
    (QAI) algorithms in solving healthcare challenges. The era of Quantum Computing
    (QC) promises to bring significant advancements in several areas of healthcare
    such that it may be sensible to give this hybrid Quantum/Classical paradigm its
    own name-Healthcare4Q. The potential of QC will extend the reach of Healthcare4Q
    with the help of diverse technologies such as quantum-enabled wearables, quantum-secure
    transfer and storage of data, and quantum computing at edge, fog, and cloud. All
    of these technologies promise to catapult Healthcare4Q to become the most capable
    healthcare framework in the advancement of medical innovations and improvement
    of patient care. An integral part of a person''s health lies in cardiovascular
    health, and thus prioritizing and optimizing cardiovascular health remains vital
    to the broader goals of public health and healthcare sustainability. In this study,
    under the paradigm of Healthcare4Q, we propose a framework called the Quantum
    AIdriven Heart Health Framework (QAIHHF) that can provide advanced predictive
    intelligence to healthcare providers by utilizing historical and real-time data
    and processing capabilities proposed in Healthcare4Q. We show that when applied
    to various diagnostics and health indicators such as ECG data, the Quantum AI
    provides accuracy at a level equal to or higher as compared to the classical methods
    thus proving itself to be the critical component that will herald the era of Healthcare4Q.
    QCDC-DR-GA: Optimizing Container Loading and Unloading through Dual-Cycling and
    Docky... Md. Mahfuzur Rahman and 4 more April 01, 2024 This paper addresses the
    optimization of container unloading and loading operations at ports, integrating
    quaycrane dual-cycling (QCDC) with dockyard rehandle minimization. We present
    a unified model encompassing both operations: ship container unloading and loading
    by quay crane, and the other is reducing dockyard rehandles while loading the
    ship. We recognize that optimizing one aspect in isolation can lead to suboptimal
    outcomes due to interdependencies. Specifically, optimizing unloading sequences
    for minimal operation time may inadvertently increase dockyard rehandles during
    loading and vice versa. To address this NP-hard problem, we propose a hybrid genetic
    algorithm (GA) QCDC-DR-GA comprising 1dimensional and 2-dimensional GA components.
    Our model, QCDC-DR-GA, consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art methods
    in maximizing dual cycles and minimizing dockyard rehandles. Compared to those
    methods, it reduced 15-20% of total operation time for large vessels. Results
    underscore the inefficiency of separately optimizing QCDC and dockyard rehandles.
    Fragmented approaches, such as QCDC Scheduling Optimized by bi-level GA and GA-ILSRS
    (Scenario 2), show limited improvement compared to QCDC-DR-GA. As in GA-ILSRS
    (Scenario 1), neglecting dual-cycle optimization leads to inferior performance
    than our proposed QCDC-DR-GA. A Two-Stage Passive Matrix Addressing Method for
    Large-Scale Beam-Steering Arrays PengYuan Wang April 01, 2024 This letter proposes
    a passive matrix addressing method to dramatically reduce the number of controlling
    (biasing) lines for large-scale beam-steering arrays. Phase shifting of each radiation
    element is accomplished in two stages by the row and column biasing lines located
    at two stacked layers, which offer a pair of orthogonal wave vectors. For an antenna
    array with M rows and N columns, conventional direct addressing designs need M
    * N biasing lines, while the proposed method needs only M+N biasing lines to complete
    the full-space beam-steering. The proposed method simplifies the routing of control
    lines and the design of driving circuits. Both theoretical and numerical analyses
    are provided to validate this method. Efficient Twiddle Factor Generation for
    Post Quantum Cryptography FALCON-based Number... Ghada Alsuhli and 4 more April
    01, 2024 Area and power-efficient hardware implementations are crucial for the
    widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms like FALCON.
    One of the main operations in FALCON is the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT),
    which needs to be performed with many prime numbers. Having one set of twiddle
    factors (TFs) for each prime makes storing all of these TFs impractical. In this
    paper, we propose an architecture for generating TFs on the fly for FALCON-oriented
    NTT, designed for area and power efficiency. Our approach dynamically generates
    TFs during NTT computations, significantly reducing on-chip memory requirements.
    The ASIC implementation results demonstrate significant improvements, with the
    proposed design reducing on-chip memory requirements by 99%, occupying 95% less
    area, and consuming 87.4% less power compared to the traditional ROM-based implementation.
    Furthermore, our design achieved a much higher maximum clock frequency, indicating
    superior performance in accessing twiddle factors. These findings highlight the
    potential of our proposed architecture for efficient hardware implementations
    of FALCON-based cryptographic systems. Enhancing Renewable Energy-Grid Integration
    by Optimally Placed FACTS Devices: The Ni... Nnaemeka Sunday Ugwuanyi and 5 more
    April 01, 2024 The global shift towards renewable energy (RE) sources, driven
    by climate change and fossil fuel depletion, encounters challenges in integrating
    intermittent sources like wind and solar power into existing grids. Developing
    countries, such as Nigeria, with weak grids, face significant limitations on RE
    penetration. This study focuses on enhancing RE grid integration in Nigeria by
    strategically deploying Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS)
    devices. Results obtained from the Nigerian grid indicate that FACTS devices,
    particularly STATCOMs, can extend the penetration limit by 40%, enabling an additional
    152 MW of wind energy to be integrated without jeopardizing system stability.
    Improved voltage profiles and enhanced stability highlight the effectiveness of
    FACTS devices in facilitating RE integration into weak grids. Thus, developing
    grids can accommodate more renewable energy without extensive reconfiguration
    of the power system architecture. Doppler Shift Distribution in Satellite Constellations
    Akram Al-Hourani April 01, 2024 Doppler shift has significant implications in
    Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations due to the rapid relative movement of satellites.
    This paper presents a novel approach based on stochastic geometry to capture the
    statistical distribution of Doppler shift in modern mega satellite constellations.
    We derive a simplified expression for both the Doppler shift s-curve and its maximum
    value, highlighting the dependency of Doppler shifts on the zenith angle of the
    closest approach during a satellite pass. Additionally, we present a stochastic
    model for the distribution of these zenith angles within the random constellation
    model. Furthermore, the statistical distribution of the Doppler bound is analytically
    formulated and validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations of two major
    satellite constellations currently in orbit. Effect of Presenting Stiffness of
    Robot Hand to Human on Human-Robot Handovers Junya Yamamoto and 2 more April 01,
    2024 In the present study, we focus on the object handover task as a major example
    of collaborative work between a human and a robot. To achieve a smooth handover
    between two different agents, their mutual communication is indispensable for
    understanding the other’s intentions. However, previous research has not dealt
    with a moment during handover in which a robot takes the object from a human grasp
    or in which a robot hands the object to the human. It should be noted that the
    performance during those phases is crucial to the success or failure of the tasks
    because slight changes in the kinematics of the relationship between hands or
    fingers and object result in significant changes in grasping status: the human
    may forcibly pull out the object while the robot is grasping it or drop the object.
    Therefore, this study aims to realize a smooth handover between a human and a
    robot, focusing on the moment of object handover. To this end, this paper proposes
    to present the stiffness of the robot hand to the human. We conducted the subject
    experiments to investigate the effect of this method on humans in the human-robot
    interaction. Experimental results show that this presentation method enables the
    worker to recognize the stiffness of the robot, which is difficult to recognize
    visually, thereby reducing the workload and allowing the worker to respond seamlessly
    to changes in the robot’s stiffness. VABAM: Variational Autoencoder for Amplitude-based
    Biosignal Augmentation within Morp... Junetae Kim and 2 more April 01, 2024 Pulsatile
    physiological signals, characterized by rhythmic fluctuations, are vital for assessing
    health conditions and are widely used in wellness devices and medical equipment.
    Despite their significance, models addressing domain-specific unmet needs and
    considerations have not been developed as much as in other fields. Therefore,
    building on the foundation of variational autoencoders, we introduce VABAM, a
    novel model for the amplitude-based synthesis of pulsatile physiological signals.
    The uniqueness of VABAM lies in its ability to maintain the morphological identity
    of signals throughout the synthesis process, achieved by integrating pass filter
    effects within the variational autoencoder architecture. To assess the effectiveness
    of the model, we developed three novel metrics based on joint mutual information.
    These metrics were aimed at evaluating the disentanglement of latent spaces, influence
    of ancillary information on signal morphologies, and controllability of amplitude-based
    synthesis within morphological identities. Comparative analyses demonstrated that
    VABAM and its variants were notably effective at preserving morphological integrity,
    highlighting their potential to minimize morphological distortions in physiological
    signal processing and their compatibility with artificial intelligence models
    employing frequency and amplitude features. Additionally, the proposed metrics,
    compatible with probabilistic models, were empirically proven to capture the characteristics
    of various models from multiple perspectives. In-and-Out Weight Box: A novel approach
    for better network compression and feature se... DaeYoung Kim April 01, 2024 Under
    the commonalities found in the goals of two areas, neural network compression
    and feature selection for dimension reduction, this research focused on finding
    a new method to address both issues: a method that can lead to easier feature
    selection, and an enhancement in the capacity of information flow control of neural
    network compression techniques, especially clustering based compression. Specifically,
    this research focused on creating a novel and effective framework to transform
    the weight matrix between the input layer and the first hidden layer in neural
    networks to be optimal. In other words, a method that can make the weight matrix''s
    structure itself optimal for information extraction. By proposing a simple, yet
    powerful weight clipping + GMM based method called an In-and-Out Weight Box that
    can intrinsically act similar to filtering while increasing the possibility of
    getting better results in compression, the main aim of research was found to be
    satisfied. Using Glioma Grading data from the UCI Repository for checking performance
    of the In-and-Out Weight box in fitting neural networks, it was found that significantly
    better compression results can be achieved in terms of weight sharing via clustering.
    This research also suggests a new feature selection method based on the In-and-Out
    Weight box constraint called IOW-FI, which can lead to solving limitations or
    problems of filtering techniques such as setting the number of components to be
    selected as efficient features or considering joint distributions of feature space.
    Is Complexity an Illusion? Michael Timothy Bennett April 02, 2024 Simplicity is
    held by many to be the key to general intelligence. Simpler models tend to “generalise”,
    identifying the cause or generator of data with greater sample efficiency. The
    implications of the correlation between simplicity and generalisation extend far
    beyond computer science, addressing questions of physics and even biology. Yet
    simplicity is a property of form, while generalisation is of function. In interactive
    settings, any correlation between the two depends on interpretation. In theory
    there could be no correlation and yet in practice, there is. Previous theoretical
    work showed generalisation to be a consequence of “weak” constraints implied by
    function, not form. Experiments demonstrated choosing weak constraints over simple
    forms yielded a 110 − 500% improvement in generalisation rate. Here we show that
    if one does not presuppose an abstraction layer, then all forms have equal complexity.
    However, in the context of a spatially and temporally extended abstraction layer,
    efficiency demands weak constraints take simple forms, and simplicity becomes
    correlated with generalisation. Simplicity has no causal influence on generalisation,
    but appears to due to confounding. ← Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 … 508 509 Next

    Abstract\nAdopting new information and communication technology (ICT) as a solution\
    \ \nto achieve food security becomes more urgent than before, particularly with\
    \ the \ndemographical explosion. In this survey, we analyze the literature in\
    \ the last decade to \nexamine the existing fog/edge computing architectures adapted\
    \ for the smart farming \ndomain and identify the most relevant challenges resulting\
    \ from the integration of \nIoT and fog/edge computing platforms. On the other\
    \ hand, we describe the status of \nBlockchain usage in intelligent farming as\
    \ well as the most challenges this promising \ntopic is facing. The relevant recommendations\
    \ and researches needed in Blockchain \ntopic to enhance intelligent farming sustainability\
    \ are also highlighted. It is found \nthrough the examination that the adoption\
    \ of ICT in the various farming processes \nhelps to increase productivity with\
    \ low efforts and costs. Several challenges are faced \nwhen implementing such\
    \ solutions, they are mainly related to the technological \ndevelopment, energy\
    \ consumption, and the complexity of the environments where \nthe solutions are\
    \ implemented. Despite these constraints, it is certain that shortly \nseveral\
    \ farming businesses will heavily invest to introduce more intelligence into \n\
    their management methods. Furthermore, the use of sophisticated deep learning\
    \ \nand Blockchain algorithms may contribute to the resolution of many recent\
    \ farming \nissues.\nKeywords: intelligent farming, food security, fog/edge computing,\
    \ blockchain,  \ndigital twin, artificial intelligence\n1. Introduction\nRecently,\
    \ the agricultural domain is facing numerous challenges related to the \nneed\
    \ to permanently increase productivity, climate change management, crop health\
    \ \nmonitoring, and irrigation water management, as well as fertilization optimization.\
    \ \nTo address these constraints, IoT technology is opening up new promising techno-\n\
    logical paths and pushing the future of agriculture to the next level. Indeed,\
    \ many \nDigital Agriculture, Methods and Applications\n2\nadvantages are offered\
    \ by IoT systems for intelligent farming, such as a panoply of \nsensor networks\
    \ to optimize irrigation and agricultural inputs management, as well \nas improvement\
    \ of the agricultural engine guidance and maintenance. Agricultural \nsensors\
    \ implemented in the fields are estimated to reach 12 million by 2023, this \n\
    revolution of smart devices will provide many remote facilities to manage seeds,\
    \ \nirrigation, fertilizers, and early disease detection by collecting real-time\
    \ data about \nthe field and the environment. We mean by intelligent farming the\
    \ integration of \nsmartness in the farming processes, not only for the land management\
    \ but also in the \nother chain links notably logistics and supply chain, transportation\
    \ [1–4], as well as \nstorage. The need for automation in the agricultural domain\
    \ to overcome the con-\nstraints imposed by classical methods of farming became\
    \ more essential than before. \nFurthermore, the availability of water in a sufficient\
    \ quantity and quality has been \nrecently become alarming because of the climate\
    \ change phenomenon. Consequently, \nmany technological, economical, and social\
    \ policies have to be implemented accord-\ning to many recent studies that focused\
    \ on water management topics [5]. Thanks \nto the smart and low-cost dedicated\
    \ sensors, irrigation tasks will be precise and the \nproductivity will be rapidly\
    \ increased, without ignoring the important contribution \nin hydrological resources\
    \ preservation. Traceability of the food supply chain (FSC) \nis an important\
    \ key factor to ensure the quality and safety of food transportation \nand identification\
    \ in a regulatory manner, as well as protect perishable food against \nwaste.\
    \ Dairy farming is another farming process that has taken benefits from the \n\
    integration of information and communication technology in the farming industry,\
    \ \nit helps farmers to adopt more accurate practices in dairy management [6]\
    \ to monitor \nthe heat of oestrus to improve reproduction, as well as the animal\
    \ health check and \nmonitoring [7].\nHighly intelligent farming or high intelligent\
    \ farming are two concepts that refer \nto the use of high tech in farming processes\
    \ to enhance the efficiency of daily work. In \nfact, using technological innovation\
    \ in farming is not new, but the rise of some disci-\nplines, such as IoT, fog\
    \ computing, satellites, drones, smartphones, and Blockchain, \nare things that\
    \ will push smart agriculture and precise farming industries to a high \nlevel\
    \ in the coming years. We believe that implementing ICT in the farming world \n\
    will enable farmers to better understand and interact with their farms by collecting\
    \ \ndata about changing variables and giving commands according to the situations.\
    \ All \nof these technologies will give the ability to the farms to make a big\
    \ transition from \nbeing simple physical environments to highly intelligent and\
    \ abstract worlds.\nDespite the existence of several studies and surveys that\
    \ introduce the issue of \nintegrating ICT in farming processes, we find that\
    \ these surveys either focused only \non one farming process or do not investigate\
    \ deep enough this integration. Moreover, \ninvestigation of Blockchain technology,\
    \ its benefits for the farming industry, and its \nrequired research to build\
    \ sustainable development, need to be elaborated. To fill these \nliterature gaps,\
    \ we propose this survey as one of the most mature studies of its kind \nthat\
    \ presents a systematic and developed state-of-the-art for integrating ICT in\
    \ the \nfarming world.\nThe remainder of this work is further structured as follows:\
    \ The research meth-\nodology is presented in Section 2. Then, the general review\
    \ of IoT-based systems’ \nrequirements is discussed in Section 3. Next, Section\
    \ 4 provides the components of an \nintelligent farming IoT model. After that,\
    \ the open challenges resulting from IoT-fog \ncomputing integration are discussed\
    \ in Section 5. The applications of Blockchain \nin intelligent farming and the\
    \ discussion part are then presented in Section 6. The \nconclusion and summary\
    \ are provided in Section 7.\n3\nDigital Agriculture and Intelligent Farming Business\

    2. Research methodology\nThis survey extensively studies the knowledge related\
    \ to the intelligent farming \ndomain. It inventories and summarizes the integration\
    \ of ICT in the IF field. The \npotential of this survey regarding the other works\
    \ is to evaluate the implementation \nof Blockchain in the IF topic.\n2.1 Reference\
    \ management\nThe references related to our research area are collected and filtered,\
    \ 104 refer-\nences have been retained based on the following four criteria: (1)\
    \ High priority was \ngiven to recent studies, which means that most of the selected\
    \ papers were published \nbetween 2017 and 2021, and some of them are in press.\
    \ (2) The timeliness and novelty \nof the study in the intelligent farming field\
    \ is another criterion that has been given \nmore priority. (3) The significance\
    \ to the field and the potential impact on the course \nof future work in the\
    \ area of smart farming, were also criteria that have been taken \ninto account\
    \ while selecting the examined papers. (4) Since the potential of our sur-\nvey\
    \ is the evaluation of the applications and benefits of Blockchain technology\
    \ for the \nfarming industry, we have given more importance to the studies that\
    \ have explored \nBlockchain technology within farming environments. A variety\
    \ of questions that \nare addressed in this survey can be summarized as follows—(Q1)\
    \ what type of ICT \nsystems and frameworks are used in the implementation of\
    \ IF solutions? The answer \nto this question gives a general study of relevant\
    \ technologies and protocols adopted \nin IoT systems as well as fog/edge computing\
    \ platforms. These technologies represent \nthe basis of many implementations\
    \ in many fields including intelligent farming, \n(Q2) is there an IoT model structure\
    \ that can be adopted to build IF solutions? To \nanswer this question, a five-layer\
    \ model for intelligent farming is presented, (Q3) how \nBlockchain technology\
    \ can be used in the IF domain, and what impact might this have \non IF practices\
    \ improvement? The answer to this question leads us to introduce the \nSource\n\

    \ smart agriculture state-of-the-arts and reviews\nStarting from the examined\
    \ papers, we have identified several state-of-the-arts, \nsurveys, and reviews,\
    \ each type of those papers discussed the use of ICT in intelligent \nfarming\
    \ based on specific ICT disciplines. Some previous surveys focused on the hard-\n\
    ware used to implement IF applications, and others covered the integration of\
    \ IoT with \nfog/edge technologies to optimize some metrics. Some points are common\
    \ between \nour work and others, such as the description of the hardware and protocols\
    \ adopted \nin IF systems, and the implementations of IF applications in cloud/fog\
    \ computing \nenvironments. In this work we studied the Blockchain discipline\
    \ related to the farming \ndomain, this point has not been obviously covered by\
    \ the other surveys. Table 1 sum-\nmarizes the comparison between this survey\
    \ and the other previous works.\n3. A general review of IoT-based systems’ requirements\n\
    In most cases, precision agriculture data are communicated wirelessly between\
    \ \nsensors, or between IoT devices and the core using several kinds of communication\
    \ \nprotocols, these protocols define the rules and the different formats of the\
    \ communi-\ncated data. The secret behind the success of IoT systems is the development\
    \ of com-\nmunication protocols [18, 19], such as RFID (Radio Frequency Identification),\
    \ NFC \n(Near Field Communication), IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.16 Wi-Max (Worldwide\
    \ \nInteroperability for Microwave Access), IEEE 802.15.4 LR-WPAN (Low-Rate Wireless\
    \ \nPersonal Area Networks), 4G and 5G cellular networks, IEEE 802.15.1 Bluetooth,\
    \ \nZigBee, ANT/ANT+ networks, DASH7, Enocea...).\nUnlike the fog computing paradigm,\
    \ the traditional cloud computing approach \nis characterized by centralization,\
    \ high latency, and more network failures. These \ncharacteristics among others\
    \ make cloud computing unsuitable for IoT applications \nwhere time and mobility\
    \ are crucial factors. In the IoT context, fog computing is a \nnew computing\
    \ approach that helps to distribute the load of processing and make it \nso close\
    \ to the sensing layer. One of the solutions that were proposed to accelerate\
    \ the \nprocessing and compensate for the resource limitation of IoT devices is\
    \ computation \noffloading. This concept allows devices to fully/partially offload\
    \ their computation \ntasks to resource-rich cloud infrastructures [20]. But this\
    \ solution bypasses only the \ncloud computing limitations and does not propose\
    \ a real solution to resolve them. A \ngroup of researchers [21] discussed the\
    \ usefulness of another concept called computa-\ntion onloading. This concept\
    \ is based on bringing cloud services to the edge of the \nnetwork to satisfy\
    \ the requirements of IoT devices in terms of bandwidth and latency.\nMany contributions\
    \ are proposed to improve the shared characteristics between \ncloud and fog computing,\
    \ notably the generated latency between requesting the task \nexecution and receiving\
    \ the response, the energy consumed during the task process-\ning, the resource\
    \ management strategy that defines the provided quality of service, \nthe security\
    \ issue directly linked to the privacy of generated data, the mobility \nsupport\
    \ to ensure the best quality of service to the end devices, the interoperability\
    \ \nbetween smart things, the scalability related to the exponential increase\
    \ of the \nnumber of IoT devices, and finally the bandwidth needed to transmit\
    \ data from the \nnetwork of smart objects to the processing center.\n5\nDigital\
    \ Agriculture and Intelligent Farming Business Using Information and Communication…\n\
    DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.102400\nThe latency generated by the\
    \ cloud is significantly important, this is an issue for new \nIoT mobile applications\
    \ that need real-time responses to their requests. To enhance this \ncharacteristic\
    \ through the fog/edge computing model, Yang et al. [22] developed an \noffline\
    \ heuristic algorithm, SearchAdjust, to minimize the average latency for Multiuser\
    \ \nComputation Partition Problem (MCPP). In the same context, Yousefpour et al.\
    \ [23] \ndeveloped and evaluated a policy to reduce the service delay for IoT\
    \ devices based on \noffloading and sharing load approach. In another work, Molina\
    \ et al. [24] proposed a \nstrategy of uplink/downlink, and edge computational\
    \ resources allocation in a multi-\nuser scenario to achieve latency and energy\
    \ efficiency in task processing. Ren et al. [25] \ninvestigated the collaboration\
    \ between cloud computing and edge computing, where \nthe tasks of mobile devices\
    \ can be partially processed at the edge node and the cloud \nserver. A joint\
    \ communication and computation resource allocation problem is formu-\nlated to\
    \ minimize the weighted-sum latency of all mobile devices.\nRegarding the energy\
    \ consumption issue, most of the processing tasks are carried \nout in the cloud\
    \ computing data centers that increase the quantity of energy needed \nfor query\
    \ transmission and execution. This consumption is minimized in the fog/\nedge\
    \ computing model because the majority of computing tasks are distributed over\
    \ \nseveral end devices or offloaded to the edge mini data centers. In this context,\
    \ Xiang \net al. [26] proposed a policy to efficiently optimize energy in LTE\
    \ (Evolution Long \nTerm)/Wi-Fi link selection and transmission scheduling, as\
    \ well as developed an \napproximate dynamic programming algorithm to reduce energy\
    \ consumption in the \nMCC (Mobile Cloud Computing). Ge et al. [27] proposed a\
    \ game-theoretic strategy \nto reduce the overall energy dissipation of both mobile\
    \ devices and cloud servers \nconsidering the offloading technique in the MCC\
    \ system. Chen et al. [28] adopted \na game-theoretic approach to propose a multi-user\
    \ offloading solution for mobile-\nedge cloud computing, their proposed solution\
    \ aims to achieve energy efficiency in a \nmulti-channel wireless interference\
    \ environment.\nIn the classical cloud computing approach, the efficiency of resources\
    \ manage-\nment is less compared to the fog/edge computing approach, this is due\
    \ to the existence \nof more sophisticated algorithms that proved their efficiency\
    \ in resources alloca-\ntion. In this window, Mostafa et al. [29] proposed an\
    \ automated fog selection and \nallocation scheme of task requests by IoT devices.\
    \ In another work, Jana et al. [30] \nproposed a QoS (Quality of Service)—aware\
    \ resource management technique for \nthe efficient management of resources. Souza\
    \ et al. [31] developed a scheme that \ncombines fog computing and cloud resource\
    \ allocation. Aazam et al. [32] proposed \na user characteristic-based resource\
    \ management for fog, which performs efficient \nand fair management of resources\
    \ for IoT deployments. Delegating data protection to \nthe cloud layer without\
    \ implementing mechanisms to protect data at the end device \nlevel is an inefficient\
    \ strategy. The best way is to ensure end-to-end data protection, \nthe fog/edge\
    \ computing model is mainly concerned by this issue compared to the \ncloud computing\
    \ approach that focuses on data protection at the cloud level. Das \nManik [33]\
    \ proposed a security protocol for IoT applications based on Elliptic Curve \n\
    Cryptography (ECC). Hernández-Ramos et al. [34] proposed a new mechanism \nof\
    \ lightweight authentication and authorization to be embedded in a smart object\
    \ \nbased on DCapBAC (Distributed Capability-Based Access Control). Zhang et al.\
    \ [35] \nsuggested using Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE),\
    \ which is a \nrecognized cryptographic technique to ensure data confidentiality\
    \ and provide firm \naccess control.\nThe majority of IoT devices used in smart\
    \ cities or smart environments are geo-\ngraphically distributed, mobility of\
    \ IoT devices and applications should, therefore, be \nDigital Agriculture, Methods\
    \ and Applications\n6\nsupported by the adopted computing approach. As a result,\
    \ many works are proposed \nto enhance the mobility of end devices in the fog/edge\
    \ model since this characteristic \nis less present in the traditional cloud computing\
    \ model. For this purpose, Chaisiri \net al. [36] proposed a mobility-aware offloading\
    \ priority design, it aims to precisely \nanticipate users’ mobility profiles\
    \ and channels. In the same context, Prasad et al. [37] \nproposed an approach\
    \ for mobility management along with traffic control to offer \nbetter users’\
    \ QoE (Quality of Experience) with latency-tolerant tasks. Ning et al. [38] \n\
    constructed a three-layer VFC (Vehicle Fog Computing) model to enable distributed\
    \ \ntraffic management and minimize the response time of citywide events collected\
    \ and \nreported by vehicles.\nInteroperability is another important difference\
    \ between the fog/edge computing \nmodel and the cloud computing approach regarding\
    \ provided smart services. The \ninteroperability requires that all interfaces\
    \ of cloud-based or fog/edge-based systems are \nwholly understood. Despite that\
    \ cloud computing offers more interoperability for some \ndistributed applications,\
    \ it is difficult to cover smart things applications due to the big \nheterogeneity\
    \ of manufacturers and systems. Contrary to cloud computing, fog/edge \ncomputing\
    \ is more open to the end devices and tends to ameliorate the interoperability\
    \ \nissue in an IoT system. Starting from this requirement, Jayaraman et al. [39]\
    \ proposed \nan OpenIoT platform used for the digital agriculture use case (Phenonet),\
    \ the OpenIoT \nenables semantic interoperability. Desai et al. [40] proposed\
    \ a semantic web permit \narchitecture to afford interoperability among smart\
    \ things. Ullah et al. [41] proposed \na semantic interoperability model for big-data\
    \ in IoT (SIMB-IoT) to deliver semantic \ninteroperability among heterogeneous\
    \ IoT devices in the health care domain.\nIn the traditional cloud computing model,\
    \ the number of smart supported devices \nand applications increases at a slow\
    \ rate oppositely to what happens in fog/edge \ncomputing systems. Scalability\
    \ is an essential feature that defines how resources \nprovisioning is performed\
    \ and what components can be scaled, notably the storage \ncapacity, the number\
    \ of fog/edge nodes, the connectivity solutions, and the internal \nhardware or\
    \ software of fog/edge nodes. Tseng and Lin [42] designed a mechanism \nto dynamically\
    \ scale in/out the serving instances of the middle nodes to make the \nwhole IoT/\
    \ M2M (Machine to Machine) platform more scalable using an industrial \nIoT (IIoT)\
    \ scenario. Vilalta et al. [43] proposed a new fog computing infrastructure \n\
    named TelcoFog that can be installed at the edge of the mobile network of the\
    \ telecom \noperator to provide several services, such as NFV (Network Function\
    \ Virtualization) \nand MEC for IoT applications, the benefits of the proposed\
    \ infrastructure are \ndynamic deployment, scalability, and low latency. Gupta\
    \ et al. [44] proposed a highly \ndistributed service-oriented middleware called\
    \ SDFog (Software-Defined Fog) based \non cloud and fog capabilities as well as\
    \ SDN (Software-Defined Networking) and \nNFV to satisfy the required high level\
    \ of scalability and QoS.\nThe bandwidth needed to transmit the data collected\
    \ is closely tied to the gener-\nated latency, the biggest amount of data requires\
    \ more bandwidth to be transmitted \nto the cloud data centers, which means more\
    \ latency in the transmission process. \nOptimizing the bandwidth in a fog/edge\
    \ environment directly minimizes the delay \nresulting from the transmission process\
    \ because the processing resources are located \nclose to the end devices. In\
    \ this context, Ito et al. [45] proposed a bandwidth alloca-\ntion scheme based\
    \ on collectible information. Gia et al. [46] introduced the process-\ning of\
    \ ECG (electrocardiogram) features using fog nodes, their results disclosed that\
    \ \nfog helps to achieve more efficiency in bandwidth and low latency in the data\
    \ process-\ning. Bhardwaj et al. [21] argued the utility of “onloading” cloud\
    \ services to the edge of \nthe network to address the bandwidth and latency challenges\
    \ of IoT networks.\n7\nDigital Agriculture and Intelligent Farming Business Using\

    4. Components of an intelligent farming IoT model\nBefore deciding to integrate\
    \ IoT infrastructure in a given smart farming business \nmodel, it is first mandatory\
    \ to understand the components of the IoT model, because \nthis is the best way\
    \ to analyze business technology compromises, and better define the \nrequirements\
    \ of the farming process system. Figure 1 illustrates the five layers com-\nprising\
    \ of the smart farming IoT model, each layer is explained in greater detail below.\n\
    4.1 Hardware sensor and actuator layer\nThis component is located in the bottom\
    \ layer of the IoT model, it can also be \ncalled the data collection and actuation\
    \ layer, it is considered as the link between the \nfarm physical world and virtual\
    \ data management and decision making. Functionally, \nthis layer is responsible\
    \ for sensing capabilities to gather data about the physical farm-\ning variables\
    \ that we want to measure, as well as take actions to change the environ-\nment\
    \ depending on the scenario of the made decision. In this layer, it is recommended\
    \ \nto take into account the hardware characteristics, such as size, cost, useful\
    \ lifetime, \nreliability, performances, as well as the scenario of use. Physical\
    \ sensors existed for a \nlong time before even the emergence of IoT devices,\
    \ the only difference is that their \nuses have become more sophisticated and\
    \ they have been used more ubiquitously. The \nintelligent farming sensors can\
    \ be manufactured separately or embedded in a specific \nFigure 1. \nThe five\
    \ layers of a smart farming IoT model.\nDigital Agriculture, Methods and Applications\n\
    8\none board and dedicated to a particular application. The common applications\
    \ of \nsensors are to measure temperature, humidity, geographical position, light\
    \ and sound \nsense, and much more.\nThe farming actuators are the translators\
    \ of the decision to comprehensive and \nuseful energy capable to change the environment\
    \ from one condition to another, such \nas guiding an agricultural engine, changing\
    \ the temperature, making a movement, or \nenabling/disabling a pump. Operationally\
    \ speaking, actuators can take three forms—\npneumatic using air pressure, electrical\
    \ using electrical energy, and hydraulic based \non the power of liquids.\n4.2\
    \ Software sensor layer\nThis layer represents the point of connection between\
    \ the physical world and the \nfog-cloud environment, it defines how an object\
    \ can be smart by doing local analyt-\nics, take simple decisions, or control\
    \ other devices. This layer enables the “software-\ndefined hardware infrastructure\
    \ (SDHI)” or “resource desegregation” [47] concept, \nwhich is one of the software-defined\
    \ environment taxonomy. This concept is of \ngreat interest today because it considers\
    \ physical hardware as a modular component \noffering more flexibility, agility,\
    \ automation, and optimization in cloud resource \nallocation. It provides a new\
    \ pool of resources-based vision and strategy to efficiently \nmanage available\
    \ hardware resources to serve multiple applications, this offers more \nprogrammability\
    \ to the infrastructure. It exists in literature more similar concepts \nlike\
    \ virtualization technique [48, 49], Virtual Network Function (VNF) [50, 51],\
    \ \nSoftware-defined cloud (SDCloud) [52, 53]. This layer is important and critical\
    \ at the \nsame time. Important because it can be used to minimize the hardware\
    \ complexity, in \nother words, instead of being stuck in a fixed hardware architecture\
    \ which is complex \nand expensive to build in most of the time, it is possible\
    \ to design generic hardware \nlike Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and\
    \ program it for various scenarios. \nAnd critical because it is the only gate\
    \ through which the data flows from the physical \nworld to cloud or fog environments,\
    \ thus the definition of an OS (Operating System) \nthat manages the hardware\
    \ and the running applications is considered a critical task.\n4.3 Communication\
    \ (network) layer\nIn some contexts, this layer is called connectivity, it defines\
    \ the manner of how \ndata are sent and received between the cloud and the smart\
    \ devices. The connectivity \nfunction has resulted from the combination of two\
    \ essential elements—protocols and \nphysical hardware used to transmit the signals.\
    \ In the beginning, RFID is used by the \nobjects to communicate with each other\
    \ [54] without human intervention. With the \nemergence of 5G cellular network,\
    \ a great opportunity is offered to accelerate the IoT \nsystems’ development,\
    \ particularly with the emergence of the MTC (Machine Type \nCommunication) concept,\
    \ which is also called machine to machine communication, \nit refers to automated\
    \ data communications among devices. According to the 3GPP \n(3rd Generation Partnership\
    \ Project), it exists two modes of communications in MTC \napplications—the first\
    \ mode can occur between an MTC device and a server, and the \nsecond can happen\
    \ between a network of MTC devices [55]. Choosing the commu-\nnication mode and\
    \ protocol is a critical task for IoT project owners. This modeling \nstep defines\
    \ not only the communication with the cloud but also determines how \nIoT objects\
    \ communicate with each other. Many communication technologies can \nbe used,\
    \ for instance, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi, and optical wireless communication \n\
    9\nDigital Agriculture and Intelligent Farming Business Using Information and\
    \ Communication…\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.102400\nfor small\
    \ coverage areas [56, 57]. Sigfox [58] and LoRa, LoRaWan (Long Range Wide \nArea\
    \ Network) [59] have been conceived for a wide coverage area. Moreover, 5G is\
    \ \nadopted to enhance all traditional mobile communication performances, and\
    \ respond \nto multiple connectivity requirements of IoT applications, such as\
    \ introducing low \nlatency and reliability.\nThe heterogeneity in communication\
    \ protocols as well as the complexity of manu-\nfacturers’ models lead us to think\
    \ about solutions to ensure the interoperability between \nIoT platforms and services.\
    \ Consequently, the IoT middleware concept is immerged \nand many solutions have\
    \ been proposed. The propositions can be classified into three \nbig families\
    \ [60]: Actor-based IoT middleware, cloud-based IoT middleware, and \nservice-based\
    \ IoT middleware. The first proposition of the actor-based middleware \nproject\
    \ offers an easy deployment in the distributed environments since it uses actor\
    \ \nor agent concept, this middleware plays the role of a bridge between IoT devices\
    \ and \ncloud services, it first works presciently to correctly receive data from\
    \ each IoT device. \nIt next sends the collected data to the cloud using HTTP\
    \ (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) \nover TCP/IP protocol. The second family enables\
    \ the terminology of the cloud of things \n(CoT) that was introduced by Yuriyama\
    \ et al. [61], it is an enabler that lets us exploit \nand manage wireless sensors\
    \ homogeneously without worrying about the manufactur-\ner’s physical complexities.\
    \ CoT uses cloud capabilities in terms of elasticity of resource \nprovisioning\
    \ as well as automation, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Considering this\
    \ \nfamily of IoT middleware, the access of IoT devices to the cloud resources\
    \ is ensured by \nthe Application Programming Interface (API) of the cloud service\
    \ provider or through \nthe product vendor’s application, as shown in Figure 2(a).\n\
    The last family of IoT middlewares refers generally to the open-source platform\
    \ \nnamed OpenIoT project, the objective behind proposing the SaaS (Sensing as-a-Service)\
    \ \nsolution is to find an adequate way to extract data from virtual cloud sensors\
    \ without \nworrying about the physical architecture of the sensor that was behind\
    \ the collected \ndata. The architecture of the service-based IoT middleware is\
    \ given in Figure 2(b).\nThe most common criteria that is recommended to put in\
    \ mind while choosing \nthe adequate IoT middleware are stability regarding the\
    \ application, the deployment \nmode (open source or commercial), the payment\
    \ model (by the number of device/\nmessages or using pay as you use mode), the\
    \ level of security needed (depends on \nthe criticality of the application and\
    \ the managed data), the hardware compatibility \nFigure 2. \nCloud-based and\
    \ service-based IoT middleware.\nDigital Agriculture, Methods and Applications\n\
    10\n(some commercial IoT Middlewares support the integration of some kind of hard-\n\
    ware devices like Arduino and Raspberry), the protocol that the application requires\
    \ \n(since it exists multiple types of communication protocols, some of them are\
    \ open \nand others are proprietary), and either the middleware platform supports\
    \ the \nrequired analytics or not (it depends on the nature of data that the application\
    \ need \nwhich can be in real-time or historic).\n4.4 Cloud (analytics) layer\n\
    IoT applications produce periodically what we call big data and send them to the\
    \ \nbackbone to be managed. The challenge for an IoT project manager is to consider\
    \ \nmany critical factors to conceive the right cloud architecture. This layer\
    \ should take \ninto account the essential 5 V of big data from the beginning,\
    \ the 5 V as mentioned in \nRef. [62] includes volume, variety, velocity, veracity,\
    \ and value. The designed cloud \narchitectures for IoT applications take many\
    \ models depending on the project man-\nager’s perspective.\nThe model can be\
    \ SaaS (Software as a Service), the customer in this case, does \nnot have any\
    \ knowledge about the platform architecture, the client only has a web \ninterface\
    \ or an API to interact with the provider platform, this model, in general, \n\
    requires additional fees and the client still stuck in “Vendor lock-in,” this\
    \ means that \nmore complexity and costs will be charged by the client if for\
    \ any reason, decides to \nswitch to another service provider.\nThe second model\
    \ is PaaS (Platform as a Service), the client in this case has mul-\ntiple choices\
    \ of software bricks that can be used on-demand to build IoT applications \nwithout\
    \ worrying about server management. This model provides many bricks for \nIoT\
    \ solutions such as device management, storage, connectivity with other IoT fleets,\
    \ \ncollection, and transmission, as well as some machine learning options for\
    \ decision-\nmaking support. The advantage of this model is the great ability\
    \ offered by the vendor \nto the client to customize the IoT applications based\
    \ on the offered software catalogs. \nBut unfortunately, this can have some additional\
    \ hidden costs.\nThe third kind of model is licensed or on-premise. Here, the\
    \ vendor only makes \nsupport available to the client. The client buys software\
    \ packages and the license, \nthen installs them in his own managed infrastructure.\
    \ All the maintenance tasks \nare under the client’s responsibility. The open-source\
    \ solutions are identical to the \nlicensed model, the only difference is that\
    \ the software packages are freely avail-\nable, the solution maintenance is ensured\
    \ by a community of volunteer developers. \nIn some cases, the maintenance is\
    \ performed by an enterprise and proposes the \nsolution as a free package, while\
    \ providing a paid version with other options. The \ntailor-made feature is another\
    \ option adopted by many customers, it consists of \nengaging an external integrator\
    \ to entirely conceive the IoT solution. In this case, \nthe source code is owned\
    \ by the application owner, he can use it subsequently to \nachieve the project\
    \ evolutivity.\n4.5 Application (user) layer\nThis layer is the most closer to\
    \ the customer, it is generally used to ensure user-\nmachine interaction, it\
    \ defines how data is presented to the end-user depending \non the user’s requirements.\
    \ In most cases, this layer is a web-based application. \nSome users require desktop,\
    \ mobile, or wearable applications. Practically, the \napplication layer is hosted\
    \ somewhere in the provider’s cloud to ensure the AAA \n11\nDigital Agriculture\
    \ and Intelligent Farming Business Using Information and Communication…\nDOI:\
    \ http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.102400\n(Anytime, Anywhere, Application)\
    \ capability. The most important thing that the \nIoT solution designer should\
    \ understand is what the final users attend from the \nsolution, and how this\
    \ job can be done.\n5. Open challenges of IoT-Fog integration in the IF context\n\
    5.1 Real-time processing\nFog computing provides required resources at the edge\
    \ of the network to deliver real-\ntime services for demanding applications (e.g,\
    \ video streaming, gaming, video analytics, \nand robot-fog interactions [63]).\
    \ When it comes to IoT data processing on a large scale, \nwe can distinguish\
    \ between three processing concepts [64], as illustrated in Figure 3.\nThe serverless\
    \ function also called Function as a service (FaaS), refers to the sim-\nplest\
    \ processing model where data are present in the input of a black box, the results\
    \ \nof processing are then gathered in the output without any session stat. The\
    \ second \nprocessing concept is called batch processing, here, data are processed\
    \ in small parts \nand often simultaneously, this type of processing is considered\
    \ in situations when a \nlarge amount of data need to be processed, input data\
    \ are accessed in batches form, or \ndata need complex processing. The last processing\
    \ mode is called stream processing, \nit refers to on-the-fly processing where\
    \ data are processed online and the results are \ndelivered instantly, this mode\
    \ of processing is appropriate in case of real-time results \nare needed. Since\
    \ IoT applications are diversified and data are generated and sent con-\ntinuously\
    \ to fog computing nodes, each processing mode can be adopted for a specific \n\
    scenario.\n5.2 Resource scheduling and management\nIt was expected that a huge\
    \ number of IoT devices will be online shortly, meaning \nthat the amount of generated\
    \ data will be also colossal. Resource management policy \nis a determining factor\
    \ in evaluating the quality of service delivered to IoT devices \nFigure 3. \n\
    Available modes of processing for IoT applications.\nDigital Agriculture, Methods\
    \ and Applications\n12\nand applications. This policy depends on many factors\
    \ such as the nature of the \napplication requiring the resource. If the application\
    \ allows delay of processing, all its \nrequests are forwarded to the cloud resources\
    \ to be executed there. But if the applica-\ntion is time-sensitive, all its requests\
    \ are served by fog computing nodes.\n5.3 IoT geo-distribution and mobility\n\
    Geo-distribution is one of the primary characteristics of smart devices. An object\
    \ \nis most of the time moving from one geographical area to another, this mobility\
    \ \ngenerates delay and packet loss [57]. Fog computing has to provide necessary\
    \ mecha-\nnisms and resources to facilitate fog users’ access at anytime, anywhere,\
    \ and without \nany delay or loss, given that devices are highly distributed,\
    \ handover is a critical \nmechanism among others that should be taken into account\
    \ while conceiving and \nimplementing fog computing architecture.\n5.4 Latency\
    \ minimizing\nMost IoT devices have resource limitations in terms of communication,\
    \ storage, \nand computation. As a direct result, the connected object needs a\
    \ powerful infra-\nstructure that can provide these requirements within a milliseconds\
    \ scale. Cloud \ncomputing is known for its big latency, which makes it unsuitable\
    \ for time-sensitive \napplications. On the other hand, the fog computing challenge\
    \ is to provide necessary \nresources at the edge of the network to process data\
    \ and serve IoT devices’ requests \nwithin milliseconds to a few seconds scale.\
    \ Fog computing serves also the central \ncloud by sending reports for data visualization\
    \ purposes [65].\n5.5 Security and integrity enhancement\nRecently, IoT-generated\
    \ data may represent the secret of an individual or an \nindustry, indeed, they\
    \ need to be protected in the transit phase and in-rest. The fog \ncomputing paradigm\
    \ must ensure confidentiality-integrity and availability of data \nthrough efficient\
    \ cryptographic algorithms. The security mechanisms offered by \nfog have to be\
    \ light and less resource-consuming to be more adapted to the limited \nproperties\
    \ of end devices. In another hand, collected data are analyzed and treated \n\
    locally in fog data centers instead of sending them through the internet to the\
    \ cloud \ndatacenter, this point helps a lot in data security reinforcement.\n\
    5.6 High availability\nThe exponential rise of IoT-generated data demands a reliable\
    \ platform that can \nmanage this huge amount of data. The temporary loss of connection\
    \ is not an issue in \nthe case of cloud computing scenarios. Whereas, a short\
    \ loss of connection can lead to \ndisastrous consequences for an autonomous vehicle\
    \ system or an application impact-\ning citizens’ safety.\n5.7 Networking, and\
    \ storage enhancement\nThis is another big challenge for fog computing, especially\
    \ after the emergence of \nsoftware-defined environments such as SDN (Software-Defined\
    \ Networking), SDHI \n(Software-Defined Hardware Infrastructures), VNF (Virtual\
    \ Network Function), \n13\nDigital Agriculture and Intelligent Farming Business\
    \ Using Information and Communication…\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.102400\n\
    virtualization, SDC (Software-Defined Computing), SDI (Software-Defined \nInfrastructures),\
    \ SDS (Software-Defined Storage), and others. Implementation of \nsuch techniques\
    \ in fog networking requires a radical change in fog computing infra-\nstructure\
    \ design. It is not simple as it looks, but once it is done, all the other benefits\
    \ \nespecially latency minimization are achieved.\n5.8 Energy consumption\nBy\
    \ definition, the IoT objects collect and transmit data using wireless connections;\
    \ \nfog computing also supports wireless D2D (Device to Device) connectivity,\
    \ whereby \nthe networks of devices can decrease significantly their energy consumption\
    \ since \na big amount of requests are executed in fog nodes. From another perspective,\
    \ fog \ncomputing contributes to decrease cloud computing energy consumption because\
    \ \nmost of the IoT requests are onloaded to the border of the network.\n5.9 Scalability\n\
    This feature is widely required in fog computing infrastructure. The fog data\
    \ \ncenters need to support the load balancing, agility, and elasticity of runtime,\
    \ these \nvariables contribute to efficiently control the variation in fog computing\
    \ workload. \nThis challenge is strongly linked to geo-distribution, since it\
    \ has been often required \nfor the fog data center to be efficiently geo-distributed,\
    \ in that way each fog datacen-\nter serves IoT devices existing in its coverage\
    \ area. The need for scalability is triggered \nby the instant and high demand\
    \ for the workload that can be created by IoT devices.\n5.10 Complexity\nIt is\
    \ obvious that IoT devices are limited in resources point of view, so onloading\
    \ \ntasks to the fog layers reduce the computational complexity of IoT devices\
    \ [66]. From \nanother perspective, the fog/edge computing approach reduces network\
    \ architecture \ncomplexity, as well as decreases the number of points of failures\
    \ in IoT systems. \nIntegrating ML capability in the fog layer minimizes the complexity\
    \ of the decision-\nmaking process.\n5.11 Heterogeneity\nIoT architecture is becoming\
    \ more heterogeneous day after day. A relevant \ndefinition of fog computing given\
    \ by Yi et al. [67] mentioned that “Fog Computing is \na geographically distributed\
    \ computing architecture with a resource pool which consists of \none or more\
    \ ubiquitously connected heterogeneous devices (including edge devices) …,” this\
    \ \ndefinition confirms that fog computing is supposed to manage data and devices\
    \ com-\ning from varied manufacturers. These devices have different physical characteristics\
    \ \nand require a variety of deployment methods.\n6. Blockchain technology for\
    \ digital farming\nWe mean by Blockchain a digital and distributed ledger that\
    \ protects the history \nof any digital asset from any alteration or unauthorized\
    \ modification, this protec-\ntion results from the use of hashing, cryptographic\
    \ techniques, public-private key \nDigital Agriculture, Methods and Applications\n\
    14\nfunctions, distributed databases, and processing, as well as consensus algorithms.\
    \ \nBlockchain is historically conceived in the creation of Bitcoin [68] by “Satoshi\
    \ \nNakamoto” in 2008 as a novel cryptocurrency purely digitalized. Although this\
    \ \ntechnology is still in its early stage, it recently creates a technological\
    \ revolution, \nthanks to its brought advantages, such as guaranteeing transparency,\
    \ auditability, \nanonymity, decentralization [69], and independency, as well\
    \ as reducing the risk of \nfrauds in transactions between machines in a P2P (Peer\
    \ to Peer) network. In the food \nand farming context, the combination between\
    \ Blockchain and IoT is a promising \ncontribution that immerged to improve the\
    \ traditional methods of farming manage-\nment. Blockchain technology can provide\
    \ farmers with new solutions to smartly \nmanage and monitor soil, engines, warehouses,\
    \ livestock, logistics, and supply chain. \nIt was expected in Ref. [70] that\
    \ the utilization of this technology in the supply chain \nmarket will reach $\
    \ 429.7 million by 2023. The need to build trust between the food \nproducers\
    \ and the consumers in the agri-food sector is a big concern that can call \n\
    Blockchain technology to provide transparency, efficiency, and sustainability\
    \ in the \nagri-food chain. Moreover, the more quantity and diversity of food\
    \ is produced, the \nmore compliances and audits are required, the information\
    \ resulting from the audits is \nstill managed with traditional paper or stored\
    \ in a centralized database, this approach \nof management is susceptible to suffer\
    \ from many issues such as error, lack of integ-\nrity, and data consistency,\
    \ as well as fraud and corruption in the case of paper-based \ninformation [71].\n\
    The following sub-sections discuss the possible solutions on how Blockchain tech-\n\
    nology can be used in digital farming and smart agriculture. Each section discusses\
    \ \nsome of the most relevant platforms adopted in Blockchain use cases upon which\
    \ IoT-\nbased intelligent farming applications are based. After consulting this\
    \ sub-section, \nthe reader will discover an obvious complementarity between the\
    \ use cases, it is up \nto the implementer of the Blockchain-based application\
    \ to decide either to combine \nmany use cases in one system or to focus on one\
    \ use case in its contribution. Figure 4 \nillustrates the possible seven use\
    \ cases of Blockchain in IF.\n6.1 IoT security optimization\nIt is difficult for\
    \ the traditional vision of networks to provide the requirements \nof IoT-based\
    \ IF systems notably latency, bandwidth, security, and reliability. A \nBlockchain-based\
    \ security architecture proposed to monitor the integrity of IoT col-\nlected\
    \ data by checking and preventing unhallowed alteration that can be caused by\
    \ \nDDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks on delivered data [72]. The Blockchain-\n\
    based solutions for improvement of IoT security in green agriculture cover many\
    \ \nareas [73] such as public key infrastructure support [74], machine learning-based\
    \ sys-\ntems [75], access control improvement [76, 77], reputation and trust use\
    \ case [78, 79], \namelioration of authentication and identification of IoT objects\
    \ thanks to the bubble \nof trust system [80]. The bubble of trust is analogically\
    \ a private VLAN (Virtual \nLocal Area Network) of sensors, communication between\
    \ sensors in the same bubble \nis fully private and secured because it must be\
    \ validated by the Blockchain network, \nfurthermore, no communication out of\
    \ this bubble is authorized. Figure 5 shows \na proposed scenario on how can Blockchain\
    \ be applied to secure transactions in an \nIoT system. When the positioning system\
    \ collects the location of the smart tractor, \na transaction is occurred and\
    \ is inserted in a new block, the generated block is sent \nto the other miners\
    \ for checking the solution used in the mining process. Once the \n15\nDigital\
    \ Agriculture and Intelligent Farming Business Using Information and Communication…\n\
    DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.102400\nmining solution is validated,\
    \ the block is addressed to the Blockchain nodes for valida-\ntion, and stored\
    \ in the Blockchain once it is verified. This process is fully decentral-\nized\
    \ and uses cryptography techniques and hashing.\nFigure 4. \nThe possible use\
    \ cases of Blockchain in intelligent farming.\nFigure 5. \nA proposed scenario\
    \ of a Blockchain-based IoT security optimization application.\nDigital Agriculture,\
    \ Methods and Applications\n16\n6.2 Fair pricing\nFarmers are the weak link in\
    \ the agri-food production chain, the price they got for \ntheir products does\
    \ not reflect their real provided efforts due to the existence of mul-\ntiple\
    \ middle layers of buyers. This issue happens because they lack marketing opportu-\n\
    nities, thus their products are not properly marketed, so they do not get the\
    \ deserved \nprice from the buyers. Thanks to Blockchain technology, farmers can\
    \ reach more \nbuyers and marketplaces than expected and can fairly discuss the\
    \ right price of their \ngoods. A decentralized farming approach named KHET is\
    \ proposed by Paul et al. [81] \nto slightly reduce this issue, KHET platform\
    \ enables farmers, companies, and buyers \nto communicate with each other, and\
    \ make commitments based on the smart contract \nwithout any intermediary. With\
    \ such a platform, farmers can finance their farming \nprojects without requesting\
    \ a loan from the bank. Figure 6 illustrates a proposed \nmodel of how can farmers\
    \ make deals fairly with retailers using Blockchain technology. \nThe farmer and\
    \ the retailers must be registered in the public Blockchain system, each \none\
    \ is identified with a unique identifier, which is its digital wallet address.\
    \ The deals \nare made on a dedicated agricultural platform which is channeled\
    \ with the Blockchain \nsystem using a dedicated API, the role of the API is to\
    \ retrieve and verify farmers’ and \nretailers’ addresses. The farmers are now\
    \ able to check and discuss the prices of their \nFigure 6. \nA proposed model\
    \ of agricultural fair pricing application based on Blockchain technology.\n17\n\
    Digital Agriculture and Intelligent Farming Business Using Information and Communication…\n\
    DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.102400\nproducts freely and fairly with\
    \ all interested stakeholders and without a middle-man. \nIf the farmer and the\
    \ retailer accept the conditions, the smart contract is established \nand the\
    \ amount of money can also be transferred from the retailer’s digital wallet to\
    \ the \nfarmer’s digital wallet using the digital money platform.\n6.3 Oversight\
    \ of agricultural subsidies\nTo help farmers in their multiple investments and\
    \ increase productivity, a new \ngovernmental subsidies distribution system should\
    \ be adopted. The classical meth-\nods of distributing aids to farmers lack transparency\
    \ due to information centraliza-\ntion and lack of coordination between agricultural\
    \ stakeholders. With Blockchain, \na decentralized ledger can be built to ensure\
    \ agricultural information sharing in a \nsecured manner. The digital ledger can\
    \ be made publically available, thus farmers \nFigure 7. \nA proposed scenario\
    \ of single farmer identity management using Blockchain in a multi-collaborators\
    \ \nenvironment.\nDigital Agriculture, Methods and Applications\n18\ncan see if\
    \ subsidies go it should be, as well as how much each farmer receives as aid.\
    \ \nIn this context, Abraham and Santosh Kumar [82] proposed a Blockchain-based\
    \ sys-\ntem to ensure transparency and reliability of the information in the subsidies\
    \ system. \nThe scenario proposed in Figure 7 provides a solution to deal with\
    \ the problem of \nfarmers’ identity management in a multi-collaborators environment,\
    \ each farmer \nis identified by a chain code which is a smart contract installed\
    \ on the peers of the \nprivate system of the AD (Agricultural Department), each\
    \ AD uses a certificate \nto authenticate the transaction in the public Blockchain\
    \ system and keep a private \nvalidated ledger. When the farmer sends a transaction,\
    \ it is accepted or refused \ndepending on the rules and the policy described\
    \ in the chain code. Agricultural \ndepartments are interfaced with the Blockchain\
    \ system to share the information \nsecurely with each other using the unique\
    \ identity of the farmer. When a transaction \noccurs between one or more AD,\
    \ it must be validated by the transaction verification \nsystem, which is composed\
    \ of the other agricultural collaborators. According to this \nscenario, farmers’\
    \ information is transparent and reliable for all the agricultural \ncollaborators,\
    \ Thus, subsidies go to the one who deserves them.\n6.4 Contract farming improvement\n\
    Smart contract occurs when it is self-managed without middle parties which \n\
    increases automation and decentralization of the tamper-proof of data, Ethereum\
    \ \nBlockchain [83] and Hyperledger Fabric represent an example of platforms that\
    \ \nsupport this kind of technology. They allow developers to implement their\
    \ Blockchain \nlayer and applications, such as smart contracts, in a decentralized\
    \ way. The Blockchain-\nbased IF use case enables the final consumers and the\
    \ partners to have full knowledge \nabout the agricultural product that they want\
    \ to buy or to retail. The integration of \nthe smart contract with IoT by Umamaheswari\
    \ et al. [84] helps to build trust between \nfarmers and consumers by providing\
    \ information about the origin and the environ-\nment in which the product is\
    \ grown and stored, as well as the ability to track the \ntransaction path. Moreover,\
    \ the implementation of smart contract in the agricultural \nprocess improves\
    \ the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) of data storing \nmethod\
    \ and enable the public to get a trustable license based on the comparison \n\
    between the products’ stored information in the data private chain and those publically\
    \ \navailable [85]. Data sharing in the IF environment is one of the major challenges\
    \ of the \ndistributed and scalable IoT systems, this issue is managed by Ur Rahman\
    \ et al. [86] \nthrough a data-sharing smart contract system with access control\
    \ capability. The smart \ncontract application is present in models proposed in\
    \ Figures 6-10.\n6.5 Overseeing farm inventory\nFarmers work hard and wait for\
    \ the post-harvest stage, it is difficult for a farmer \nto imagine any damage\
    \ in quantity or quality of his produce. Massive quantities of \nagricultural\
    \ products are wasted before it reaches the retailer. This big wastage can be\
    \ \navoided by monitoring some environmental parameters in the storage area. Humidity,\
    \ \ntemperature, and CO2 concentration are some variables that can be tracked\
    \ using \nIoT and sensors. Public ledgers using Blockchain allow to share information\
    \ about \nthe product storage operation between all the chain stakeholders, so\
    \ big visibility \nabout the product’s history is provided to all interested collaborators.\
    \ Moreover, \ncombining IoT and sensors to gather information about the inventory,\
    \ and public \nledgers to implement strategies to monitor this information can\
    \ be a perfect way \n19\nDigital Agriculture and Intelligent Farming Business\
    \ Using Information and Communication…\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.102400\n\
    to manage inventories and logistics flows. Vendor-managed inventories (VMI) is\
    \ a \npopular Blockchain-based collaborative inventory management policy, VMI\
    \ might \nbe founded on the smart contract between manufacturers, vendors, and\
    \ buyers [87], \nconsequently, each one of those collaborators can build its supply\
    \ chain strategy and \ninventory policy management [88]. The proposed architecture\
    \ in Figure 8 illustrates a \nBlockchain-based system for product inventory management.\
    \ Farming, manufactur-\ning, and supply chain processes are authenticated using\
    \ smart contracts and share the \nproducts’ data in the Blockchain system publically\
    \ available for consumers. All the \ntransactions occurring between the consumer\
    \ and the other stakeholders are man-\naged and protected by the smart contract,\
    \ the verified transaction are stored securely \nin the Blockchain. The consumer\
    \ can check the information related to the products \nbefore ordering them, or\
    \ track their safety on the farm, in the factory, or during the \ndelivery process.\n\
    6.6 Farming supply chain enhancement\nDemonstrating the quality of a product in\
    \ a producer-consumer relationship is the \ncritical weakness of community-supported\
    \ agriculture [89]. Without transparency \nand mechanisms of tracking and monitoring\
    \ in the production process, consum-\ners are unsure about the safety of the goods\
    \ they buy and receive. The traceability \nframeworks based on Blockchain technology\
    \ in the supply chain is an important \nkey feature not only to ensure the security\
    \ of the on-chain or off-chain encrypted \nFigure 8. \nA proposed scenario of\
    \ overseeing farm inventory using Blockchain.\nDigital Agriculture, Methods and\
    \ Applications\n20\nand stored data, but also to overcome the big latency that\
    \ can be generated when \nquerying databases [90] either by the public community\
    \ or by the relevant partners. \nCombining IoT, RFID, and QR (Quick Response)\
    \ code with Blockchain helps to build \nFigure 9. \nA proposed model of supply\
    \ chain enhancement using Blockchain technology.\nFigure 10. \nA proposed Blockchain-based\
    \ FMS scenario.\n21\nDigital Agriculture and Intelligent Farming Business Using\
    \ Information and Communication…\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.102400\n\
    powerful supply chain systems to track agricultural food from farmer to retailer\
    \ and \nmake product information accessible to all users [91]. Figure 9 shows\
    \ a proposed \nmodel for a supply chain enhancement use case. The food information\
    \ is shared in \nall the supply chain phases. IoT and sensors collect data related\
    \ to the environment \nwhere the crop is grown, the manufacturing conditions,\
    \ the shipment and logistic \nflow, and the retailing environment. The consumer\
    \ through his mobile application \ngenerates a transaction (new command of a product)\
    \ and checks the product’s shared \ndetails. On the other hand, the supplier can\
    \ make his offer, the smart contract is for \nprotecting the valid transaction\
    \ between consumer and supplier, as well as storing the \nnew transactions in\
    \ the Blockchain system.\n6.7 Enhancement of farm management software\nModern\
    \ farming requires the modernization of all its processes including \nFMS (Farming\
    \ Management Software), traditional FMS are based on a classical \nclient-server\
    \ based-approach, this method does not satisfy the growing demand on \ninputs-outputs\
    \ as well as enough security level for data protection. With Blockchain \ntechnology,\
    \ more sophisticated and secured systems for supply chain management, \nsmart\
    \ greenhouse, and livestock are provided, so that farmers and analysts who care\
    \ \nabout data integrity and uncertainty will not worry anymore about intentional\
    \ or \naccidental alterations that can be caused by one of the information flow\
    \ manipula-\ntors. It is expected that the FMS market growth will reach $4.22\
    \ Billion by 2025 [92], \nthanks to the widespread of Blockchain solutions and\
    \ the wide usage of IoT, sensors, \nas well as artificial intelligence in the\
    \ farm management workflow. The model pro-\nposed in Figure 10 explains an FMS\
    \ use case. A secured and decentralized manage-\nment of the farm’s processes\
    \ is achieved, the principal role of the smart contract is to \nauthenticate all\
    \ the decentralized processes and ensure the integrity of the transac-\ntions\
    \ that can be occurred between them. The data gathered in each decentralized \n\
    process are shared with the public consumers through the public Blockchain system,\
    \ \nthe consumer can check the origin, the expiry date, and other information\
    \ related to \nthe warehousing with a simple scan of the QR code of the product.\
    \ If the consumer \nis satisfied, he/she can supply orders to the farmers, and\
    \ the smart contract is estab-\nlished. The farm distributed processes and the\
    \ consumers’ orders are managed using \nthe FMS decentralized consol.\n7. Research\
    \ and development in digital farming\nAn overview of the published literature\
    \ on the actual status of ICT usage in digital \nfarming, particularly IoT-fog/edge/cloud\
    \ computing, and Blockchain technologies \nreveals that most growers are interested\
    \ in understanding the optimum conditions in \nopen-field and closed-field crop\
    \ production that results in reducing inputs, and at the \nsame time maximized\
    \ crop yield and quality. Our previous studies and survey show \nthat some of\
    \ the trending research topics in this context include (1) development of \ndigital\
    \ twin models that receives live data from various wireless sensors for improving\
    \ \nefficiency of crop production systems [93], (2) adaptation of multi-robot\
    \ platforms \nfor wireless and IoT data collection [94], (3) health assessment,\
    \ stress identifica-\ntion, and early disease detection using UAV remote sensing\
    \ [95], (4) development \nof soil-test kits that can be mounted on mobile-robots\
    \ for spontaneous determina-\ntion of macronutrients in soil [96], (5) yield prediction\
    \ and yield estimation using \nDigital Agriculture, Methods and Applications\n\
    22\nmodel-based and AI algorithms [97–99], (6) evaluation of crop growth environment\
    \ \nprior to the actual cultivation for preventing yield loss (i.e., predictive\
    \ models that \ncan be leveraged as a part of digital twin) [100], (7) development\
    \ of virtual orchard \nmodels using photogrammetry [101], (8) smart irrigation\
    \ with solar powered IoT \ncontrolled actuators [102], (9) reducing time losses\
    \ of machinery and increasing their \nfield efficiency by using fleet management\
    \ software [103], and (10) robotic weed-\ning and harvesting [104, 105]. The success\
    \ of such systems in our point of view is \nintimately linked to some important\
    \ factors like the accuracy and complexity of ML/\nDL algorithms used to make\
    \ IF decisions, as well as the availability of enough datasets \nto train and\
    \ validate the ML/DL algorithms. From a Blockchain point of view, the \nhorizontal\
    \ and vertical scalability of IoT systems introduces more complexity in data \n\
    sharing models within IF systems. The success of Bitcoin, as a result of Blockchain,\
    \ \nis proven but the mutual collaboration between Blockchain contributors requires\
    \ \nmore maturity. Moreover, more efforts and works have to be provided to sensitize\
    \ the \npublic, the community of regulators, and the contributors about the need\
    \ to invest \nin Blockchain development, without forgetting to address the scalability\
    \ challenge \n(technologically speaking, it has a direct impact on the number\
    \ of transactions). \nFurthermore, farmers in IF ecosystems need to make payments\
    \ and receive subsidies \nfrom the government using cryptocurrency, transactions\
    \ in this situation are sus-\nceptible to be targeted with selfish mining [106].\
    \ Blockchain is an open system, any \nminer can join the chain, and selfish miners\
    \ can outperform honest miners and then \ncan threaten the security of the transaction.\
    \ It is a fact that Blockchain frameworks \nand updates for coding are publicly\
    \ available, but they often lack the needed level of \nvalidation and verification\
    \ against bugs, security breaches, and errors [107], so new \nresearches and efforts\
    \ are required in this direction.\nAnother important needed research is how to\
    \ achieve interoperability between \nthe Blockchain projects namely cross-chain,\
    \ or between Blockchain and the exiting \ndata models. The required interoperability\
    \ in Blockchain enables users to take the full \nbenefits of distributed Blockchain\
    \ in terms of sharing information smoothly. As the \nmain purpose of Blockchain\
    \ is to fight against the centralization aspect, a big concern \nshould be given\
    \ to show how to build a strategy to share agricultural data (known \ncrops diseases\
    \ and solutions, best practices to increase yield) between farmers’ \ndecentralized\
    \ ecosystems. The environmental impact of these technologies is always \nignored\
    \ or never addressed. Since sensors and electromagnetic fields generated by \n\
    gateways are directly interacting with animals, soil, and vegetation, a serious\
    \ study \nshould be made to evaluate the degree of impact that the waste material\
    \ of such \ntechnologies can have on the environment.\n7.1 Machine learning for\
    \ IoT-based digital farming\nThe efficiency and effectiveness of agriculture are\
    \ driven by machine learning and \ndeep learning techniques, these two mechanisms\
    \ enable machines to learn and ana-\nlyze data without even being programmed.\
    \ ML/DL has emerged simultaneously with \nthe Big data discipline to detect relationships,\
    \ analyze patterns, and make predictions \nin farming activities. An example of\
    \ applying a supervised machine learning algo-\nrithm with multiple distance detection\
    \ sensors for autonomous navigation of a field \nagent robot is proposed by the\
    \ SunBot project and shown in Figure 11. This robot is \nused for health assessment\
    \ inside berry orchards and to collect data for supporting \ndigital agriculture.\
    \ Since traditional approaches and methods for farming manage-\nment do not allow\
    \ to increase productivity, farms nowadays need to be partially or \n23\nDigital\
    \ Agriculture and Intelligent Farming Business Using Information and Communication…\n\
    DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.102400\nfully automated using IoT systems\
    \ to collect data, and ML/DL to make data inspec-\ntions and drive the decision-making\
    \ tasks. ML/DL technology helps farmers and \nscientists to select the appropriate\
    \ species that respond to specific requirements in \nterms of diseases resistance,\
    \ adaptation for specific aquatic or soil conditions, this \nclassification task\
    \ was quite tedious for farmers or scientists, but with ML/DL, a huge \nquantity\
    \ of unorganized data is gathered and analyzed automatically to finally choose\
    \ \nwhich genome is suitable for breeding. In some cases, such as plant health\
    \ monitoring, \nit is needed to compare plants according to their colors, leaf\
    \ morphology, and shapes, \nin that case, ML/DL can be the solution to perform\
    \ the fast and accurate classifica-\ntion. In this context, Thaiyalnayaki et al.\
    \ [108] used SVM to classify soybean diseases, \nand [109] performed plant leaf\
    \ diseases classification based on visible symptoms.\nSoil management is another\
    \ farming process that has benefited from ML/DL \nand IoT technologies, the buried\
    \ sensors collect real-time data about the under-\nground ecosystems such as temperature\
    \ and moisture, and transfer them to ML/DL \nalgorithms to estimate the quantity\
    \ of water needed for irrigation, or evaluate the \nquantity of nutrients required\
    \ for optimal growth of crops. Superficial sensors play \na major role in measuring\
    \ temperature, humidity, pressure, evaporation, and evapo-\ntranspiration, these\
    \ climatological and hydrological parameters among others can be \nused by ML/DL\
    \ algorithms to estimate exactly how much water is needed to irrigate a \ngiven\
    \ surface area without any wastage. To avoid wastage related to weather forecast\
    \ \nuncertainty, Chen et al. [110] used a short-term weather forecasts method\
    \ to pro-\npose an optimal irrigation strategy. Another important role of ML/DL\
    \ in intelligent \nfarming is the accurate yield prediction in quantity and quality,\
    \ this prediction can be \nuseful in crop monitoring tasks and market price forecasting.\
    \ From this vision, many \npopular ML/DL algorithms are compared in Ref. [111]\
    \ in terms of three crops yield \nprediction, they reported good prediction skills\
    \ of the SVM ML algorithm compared \nto the other tested ML/DL methods. Traditional\
    \ methods to control crops diseases \nwidely spread pesticides in all the field,\
    \ this treatment method leads to wastage and \ndoes not ensure the required level\
    \ of efficiency, as well as harming of environment. \nModern farms use computer\
    \ vision techniques to accurately detect where to apply \npesticides, when to\
    \ apply, how much is needed, and use drones to apply pesticides \nwith high precision.\
    \ Consequently, more financial benefits are won by the farmer \nwith no environmental\
    \ side effects. Weeds density detection and treatment are \nexamples of computer\
    \ vision use case that was applied by [112] to control the area of \ntreatment.\n\

    \ for assisted navigation of a four-wheel \nsteering field robot agent. Source:\
    \ SunBot.de.\nDigital Agriculture, Methods and Applications\n24\nLike crops management\
    \ monitoring, there is livestock management monitoring, \nthe use of IoT and ML/DL\
    \ in this farming activity enables farmers to predict the \nproductivity of meets\
    \ and eggs based on actual or past data. For example, a drone \ncan make a scan\
    \ of the field and count the number and the position of the cattle. A \ncomputer\
    \ vision system with smart cameras can monitor the mental condition of \ncows\
    \ to detect their preferred time of milking or the quantity of feeds they want,\
    \ as \nwell as the amount of nutrients in their milk using sensors. The visible\
    \ symptoms \ndetected through computer vision techniques are used to measure animal\
    \ welfare by \nmonitoring the health conditions of animals, and predicting if\
    \ a member of the cattle \nis sick or wants to eat or to drink.\n7.2 Wireless\
    \ communication for seamless connectivity in digital farming\nConnectivity, as\
    \ we said earlier, is an important component in IoT smart systems, \nthis component\
    \ is a challenging issue in rural environments where cellular network \ncoverage\
    \ may be absent, or only 2G networks are available, in this kind of cellular \n\
    network, a limited number of devices can be supported that leads to a lack or\
    \ reduced \nperformance in data transfer. Nowadays, 3G/4G cellular networks are\
    \ enough to \nbuild usual and smart farming applications. However, to unlock the\
    \ potentials of \nIoT systems, two promising connectivity solutions, according\
    \ to McKinsey Global \nInstitute [113], are expected to be developed, these technologies\
    \ are being referred to \nas “advanced” and “frontier.” An example includes IoT-based\
    \ collision avoidance sen-\nsors for autonomous electrical mowers that are capable\
    \ of transmitting their distance \nmeasurement via WiFi and LoRa. While the main\
    \ communication between different \nFigure 12. \nPerception system with IoT-based\
    \ LPWAN sensors for collision avoidance of a robotic mower. Source: SunBot.de.\n\
    25\nDigital Agriculture and Intelligent Farming Business Using Information and\
    \ Communication…\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.102400\nelectrical\
    \ control units (ECU) for such system still relies on CANBUS and the detected\
    \ \ndistances can be logged on an onboard SD card (Figure 12), but the use of\
    \ IoT-based \nECUs that are independent of GPS and WiFi, provide the operator\
    \ with LoRa mes-\nsages for real-time monitoring of the mower status. This approach\
    \ also makes possible \nsimple switch control of the device in remote areas where\
    \ WiFi and mobile coverage is \nnot available. The architecture of this system\
    \ is shown in Figure 12.\nThe advanced connectivity represents the next generation\
    \ of already existing \ninfrastructures, we mention here the upgrade that is occurring\
    \ by providers of 4G \ntechnology toward 5G, this upgrade offers more improvement\
    \ in speed, bandwidth, \nand latency, and the number of supported devices will\
    \ be increased as well. For \nnow, the evolution of wired connectivity, such as\
    \ optical fibers, can offer the best \nperformances in terms of latency, bandwidth,\
    \ and speed especially in the core of \nthe network, or in environments where\
    \ mobility is not a crucial factor. Not Far from \nwireless networks, the Wi-Fi\
    \ Alliance has certified the new standard 802.11ax known \nas Wi-Fi 6/6Extended,\
    \ this new connectivity solution offers for devices a wide range \nof frequency\
    \ and improved gain of speed that was estimated to achieve 40%, the \ntheoretical\
    \ speed of the network was estimated to reach 10 Gb/s, the Wi-Fi 6E offers \n\
    11 Gb/s as a theoretical speed with larger spectrum channels. These advantages\
    \ enable \nIF devices to be connected seamlessly and smoothly, and the number\
    \ of supported \ndevices will be improved as well. The revolution in connectivity\
    \ solutions has also \nbeen made by short-range technologies (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,\
    \ RFID) and low power wide \narea networks (LPWAN, LoRa, LoRaWan, NB-IoT), these\
    \ technologies are usually \nused for tagging, tracking, or identification. These\
    \ technologies have become more \nsophisticated and adapted for seamless connectivity\
    \ in intelligent farming. The fron-\ntier connectivity is mostly designed for\
    \ high mobility systems that need high speed, \nreliability, security, and minimal\
    \ latency. Low earth orbit (LEO) and 5G networks \nare two options that will be\
    \ developed to satisfy all IoT requirements. LEO constel-\nlations provide seamless\
    \ connectivity services for IoT-based IF systems installed in \ndistributed rural\
    \ areas, or in zones where the terrestrial network is not available, so \nsatellite\
    \ coverage is needed. The other option of frontier connectivity is the 5G cellular\
    \ \nnetworks, which promises to combine all the advantages of wired fiber in the\
    \ air to be \nmore adapted to IoT systems and wireless sensor networks.\n7.3 Connectivity\
    \ challenges of wireless sensing under field conditions\nIn remote areas, it is\
    \ more adapted to use wireless devices as they allow to cover \nwider areas, but\
    \ the energy consumed by these devices and their limited source of \nenergy creates\
    \ a big challenge that needs to be addressed. Figure 13 shows multiple \nsolar-powered\
    \ LoRa sensors that have been deployed in different berry orchards in \nthe state\
    \ of Brandenburg in Germany for IoT monitoring of agricultural parameters \n(i.e.,\
    \ air and soil temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, leaf wetness, light\
    \ \ncondition, and dew-point temperature). The wider area the IF system covers,\
    \ the \nmore power is consumed, some solutions are proposed to solve this issue,\
    \ such as \nphotovoltaic panels and the choice of low power consumption sensors.\
    \ For instance, \nif BLE or low power consumption devices are used, the coverage\
    \ area will be reduced \nbecause energy consumption will also be reduced, but\
    \ if a wider communication \nrange is needed, Wi-Fi connectivity can be adopted\
    \ but energy consumption will be \nhigh. Technologies like LPWAN, LoRa, and LoRaWan\
    \ adopt more efficient energetic \nstrategies and a high communication range.\
    \ Another connectivity limitation is the \nwireless signal quality. In remote\
    \ areas where geographical issues are encountered, the \nDigital Agriculture,\
    \ Methods and Applications\n26\nwireless signal may have an attenuation problem\
    \ because of multiple environmental \nobstacles or electromagnetic noises that\
    \ can be introduced. The propagation of wire-\nless signals can also be an issue\
    \ that can be mitigated by installing signal repeaters or \ndesigning more efficient\
    \ topologies such as mesh. The IoT and WSN systems manage-\nment is another solution\
    \ to reduce the connectivity limitations of intelligent farming \nsystems, some\
    \ of the management best practices are: (1) Designing an optimal size \nof the\
    \ sensor network, here the number of sensors and the number of intermediary \n\
    nodes to reach the gateway are to be considered because this factor impacts the\
    \ com-\nmunication range and the latency of data transmission. (2) The calibration\
    \ of all WSN \nnodes whether sensors or gateways, this maintenance action improves\
    \ the lifetime \nof the battery, especially in devices that operate in a wide\
    \ range [114]. (3) Using \noptimized transmission protocols, many protocols are\
    \ identified in the literature as \nefficient solutions to optimize transmission\
    \ tasks, either to save the energy of the \nbattery, to optimize the routing strategy,\
    \ or to increase the coverage area.\n7.4 Challenges with IoT monitoring in remote\
    \ areas\nOther issues that are encountered when designing an IoT-based intelligent\
    \ farming \nsystem are related to interoperability [115], technological development,\
    \ data heteroge-\nneity management, scalability and flexibility of the system,\
    \ fault tolerance, complexity \nof the system and the harsh environment, energetic\
    \ issue, and the need for professionals \nto implement and manage the system.\
    \ The interoperability issue takes four different \nformats, it can be technical,\
    \ organizational, semantic, or synthetical, all of these four \ncomponents are\
    \ interdependent, but the most common issue is the technical one, this \nis occurred\
    \ due to the hardware and software differences between manufacturers, \nthese\
    \ differences imply heterogeneity in protocols and connectivity standards, so\
    \ when \nimplementing the IF system, the farmer finds himself in front of many\
    \ incompatible \ntechnical choices that he should manage particularly if there\
    \ is an already existing sys-\ntem that it has to be taken into account. The integration\
    \ issue can go beyond hardware \nFigure 13. \nImplementation of multiple solar-powered\
    \ LoRa sensors in different berry orchards for IoT monitoring of field \nparameters.\
    \ Source: SunBot.de.\n27\nDigital Agriculture and Intelligent Farming Business\
    \ Using Information and Communication…\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.102400\n\
    compatibility to software conflicts that can create a new challenge of integrating\
    \ \nnew IoT points with the existing management software or vice-versa. The velocity\
    \ of \ntechnological development is another issue of IoT implementation in IF,\
    \ the hardware \nand the software related to IoT systems are evolving rapidly,\
    \ which leads to the continu-\nous emergence of new efficient frameworks, the\
    \ upgrade process can be expensive in \nterms of infrastructure or maintenance.\
    \ The scalability and flexibility of the IF system \nmeasure the level of opening,\
    \ centralization, ease of integration with other existing \nsystems and platforms,\
    \ and ability to scale the system in terms of the number of nodes \nand storage,\
    \ this issue represents an example of organizational interoperability. We \nrarely\
    \ find all the implemented components of the IoT system from the same manufac-\n\
    turer, this technological heterogeneity and the lack of a global standard that\
    \ unifies the \nformat of data managed by each technology is challenging for the\
    \ farmer. Some efforts \nin this context have been made by the Agricultural Industry\
    \ Electronics Foundation \n(AEF) to propose the ISOBUS database (actual version\
    \ is ISO 11783-1:2017) as an \nattempt to fill the heterogeneity in data format\
    \ for agricultural machinery, this issue \nrepresents an example of semantic interoperability.\
    \ The fault-tolerance measures the \nrobustness of the designed IF system. When\
    \ implementing the IoT-based IF system, \nthe farmer is invited to manage all\
    \ the hardware faults and system errors that can be \noccurred, the fewer harmful\
    \ events the system generates, the more reliability the system \nhas. However,\
    \ farmers need to have particular skills for better management of these \ndamaging\
    \ events. As we discussed before, the power strategy in IF systems represents\
    \ \na big issue that makes energetic barriers in front of IoT systems implementation\
    \ and \nneeds to be taken into account. Because the farming system is composed\
    \ of multiple \nheterogeneous hardware and software components, the management\
    \ and the integra-\ntion tasks could be more or less difficult depending on the\
    \ level of complexity generated \nby the adopted topology, the interoperability\
    \ between the elements of the system, and \nthe opening degree of the adopted\
    \ technology. In fact, the complexity is not an issue \nfor the farmer only, but\
    \ the manufacturers also should consider it while designing their \nproducts.\
    \ The reliability and efficiency of the IF system are greatly impacted by the\
    \ \nenvironment where it is deployed, geographical and climatological characteristics\
    \ such \nas high temperature, wind speed, heavy rain, and dusty environments can\
    \ destroy the \nsensors or can make them totally out of service [116]. Thus, choosing\
    \ the hardware \nthat resists environmental damages is considered a big responsibility\
    \ that should be \nFigure 14. \nRedundant LoRa sensors with modular accessories\
    \ and multiple transmitters and gateways to overcome \nuncertainties and connectivity\
    \ issues in actual field conditions. Source: SunBot.de.\nDigital Agriculture,\
    \ Methods and Applications\n28\nconsidered when implementing the IoT-based IF\
    \ system. Figure 14 shows a modular IoT \nsolution with multiple LoRa sensors\
    \ and gateways that have been custom-built for the \nSunBot project to withstand\
    \ harsh field conditions and overcome the issues with WiFi \ninstability. Each\
    \ sensor is benefitting from multiple transmitters to reduce the probabil-\nity\
    \ of signal loss, and multiple gateways to ensure data uploads to the private\
    \ cloud.\n8. Conclusion\nThe interactions between the human and virtual world\
    \ are increasingly develop-\ning day after day, thanks to the widespread connectivity\
    \ solutions and the ubiquity \nof connected objects that rapidly become smart.\
    \ ML/DL also is one of the promis-\ning topics that gain recently the big attention\
    \ of the research community since it \ncapitalizes the efforts made in IoT data\
    \ management fields and the evolution of Fog/\ncloud computing paradigms. In this\
    \ survey, we discussed the IoT-based systems’ \nrequirements and shed light on\
    \ the components of an intelligent farming IoT model \nas well as the open challenges\
    \ resulting from the integration of IoT systems and fog \ncomputing technology.\
    \ We talked later about Blockchain technology, its applications \nto improve the\
    \ intelligence and the security of the farming field. From another hand, \nwe\
    \ discussed the needed researches to apply Blockchain more accurately in the farm-\n\
    ing domain. This paper is closed with a discussion about the main limitations\
    \ that the \nimplementation of IoT in intelligent farming is facing. In summary,\
    \ the significant \nresults of this survey can be summarized in the three following\
    \ points—(1) this \nsurvey investigates the implementation of ICT in farming environments\
    \ to solve \nmany current serious issues related to management methods. IoT-based\
    \ applications \ncombined with machine learning are complete solutions to efficiently\
    \ improve crop \nyields without wasting too much resources. The second result\
    \ concerns Blockchain \ntechnology that can be integrated with IoT-based farming\
    \ systems to provide efficient \nsecurity solutions and build trust between farmers\
    \ each other, or between farmers \nand consumers. Furthermore, we enable the reader\
    \ to discover the seven significant \napplications of Blockchain in the intelligent\
    \ farming field to improve security in IoT \nsystems, fair pricing, agricultural\
    \ subsidies oversight, the smart contract to securely \nmanage the relationships\
    \ between all the farming stakeholders, farm inventory \noverseeing, amelioration\
    \ of supply chain and farm management software. This study \nalso summarizes the\
    \ open challenges resulting from the integration of IoT with fog/\nedge mining\
    \ that creates many research problematics as well as makes the imple-\nmentation\
    \ of such solutions in the farming world very challenging tasks. (2) Many \nprevious\
    \ papers addressed the issue of implementing ICT in farming processes, but \n\
    this work particularly elaborated the transition from cloud computing to fog/edge\
    \ \ncomputing to serve IoT applications and added the integration of Blockchain\
    \ in the \nfarming field, its benefits, challenges, and applications. Finally,\
    \ some recommended \nresearches are needed to concretize the implementation of\
    \ the proposed Blockchain \nmodels and propose another model for each farming\
    \ activity. From another hand, \nthe development of Blockchain technology requires\
    \ serious investment efforts to \nprovide a complete legal arsenal for better\
    \ and safe implementation. (3) Although \nBlockchain technology is designed to\
    \ build trust, its implementation in the intelligent \nfarming workflow is still\
    \ confronting many barriers related to the lack of trust [117] \nnotably regulatory\
    \ uncertainty (with 48%), lack of trust among users (45%), separate \nBlockchain\
    \ systems not working together (41%), inability to scale (21%), intellectual \n\
    property concerns (30%), and audit-compliance concerns (20%).\nDigital Agriculture\

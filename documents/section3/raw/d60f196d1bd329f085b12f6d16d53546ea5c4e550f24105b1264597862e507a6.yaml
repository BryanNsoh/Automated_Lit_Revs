    Notes Abstract Recent advancements in wireless communication technology have brought
    about the pressing issue of increasing spectrum scarcity. This challenge in spectrum
    allocation arises from ongoing research in the field of wireless communication.
    Unfortunately, a significant portion of the spectrum remains underutilized within
    wireless networks. Cognitive radio (CR) presents an innovative solution to this
    problem by enabling unlicensed secondary users to coexist with licensed primary
    users within allocated spectrum bands without causing interference to the primary
    users’ communications. This paper promises to address the spectrum redundancy
    challenges and substantially improve the spectrum utilization efficiency. Cognitive
    radio networks (CRNs), alternatively known as dynamic spectrum access networks,
    are comprised of multiple CR nodes and are frequently referred to as next generation
    (XG) communication networks. These XG communication networks are expected to offer
    high-speed data transmission capabilities to adaptable users through a variety

    they are more susceptible to various types of attacks compared to their wired

    This paper presents two key approaches: the node evaluation and selection (NES)
    algorithm and the secure spectrum sensing mechanism, which incorporate the user’s
    interaction history and connection distance, that are recorded in a public ledger
    and managed by a blockchain management system. The proposed algorithm facilitates
    the central aggregation point for selecting nodes with outstanding performance
    for cooperative sensing, thus enhancing the network’s security against malicious
    node attacks. Keywords: blockchain; cognitive radio network; error rate; NES algorithm;

    is rapidly gaining momentum, driven by the ever-evolving industry landscape. Numerous
    startups have embarked on blockchain projects, and investments in this technology
    have surged significantly. Despite blockchain’s ongoing development in terms of
    technological maturity, there is a continuous surge in innovative experimental
    adoption and customization [1]. Blockchain possesses the potential to disrupt
    established innovations and reshape industries or create entirely new ones [1].
    The initial trends in the emergence of cryptocurrencies have already demonstrated
    that blockchain technology is a disruptive force in the banking and financial
    services sectors [2]. Notably, cryptocurrencies have the potential to challenge
    centralized banking systems by eliminating the transaction fees typically associated
    with credit and debit card usage [3]. Recent developments suggest that blockchain
    is transitioning from a disruptive technology to a sustaining one [4]. Its significant
    potential extends well beyond the realm of finance and is poised to have a substantial
    impact on supply chain management, healthcare, the Internet of Things (IoT), education,
    and public services. The commercial feasibility and acceptance of blockchain are
    steadily increasing [3]. The patent landscape further underscores the growing
    influence of blockchain, with more than 3021 patent families associated with blockchain
    applications falling into four sub-categories: payments and transaction systems,
    financial services business, administration, and e-commerce [5]. Blockchain’s
    high level of security is attributed to its extensive use of cryptography and
    decentralization. Concerns about privacy, often associated with public blockchains,
    can be addressed by implementing blockchains in a controlled manner, known as
    permissioned blockchain, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. An overview of the blockchain
    architectures. Blockchain has the capacity to record various types of transactions,
    contracts, data assets, or virtually any information that can be stored digitally
    [6]. Blockchain records possess enduring qualities and are digitally structured,
    transparent, and easily accessible, as shown in Figure 1. Each newly generated
    “block” is appended to the end of an existing “chain,” and the initiation, validation,
    storage, and distribution of each block are governed by a predefined protocol
    [7]. This technology eliminates the necessity for third-party intermediaries,
    as participants within the blockchain network execute complex algorithms to verify
    the integrity of the records within the block. Blockchain presents an intriguing
    alternative to conventional data storage methods [8]. Historically, databases
    have been the primary means of data storage. While databases offer speed and user-friendliness,
    they also come with limitations and challenges, such as the absence of immutability
    [1,9]. Table 1 outlines the key distinctions between blockchain and traditional
    databases. Blockchain databases offer distinct advantages and trade-offs, making
    them suitable for different use cases based on specific requirements for data
    security, transparency, immutability, and decentralization [10]. A blockchain
    system comprises various integral components that collaborate to facilitate business
    transactions and operations [6]. Table 1. Comparison of databases with blockchain
    [1]. Node: A node refers to a computational unit within the blockchain network
    with the capability to initiate, receive, or validate transactions [11]. It operates
    using software applications designed for specific business use cases. Typically,
    blockchains feature two types of nodes. Validator Nodes: These nodes possess enhanced
    capabilities, allowing them to initiate, receive, and validate transactions. Member
    Nodes: Member nodes, on the other hand, are limited to initiating and receiving
    transactions. Transaction: In the context of a blockchain, a transaction is a
    collection of various data items that convey information about the exchange of
    assets, services, entities, events, or anything of value. Block: A block is a
    data structure tasked with storing a collection of transactions. After undergoing
    successful verification, each block is distributed to all the nodes across the
    blockchain network. Block Number: This identifier uniquely identifies blocks within
    the chain of blocks. User Nodes: User nodes are primarily responsible for initiating
    transactions and do not engage in block verification. These components collectively
    form the foundation of a blockchain system, enabling secure, transparent, and
    tamper-resistant transactions and data management. Several well-known consensus
    algorithms are Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (POS), Proof of Activity (POA),
    which combines elements of both POW and POS [12], and Proof of Capacity (POC).
    2. Blockchain-Based CRN Security Technique Blockchain is a basic innovation preoccupied
    via Bitcoin. It is another use of conventional innovation in the web period that
    incorporates conveyed information stockpiling innovation, remote organizations,
    agreement systems, and cryptography [7]. Table 2 A, B represents the block structure
    in a blockchain radio network. As a decentralization public data set, blockchain
    utilizes public keying cryptographical calculations, hashing capacities, agreement
    instruments, and different innovations to fabricate a decentralized non-verification
    framework that could be utilized in internet business to guarantee client data
    security [7,13]. It would additionally advance the course of monetary globalization
    and would enormously affect the current monetary marketing design and, surprisingly,
    social design [5]. Blockchain innovation enjoys the benefits of the lowest exchange
    costs, solid straightforwardness, and the highest securities. Normal issues like
    a significant expense, low effectiveness, and low information stockpiling security
    in the normalized data set give groundbreaking thoughts [13,14]. Blockchain is
    a carefully designed, full history information base stockpiling innovation that
    ordinarily utilizes highlight direct innovation to coordinate every hub. Every
    hub understands the elements of steering, and a new hub distinguishes proof and
    information dispersal via multicast. By utilizing cryptography, it can create
    related information blocks. The created information could look at the legitimacy
    of the data and likewise understand the solid connection via the following information
    [15]. Taking into account the benefits of blockchain innovation, this paper gives
    a psychological remote organization security calculation dependent on blockchains
    [11]. Table 2. (A, B) Block structure in a blockchain radio network summary [1].
    Algo Design Structure Clients speak via the block chain framework in the combination
    place. The particular construction is displayed in Figure 2. The IoT gadget sends
    its hub data to the combination place, and the combination community inquiries
    the blockchain framework for the presence of its hub data. Afterwards, the hub
    sends the information endorsed via the private keying to the combination place,
    and checks when the detecting hub had a relating private keying paired signature.
    Figure 2. Security calculation construction of the intellectual remote organization.
    Assuming is the above, the hub’s solicitation is forwarded to the blockchain framework,
    and the reaction of the blockchain framework is sent back to the detecting hub.
    Some potential research gaps identified in CRN security are in the field of physical
    layer security, machine learning-based attacks and defenses, security in spectrum
    sensing, coexistence with legacy systems, dynamic key management, privacy preservation,
    cross-layer security, resilience against jamming and spoofing, blockchain and
    distributed ledgers, secure localization, and security education and awareness
    [16]. 3. Blockchain Technology Blockchain-Based Secure Spectrum This paper presents
    blockchain innovation and a notoriety system into the range detecting measure.
    Another safe range detecting strategy was proposed. This security detecting strategy
    incorporated the assessment of the client’s immediate standing and suggestion
    notoriety. To stay away from conspiracy assault and malevolent hub conduct, the
    detecting results were more precise. The particular working course of the safety
    range detection dependent on blockchain innovation is displayed in Figure 3. The
    value was determined using Equation (1). 𝑇 𝑖 = 𝑁 𝑖 𝑘 𝜃 𝜔 𝑖 (1) Figure 3. Flow
    chart depicting the security enhancement in CRNs through the blockchain-based
    spectrum sensing algorithm. In Equation (1), Ti addresses the ith detecting period,
    Ni is the quantity of all the detecting periods up to the Ti time frame. The significance
    of k is equivalent to and shows the right number of intuitive detections in the
    history, θ implies the detecting activity force, its worth is determined by ωi,
    which is the impact coefficient of the detecting times in the public record book.
    Its worth is determined by Equations (2) and (3). 𝜃=1− 𝑒 |− 𝑘 𝑚𝑛 | (2) 𝜔 𝑖 = ∑
    𝑛 𝑖=1 | ℎ 1 𝑚 . 𝑙 𝑛 | (3) where h1 is the number of cooperations in l period,
    m is the size of the detecting period in every period, and n is the all-out association
    time frame. It can be seen from the equation that the nearer the cooperation history
    in the public record book, the more prominent the extent, and the effect on the
    trust worth will increment as needed. At the point when the trust worth of the
    hub is not in the front line, with everything being equal, the hub is chosen by
    figuring the extensive trust esteem, and the thorough trust worth of the hub is
    determined by Equation (4). 𝑇 𝑖,𝑐 =∅ 𝑇 𝑖 +𝜑| 𝑇 𝑖 +𝜃 ∑ 𝑖 𝑤 𝑖 | (4) The blockchain
    can contribute to improving CRN security for immutable transaction records, secure
    spectrum allocation, consensus mechanisms, decentralization, secure identity and
    authentication, transparency and trust, and resilience to sybil attacks and data
    integrity. By integrating blockchain technology into CRNs, network operators can
    enhance security, transparency, and trust in spectrum allocation and access. It
    provides a robust foundation for managing spectrum resources and mitigating various
    security threats commonly associated with dynamic and shared spectrum environments
    [17]. The NES algorithm plays a crucial role within the context of dynamic spectrum
    sensing in CRNs. Its primary purpose is to effectively and intelligently evaluate
    and select the nodes that will participate in the spectrum sensing process, ultimately
    improving the overall efficiency and reliability of spectrum utilization [18].
    The NES algorithm aims to address the challenges of dynamic spectrum sensing in
    CRNs, where multiple nodes must collaboratively sense and share information about
    the available spectrum bands. Its core purposes are node evaluation, node selection,
    efficiency enhancement, and reliability improvement. In dynamic spectrum sensing
    scenarios [19], where the availability of spectrum bands can change rapidly, the
    NES algorithm is highly relevant and valuable. The NES algorithm serves as an
    intelligent mechanism for selecting nodes in CRNs, ensuring that spectrum sensing
    is efficient, reliable, and adaptable to the dynamic nature of the spectrum availability.
    It plays a vital role in optimizing resource usage and improving the overall performance
    and trustworthiness of dynamic spectrum sensing in CRNs [20]. Various sectors,
    including satellite services, government agencies, and industries like broadcasting
    and aerospace, also rely on the spectrum [21]. Balancing the needs of these sectors
    with the demand for wireless data can lead to challenges in spectrum allocation.
    The scarcity of available spectrums can limit the ability to conduct experiments,
    trials, and research on new wireless technologies and applications. These trends
    and statistics highlight the pressing need for continued research in spectrum
    management, allocation, and optimization. As technology advances and new applications
    emerge, the urgency to find innovative solutions to address spectrum scarcity
    becomes even more critical. 4. Result Analysis In this section, we conduct a thorough
    analysis of the outcomes derived from the integration of blockchain technology
    within the context of the cognitive radio network. To provide a comprehensive
    understanding of our findings, we reference and elaborate upon the simulation
    parameters, as outlined in Table 3. The simulation area for the network was defined
    as a circular region with a radius of ‘m’. Within this area, primary users were
    positioned at arbitrary locations along the circumference of the circle. In the
    given system, the signal power was 100 MW (megawatts), and the bandwidth was 100
    kHz (kilohertz). There were 15 nodes in the system, with SNRs (signal-to-noise
    ratios) of −18 dB and −14 dB for some of the nodes. The noise used in this system
    was additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The system parameters included an average
    detection time of 10,000 and the presence of three auxiliary nodes. The spectrum
    detection method employed was energy detection. The cognitive radio topology is
    defined in Figure 4. The different number of primary and secondary users was placed
    in a particular geometry. The range of the network was between −500 to 500 m.
    There was one primary user and multiple secondary users. The primary user was
    located at the center of the area while the secondary users were located around
    the primary users within the specific pattern. The total error rate is depicted
    in Figure 5, commencing at 15% within the first second. Figure 5 shows that the
    total error rate progressively rose to 20.05% over a period of 2 s. Subsequently,
    there was a sudden decline, bringing the total error rate down to 10%. Figure
    4. Cognitive radio topology. Figure 5. Total error rate. Table 3. Specific simulation
    parameters. A similar Analysis of Security in Cognitive Radio is displayed in
    Figure 6. It tends to be seen from Figure 6 that when the NES and SSSB calculations
    are utilized in the mix, as expanding the number of associations between the detecting
    hub, combination focus and blockchain the board community, the security file of
    the psychological remote organization rises fundamentally quickly. Figure 7 depicts
    the analysis of the energy consumption in terms of the proposed algorithm vs.
    the NES algorithm. Figure 7 clearly demonstrates that when the number of detection
    cycles exceeded 60, the energy consumption associated with the algorithm presented
    in this study was markedly lower compared to that of the conventional algorithms.
    Increasing the number of detection cycles resulted in longer detection times,
    ultimately leading to greater energy conservation. This significantly benefitted
    the cognitive wireless network by extending its operational lifespan. The reason
    behind this was that the algorithm presented in this paper consistently selected
    the node with the optimal performance for timely participation in cooperative
    detection, thereby saving more energy when the detection performance surpassed
    that of the traditional methods. In comparison to the NES algorithm, the proposed
    algorithm demonstrated superior energy efficiency. The results for the organization
    of traffic are presented in Table 4. Query per second (QPS) assessments offer
    numerous advantages when examining traffic utilization. To illustrate that the
    new algorithm did not increase network overhead, a deliberate organization traffic
    test was conducted. The proposed solution outlined a protocol or algorithm used
    to manage network traffic within a blockchain network. It aimed to maintain optimal
    network performance by routing requests appropriately, monitoring traffic conditions,
    and ensuring timely responses. This test aimed to evaluate the algorithm without
    introducing any variables related to character data in this segment. Figure 6.
    Comparative analysis of security in cognitive radio. Figure 7. Analysis of the
    energy consumption: the proposed vs. NES algorithms. Table 4. Network traffic
    test results. Its primary objective was to compare network traffic disparities
    between remote gateways. If the traffic surpassed a certain predefined threshold,
    a specific action was taken, and the query or request was directly routed to the
    blockchain. This approach could be employed to alleviate network congestion or
    ensure that critical queries are handled promptly by the blockchain, bypassing
    any potential bottlenecks in the network. The selection of service nodes was also
    mentioned as a part of this process. Scenarios such as location spoofing, resource
    exhaustion attacks, authentication and key management vulnerabilities, rogue spectrum
    access points, primary user protection attacks, jamming attacks, spectrum sensing
    data falsification and primary user emulation illustrated the potential security
    risks in CRNs, emphasizing the need for robust security mechanisms, such as authentication,
    encryption, intrusion detection, and intrusion prevention, to mitigate these threats
    and ensure the safe and reliable operation of CRNs. The basic architecture, as
    discussed above, outlined the key components and processes for integrating blockchain
    into CRNs to enhance security and spectrum access management. By leveraging blockchain
    technology, CRNs can achieve greater transparency, trust, and efficiency in spectrum
    allocation and management while mitigating security risks. It’s essential to customize
    this architecture according to specific CRN use cases and regulatory frameworks.
    Integrating blockchain technology into CRNs can bring several benefits, but it
    also introduces potential overheads and performance trade-offs that network operators
    and architects need to consider. Integrating blockchain into CRNs can significantly
    enhance security and spectrum access management. Blockchain-enabled CRNs can offer
    both advantages and pose challenges in terms of aligning with current spectrum
    regulations and policies. While blockchain-enabled CRNs offer significant potential
    for enhancing spectrum management, there are hurdles to overcome in aligning these
    systems with current spectrum regulations and policies. Collaboration, adaptation,
    and a balanced approach to privacy and transparency are key to successfully integrating
    blockchain technology into the regulatory framework of CRNs. Mitigating security
    vulnerabilities in CRNs requires a multifaceted approach that combines technological,
    operational, and regulatory measures. By implementing practical strategies and
    countermeasures, such as authentication and authorization, spectrum sensing security,
    jamming detection and mitigation, primary user protection, secure spectrum allocation,
    intrusion detection, and response, redundancy and resilience, CRN operators can
    enhance the security and resilience of their networks. 5. Conclusions In real-world
    applications for cognitive wireless networks, it is common to encounter genuine
    errors in data detection through network nodes, leading to deviations from the
    expected range of detection values. Additionally, there are instances where some
    nodes intentionally transmit incorrect data to the central aggregation point.
    In response to these security concerns, this paper presents two key approaches:
    the NES algorithm and the secure spectrum sensing mechanism. The proposed techniques
    incorporate the user’s interaction history and connection distance, which are
    recorded as a public ledger and managed by a blockchain management system. The
    proposed algorithm facilitates the central aggregation point in selecting nodes
    with outstanding performance for cooperative sensing, thus enhancing the network’s
    security against malicious node attacks. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    Cost Structure and Scalability Article Open access 07 July 2021 1 Introduction
    IoT is envisaged as the promising paradigm due to the plethora of research concentrated
    on enabling technologies of 5G that would effectively mean a pervasive interconnection
    of objects like sensors, Radio Frequency Identification Tag (RFID), actuators
    through wired and wireless communication technologies. This multitude of connection
    becomes smart, only when these objects have unique addressing scheme based on
    legacy protocols so that it could be managed through wide range of communication
    networks for new services and applications. Moreover, operating these devices
    in unlicensed band create spectrum shortage issues. To overcome this problem,
    we foresee CR as a feasible solution for IoT smartness. In view of this, the quality
    of wireless communication is of paramount importance to furnish accessibility
    to remote IoT devices. However, in practical scenarios wireless channel suffer
    from multipath fading and shadowing to hinder reliability of transmission. Here,
    the remedy is to use a relay temporarily for reliable communication. Hence, introducing
    cognitive relaying into IoT technology is the need of hour. In light of the above
    discussed issues, co-operative communications [1] has improved the system capacity
    and diversity for LTE-advanced systems. Some relaying protocols like Amplify and
    Forward (AF), Decode and Forward (DF), Compress and Forward (CF) have been discussed
    [2] to achieve cooperative diversity. Next, comparison of these protocols for
    multi-hop relay networks is studied [3]. Though they achieve better BER performance,
    the position of the relay may affect the performance of this cooperative model.
    So our motivation lies in employing the protocols AF and DF with Network Coding
    (NC) for proposed two path cognitive relaying scheme to enhance the diversity
    gain for IoT applications without the need of extra antennas. In order to achieve
    this, they harvest the advantage of NC in wireless systems by means of cooperative
    communication [4]. Such cooperative protocol provides joint time and power allocation
    for relays to minimize the outage probability. Power allocation problem has been
    formulated as convex optimization problem [5] for Device-to-Device (D2D) communications
    to improve the lifetime and localization accuracy of the cooperative cellular
    network. Similarly, two optimization problems are formulated to minimize the probability
    of error and maximize the rate for two path relaying scheme [6, 7]. The power
    allocation strategy has been proposed by using water-filling algorithm [8] in
    order to avoid the inter user interference. Thus, it is known that amount of power
    allocated or water filled must be proportional to signal to noise ratio (SNR)
    of the channel. Just like the aforementioned examples, we study the power allocation
    problems through CVX modeling system to improve the capacity of the cooperative
    network. Meanwhile to achieve better data rates for different class of users,
    hierarchical modulation has been discussed [9,10,11]. In this context, PU bits
    are separated as high and low priority termed as basic information that is essential
    for the destination whereas along with additional secondary information, transmitter
    uses two modulation schemes namely 16QAM and QPSK respectively to obtain good
    data rates. It has been argued that Inter Relay Interference (IRI) is the main
    problem that degrades the performance of the cooperative communication. Full Interference
    Cancellation (FIC) [12] and Partial Interference Cancellation [13] have been proposed
    for IRI mitigation. In light of the above, the main contributions of the paper
    include. We propose a novel spectrally efficient cognitive two path relaying with
    hierarchical modulation transmission scheme that improves the data rate compared
    to conventional direct link transmission. This model enables the transmission
    of 2 PU and 1 SU data symbols with NC co-operation based on AF and DF protocols.
    Optimum power allocation is modeled as CO problem through disciplined programming
    called CVX to avoid the interference caused to PU network. Diversity order gains
    attained for this model is four for PU and one for SU. We ensure that our cooperative
    relaying scheme will be robust against errors caused due to interference of co-existing
    IoT devices. 2 System Model In this section, we consider a co-operative network
    that is composed of PU transmitter S acting as source, PU receiver as D for destination
    co-operating with the assistance of two SU relays A and B as transmitter and receiver
    respectively. Figures 1, 2, 3 indicates the cognitive two-path relaying scheme
    enabling the transmission of two PU symbol and one SU symbol in three time slots.
    Here, \\({\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sd}(1)}\\) and \\({\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sd}(2)}\\)
    are the channel co-efficient between S and D in time slot one and two respectively.
    Similarly the gains from A and B to D are \\({\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{ad}}\\) and
    \\({\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{bd}}\\) respectively, \\({\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sa}}\\)
    and \\({\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sb}}\\) are the channel coefficients from S to
    A and B respectively. The inter-relay channel gain in second time slot is represented
    as \\({\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{ab}}\\). In addition, we assume the transmission
    procedure of each node through a flat-faded Rayleigh channel. Fig. 1 Cognitive
    relaying in time slot 1 Full size image Fig. 2 Cognitive relaying in time slot
    2 Full size image Fig. 3 Cognitive relaying in time slot 3 Full size image Now,
    we review the operation of the cognitive relaying scheme in three time slots.
    In first time slot, S transmits its data symbol S1 to A, B and D with total power
    PS. The received signal at PU destination and both relays is represented in equations
    as below [14], 15] $${\\mathrm{y}}_{\\rm{D}}^{(1)}=\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\rm{S}}}
    {\\mathrm{S}}_{1} {\\mathrm{h}}_{\\rm{sd}(1)}+{\\mathrm{n}}_{\\rm{D}}^{(1)}$$
    (1) $${\\mathrm{y}}_{\\rm{A}}^{(1)}=\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\rm{S}}} {\\mathrm{S}}_{1}
    {\\mathrm{h}}_{\\rm{sa}}+{\\mathrm{n}}_{\\rm{A}}^{(1)}$$ (2) $${\\mathrm{y}}_{\\mathrm{B}}^{(1)}=\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}}
    {\\mathrm{S}}_{1} {\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sb}}+{\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{B}}^{(1)}$$
    (3) where,\\({\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{D}}^{(1)}\\),\\({\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{A}}^{(1)}\\)
    and \\({\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{B}}^{(1)}\\) are AWGN noise samples with zero mean
    and variance \\({\\upsigma }^{2}\\) in first time slot. The second time slot deals
    with the transmission of symbol \\(({\\mathrm{S}}_{1}\\oplus {\\mathrm{S}}_{2})\\)
    by S to D, while the relay A transmits the received data in previous time slot
    after employing the Decode–Amplify and forward protocol (D-AF). The received signal
    at D and B respectively are given by $${\\mathrm{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}^{(2)}=\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}}
    ({\\mathrm{S}}_{1}\\oplus {\\mathrm{S}}_{2}){\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sd}(2)}+{\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{D}}^{(2)}$$
    (4) $${\\mathrm{y}}_{\\mathrm{B}}^{(2)}=\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}} ({\\mathrm{S}}_{1}\\oplus
    {\\mathrm{b}}_{1}){{\\upbeta }_{\\mathrm{A}}\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{ab}}+{\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{B}}^{(2)}$$
    (5) where, \\({\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{D}}^{(2)}\\) and \\({\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{B}}^{(2)}\\)
    are respective AWGN samples and \\({\\mathrm{b}}_{1}\\) is the SU data symbol.
    Hereinafter, assuming that relay A transmits with power \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}=\\uplambda
    {\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\), we have the normalized amplification factor satisfying
    the power constraint \\({\\mathrm{E}|{\\mathrm{S}}_{1}\\oplus {\\mathrm{b}}_{1}|}^{2}\\le
    {\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}\\) expressed as below $${\\upbeta }_{\\mathrm{A}}=\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}}{{\\mathrm{E}|{\\mathrm{y}}_{\\mathrm{A}}^{(1)}|}^{2}}$$
    (6) Similarly, $${\\upbeta }_{\\mathrm{B}}=\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{B}}}{{\\mathrm{E}|{\\mathrm{y}}_{\\mathrm{B}}^{(1)}|}^{2}}$$
    (7) where, \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{B}}\\) is the transmit power of relay B
    and \\({\\mathrm{y}}_{\\mathrm{B}}^{(1)}\\) is the received signal at B in first
    time slot. During the third time slot, both A and B transmits the decoded symbol
    \\({\\mathrm{S}}_{1}\\) to D received in previous time slots with amplification
    factor \\({\\upbeta }_{\\mathrm{A}}\\) and \\({\\upbeta }_{\\mathrm{B}}\\) while
    S remains idle. Thus, the received signal at D is as follows $${\\mathrm{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}^{(3)}=\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}}
    {\\mathrm{S}}_{1}{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{ad}}{\\upbeta }_{\\mathrm{A}}+\\sqrt{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{B}}}
    {\\mathrm{S}}_{1}{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{bd}}{\\upbeta }_{\\mathrm{B}}+{\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{D}}^{(3)}$$
    (8) where, \\({\\mathrm{n}}_{\\mathrm{D}}^{(3)}\\) is the noise term in third
    slot. Now, we combine the received signal through popular diversity scheme known
    as Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) since D has multiple copies of same symbol received
    in each time slot. So, using the instantaneous SNR for S-D, S-A-D and S-B-D as
    given below $${\\upgamma }_{\\mathrm{SD}}=\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{t}}{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sd}}}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}$$
    (9) $${\\upgamma }_{\\mathrm{SAD}}=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sa}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{ad}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)}{1+\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sa}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{ad}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)}$$
    (10) $${\\upgamma }_{\\mathrm{SBD}}=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sb}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{B}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{bd}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)}{1+\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sb}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{B}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{bd}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)}$$
    (11) where, \\({\\mathrm{N}}_{0}\\) is the noise power. The effective SNR of the
    combined MRC case is $${\\upgamma }_{\\mathrm{MRC}}^{\\mathrm{D}}={\\upgamma }_{\\mathrm{SD}}+{\\upgamma
    }_{\\mathrm{SAD}}+{\\upgamma }_{\\mathrm{SBD}}$$ (12) If the perfect Channel State
    Information (CSI) is known at the receiver the Zero Forcing (ZF) estimate of the
    symbol vectors could be obtained from the below equations $${\\mathrm{Y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}=\\mathrm{G}({\\mathrm{H}}_{\\mathrm{D}}\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{N})$$
    (13) where,\\(\\mathrm{G}={\\left({\\mathrm{H}}^{\\mathrm{H}}\\mathrm{H}\\right)}^{-1}{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\mathrm{H}}\\)
    is the pseudo inverse matrix and \\({\\mathrm{H}}_{\\mathrm{D}}\\) is the channel
    gain matrix. 3 Problem Formulation In this section, our problem is to control
    the optimum power of relays to minimize the probability of error and to maximize
    the average achievable rate of transmission. To find the value of those parameters,
    optimum power allocation is formulated as convex problem. Here, we note that only
    in time slot 2 both S and A transmits simultaneously whereas in remaining slots
    either S or both relays transmits with power \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\),\\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}\\)
    and \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{B}}\\) respectively.So, rate maximization is with
    respect to the optimal power that is allocated in time slot 2. It is obvious that
    average rate is a function of \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{t}},{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\)
    and\\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}\\).Thus, it is obtained at D through B, A and
    direct link communication from S represented respectively as below [16], 17] $${\\mathrm{R}}_{\\mathrm{D}1}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{N}+1}\\right)*{\\mathrm{Blog}}_{2}\\left(1+\\mathrm{M}\\left[\\frac{\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sb}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{B}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{bd}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)}{1+\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sb}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{B}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{bd}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)}\\right]\\right)$$
    (14) $${\\mathrm{R}}_{\\mathrm{D}2}=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{N}+1}\\right)*{\\mathrm{Blog}}_{2}\\left(1+\\mathrm{M}\\left[\\frac{\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sa}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{ad}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)}{1+\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sa}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{ad}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)}\\right]\\right)$$
    (15) $${\\mathrm{R}}_{\\mathrm{D}3}={\\mathrm{Blog}}_{2}\\left(1+\\frac{{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{t}}|{\\mathrm{h}}_{\\mathrm{sd}}^{2}|}{{\\mathrm{N}}_{0}}\\right)$$
    (16) Herewith, we consider the rate of PU as objective function and our goal is
    to maximize the rate such that. maximize \\(\\left\\{\\mathrm{min}({\\mathrm{R}}_{\\mathrm{D}1},{\\mathrm{R}}_{\\mathrm{D}2},{\\mathrm{R}}_{\\mathrm{D}3})\\right\\}\\)
    subject to: \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}<{\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\) $${\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{min}}\\le
    {\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\le {\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{max}}$$ where, \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\)
    is the total transmit power of the co-operative model, \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\)
    is the transmit power of the PU transmitter and B is the channel bandwidth. Finally,
    we transform the optimal power allocation as convex with two constraints solved
    by using CVX [18]. The value of the parameters obtained in time slot two are \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}=0.689\\)
    and \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}=0.311\\) which ensures the optimum solution
    for rate maximization. 4 Numerical Results In this section, we discuss the numerical
    results of the proposed cognitive relaying scheme with single PU transmitter and
    receiver. SU relays A and B that are in middle between S and D assist in retransmitting
    the received symbol to destination. We validate the performance of the proposed
    scheme through Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation parameters are listed in
    Table 1.The cooperative transmission of data takes place in three time slots hence
    the bandwidth efficiency is considered as unity. Through network coded co-operation,
    two PU symbol are hierarchically modulated as high and low priority bits by QAM
    modulation. Table 1 Simulation parameters and values Full size table Meanwhile,
    A and B uses QPSK modulation thereby achieving diversity order gains for its cooperative
    transmission. In order to provide comparisons among various two path relaying
    schemes, we consider the case of optimum power allocation solved through CVX modeling
    system. Although the conventional power allocation schemes have greater impact
    on SU system, we here ensure the advantage of BER minimization for PU system in
    comparison with direct link transmission. 4.1 BER Performance Comparisons for
    PU Figure 4 shows the BER comparisons results for PU high and low priority data
    with direct link transmission. Note that the values in horizontal axis indicate
    the SNR between S and D. As we can infer from Fig. 4, the BER performance of hierarchically
    modulated PU data shows good performance that are obtained by Monte Carlo simulations.
    In view of this case, we have 2 dB SNR gain at 10–2 in comparison with direct
    transmission. But with the comparison of PU low priority data; there is a remarkable
    performance improvement for direct transmission. Even though S transmits its bits
    by QAM modulation for PU low priority and for direct link case, here the relay
    position with the end- to-end SNR knowing the CSI has impact on BER performance
    as shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 4 PU BER comparison for proposed method in terms of a)
    high priority data b) low priority data c) direct link transmission with different
    values of SNR Full size image 4.2 BER Performance Comparisons for SU As discussed
    from above BER performance of PU, SU performance comparison will not reflect the
    better since it avoids interference at D but inter-relay interference diverges
    it somewhat poorer in comparison with PU. So in this section, Fig. 5 depicts the
    proposed scheme with and without optimum power allocation.Based on the transmitting
    power obtained through CO i.e., \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{A}}=0.311\\) in time
    slot 2, it ensures that there will be no harmful interference for PU operating
    with \\({\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{S}}=0.689\\).Thus, below results confirms that
    only low data rates can be achieved through this BER but reliability of transmission
    is improved by operating with this optimal power which is very much needed for
    IoT devices. Fig. 5 BER comparison of SU with and without optimum power allocation
    Full size image 4.3 Rate Maximization Through Optimum Power Allocation From the
    Fig. 6, we can observe that when SNR is low, the average rate for the proposed
    scheme is good in agreement with the existing two path relaying. At SNR = 5 dB,
    we have 14% improvement for our scheme. However, after 10 dB, average rate performance
    is almost same. This is because, at low SNR levels the data symbols are perfectly
    decoded at D without interfering with SU data symbols since we use optimal power
    for transmission and in addition we use ZF equalizers to nullify the channel effects.
    But at high SNR regime, we have good channel condition. So, we could decode the
    low priority bits of PU and hence we could achieve better data rate. Fig. 6 SNR
    Vs Average Rate Full size image 5 Conclusion In this paper, spectrally efficient
    cognitive two path relaying is proposed considering network coding as a paradigm
    to achieve cooperative diversity. Through network coded co-operation, the transmission
    of 2 PU symbols and one SU symbol takes place. Here we consider CO problem to
    optimally allocate power to the transmitters by CVX modeling system thereby avoiding
    interference at destination for decoding process. We use MRC combiners so that
    the diversity order gains achieved for PU and SU is four and one respectively.
    As discussed from the numerical results, it can be inferred that the probability
    of error is minimized obtaining a SNR gain of 2 dB in comparison with direct link
    transmission. Furthermore, we obtained average rate maximization by 14% in comparison
    with the existing two path relaying scheme. On the other hand, this cognitive
    relaying approach will be an essential option that helps in achieving reliable
    data rates with optimal transmitted power enhancing the life time for battery
    operated IoT devices. Data Availability Data sharing not applicable to this article

    I. Introduction The U.S. Marine Corps relies heavily upon resilient communications
    technologies that leverage the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) to conduct maneuver
    operations [1]. Unmanaged radio frequency (RF) signatures result in the identification
    and targeting of forward deployed forces. Recent doctrine stresses the need for
    RF signature reduction technologies and resilient networking systems [2]. Future
    forces will require enhanced situational awareness (SA) for forward deployed troops,
    allowing them to execute distributed command and control (C2) over a diverse cyber-physical
    battlespace. The development pace of near peer adversaries in the electromagnetic
    spectrum operations (EMSO) domain has highlighted the need for technologies to
    augment traditional communications techniques. This has resulted in a contested
    maritime domain, both physically and with respect to EMS. Wireless communications
    links in an anti-access / area-denial (A2/AD) environment must be resilient and
    reliably transfer data over long distances to distributed forces. Mobile platforms
    within the A2/AD environment require uninterrupted communications to execute their
    mission and provide situational awareness. Satellite communications (SATCOM) may
    be disrupted through hostile interference or loss of assets. The A2/AD environment
    presumes the presence of intentional interference. Intentional interference techniques
    may include, but not be limited to: swept, partial band, and narrowband techniques
    that can be used singularly or in combinations. WHAC-A-MOLE (Wireless Heterogeneous
    Adaptive Communications Architecture for Multi-Waveform Obfuscation of Localizable
    Emissions) is an overlay protocol for multiple-transceiver, software-defined radio
    (SDR) platforms that has been implemented with a time-based emissions schedule
    of heterogeneous waveforms, dynamically allocated to an array frequency channels.
    The WHAC-A-MOLE concept is intended to disrupt the collection and signature identification
    by hostile forces as a means of obfuscating signal characteristics and localization
    of emissions. The location and characteristics of the RF emissions are constantly
    changing thus affecting the observability from the viewpoint of a passive RF detection
    system. RF signature management is achieved by avoiding detection by limiting
    power, visibility, range, talk-time (duty cycle), or a combination of them. These
    techniques are effective and continue to act as the controllable building blocks
    for effectively limiting emissions exposure. The emissions schemes are intended
    to be configurable such that daily, weekly, monthly secrets can be shared for
    network participants. These configurations control the transmissions over a given
    radio link within the overall network transmission schedule. The design assumes
    a platform with a number of independent receiver (or transceiver) chains to support
    simultaneous reception of diverse signals and modulations (i.e. waveforms). Frequency-hopping,
    a spread-spectrum technique, has been proven over the decades as an electronic
    counter-counter measure (ECCM) method for enhanced message security. Commercial
    applications (e.g., Bluetooth) reduce the effects of interference in increasingly
    crowded frequency bands. The technique explored in this work uses agile, pseudo-random
    waveform selection to augment traditional frequency hopping as a means to increase
    the difficulty of adversary targeting and signal characterization. Obscuring location
    is provided by rapidly varying waveform characteristics from constantly changing
    locations. Advances in electronics technology, including the development of SDRs
    using digital signal processing, and significant reductions in size, weight and
    power have resulted in radio platforms having multiple, simultaneous communications
    capabilities. Such multi-waveform platforms, including the Defense Advanced Research
    Projects Agency''s (DARPA) Wireless Network after Next (WNaN) platform [3] incorporate
    one or more transmitters and multiple receivers in a single package. Each receiver
    can be configured to support a particular waveform with the radio capable of simultaneous
    transmission and reception on any of its receivers. More recent platforms, including
    work conducted by the Air Force Research Laboratory [4] have continued to develop
    similar technical capabilities. Multiple receivers within a radio allow a given
    transmitter to use a different waveform during successive transmissions (timeslots)
    to the other networked radios. An adversary, conditioned to expect frequency hopping
    but waveform consistency for network targeting, is offered additional confusion
    by the inconsistency of waveform. Such an agile radio network environment may
    appear to the enemy as many networks, each using a particular waveform. Put another
    way, for a given radio network message traffic load there are fewer transmissions
    using a particular waveform. While this paper doesn''t address targeting probabilities,
    it provides formulas for calculating the number of waveform-frequency pairings
    for timeslots for a given number of networked radios (nodes), number of available
    waveforms and number of available frequencies. It is shown that a very large number
    of distinct timeslot assignments can result from relatively few available waveforms
    and frequencies. As a result, it is postulated that changing waveforms as well
    as frequency in a sequence of timeslots provides increased anti-targeting robustness
    and increased signal security. A waveform-agile/frequency-agile military radio
    network can include an integrated scheduler that interfaces to commercial wireless
    infrastructure for dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) [5], [6] for shared spectrum
    access by both military and commercial assets. SECTION II. WHAC-A-MOLE Protocol
    A. Design Assumptions The WHAC-A-MOLE concept employs a shared schedule for waveform
    execution and time division multiple access (TDMA). Based on the number of transceivers
    additional layers of complexity can be added that can be tailored based on the
    emission threat profile. Allocating a receive asset for sensing provides the following
    advantages: (1) Sensing capabilities employed in the radios can be used to inhibit
    transmissions in congested frequencies, through a technique called excision. Excision
    is the inhibition of a schedule transmission due to anticipated congestion. (2)
    Excision can be further used to obfuscate the TDMA schedule. (3) A further application
    of sensing capabilities would be to influence the TDMA waveform utilization by
    periodically adjusting the profile of usable frequencies. In addition to these
    sensing concepts, the technique of slicing could be used as a further method of
    protecting the transmission. This method, borrowed from the work in [7], [8],
    employs a potential reserve time slot, at a different frequency/waveform, for
    protecting particular messaging. These variations on the employment structure
    depend on the configuration of the transceivers and availability of reserve Tx
    or Rx assets. The TDMA structure further supports the potential for DSS interoperability
    with commercial cellular providers, on the condition that access to the commercial
    scheduler is available. Non-TDMA methods have been discussed, but have not yet
    been pursued. A radio network consisting of a number of radios with both frequency
    and waveform agility is examined in terms of the number of waveform-frequency
    pairs available during a timeslot. In this paper a timeslot is defined as an increment
    of time during network operation, which supports the transmission and reception
    of message traffic using specific waveform-frequency pairings for transmitters
    and receivers. Expressions for the total number of timeslots possible without
    reuse of any waveform-frequency pair by any radio in a timeslot are formulated.
    A waveform-frequency pair is distinguished by frequency only; waveforms can be
    reused within a timeslot. The addition of waveform agility to that of frequency
    agility (frequency hopping) is intended to increase the difficulty in locating
    geographically-dispersed radios. The goal is to create an effect analogous to
    that of many dispersed fireflies blinking on and off. Radio mobility adds an additional
    layer of protection, but isn''t examined in the present discussion. The following
    definitions and operational rules are postulated governing the radio network:
    There is a total of N= n 1 , n 2 … n N radios (nodes). During a timeslot, a radio
    will either have one active transmitter (or transceiver in transmit mode) or be
    in listen-only mode. There are R= r 1 , r 2 … r R receivers (or transceivers in
    receive mode within a timeslot) per radio. W= w 1 , w 2 … ww waveforms are available
    for use by a transmitter or receiver with W≥R . F= f 1 , f 2 … f F frequencies
    are available for use by a transmitter or receiver with F≥R . All transmitters
    within a given timeslot are operating with distinct frequencies, but not necessarily
    distinct waveforms. The radios comprising the network are geographically dispersed,
    but are within communications range of one another, either directly or via routing
    to disadvantaged platforms. A particular waveform-frequency pair won''t be reused
    by a transmitter until all possible pairs have been exhausted. B. Network Configuration
    Overview The maximum number of simultaneous transmissions permissible in a timeslot
    is governed by the number of receivers (R) within a radio. A radio consists of
    a transmitter and R receivers per radio. All radios comprising the network are
    assumed to contain R receivers. For the general case in which R < N-1, the maximum
    number of active transmitters in a timeslot is limited to the value of R. For
    the special case when R≥N−1 , there can be N transmitters operating in a timeslot
    with each radio receiving message traffic on N-1 of its R receivers. Tables I
    and II provide respective examples of the general and special cases for a network
    of 4 radios (nodes). Table I shows that no more than two transmitters can be active
    in a timeslot with items in red being inactive during the timeslot. The configuration
    show in Table II allows for four simultaneous transmissions. In the following
    sections, two instances of the general case (fewer receivers per node than N-1
    nodes in the network) and special cases (equal or greater number of receivers
    per node compared to total network nodes) are considered. Table I. Two transmitters
    in a timeslot, N=4, R=2 Table II. Four transmitters in a timeslot, N=4, R=3 C.
    General Case (R<N−1) Without Waveform Reuse in a Timeslot Using the radio network
    shown in Table 1 with N=4,R= 2 and W=F=4 , the maximum number of active transmitters
    is limited to R for this case since R<N−1 . A total of W ∗ F= 16 waveform-frequency
    pairings is possible for the first transmitter (radio n 1 ). The second transmitter
    (radio n 3 ) cannot use either the waveform or frequency assigned to the first
    transmitter and thus has 3 ∗ 3=9 pairings from which to choose. The total number
    of pairings is 16 ∗ 9=144 . These 144 pairings can be permuted among the 4 radios
    resulting in 144 ∗ 4!=3456 total timeslots (TS). Two of any of the four transmitters
    in a timeslot will always remain idle. In terms of the variables and the preceding
    discussion this example may be expressed as: TS=( W ∗ F ) ∗ [(W−(R−1) ] ∗ [F−(R−1)
    ] ∗ N!=3456 (1) View Source Noting that the variables on the right in (1) may
    be rearranged as W ∗ (W−R+1 ) ∗ F ∗ (F−R+1 ) ∗ N! , an equation for any N,R<N−1,W≥R
    and F≥R may be formulated as W ∗ (W−1 ) ∗ (W−2 ) ∗ … ∗ (W−R+1 ) ∗ F ∗ (F−1 ) ∗
    (F−2 ) ∗ … ∗ (F−R+1 ) ∗ N! and expressed more compactly as shown in (2) where
    P denotes the permutation function: TS=W!/(W−R)!∗F!/(F−R)!∗N!=P( W R )∗P( F R
    )∗P( N N ) (2) View Source D. General Case (R<N−1) with Waveform Reuse in a Timeslot
    Removing the requirement for distinctive waveforms per radio per timeslot results
    in an increase in available waveform pairings using the same configuration values.
    Again using Table I, the first transmitter has a choice from any of 16 available
    waveform-frequency pairings while the second transmitter has 4 ∗ 3=12 choices.
    The total pairings per timeslot is 1  6 ∗ 12=192 . These 192 pairings can be permuted
    among the 4 radios resulting in 192 ∗ 4!=4608 total timeslots with the caveat
    that only two transmitters may be active within a timeslot. In terms of the variables
    this example equates to: TS=(W∗F)∗(W∗[(F−(R−1)]∗N!=4608 (3) View Source Noting
    that (3) can be written W ∗ W ∗ F ∗ (F−R+1 ) ∗ N! an equation assuming waveform
    reuse for any N,R<N−1,W≥ R and F≥R may be formulated as W ∗ W ∗ … ∗ W R ∗ F ∗  (F−1
    ) ∗ (F−2 ) ∗ …  ∗ (F−R+1 ) ∗ N! and expressed more compactly as: TS= W R ∗F!/(F−R)!∗N!=
    W R ∗P( F R )∗P( N N ) (4) View Source E. Special Case (R≥N−1) Without Waveform
    Reuse in a Timeslot 1) Maximum N Transmitters in a Timeslot Consider a radio network
    as in Table II in which N=4,R=N−l=3,W=F=4 and using distinct waveforms within
    a timeslot for each radio. Since in this example R=N−1,4 active transmitters are
    permitted per timeslot vice 2 as in the previous section. A total of W ∗ F=16
    waveform-frequency pairings are available to the first transmitter. The second
    transmitter can''t use either the waveform or frequency assigned to the first
    transmitter and thus has 3 ∗ 3=9 pairings from which to choose. The third transmitter
    has 2 ∗ 2=4 choices while the fourth transmitter gets the 1 ^{\\ast} 1 pairing
    leftover. The total number of pairings is 16 ∗ 9 ∗ 4 ∗ 1=576 . In addition, any
    of these 576 pairings can be permuted among the 4 radios resulting in 576 ∗ 4!=13,824
    total timeslots. The expression for any N, R≥N−1,W≥N and F≥N follows the configuration
    leading to (2) but with R replaced by N: TS=W!/(W−N)!∗F!/(F−N)!∗N!=P( W N )∗P(
    F N )∗P( N N ) (5) View Source 2) Less than N Transmitters in a Timeslot Assume
    a network that could support up to N transmitters in a timeslot, but with the
    operational restriction imposed that the number of transmissions (n) per timeslot
    be less than N. So n transmissions per timeslot would require n active receivers
    per radio per timeslot and the general case TS equation (2) applies with R replaced
    by n, and the R-n remaining receivers remain idle in a timeslot: TS=W!/(W−n)!∗F!/(F−n)!∗N!=P(
    W n )∗P( F n )∗P( N N ) (6) View Source F. Special Case (R≥N−1) with Waveform
    Reuse in a Timeslot 1) Maximum N Transmitters in a Timeslot With Table II again
    applicable, the first, second, third and fourth transmitters have a choice from
    16, 12, 8 and 4 waveform-frequency pairings, respectively, for a total including
    radio permutations of 16 ∗ 12 ∗ 8 ∗ 4 ∗ 4!=147,456 total timeslots and capability
    of 4 active transmitters per timeslot. The expression assuming waveform reuse
    for any N, R≥N−1,W≥N and F≥N follows the development leading to (4) but with R
    replaced by N: TS= W N ∗F!/(F−N)!∗N!= W N ∗P( F N )∗P( N N ) (7) View Source Note
    that removing the requirement for distinct waveforms in the general case results
    in a modest increase of 4608 ― 3456 =1152 timeslots whereas for the special case
    removal of this requirement results in an increase of 147,456−13,824= 133,472
    timeslots. The addition of one additional receiver per radio in the special case
    dramatically increases the number of timeslots as well as provides for increased
    message traffic handling per timeslot. 2) Less than N Transmitters in a Timeslot
    A restriction of n transmissions during a timeslot and allowing for waveform reuse
    results in a TS expression like that (4) of the general case but with R replaced
    by n: TS= W n ∗ F!/(F−n)! ∗ N!= W n ∗P( F n )∗P( N N ) (8) View Source Additional
    randomization is possible by varying what radio transmits first, second, etc.
    For an N-node network P( N n ) permutations of transmitter sequences are possible
    where n is the number of permitted transmissions in a timeslot. This provides
    added value combined with moving or stationary nodes in that a hostile receiver
    can''t stare at a location waiting for an occurrence of the same transmission
    type. Further obfuscation can occur by utilizing the DSS slotting in 5G to interoperate
    within the 5G transmission schedule. Additional variations can be conceived with
    the use of additional transmitter resources activated. The overall mechanism can
    be optimized base on prioritization of data transmission requirements vs. desire
    for greater obfuscation. The expressions (2), (4), and (5–8) for the total number
    of distinctive timeslots for the general and special cases with and without waveform
    reuse have been developed. These timeslots can be assigned in any pseudo-random
    order until all waveform-frequency pair assignments to a particular transmitter
    have been exhausted. The large number of possible waveform-frequency pairings
    for a timeslot creates the appearance of several heterogeneous radio networks.
    The next section discusses the laboratory implementation of three radios cycling
    through the pseudo-randomly generated timeslot sets provided by the scripts, keeping
    in mind that the randomness is from the observer point of view; the participating
    radios in the network are aware of past, current, and future timeslot assignments.
    SECTION III. Proof of Concept Implementation A. Laboratory Setup The WHAC-A-MOLE
    design is built upon a multi-transceiver radio platform suitable for running a
    diverse suite of software waveform applications. Such platforms were described
    briefly earlier in this report, and include commercial off the shelf (COTS) platforms
    as well as those designed specifically for military communications. To demonstrate
    the feasibility of the WHAC-A-MOLE concept in the laboratory, a cabled laboratory
    network of radios was setup. This network consisted of three radio nodes, to form
    a small network. A three node network was used as it fulfills the requirements
    for a network of radios beyond a single bidirectional link. Each radio node was
    created to mimic a multi-waveform platform, with one transmitter chain and two
    receiver chains. Thus, a single radio includes multiple independent RF front ends,
    each consisting of a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) N210, connected
    to a common computer for processing and handling data transmission and reception.
    The common processor allowed for rapid development of software prototyping and
    interfacing to three connected USRPs. For system operations and testing, a network
    of three nodes was created. Each node contained three separate software-defined
    radios. One radio was used as a transmitter, and two radios were used as receivers.
    The setup is depicted in Figure 1 below. Fig. 1. WHAC-A-MOLE laboratory setup
    Show All Three processing servers were used in the setup. Each server performed
    the signal processing and communications algorithms for each node, including one
    transmitter and two receivers. An additional server was used for graphical display.
    An Ethernet switch was connected to all SDRs and servers for convenient access.
    For RF connections, each node had a circulator to split the signal among the outgoing
    transmission and incoming receptions. Each node also had a three-way power divider
    to split the incoming signal to its two receivers. A five-way divider was used
    to split the signal among the three radio nodes. In addition, a spectrum analyzer
    was connected to the five-way divider to view the transmissions. B. Modulation
    Schedule A configuration schedule was created and implemented as shown by Table
    III below. Three frequencies at 1670, 1830, and 1940 MHz were used. In addition,
    the modulation schemes Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK), Gaussian Frequency
    Shift Keying (GFSK), and Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) were used. These three
    frequencies and modulations (waveforms) allowed for a total of 27 possible frequency-waveform
    combinations. For simplicity, only three combinations were used: GMSK at 1670
    MHz, GFSK at 1830 MHz and BPSK at 1940 MHz. These three combinations were chosen
    to span all modulation schemes and frequencies in the simplest way. The entire
    cycle, where all nodes transmit all three combinations, takes 90 seconds. Once
    the cycle ends, the schedule is repeated. The ninety-second interval is a convenient
    multiple of an hour, and there are 40 cycles in an hour. Therefore, the schedule
    starts on the hour and after 40 cycles, restarts on the next hour. For proper
    time synchronization, the network time protocol (NTP) was used. All three processing
    servers used the display server as the NTP clock server. Table III. Configuration
    schedule C. Software Architecture Each radio node in the network was instantiated
    in GNU Radio for the signal processing and conditioning blocks in the radio front
    end. The radio platforms were instantiated to support five modulation types for
    the purposes of the demonstration. These modulations included GMSK, GFSK, Differential
    Phase Shift Keying (DPSK), BPSK, and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) signals.
    To demonstrate the concept and reduce the number of possible combinations, three
    of these modulations were used for the laboratory proof of concept. Implementation
    was performed on GNU Radio, a software development toolkit that provides signal
    processing blocks to implement software radios. GNU Radio provided transmitter
    and receiver blocks for the USRP. This hardware was the software-defined radio
    used for development and testing. GNU Radio also provided the modulation waveforms
    used, including GMSK, GFSK, and BPSK. In addition, GNU Radio provided scripts
    for packet transmission and packet reception. These scripts include benchmark_rx.py
    and benchmark_tx.py, which were useful for system testing and tuning. These scripts
    provided a foundation for the software, with waveform switching and timing added
    in the media access control (MAC) layer. 1) Physical Layer Three separate message
    sources were connected to the corresponding GMSK, GFSK, and BPSK modulation block.
    The message source block contained an internal queue used for interaction with
    the MAC layer. This setup gave the MAC layer the ability to transmit packets to
    the radio. The PSK modulation block contained two constellation points, thus employing
    BPSK. A selector block was used to choose the correct modulation scheme as output.
    A stream to tagged stream block was used to allow bursty transmissions. Without
    it, underflow warnings would have been issued by the USRP driver. A USRP Sink
    block was used to turn the complex IQ data into radio transmissions. For additional
    timing control, a USRP Async Msg Source was used. This block provided error information
    for every transmitted burst. That error information was stored in a message queue
    for the MAC layer. As a secondary benefit, the Async Msg Source blocks gave the
    MAC layer immediate feedback when the packet transmission had concluded. This
    feature was especially important given the timing and switching requirements implemented
    in the MAC layer. A packet framer routine was used to provide preamble, packet
    length and cyclic redundancy code (CRC). This routine was used by the MAC layer
    to add a frame to the original payload. Once the frame was created, the entire
    data was inserted into the queue of the message source for the desired modulation.
    The USRP Source block provided the receiver interface to the USRP. RF signals
    were converted to baseband complex samples. Next, a selector block was used to
    choose between various demodulators. The Correlate Access Code block was used
    to find the beginning of the frame. The framer sink stripped the header and CRC
    and stored the payload in a queue for the MAC layer. 2) MAC Layer The MAC layer
    operated outside of the GNU Radio flowgraph and was implemented with a python
    script that first created the flowgraph and then started it. Next, the python
    script initiated the MAC layer. The node number and transmission mode were set
    by command line arguments from the user. The MAC layer used the operating system''s
    time to determine its current state, including the cycle, transmit round, and
    transmit state. Based on this state, the MAC layer set up the flowgraph''s center
    frequency and selectors for the modulator and demodulator. If the transmission
    state was on, the MAC layer inserted 10 frames in the message source''s queue.
    The GNU Radio flowgraph read the frames in the queue and processed them as transmitted
    packets. The MAC layer continued indefinitely until the script was terminated
    by the user. D. Single Transmit Mode Each cycle is divided into three transmit
    rounds, where each transmit round takes 30 seconds. During the transmit round,
    there are three transmit periods with each period lasting 10 seconds. During the
    transmit period, radios are on for 5 seconds, and then off for 5 seconds. Table
    IV below shows the initially designed transmit round. Table IV. Single mode transmit
    round Figure 2 shows a spectrogram capture of single mode transmissions. The cycle
    began with GMSK transmissions at 1670 MHz. The spectrogram showed the corresponding
    energy at the top left corner. The next transmissions were BPSK at 1940 MHz, GFSK
    at 1830 MHz, an additional GFSK at 1830 MHz, and GMSK at 1670 MHz. These configurations
    matched the schedule shown in Table III. There was an abundance of empty space
    between each transmission. This implied that additional packets could be transmitted
    within the five-second transmission time for each node. The current algorithm
    limited the transmission to ten packets for simplicity. Fig. 2. Spectrogram capture
    of single mode transmissions Show All E. Normal Transmit Mode The single transmit
    mode demonstrated waveform switching in a simple, intuitive way. Each node took
    turns transmitting. The transmission window lasted for 5 seconds, followed by
    temporary silence for another 5 seconds. This setup, although intuitive, represented
    an underutilization of receiver resources. Such a scheduling case could be a response
    to an increased need for obfuscation. Each node had two receivers with only a
    single receiver being used at any time. For full receiver utilization, each transmit
    period required two nodes transmitting simultaneously. A schedule employing increased
    transmissions could be in response to an increased data requirement in a less
    contested environment. Table V below depicts the normal transmit mode. Table V.
    Normal mode transmit round During each transmit period, two nodes were transmitted
    simultaneously. The third node received packets from both transmitters. In addition,
    the transmitting nodes received packets from each other. Figure 3 shows the spectrogram
    output for normal mode transmissions. Every transmission period shows two different
    modulations at two different frequencies. Five transmit periods are seen. The
    image shows modulations in the following order: 1) GMSK at 1670 MHz and BPSK at
    1940 MHz, 2) GFSK at 1830 MHz and BPSK at 1940 MHz, 3) GMSK at 1670 MHz and GFSK
    at 1830 MHz, 4) GMSK at 1670 MHz and GFSK at 1830 MHz, and 5) GMSK at 1670 MHz
    and BPSK at 1940 MHz. The configuration schedule was implemented for both an underutilized
    single mode transmission and a fully utilized normal mode transmission. Fig. 3.
    Spectrogram capture of normal mode transmissions Show All SECTION IV. Conclusion
    and Future Work The WHAC-A-MOLE waveform switching system was designed and implemented
    in development radio hardware in order to explore the practical implications of
    such a scheme, and to allow for rapid prototyping. This work demonstrated a basic
    capability for establishing a time-division based overlay scheme to enable simultaneous
    communications using a diverse set of modulation types across multiple frequencies.
    The work established the baseline proof of concept, followed by initial steps
    in implementing a fully automated process. Using a simplified network structure,
    with limited nodes and total waveform-time-frequency combinations, basic automation
    was demonstrated to support waveform switching in the laboratory environment.
    The basic WHAC-A-MOLE implementation requires a radio platform with multiple transceivers,
    but the generalized algorithm supports multiple variations involving different
    utilization of transmitter and receiver resources. These variations range from
    fully occupying all transmitter resources, fully occupying all receiver resources
    without full transmitter utilization, and implementations that underutilize both
    transmitter and receiver resources, depending on the application. This configurability
    is included in the design to allow for tailoring the network loading, or number
    of transmissions, to allow for different obfuscation of the network traffic. In
    configurations with underutilized resources, the surplus transmitter and receiver
    chains can be used for other mission functions including sensing and segmentation
    of messages across waveforms. Future work, including additional software development,
    and implementation in modern radio hardware will allow the technology to mature.
    With the multitude of existing waveforms in existence, solutions are needed for
    obfuscated communications using the existing technologies in new ways. Dynamic
    switching across a set of disparate waveforms is one example of such technical
    direction. Beyond maturation of the development software and radio platform hardware,
    more work is needed to enable dynamic schedule adjustments. The incorporation
    of DSS technologies, including broadband spectrum sensing, and policy-based reasoning
    will further augment the WHAC-A-MOLE system to produce a multifunctional adaptive
    radio network. The network performance must be considered as the technology matures.
    More investigation is needed to evaluate the system in a larger scale network.
    Foreseeable challenges include network synchronization, network rejoin, data routing,
    message forwarding and relay, and network security, to name a few practical considerations.
    Not considered here are emissions directionality, a key capability for low observability,
    Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), link and network reliability. These factors
    warrant further investigation and are reserved for future work. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    Location: Bangalore, India Description Focusing on the spectrum sharing between
    radar and communications, the existing works can be broadly classified into two
    categories. The works on Co-design envisage a single transmission performing both
    the radar and communication tasks and the system is optimized to ensure certain
    quality of service for both tasks. The works on Co-existence consider the communications
    and sensing as two separate entities performing their own tasks with their own
    transmissions, but adhere to limiting their mutual interference. In this demonstration,
    we consider the co-existence paradigm and resort to the cognitive process towards
    spectrum utilization to minimize mutual interference. In this context, we build
    and demonstrate the performance of a MIMO PMCW (Multiple Input Multiple Output
    Phase Modulated Continuous Wave) cognitive radar coexisting with communications.
    Letting the communication service to be incumbent, the radar uses an intelligent
    spectrum sensing and adapts its transmission strategy based on the decision of
    the spectrum sensing module in real time. In our work, the transmission strategy
    involves designing set of sequences (waveforms), akin to CDMA codes, to be transmitted
    from the multiple antennas of the radar with the dual objectives of limited interference
    to communications (out of band emissions) while maintaining radar performance.
    Additional constraints on the power and constellations used for the sequence design.
    The cognitive radar set-up is built using USRPs while the LTE Application from
    National Instruments is used for emulating a communication link. The real time
    adaptation of the radar to changes in spectrum utilisation and improvement in
    performance of radar/ communications with the proposed coexistence scheme will
    be demonstrated. Figure 1 depicts the devised prototype indicating the actual
    set-up and the connection diagram while Figure 2 focusses on the spectrum sensing
    and radar applications. This demonstration extends the work discussed in [1].

    the developed cognitive mimo radar application. In the transmit side (a), a list
    of occupied frequency bands will be received through the network connection between
    the spectrum sensing application and the radar application. Based on this information,
    the proposed design algorithm optimizes the transmitting waveforms. At the receive
    side (b), the optimized waveforms will be used for appropriate matched filtering
    in the fast-time dimension. Consequently, the modulus of the range-doppler plots
    will be calculated after taking fft in the slow-time dimension. Show All Authors

  description: Wireless communication explores new era of ease of information exchange
    through human-machine and machine-machine interaction to deal various real time
    applications. This has created a great spectrum scarcity to deal high bandwidth
    smart applications. The cognitive radio is an advance approach to manage spectrum
    congestion through dynamic spectrum access (DSA). The unlicensed secondary users
    are being allowed to access unutilized spectrum of primary licensed users through
    opportunistic scan. This elicits the need of an UWB antenna for wireless sensor
    networks to explore every possible vacant channel opportunity during scan. A novel
    UWB antenna is proposed here for wireless cognitive radio sensor network (WCRSN)
    to scan maximum RF spectrum as per FCC standard. Antenna offers matched impedance
    bandwidth for wide spectrum range from 3.3-11.5 GHz with sustainable 4.0 dBi high
    gain and bidirectional radiating properties for the entire frequency sweep.

    Metrics Abstract: Wireless communication explores new era of ease of information
    exchange through human-machine and machine-machine interaction to deal various
    real time applications. This has created a great spectrum scarcity to deal high
    bandwidth smart applications. The cognitive radio is an advance approach to manage
    spectrum congestion through dynamic spectrum access (DSA). The unlicensed secondary
    users are being allowed to access unutilized spectrum of primary licensed users
    through opportunistic scan. This elicits the need of an UWB antenna for wireless
    sensor networks to explore every possible vacant channel opportunity during scan.
    A novel UWB antenna is proposed here for wireless cognitive radio sensor network
    (WCRSN) to scan maximum RF spectrum as per FCC standard. Antenna offers matched
    impedance bandwidth for wide spectrum range from 3.3-11.5 GHz with sustainable
    4.0 dBi high gain and bidirectional radiating properties for the entire frequency

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Moradabad, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Spectrum scarcity is one of the prominent issues in wireless communication due
    increasing data transmission load and increasing number of applications over common
    dedicated channel. Cognitive radio (CR) provides an alternative solution for spectrum
    management through opportunistic utilization of vacant channel opportunity. The
    primary users known as PU, are the valid licensed users with all transmission
    priorities over the channel and beneficiaries of this scheme, secondary users
    (SU), are the unlicensed user to avail vacant channel opportunity. This process
    is well executed through dynamic spectrum access (DSA) protocols and supervised
    by software defined radio (SDR) in CR. The first step in this direction is the
    vacant spectrum scanning and second step is to allocate SU for dedicated transmission
    over the vacant channel with referred transmission control protocol (TCP). Spectrum
    scanning is a very tedious task for SDR and requires highly volatile antenna characteristics.
    This paper proposes a design and development of novel antenna to deal with wide
    spectrum scanning in CR. The antenna exhibits high compatibility with RF environments
    and transmission modules associated with CRN embedded systems. The primary study
    reveals the UWB design and respective parametric studies suitable for WCRSN. Figure
    1 shows a basic layout of cognitive radio structure of spectrum sharing between
    PU and SU. Fig. 1: Cognitive radio scheme Show All Many UWB antennas are reported
    in the literature. A wide slot antenna [1], different types of vertically mounted
    monopoles-their impedance and radiation characteristics [2], square planar wideband
    vertical monopoles with asymmetrical beveling, symmetrical beveling and shorting
    post [3], CPW-fed broadband square slot antenna includes tuning stub [4], a square
    patch fed semi circled arc-shape slot and a triangular-shaped slot [5], double-sided
    printed bow-tie antenna [6], printed monopole triangular antenna in addition to

    radiations[21], elliptical UWB monopole antenna [22] are some of the printed UWB
    antennas reported in the literature. The designing & developing art of wide applications
    and to design such antennas for such applications [23], the effect of truncated
    ground-plane for ultra-wideband (UWB) applications are described in [24], different
    impedance bandwidth enhancing techniques for wide band folded-shorted antenna
    were presented in [25], design rule of various antennas for UWB applications under
    different frequency spectrums for IoT, Cognitive radio, energy harvesting and
    other advanced applications are discussed in [26]. The three-layer cognitive radio
    structure consist of perception, network and application layers as shown in figure
    2. This reveals the need of a highly compatible antenna system for perception
    layer. Fig. 2: CR layer architecture Show All Bandwidth widening technique of
    a multilayer patch antenna for X-band applications is proposed. A method to enhance
    the bandwidth having two compact antennas with circular ground and reduced fractal
    ground are much popular but enhances complexities in many applications. In this
    reference, the application layer consists of multimedia-based user interface,
    transport deals with internet of things & SDR and perception elicits the effective
    use of wireless cognitive radio sensor networks as shown in figure 3. Therefore,
    this design is a very augmented entity for sensor network to scan wide network
    over licensed spectrum of PU. Fig. 3: CR layer attributes Show All SECTION II.
    Antenna Design It is reported that the multiple orthogonal modes can be possessed
    with possible radiation properties by antenna geometry. These modes can be obtained
    by the generalized equation of Maxwell with nth Eigen values of current J n ,
    reactance X and resistance, while λ n corresponds to respective mode X( J n )=
    λ n R( J n ) (1) View Source Where, R is real part of impedance matrix and X is
    the imaginary parts of the impedance matrix Z=R+jX λ n =[ J ∗ n X( J n ) J ∗ n
    R( J n ) ] (2) (3) View Source Also, λ n = p rect,n p rad,n MS=[ 1 (1+j λ n )
    ] (4) (5) View Source Equation 1 to 5 give that the characteristics modes corresponds
    to negative values λ n conserves the electric energy and for greater than zero
    would be responsible of magnetic energy storage. Hence, the resonance mode can
    be obtained with respect to λ n =0 . Another alternative is to determine resonant
    frequency to a specific mode is to determine Modal Significance factorMSS’, having
    value 1 represents most efficient resonating mode. The design modifications are
    made on both the sides of the antenna over a structure of 21×18mm2 area substrate
    of FR4 material. Table 1: Design attributes As a first step deformed ground structure
    is obtained to suppress the unwanted scattered radiation in undesirable band of
    frequency. This has been modeled with respect to ground geometry alteration rather
    picking up any other change in rest of the structure. The model design is conceptualized
    on HFSS software and multiple design attributes to obtain the desired results
    analysis as covered in table 1From the lumped equivalent diagram of the schematic
    as shown in figure 4, it is observational that any variation in the respective
    patch and ground length causes tuning of impedance matching. Based on various
    design strategy, a parametric study of multiple design is processed in this section,
    the behavior of return loss parameter is analyzed with the local development of
    antenna equivalent is presented in figure 5. Fig. 4: Schematic diagram of model
    Show All CMA for probe feed U-slot patch for in dimension invariance, resonant
    frequency and combination mode gives new design aspects for the class of antenna
    with optimized degree of parameter. The design development of antenna has been
    taken up on characteristic mode theory. The basic structure of antenna converges
    for its resonant mode equation and symmetry for εr= 4.4 & h = 1.5 mm. The base
    dimension would yield a new modified geometry on U-shape antenna due to its high
    convergence falls in UWB applications for the improvement of operating frequency
    range, the antenna architecture is observed under its bandwidth characteristics.
    The CM theory is successfully applied on a varying dimension and prototype is
    developed as shown in figure 6. Fig. 5: Equivalent diagram of slot Show All Fig.
    6: Antenna prototype Show All SECTION III. Results and Discussion The loss free
    antenna has quality factors suggested by Chu''s definition that is inversely associated
    with bandwidth. The first prototype Antenna U-shape antenna is characterized in
    multiple designs with the variation of W/L ratio and the variation has been supported
    in table 1 and analyzed. It has been observed that below and above the optimized
    ratio of width & length for ground plane of the antenna is not able to radiate
    effectively with synchronized impedance matching. Thus, design 1 is chosen for
    further improvement on its characteristic mode. CMA for probe feed U-slot patch
    for in dimension invariance, resonant frequency and combination mode gives new
    design aspects for the class of antenna with optimized degree of parameter. The
    design development of antenna has been taken up on characteristic mode theory.
    The basic structure of antenna converges for its resonant mode equation and symmetry
    for ∈ − r=4.4 & h = 1.5 mm. The base dimensions would yield a new modified geometry
    on U-shape antenna due to its high convergence falls in UWB applications. For
    the improvement of operating frequency range, the antenna architecture is observed
    under its bandwidth characteristics. The CM theory is successfully applied on
    a varying dimension and in accordance to the applied many strategies for evolution
    of optimized geometries and respective responses as presented in figure 7. Fig.
    7: Scattering loss with respect varying patch dimensions Show All The aspects
    of design modification are led by the varying ground geometry as shown in figure
    8. It is interesting to see higher the length width ratio gives better impedance
    matching but a slight adjustment in this ratio may tum-up effective bandwidth
    of the antenna. This is indeed motivated from the suppression of spurious feed
    radiations produced within the radiator by truncation or deformation of the ground
    structure. Hence in conclusion, the simultaneous modification makes radiator more
    efficient in reference to operating characteristics. Fig. 8: Effect of ground
    modification Show All Further a consistency is seen in return loss characteristics
    with respect to ground length and width ratio variations. This is an important
    aspect to make decision on optimized geometry as shown in figure 9. On this basis,
    prototype is tested and measured for the complete simulated frequency sweep as
    shown in figure 10. The antenna justifies its candidature for real time applications
    for sensing the wide spectrum in cognitive radio applications. The comparative
    bandwidth variation of multiple design models is obtained in figure 11. Obtaining,
    a remarkable band of 7.4 GHz. under the multiple rectification of antenna models
    and obtaining design 1 a base structure for further design optimization. Fig.
    9: RL vs. Freq for the variation wg/lg Show All Fig. 10: Design validation through
    measuerd and simulated comparasion Show All Fig. 11: Bandwidth variation with
    respect to parametric changes Show All The feed strip patch is formed over the
    band gap processed optimized ground geometry. The radiating patch is designed
    and simulated for optimized U-shape radiating structure and association of slotted
    feed match strip for avoiding any impedance deviation over a wide band operation
    of Wi-Max/HiperLan-2/X-band as per IEEE standards. The simulated and measured
    |S11| parameters of wide scanning antenna for CRN is found suitable below −10
    dB from 3.3 GHz to 11.5 GHz, are traced for UBW applications. Fig. 12: E-plane
    radiation pattern at (a) 4.0 (b) 7 and (c) 10 ghz Show All For the same, radiation
    pattern shows bidirectional properties for E-plane and H-plane is shown in figure
    12 and 13 With respect to 4.7, 7 and 10 GHz. the pattern shows stable characteristics.
    This makes antenna design sustainable over the large bandwidth. Fig. 13: H-plane
    radiation pattern at (a) 4.0 (b) 7 and (c) 10 ghz Show All The wideband properties
    are taken in to account for less than −10 dB return losses and VSWR in between
    2 to 1. At the field distribution, the most important analysis has been made to
    determine the net field distribution over the selected geometry of patch in figure
    14. Fig. 14: Current density distribution Show All Fig. 15: Total gain (db) at
    4.0 & 10 ghz Show All Effective current & field distributions are seen from feed
    strip to limbs of the U-shape patch at successive -frequency sweeps. The more
    variations were also observed to produce net field radiation in the operating
    band of the frequency. It is noticeable that the novel sensor antenna geometry
    is wide band frequency band operation, the 3-dimensional radiation pattern characteristics
    with effective gain coefficient is shown in figure 15 under multiple test conditions
    at respective frequencies of 4.7, 7 and 10 GHz. The EM radiations in E-plane and
    H-plane with respect to antenna axis, radiation pattern is suitable for broadcasting
    applications. The design conclusion of UWB U shape dipole antenna has been proposed
    for base structure to unique development of proposed antenna design. Another advantage
    is developed that antenna can resonate even at quite lower frequency with significant
    reduced size. Infect, making a little compromise may yield low frequency resonating
    antenna, while ultra-wide band design 1 antenna is meeting best possibilities
    of this work. Therefore, this work approach is entitled for effective utilization
    of wide band antenna in sensing of available spectrum opportunity and beneficial
    for CR network. SECTION IV. Conclusion The proposed antenna delivered a wide band
    impedance matching with high gain and stable radiation characteristics. The antenna
    is highly compatible for spectrum scanning commanded by the SDR during opportunistic
    scan of channel vacancy. The radiation characteristics delivers a defined and
    stable pattern for complete frequency sweep. The overall performance of the antenna
    met the feasibility in cognitive radio network to allot opportunistic transmission
    to secondary user during high spectrum scarcity. The antenna is highly compatible
    for most of the licensed frequency spectrum bands as per the FCC standards and
    helps in finding the vacant RF spectrum. Authors Figures References Citations

  description: Cognitive radio (CR) overcomes the spectrum congestion problem of the
    static spectrum access policy and considered as a future technology for upcoming
    Wireless Communication Standards like 5G, Internet of Media Things (IoMT), etc.
    CR utilizes the Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) technique without compromising the
    QoS issues of primary users (PUs). In CR network, secondary users (SUs) perform
    periodic spectrum sensing that reduces the effective throughput of SUs. Also,
    if a PU activity is detected during sensing activity, SU will remain idle up to
    the next sensing slot. In-between if a PU leaves the channel, the channel will
    remain idle till the next sensing slot which further reduces the throughput of
    SU. In this article, we propose a novel sensing strategy that helps to find out
    the additional transmission opportunity that increases the overall throughput
    of CRN and would be beneficial for a real-time application like video. The extensive
    simulation shows that the short sensing scheme outperforms the conventional sensing
    strategy in terms of throughput efficiency and improves the Quality of Experience
    (QoE) of different real-time video applications.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Kolkata, India SECTION I. Introduction The
    rapid growth of wireless users along with the increasing popularity of wireless
    multimedia services have depleted the radio spectrum day-by-day. However, the
    Federal Communication Commission (FCC) has observed that nearly 15% to 85% spectrum
    is underutilized over different geographical areas [1]. Cognitive radio networks
    (CRN) use dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technique that addresses the spectrum
    deficiency problem by allowing unlicensed secondary users (SUs) to use the licensed
    spectrum if primary user (PU) is absent. To protect PU’s transmission, periodic
    spectrum sensing (SS) is deployed where SU periodically sense the channels to
    find out spectrum opportunity. In CRN, sensing periodicity ‘Tp’ is determined
    by maximum interference duration that a PU can tolerate [2]. Considering the growing
    demand for Quality of Service (QoS) driven multimedia applications, CRN is surely
    a promising candidate which can provide additional bandwidth for QoS enhancement.
    Energy detection (ED) is the most widely used spectrum sensing strategy used in
    CRN due to it’s easy implementation [3]. In the conventional approach, the cognitive
    cycle is composed of periodic sensing and transmission slots. In sensing slot,
    SUs sense the activity of PUs and initiate transmission if the channel is idle
    otherwise it remains silent for entire duration which is denoted as silent blocks.
    Therefore, SU’s throughput is greatly reduced by periodic sensing activity and
    the occurrence of silent blocks due to the presence of PUs. The efficiency of
    CRN significantly depends on the sensing strategy which comprises sensing technique
    and scheduling of the sensing activity. Sensing periodicity is a key parameter
    of the scheduling activity which has been studied elaborately in [4]–[6]. In order
    to maximize SU’s throughput, transmission duration is optimized in [5]. In [6],
    optimization of both transmission and sensing duration is analyzed. In [7], optimization
    of probability oriented transmission activity is developed by employing the statistics
    of licensed spectrum. In this paper, fixed sensing duration is considered and
    transmission duration is optimized based on PU activity. In [8], the tradeoff
    between sensing and throughput duration is mathematically examined and optimal
    sensing time is achieved for throughput maximization of SU. In [9], the basic
    CR cycle is modified by introducing momentary sensing between successive transmissions
    of packets in order to achieve higher throughput and better VoIP transmission.
    It is thus evident from the literature survey that there is a genuine requirement
    of throughput enhancement for SUs. Several schemes have been developed which modify
    the basic CR cycle parameters in order to improve the secondary throughput. In
    spite of this, there exist a few areas which can be explored for further throughput
    enhancements. Higher throughput is an important criterion for real-time communication
    over the CRN platform. However, in the basic cognitive cycle, secondary throughput
    is greatly affected by periodic sensing activity and the frequent appearance of
    the silent blocks caused by random PU activity. Due to the random behavior of
    PU traffic, there exist some silent blocks which are neither utilized by PUs nor
    by SUs and this leads to the possible opportunity loss for SUs. In this article,
    our main focus is to device a novel sensing strategy that can improve the overall
    throughput of SUs. Our proposed policy improves the throughput in two stages.
    In the first stage, we enhance the throughput by optimizing the periodic sensing
    duration and in the second stage, we introduce a novel continuous short sensing
    mechanism to identify the possible transmission opportunity for SUs. Continuous
    short sensing in the silent phase of SUs will reduce the duration of unutilized
    silence blocks and improves the effective throughput of the CRN. Fig. 1. Basic
    Cognitive Cycle Show All This article is organized as follows. Section II deals
    with the system model and the proposed sensing strategy. In Section III, we discuss
    throughput enhancement strategies. In Section IV, we compare our proposed scheme
    with the conventional sensing strategy and analyze the effectiveness of our proposed
    scheme for real-time video applications over CRN. Finally, we conclude the paper
    in Section V. SECTION II. System Model Assuming the length of the SU’s cognitive
    cycle as ‘Tp’, the basic cognitive cycle is shown in Fig. 1. Basic cognitive cycle
    duration comprises of two parts: sensing duration and transmission duration.Although
    PU activity varies widely from time to time, it can be predicted with higher accuracy
    by learning-based approach [10]. If PU activity is identified during the sensing
    time, SU may wait for transmission on the same channel or it may initiate spectrum
    handoff. To avoid interference, SU should stop transmission and remain silent
    for the rest of the cognitive cycle which leads to silent blocks. However, PU
    may vacate the channel during the silent block, which results in unutilized slots
    and leads to throughput loss for SUs. If the PU activity is truly random with
    a very high departure rate, then SU may lose a great amount of time in silent
    mode which contributes to the throughput loss of SUs. Spectrum handoff is beyond
    the scope of this work and not analyzed in this article. In order to reduce the
    idle time of SUs, we introduce a novel continuous short sensing mechanism within
    the silent block as shown in Fig. 2. If PU is detected during normal sensing operation,
    SU enables continuous short sensing to closely monitor the activity of PU and
    try to detect possible transmission opportunity during inter sensing duration.
    This proposed scheme improves the throughput of SU by reducing the possibility
    of idle duration (silent blocks) but at the cost of additional energy consumption.
    However, this scheme is essential for real-time communication over CRN where throughput
    enhancement is more essential compared to energy efficiency. SECTION III. Throughput
    Enhancement Strategies In this paper, we have proposed overall throughput enhancement
    in two stages. In the first stage, we find the optimum sensing time that leads
    to throughput maximization considering the possibility of PU arrival during SU’s
    transmission. This makes the analysis more realistic. In the second stage, we
    introduce a novel continuous sensing strategy to exploit the possible transmission
    opportunities during inter sensing duration. Fig. 2. Modified Cognitive Cycle
    Show All A. Optimum Sensing Time PU activity can be modeled as ON/OFF process
    where ‘ON’ represents the busy and ‘OFF’ represents the idle state. In general,
    ON/OFF periods are exponentially distributed with PDFs [7], [11]: fB(t) = αe−αt
    and fI(t) = βe−βt where ‘α’and ‘β’are transition rates from busy to idle state
    and vice versa. Therefore, channel idle probability can be expressed as: P I =
    α α+β and busy probability can be expressed as: P B = β α+β . Generally, the performance
    of the energy detector based spectrum sensing can be determined by the detection
    probability (PD) and the false alarm probability (Pf). To protect PU from secondary
    transmission, target detection probability ( P ¯ D ) is set very close to unity
    and target false alarm probability ( P ¯ f ) is set less than 0.1. In IEEE 802.22
    WRAN standard, ( P ¯ D ) is considered as 0.9 for a SNR of –20 dB [8]. To achieve
    required performance at a particular SNR (γp) for channel bandwidth (B), sensing
    time ‘τ’should be greater than ′ τ ¯ ′ [8]. τ≥ τ ¯ = 1 2B ( Q −1 ( P ¯ f )− Q
    −1 ( P ¯ d ) 2 γ p +1 − − − − − − √ γ p ) 2 (1) View Source Hence, the average
    throughput of SU can be approximated as R ∗ (τ)≃ T p −τ T p S 0 (1− P f ) P I
    (2) View Source where S0 = B log2(1 + γs) denotes the achievable data rate of
    the SU when PU is absent and ‘γs’is the SNR due to secondary transmission. Let
    the channel idle time is denoted by ‘TI’. If a channel is sensed idle during sensing
    time, the probability that the channel will remain idle during the next transmission
    cycle is: Pr( T I > T p −τ)= e −β( T p −τ) (3) View Source Therefore, the effective
    throughput ( R ′ (τ)) of SU can be derived as: R ′ (τ)= R ∗ (τ)∗Pr( T I > T p
    −τ)= R ∗ (τ)∗ e −β( T p −τ) (4) View Source and effective normalized throughput
    (R(τ)) can be derived as: R(τ)= R ′ (τ) B = 1 B ( T p −τ T p ) S 0 (1− P f ) P
    I e −β( T p −τ) (5) View Source Fig. 3 shows the normalized throughput variation
    as we increase the sensing time ‘τ’. Fig. 3 clearly shows that there exists an
    optimum sensing time ‘τ*’for which SU throughput is maximum, below which the false
    alarm would be more dominating and beyond this optimum value-effective transmission
    duration would be substantially low. Hence optimum sensing time (τ*) is defined
    as: τ ∗ = max τ R(τ) s.t. τ≥ τ ¯ (6) View Source Fig. 3. Normalized Throughput
    variation of SU with sensing duration Show All Analytically it is difficult to
    find out optimum sensing duration, however, numerical optimization techniques
    can be applied to find out optimum sensing time ( τ*). B. Continuous Short Sensing
    Continuous short sensing (CSS) is applied when PU is detected during periodic
    sensing activity. We set the sensing duration as ′ τ ¯ ′ which is necessary to
    meet the requirements of ′ P ¯ D ′ and ′ P ¯ f ′ but usually smaller than ‘τ*’.
    Let ‘L’ be the number of short sensing duration during silent phase which can
    be defined as: L=⌊ ( T P − τ ∗ ) τ ¯ ⌋ . We define average opportunity gain (
    T ¯ OG ) as the average transmission opportunity obtained due to CSS during the
    silent phase and can be derived as follows: T ¯ OG = ∑ l=1 L (L−l) τ ¯ P I l |B
    = τ ¯ [ L(L−1) 2 + e −α τ ¯ (1− e −Lα τ ¯ ) (1− e −α τ ¯ ) 2 − L e −α τ ¯ 1− e

    define normalized throughput gain factor (ηG ) with probability of detection (
    P ¯ d ) as: η G = T ¯ OG T P × P ¯ D × P B ×100% (9) View Source C. Application
    Modelling International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has recommended that the
    Mean Opinion Score (MOS) could be used for subjective quality assessment of video
    applications. In general, MOS is a QoE measurement metric that varies from scale
    1 to 5, where ‘1’ represents poor quality and ‘5’ represents excellent quality.
    Based on the motion contents of video applications, it can be broadly categorized
    into three groups [12], i.e. rapid motion (RM), gentle walk (GW) and slight motion
    (SM). Motion intensity decreases from RM to SM type. Different video applications
    can be mathematically modeled as [12]: MOS= c1+c2∗FR+c3∗ln R ′ 1+c4∗ P e +c5∗
    P 2 e (10) View Source Where ‘c1’, ‘c2’, ‘c3’, ‘c4’and ‘c5’are the parametric
    coefficient of the model shown in Table I. ‘R ’represents the effective data rate
    and ‘Pe’represents the packet error probability. Among all these types of video
    applications RM type is considered as the most critical one due to it’s rapid
    motion content which may degrade the overall performance of the CRN. Our main
    objective is to improve the QoE of RM type video. SECTION IV. Simulation results
    In this section, we compare our proposed CSS with the conventional sensing strategy.
    Different parameters used for the performance analysis are summarized in the Table
    II. Fig. 4 shows the normalized throughput gain factor (ηG) for the proposed CSS
    when the channel idle probability increases. Two different bandwidth conditions
    are analyzed for the performance evaluation. In Fig. 4, it is observed that with
    increased probability of transition (busy to idle state), the throughput gain
    factor increases in CSS. This is because SU will get some additional transmission
    slots due to CSS and utilizes the same for secondary transmission. Fig. 4. Normalized
    Throughput Gain Factor for different PU activity Show All Fig. 5. QoE comparison
    of conventional and proposed scheme Show All Fig. 5 compares MOS of different
    video applications for the CSS and the conventional sensing strategy. It is clear
    from Fig. 5 that the performances of different video applications are improved
    due to the CSS. This is due to the additional throughput gain achieved by short
    sensing which leads to the quality enhancement of different video applications.
    In Fig. 6, we compare the % QoE improvement of different video applications for
    the proposed scheme. Generally, RM types of videos are extremely critical due
    to the higher motion content and their performance depends on the network conditions.
    Nearly 14% improvement is observed for the RM type. For GW and SM type videos
    the improvement factor is 6.5% and 1% respectively. For SM type, % improvement
    is marginal as they have very less motion content and their performance does not
    depend much on channel throughput. Fig. 6. QoE comparison of conventional and
    proposed scheme Show All SECTION V. Conclusion In this article, we have proposed
    a novel sensing strategy where overall throughput enhancement is envisioned by
    utilizing the transmission opportunity during the silent block of the conventional
    spectrum sensing scheme. Sensing duration is optimized to achieve higher throughput.
    We have defined the normalized throughput gain factor as the performance metric
    and compared the performance of our proposed scheme with the conventional scheme
    for different video applications. It is observed that the proposed scheme improves
    the QoE of different video applications, especially for RM type of videos which
    are more sensitive to the network conditions like the network throughput and gets
    benefited by the additional transmission opportunity achieved by our proposed
    scheme. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors deeply acknowledge the support from Visves-varaya

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Bhopal, India SECTION I. Introduction Static
    spectrum access strategy is the foundation of conventional wireless communication
    networks in which available frequency bands are utilized inefficiently because
    of the unalterable and reserved frequency allocation. Thus resulted spectrum-scarceness
    is the basis for evolution of the conception of Cognitive Radio, which constitutes
    various techniques enabling the cohabitation of licensed and unlicensed users
    upon the identical spectrum without compromising the performance. Static spectrum
    distribution result in white space, white spectrum, idle frequency/channel/band,
    which is the part of the radio spectrum, spatially & temporally unused, that can
    now be available for use by a secondary user or CR. Following sections of this
    paper will describe the concept behind the development of cognitive radio in section
    II, the metrics involved as performance measurement in section III, cognitive
    cycle and various cognitive tasks in section IV, imperfections that degrade the
    performance of CR in section V, the hypothesis defined for CR opportunity identification
    in section VI, various algorithms for detection of spectrum holes in section VII
    and finally, section VIII presents conclusion and future areas for research. SECTION
    II. Spectrum Holes and Dynamic Spectrum Access A. Software Defined Radio Software
    Defined Radio (SDR) [1], [2] is a radio wherein various attributes of carrier,
    signal, modulation, frequency range and network access e.g. modulation, cryptography,
    error correction coding, source coding of voice, video, or data etc. are delineated
    by software. Thus, SDR defines the architecture to describe and drive almost every
    aspect of radio through software. In terms of accession-duration for radio exploitation,
    bandwidth segments are categorized as incessantly-accessed, never-accessed and
    fractionally-accessed. A Spectrum hole [1], [3] is thus defined as unused segment
    of the spectrum, which can be considered as an opportunity for use by CR or secondary
    or unprivileged user. In terms of power spectra of incoming RF, the spectrum holes
    are classified broadly into three types: (i) Black spaces which are densely occupied
    by high-power local interferers and are never an option for use by SU, (ii) Grey
    spaces which are occupied partially by low-power interferers, and (iii) White
    spaces which are free of RF interferers and are possible candidate for use by
    SU. B. Opportunistic Spectrum Access Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA) is an
    upshot of the commencement of SDR [4] and the conception of cognitive radio technology.
    OSA thirsts for “cavity” in the spectrum and then modulates the link parameters
    to correspond to the cavity in order to transmit over those portions of spectrum
    that are vacant or not in use. OSA characterises the “listen before talk” etiquette
    for accessing the spectrum and in order to locate a hole, its role is somewhat
    complex due to the overhead of listening to other non-opportunistic transmitters
    too. A subclass of OSA [2], [4] is Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS), also called
    as Dynamic Channel Selection (DCS), that is utilized to obviate a device to access
    a particular band when it is in use and to avoid co-channel interference between
    primary user (PU) and secondary user. Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) [2], [5] uses
    the concept of spectrum pooling in recognizing the obtainability of underutilized
    spectrum and providing a mechanism thereafter to generate opportunities for cognitive
    sharing of underutilized spectrum to unprivileged users. The only requisite for
    DSA is that secondary or tertiary radio transmission should strictly not create
    any destructive interference to primary systems. DSA increases the density and
    manages the interference dynamically to provide interference-tolerant operation
    and adjacent-channel and co-site interference resolution. SECTION III. CR Performance
    Metrics The objectives that pilot the decision procedures, e.g., To maximize Signal-to-Interference
    along with Noise Ratio (SINR), to minimize device power consumption, to minimize
    the Error Rates w.r.t. Bits (BER) and Frame (FER), to minimize latency, to maintain
    network connectivity, etc. are considered as benchmarks to delineate the performance
    of any algorithm for spectrum access. Following are the utility functions that
    define the performance of a CR [6]: A. Node-Level Metrics 1) For Situation Awareness
    For dynamic spectrum sharing, the information regarding the presence of PUs has
    to be identified by SUs. For the purpose, two complementary metrics are used:
    Probability of Detection ( P d ) and Probability of False Alarm ( P fa ). 2) For
    Cognitive Functionality Assessment Evaluation of cognitive functionalities is
    done through analysing, resolving, organising, and erudition. Different levels
    of radio IQ are enhanced through various cognitive capabilities e.g. PU/SU detection
    rate and false alarm rate. 3) For Node Performance Assessment Evaluation for node
    performance is carried out in terms of (i) SINR/INR, BER, bandwidth and power
    efficiency, at Physical Layer (ii) Collision rate, Average channel access duration,
    overhead ratio, packet-lost rate, and frame-error rate, at Link Layer (iii) Average
    and highest packet deferral and routing-track alteration rate, at Network Layer.
    Overall Node-performance can thus be evaluated in terms of: Sum throughput and
    network available time for spectrum utilization Transfer loss and SINR/INR for
    impact to other SUs Active time and battery life for power efficiency Communication
    cost for end users BER, FER or Packet drop ratio for link reliability B. Network-Level
    Metrics Spectrum Exploitation Efficacy (SEE) is a network-level metric [6] that
    resolute through the extent, spectrum in terms of frequency, geometric space and
    time, is utilized by the system. If I is the amount of information transferred
    and U is the amount of spectrum utilized that depends on the spectrum-range, geometric-space
    and time, then SEE will be the ratio of ‘ I ’ over ‘ U ’. Overall Network-performance
    can thus be evaluated in terms of: Sum throughput, throughput of secondary system
    and packing factor Spectrum utilization efficiency Impact to PU network or other
    co-existing SU network through (i) Increased average packet delay experienced
    by privileged PUs, (ii) SINR or BER deterioration at PU receiver and (iii) Call-drop
    rate increment, failure in handover, origination and termination failure. End-to-end
    metrics such as mean throughput, delay, packet drop rate, jitter etc. SECTION
    IV. Cognitive Cycle A. Layerwise Functioning of Cognitive Cycle Spectrum Sensing
    through Physical (PHY) layer: Aimed to detect the spectrum holes through detection
    of PUs Spectrum Management through Medium Access Control (MAC) layer: Aimed to
    acquire the best spectrum available that best fit the communication requirements
    Spectrum Mobility through Medium Access Control (MAC) layer: Aimed for shifting
    of SU''sfrequency spectrum to available hole after decision process Power Control/Routing
    through Network (NET) layer: Aimed to minimize power requirements during the process
    without affecting the CR performance [1], [4]. B. Cognitive Tasks 1) Receiver-Task
    a) Radio-Scene Analysis Interference-temperature [1] estimation of the radio surroundings
    Discovery of spectrum cavities b) Channel Identification Valuation of channel-state
    information (CSI) [1] Forecasting of channel capacity for transmission 2) Transmitter-Task
    Transmit-power control & dynamic spectrum management C. Spectrum Management Procedures
    Grounded on SUs radio access technique, broad classification of spectrum management
    [1], [7] can be done as interweave, underlay, and overlay methods. 1) Interweave
    This model incorporates meddling evasion with opportunistic communication for
    SUs, at portions which are left vacant/unused by the PUs, in space/frequency/time.
    Fig. 1. Basic cognitive cycle [1] Show All 2) Underlay This model allows the coexistence
    of primary and secondary systems, provided the interference caused by Secondary
    Transmitters (STs) to the Primary Receivers (PRs) is below the maximum allowable
    interference level, known as interference threshold, decided by interference temperature
    model, to guarantee a trustworthy operation of PUs irrespective of SU''s spectrum
    capturing. 3) Overlay This model offset the hindrance instigated by the ST to
    the PR by using a part of SUs power for transmitting the primary message. This
    allows concurrent transmission of SU with PU but it is very difficult to realize
    the philosophy as it entails high degree of cognition, between the two systems,
    in the form of information regarding the PU''s channel, its codebooks, messages,
    etc. SECTION V. CR System Imperfections Spectrum cognizance problem under CR can
    be defined cogitating the following constraints: (i) Advance information on PU''s
    signal details along with the variations in channel/noise is absent (ii) Maximum
    possible time to gather the data such as spectrum usage, SNR, etc. Is insufficient,
    (iii) The SNR detected for primary may be very low, and (iv) Variation in noise/interference
    power results in ambiguity regarding decision on PU presence/absence. This vagueness
    in cognitive radio [8], [9] can be categorised into (i) Signal/Noise/Channel related,
    and (ii) Equipment related, listed below: A. Signal/Noise/Channel Related 1) Noise
    Uncertainty In practice, precision on noise distribution is not feasible. In worst-case
    scenerio i.e. received signal SNR below −20 dB [10], the noise-variance estimation
    can never be perfect and this limits the performance of noise statistics based
    spectrum detection techniques. Further, noise uncertainty aslo persist in receiver
    devices due to non-linearity and time-varying thermal noise within various components.
    Fig. 2. Spectrum management schemes [8] Show All 2) Channel/Interference Uncertainty
    To restraint the interference originated by a CR, the PRs'' channel information
    is critical. Owing to the presence of channel vagueness, the received power of
    PRs can never be accurately known and it must also be estimated by CR. Further,
    the characteristics of interference e.g. its power level, waveform and its distribution
    are generally indefinite; that heads to the problem of interference vagueness
    too. 3) Signal Uncertainty Since the secondary user is incapable of having precise
    a priori knowledge of primary signals and their properties, that might be present
    in interested band, this may lead to signal uncertainty. Also, the fading and
    multipath complicate the situation by fluctuating the signal power drastically.
    4) Noise/Channel Correlation Because of the inadequacy in filtering, pulse shaping
    and sampling procedures in the receiver system, the noise may turn out to be correlated.
    The same happens with channel because of the scattering of signals propagating
    in atmosphere and also due to the pairing between antennas. B. Equipment/Transeiver
    Related 1) Power Amplifier Nonlinearlity To achieve higher efficiency during transmission,
    a significant portion of energy is exhausted in RF circuits of Power Amplifier
    (PA) that results in increased nonlinear distortions which subsequently result
    in the Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI) with output signal''s spectral regrowth
    [11]. 2) Quantization Errors In quantization process, if the operation of Automatic
    Gain Controller (AGC), employed for regulating the level of input signal provided
    to Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), is not augmented appropriately, it may result
    in faults like (i) Quantization error, and (ii) Clipping error. In low SNR regime,
    these errors cause critical issues in detection of weak primary signals. 3) Synchronization
    Errors In practice, various synchronization errors e.g. drifts and offsets can
    occur in frequency/time/phase which may degrade the performance of spectrum estimation
    e.g. in cyclostationary feature detector, frequency mismatch initiated by clock/oscillator,
    unable the detector to extract the actual cyclic frequency. 4) Self Interference
    in Full Duplex Transceivers A major challenge in realizing a full duplex transceiver,
    employed for maximum throughput, in CR is self-interference. While accomplishing
    the task of spectrum recognition with the assistance of one RF chain, the other
    RF chain may act as a source of interference which consequently lowers the chances
    to perfectly detect the signal. In absence of prior information of PU system parameters
    to SUs, worsen the interference situation. 5) Calibration Error Calibration is
    a significant task to be performed at transmitter as well as receiver end. But
    it is not practical in CR scenario to calibrate at both ends as the PTs and SRs
    are handled through distinct entities. That is why, the cognitive receiver side
    is responsible only to carry out the calibration but this makes this process,
    device-dependent. SECTION VI. Spectrum Sensing Hypothesis For CR environment,
    Spectrum Sensing (SS) [4], [8] is a fundamental technique to cultivate the occupancy
    statistics of primary spectrum. It searches for spectrum holes in various signal
    domains and utilize them for secondary access. A cognitive radio functions as
    a user who has no privilege to access the frequency bands that are pre-assigned
    to PUs, hence it is necessary for CR to dynamically detect the presence of primary
    users. There are several factors, discussed in previous section, which make the
    spectrum sensing, a Challenge. In addition to those issues, the spatial sensing
    of a primary user involves very complex signal processing. Also, in order to avoid
    harmful interference to the PRs, the SUs need to evaluate the Channel State Information
    (CSI) regarding PRs and due to absence of any cooperation between primary and
    secondary systems, it is tough to explore CSI [1]. The SS query basically discriminate
    the events for Absence/Presence of a PU. The superiority of sensing is measured
    in the form of three probabilities namely (i) Probability of False Alarm, P f
    (ii) Probability of Missed Detection, P md , and (iii) Probability of Error, P
    e Representing the hypotheses [8], [12] for PU Absence and PU Presence by H 0
    (Only Noise) and H 1 (Signal with Noise) respectively, the problem can be framed
    as y[k]=n[k], y[k]=hs[k]+n[k], H 0 Null Hypothesis H 1 Alternate Hypothesis View
    Source Where, s[k] represents the signal that is being transmitted at k th sampling
    instant, h specifies the channel coefficient, n[k] represents the additive white
    noise with Gaussian distribution and y[k] represents the signal received by CR
    at k th sampling instant. Further, if the Probability that Primary is absent,
    i.e. H 0 True, is π 0 ; and the Probability that Primary is present, i.e. H 1
    True, is π 1 and as π 0 + π 1 =1 ; then Type-I Error is defined as the probability
    P f : Accepting H 1 when H 0 is True; Type-II Error is defined as the probability
    P md : Accepting H 0 when H 1 is True; and Average Error Probability is given
    by P e = π 0 P f + π 1 P md . SECTION VII. Signal Processing Based Spectrum Sensing
    Techniques Spectrum recognition techniques can be largely classified as: (i) Blind
    and (ii) Non-Blind [13]. Blind methods does not necessitate information of primary
    system parameters while non-blind methods need the same. Blind techniques are
    further classified into (i) Spectrum sensing based and (ii) Environmental parameter
    estimation based. The area that is taken into account for this section is spectrum
    sensing techniques that are based on signal processing. A. Energy Based Detection
    Energy Detection (ED) [14] is employed to decide the existence of carrier frequencies
    in a certain sub-band. ED utilizes the autocoherence property to extricate the
    elements (e.g. number of distinct signals) from individual sub-band of frequencies.
    Perfect discovery through ED necessitate accurate information on noise variance.
    The discovery information is utilized in deciding an apposite threshold for autocoherence
    function to state a false alarm rate for a fixed lag τ and cyclic frequency α
    . ED is optimal for detection of Independent and Identically Distributed (IID)
    signals, but for the detection of correlated signals, its performance is not reliable.
    Also, the technique requires perfect knowledge of noise variance but in practice,
    the noise variance has uncertainty which consequently makes the detection process
    dodgy. B. Autocorrelation Based Detection Autocorrelation based sensing approach
    takes advantage of the amplitude of the Cyclic Autocorrelation Function (CAF)
    [15]. This method detect the presence of a PU by exploiting the difference between
    signal and noise spectrums over the detection bandwidth. The noise has wide sense
    stationary property with zero autocorrelation and the transmitted signals, due
    to the redundancy of signal periodicities, hold the cyclostationary property having
    cyclic autocorrelation. A significant difference, thus exists between the two
    spectrums. At low SNR values, the effect of noise correlation dominates the channel
    correlation which makes this model less effective for low SNR regime. C. Covariance
    Based Detection This technique has an advantage over energy detection method as
    this requires no information of signal, channel and noise, a priori. This approach
    sets the threshold for the target statistics, i.e. probability of false alarm,
    based on an algorithm that depends on Correlation Random Data Matrix (CRDM) of
    the received signal. Since the sample covariance matrix grabs the correlations
    among the signal samples, this scheme has better performance as compared to the
    energy detection based approach. D. Cyclostationary Based Detection In Cyclostationary
    based detection, the SU exploit the cyclstationary property of PU signal for spectrum
    sensing. By exploring the periodic fashion of the cyclostationary parameter, a
    PU can be detected if it transmits a signal having cyclostationary property. Cyclostationary
    property of modulated signals is confirmed when their mean and self-correlation
    change periodically. According to the algorithm in [16]: When the signal s(t)
    from PU, received by SU, is scalar and cyclostationary in nature, the Cyclic autocorrelation
    R(τ) of that signal is obtained by correlation operation between s(t) and shifted
    s(t) for a shifting of cyclic frequency α . The spectral correlation concentration
    is acquired afterwards through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of cyclic autocorrelation.
    Spectral Correlation Function (SCF) is then calculated for fixed number of samples,
    say N. The SCF peak is obtained at the exact cyclic frequency. Decision follows
    the existence of PU when SCF>Threshold and noise only when SCF<Threshold. When
    no prior information is available about the PU''s waveform, as in actual scenario,
    cyclostationary feature detection approach give best results because of its noise
    rejection capability. But, this technique is costly and more complex and takes
    longer observation time to evaluate [16], [17]. E. Eigenvalue Based Detection
    In this technique, for detection of signal existence, Eigenvalue disintegration
    (EVD) based functions are utilized for received signal''s covariance matrix [8],
    [18]. The execution includes the compilation of received samples, by CR node,
    in M×N matrix form where M is the number of sampled branches or the cooperative
    nodes and N is the number of samples taken. The fundamental algorithm trails the
    following: (i) Counting the effects of noise variance, Formulation of the covariance
    matrix of received signal (ii) Calculation of eigenvalues ( λ ) for that matrix
    (iii) Estimation of the eigenvalue-weighting based test statistic e.g. λ max and
    λ min for Maximum-to-Minimum Eigenvalue (MME) (iv) Based on the test statistic
    i.e. λ max / λ min , Decision follows the PU existence when λ max > λ min and
    Noise only when λ max < λ min . F. Max-Min SNR Based Detection As the pulse shaping
    filter is designed in initial stage and is fixed, the cognitive receiver is assumed
    to know about the behaviour of oversampled signal passed through it. The sensing
    mechanism follows the succeeding steps: (i) an oversampled signal, with total
    duration equal to the symbol period, is combined linearly with the help of a combiner
    vector. (ii) SNR maximization and minimization problems for combined signals are
    then formulated as Rayleigh quotient optimization problem [19]. (iii) Taking the
    ratio of signal energy corresponding to the maximum and minimum SNRs, test statistics
    are formulated [20]. Results of this approach establish that the algorithm has
    better sensing performance as compared to the ED and EVD-based detector in AWGN
    and Rayleigh fading environment. G. Moment Based Detection In digitised communication
    systems, a particular constellation is chosen to collect samples of signals, being
    transmitted, with values in range [−b, b], b>0 , where b has received signal''s
    SNR dependency. A statistic ( S ) expressed by ratio of fourth absolute moment
    and square of second absolute moment results in 2 and less than 2, respectively
    for bare noise and signal plus noise cases. That is why, a new test statistics
    is taken as S subtracted from 2 i.e. (2 minus S ). The sensing based on second-order
    and fourth-order moments is advantageous as of the independence of the signal
    phase, consistency, and increased computational efficiency [21]. H. Cooperative
    Sensing Based Detection In non-cooperative sensing based detection, prevailing
    problems are hidden nodes, exposed nodes, shadow fading, etc. Single-threshold
    based detection is susceptible to the noise power while multiple-threshold downgrades
    the spectrum efficiency. Two-threshold with cooperation based method is proposed
    in [22] for energy detection of the signal and finally Maximum Ratio Combining
    (MRC) for energy fusion with OR rule [23] is adopted to attain decision fusion.
    The algorithm consists of a common node which accepts the result ( R i ) from
    each CR detecting the spectrum through both decision thresholds V Th0 and V Th1
    independently. If S i is the ith CR''s local detection and V i is the ith CR''s
    detected value falling into ( V th0 ,  V th1 ] such that R i ={ V i S i V th0
    < V i ≤ V th1   Otherwise View Source The final detection Result ( RES ) will
    be in accordance with following test statistics RES= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ 1 0 ∑ i=1 K S i
    +A>0   Otherwise View Source Where, S i =0 specifies the absence of PU; and S
    i =1 specifies the presence of PU and A is a local test statistic defining Presence
    ( A=1 ) and Absence ( A=0 ) of the PU, respectively. With the use of double-threshold
    cooperative energy detection approach, the sensing probability of CR systems can
    be enhanced significantly [22]. Table I. Performance analysis of various sensing
    practices for PU detection SECTION VIII. Conclusions and Future Directions In
    this paper, the concept of sensing of spectrum, to detect the spectral holes,
    is discussed through a number of signal processing based techniques. Since we
    are moving towards an era of 5th generation communication, this field is always
    a thirst for researchers. There are many algorithms, some discussed here in this
    paper, which aim towards exploring the spectrum to search for portions of radio
    that is underutilized and which can be a potential area for use by an unlicensed
    system. In all approaches, the concept is to identify the spectrum holes efficiently
    and precisely, even in presence of various signal degradations and environmental
    issues. These algorithms address to detect the presence of PU efficiently even
    in very low SNR regime and without being degraded under various signal deterioration
    conditions like multipath, fading, ACI, etc. and also having a perfection in terms
    of reduced complexity, cost and time-to-detect, but every methodology is having
    advantages as well as disadvantages. Some are better at performance but on the
    cost of complexity and time and some require prior information which practically
    is not feasible. The issues which need to be addressed, in order to maximize the
    performance of CR and to minimize the computational complexity, cost and decision
    time are the need of algorithms to mitigate the effects of signal/channel/noise
    uncertainty, various interferences, fading, transceiver imperfections, etc. so
    that the test statistics can be improved to perfection. All these, open new dimensions
    in the direction of further research on already discussed methodologies and also
    to develop new hybrid algorithms. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

  description: In the late years, researches focus on decay of TCP throughput over
    wireless connections, and numerous wireless TCP solutions are proposed to manage
    this issue. On the other hand, trailed by the change of equipment innovation,
    new system structures and mechanism are proposed to upgrade wireless interchanges,
    for example, the Cognitive Radio (CR) systems. However this new system architecture
    causes another issue, which is not solved in wireless TCPs. In this paper, we
    discuss new issues that affect the TCP throughput over CR systems, which we call
    Bandwidth Variation and Packet Loss Event and it as concerned with three events
    such as PU-Interference Loss Event, Mild-Congestion Event and RTT-Variance Event
    that cause these issues. In view of these three events we proposed three event
    handlers such as Primary user interference handlers, Fast recovery handlers, RTT
    adjustment function to boost TCP throughput. A cross layer arrangement is proposed
    to manage these new issues. We propose an event driven CR-TCP that joins these
    event handlers, which can be solved with begin of-start-of-Art CR-TCP arrangements.
    Both numerical and simulation results are displayed to exhibit the effectiveness
    of the proposed arrangement.

    communications systems don''t exploit the whole available frequency band. The
    idea has naturally emerged to develop tools to better use the spectrum. Cognitive
    Radio (CR) is the concept that meets this challenge. The CR is a form of wireless
    communication in which a transmitter/receiver can detect intelligently communication
    channels that are in use and those that are not, and can move to unused channels.
    This optimizes the use of available radio frequency spectrum while minimizing
    interference with other users. CRs must have the ability to learn and adapt their
    wireless transmission according to the ambient radio environment. The application
    of Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches in the CR is very promising because
    they are essential for the implementation of CR networks architecture. They must
    be able to coexist to make CR systems practical, which may cause interference
    to other users. To solve the problem of congestion, CR networks use Dynamic Spectrum
    Access (DSA). In order to deal with this problem, the idea of cooperation between
    users to detect and share spectrum without causing interferences is introduced.
    The authors found a large number of suggested works relating to spectrum access,
    those using Auctions, a large number of approaches use the Game theory, but those
    using Markov chains are fewer. However, some research has been done in this area
    using Multi Agent Systems (MAS). Request access from your librarian to read this
    chapter''s full text. Full Text Preview Cognitive Radio The idea of CR was officially
    presented by Joseph Mitola in a seminar at KTH, the Royal Institute of Technology
    in 1998, later published in an article by Mitola and Gerald Q. Maguire, Jr. in
    1999 (Mitola J, 1999). The term Cognitive Radio is used to describe a system with
    the ability to sense and recognize its context of use, in order to enable it to
    adjust its radio operating parameters dynamically and autonomously and learn the
    results of its actions and its environmental setting operation. CR is a form of
    wireless communication in which a transmitter/receiver (transceiver) can detect
    intelligently communication channels which are in use and those that are not,
    and can move to unused channels. This optimizes the use of available spectrum
    radio frequency while minimizing interference with other users. The principle
    of CR, included in the IEEE 802.22 and IEEE 802.16h (Grandblaise, 2006), requires
    an alternative spectrum management (i.e., a mobile called secondary may at any
    time access to frequency bands that are free, that is, not occupied by primary
    user (PU) of the licensed band). The secondary user (SU) will assign the service
    once completed, or once a PU has shown an inclination connection. Continue Reading

  description: It is now widely recognized that wireless communications systems don’t
    exploit the whole available frequency band. The idea has naturally emerged to
    develop tools to better use the spectrum. Cognitive Radio (CR) is the concept
    that meets this challenge. The CR is a form of wireless communication in which
    a transmitter/receiver can detect intelligently communication channels that are
    in use and those that are not, and can move to unused channels. This optimizes
    the use of available radio frequency spectrum while minimizing interference with
    other users. CRs must have the ability to learn and adapt their wireless transmission
    according to the ambient radio environment. The application of Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) approaches in the CR is very promising because they are essential for the
    implementation of CR networks architecture. They must be able to coexist to make
    CR systems practical, which may cause interference to other users. To solve the
    problem of congestion, CR networks use Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). In order
    to deal with this problem, the idea of cooperation between users to detect and
    share spectrum without causing interferences is introduced. The authors found
    a large number of suggested works relating to spectrum access, those using Auctions,
    a large number of approaches use the Game theory, but those using Markov chains
    are fewer. However, some research has been done in this area using Multi Agent
    Systems (MAS).

    SECTION 1. Introduction Narrow band SISO communication standards do not implement
    multiple concurrent data streams nor include multi antenna support. Nevertheless
    it is useful to review Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems to provide
    context for the application of multi antenna techniques to the target SISO standards.
    MIMO communications standards such as IEEE 802.11n, 802.11 ac and LTE Advanced
    [1] employ multi-antenna transceiver architectures by implementing advanced coding,
    modulation and combining algorithms to enhance data throughput and to improve
    link margins [2]. These systems exploit channel diversity to send multiple data
    streams between devices over the same Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum. To increase
    diversity in the channel, MIMO equipment manufacturers typically deploy their
    systems with multi polarized antenna arrays. For example consumer grade 802.11n
    access point installation guides such as the one shown in Figure 1, instruct the
    user to arrange the multiple antennas to achieve “Optimal Wireless Performance”.
    The consumer is not expected to understand why this arrangement provides higher
    performance but it should be clear that the outer two antennas on the left image
    are arranged to present the channel with cross polarized states as viewed from
    the front. This configuration provides greatly improved channel diversity and
    throughput [3]. These antenna arrangements unfortunately exhibit pattern problems.
    Figure 1 D-link consumer wireless router polarization setting instructions Show
    All The toroidal pattern of a dipole antenna exhibits a pattern null along the
    axis of the antenna as illustrated in Figure 2a. Although the right and left antennas
    in Figure 2b have horizontal electric field components, as indicated by the electric
    field vectors, and maximum isolation between them, this configuration results
    in poor coverage to the upper left and upper right. Furthermore, if the antennas
    were arranged as instructed on the right of Figure 1, the left and right antennas
    would be horizontally polarized with a transmission null to the left and right
    for two of the three antennas. Unique antennas, designed as part of this research
    [4], partially solve this multi antenna pattern problem, as illustrated in Figure
    3, with a horizontally polarized (H-Pol) element that is truly omni-directional
    while supplying the additional multi antenna attribute of antenna to antenna isolation.
    Figure 2 A) dipole antenna toriodal pattern shape b) access point configuration
    Show All Figure 3 Preferred configuration with h-pol omni antennas Show All Since
    this new H-Pol antenna element is contained in a nearly vertical antenna form
    factor, as discussed in Section 2.1, it was possible to extend the design and
    implementation of common aperture dual polarized (D-Pol) antenna. With such an
    antenna, any possible polarization can be generated by the vector sum of the two
    orthogonal antenna elements. If the polarization of an antenna can be made adaptable
    then channel diversity can be adaptively optimized. Although extensively studied
    [5]–[8], Adaptive Polarization (AP) is an oftentimes overlooked technique for
    interference mitigation [9] and DSA, particularly in the context of SISO radio
    standards. The Adaptive Polarization Algorithm (APA) described here is designed
    to optimally combine two nominally orthogonal receive antennas, and is compared
    to the following competing methods; Switched Polarization Diversity (SPD), Maximal
    Ratio Combining (MRC), and simple linear polarization equipped receivers. A new
    APA method [10] is reviewed here, which is superior to all competing methods in
    optimizing the quality of the received signal. In addition APA equipment can be
    incrementally deployed thus improving existing systems due to complete backward
    compatibility. 1.1 Review of Polarization Just as MIMO system capacity is improved
    by a high degree of spatial and polarization diversity in the channel, AP benefits
    from a high degree of polarization diversity for both desired signals and the
    interferers. For the purposes of this paper the polarization state of a signal
    in the channel is represented as a point on the Poincare Sphere [11]. As shown
    in Figure 4, the difference between any two polarization states can be represented
    by the angle α . The polarization coupling factor between two polarization states
    P 1 and P 2 is given by (1). As α P C P 1 P 2 =10 log 10 cos 2 ( α 2 ) (1) View
    Source approaches 180° the coupling between the states approaches zero. The goal
    of AP is to match the receiver polarization state to that of the desired signal
    as modified by the channel, and thus minimize Polarization Dependent Loss (PDL)
    and reject or null the dominant interferer''s polarization state. Figure 4 Poincare
    sphere with states P 1 and P 2 Show All Figure 5 Polarization filter response
    vs.σ Show All The complete polarization coupling factor as a function of a is
    shown in Figure 5. It may appear that the APA should strive to place the interferer
    in the response null with an α of 180°, however, there may be a more optimal solution.
    The maximum SINR is achieved when the AP enabled receiver implements a third state
    which trades off desired signal strength for rejection of the interferers. This
    optimal solution is provided by the APA algorithm described here. 1.2 Polarization
    Based Channel Diversity If both the desired signal and the dominant interfering
    source arrive at the receiver with the same polarization state then the APA will
    provide little improvement. Just as additional diversity in the channel can improve
    the channel capacity of a MIMO system, AP benefits from a channel that results
    in polarization rotation. Figure 6 illustrates the polarization distribution of
    a population of 400 gas meters equipped with a vertical antenna. Observing the
    population was an AP equipped gas meter collection receiver mounted at a height
    of 30 feet in a suburban environment. Note that a significant percentage of the
    population had a channel induced a greater than 90° indicating a 3dB and greater
    PDL than a vertical receiving antenna. Gas utility companies demand that all meters
    be read wirelessly, therefore in a large metro area of 1M meters, the utility
    is demanding more than 6 nines (99.9999%) of coverage reliability. In this population
    the PDL will be significant enough to reduce the coverage reliability to less
    than 96% for a number of meters in this population, as nearly 4% will experience
    a PDL of 15dB or greater, severely impacting the deployment link margin. Since
    an APA equipped receiver can recover the power that would otherwise be lost to
    PDL, polarization rotation in the channel becomes inconsequential in an interference
    free channel. In interference burdened channels, the polarization rotation of
    the desired signal provides the APA equipped receiver the opportunity to mitigate
    interferers with differing polarization states. Figure 6 Polarization state of
    400 gas meters Show All 1.3 Ap Combining Algorithms In addition to the lack of
    direct support for capturing and maintaining channel state information, SISO systems
    communication standards can be implemented with low-cost non-coherent OOK and
    FSK modulation. Combining algorithms, such as MRC and Minimum Mean Square Error
    (MMSE), require carrier recovery prior to computation. An AP system using these
    algorithms would require carrier recovery in low and negative Signal to Interference
    Ratio (SIR) environments. This is difficult without support for carrier recovery
    beyond that found in short preambles. For the purposes of this paper, “preamble”
    is defined as any known sequence in the signal. Another barrier to AP adoption
    is the extreme cost pressures on equipment for SUN end-points (a.k.a meters) and
    relatively low production volumes for Public Safety equipment as compared to cellular
    and wireless networking equipment. Fortunately the extreme cost pressures on ubiquitous
    802.11n and 11ac equipment have motivated Radio Frequency Integrated Circuit (RFIC)
    manufacturers to follow Moore''s Law with highly integrated multiport transceivers
    as evidenced in the recently introduced Ettus B210 Universal Software Radio Peripheral
    (USRP) utilizing the Analog Devices AD936X family of dual transceivers [12]. SECTION
    2. SIMO Solution Architecture By adding a second receiver to a SISO radio, the
    system is updated to a Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) system. The SIMO system
    consists of aD-Pol antenna and APA to mitigate PDL and interference. A 900 MHz
    ISM band demonstration system was developed based on common-aperture dual-polarized
    omni-directional antennas and the Ettus Figure 7 AP SDR hardware/software architecture
    and implementation Show All USRP equipped with 2 customized RFX900 radios as shown
    in Figure 7. GNU Radio Companion (GRC) provided Software Defined Radio (SDR) data
    flow and post processing while a custom C block implemented synchronization, triggering,
    APA, demodulation, SINR calculation and packet error rate (PER) calculations.
    2.1 Common Aperture Dual Polarized Antennas Experience with the stealth requirements
    for Public Safety and the aesthetics requirements of neighborhood SUN collector
    deployments dictates a design requirement of low visual cross section. Backward
    compatibility also dictates that current deployment methods and aesthetics be
    maintained. By designing the basic D-Pol array element in a compact common-aperture,
    collinear arrays can be assembled for increased gain. A number of H-Pol and D-Pol
    elements and arrays were developed for the 2.4 GHz and 900 MHz bands [13], [14].
    An example of these is shown in Figure 8. Figure 8 Common aperture dual-polarized
    omni-directional antenna w/vertical form factor Show All Design criteria dictates
    similar gains and patterns for the orthogonal pair as well as high cross polarization
    performance and isolation between the feeds. Figure 9 illustrates the measured
    pattern and gain performance of the prototype antenna shown in Figure 8. Both
    antenna feeds exhibit similar gains and identical patterns. SUN enabled APA equipment
    requires embedded antenna designs. Figure 10 shows how a residential electric
    meter can be updated to a SIMO or MIMO APA equipped transceiver. Figure 9 Co-polarized
    patterns for vertical (top) and horizontal (bottom) feeds Show All Figure 10 D-pol
    antenna embedded in an electric meter Show All 2.2 Optimal Sinr Receiver Antenna
    Combining Applying APA to the receiver of a SISO radio standard updates the standard
    to a SIMO system. The APA for receiving (APARx) adjusts the polarization of the
    receive antenna over all polarization states to maximize the signal quality on
    a per packet basis. As previously discussed, two or three receive antennas with
    nominally orthogonal polarizations can have their signal outputs combined to emulate
    a single receive antenna of any arbitrary polarization state; the problem is then
    finding the best algorithm for combining them. The best “real-time” metric for
    signal quality is SINR (“Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio”). SINR is distinguished
    from SNR in that it connotes a difference between interference and noise and how
    these quantities affect the competing antenna-combining methods. Interference
    is defined here as the portion of undesired signal that is correlated between
    the two antenna outputs. Noise is defined as the portion of the undesired signal
    that is uncorrelated between the two antenna outputs, plus the receivers'' noise
    figure. The APARx method [15] developed in this research is given the name Max-RFRx.
    Max-RFRx, performs a closed form search over a proprietary rectangular domain
    which represents all possible polarization states, maximizing a proprietary metric
    which serves as an exact proxy for estimated SINR. The search domain is a mapping
    of the entire surface of the Poincare Sphere to a proprietary rectangular 3 domain.
    The SINR proxy metric is monotonic over the search domain, in that it has no local
    maxima other than the global maximum. Max-RFRx produces the best SINR results
    compared to any of the competing combining methods evaluated, as shown in Section
    2.3. This description of the Max-RFRx implementation is based on the following
    application: The transmitting units are low-cost and lack sufficient phase stability
    to perform carrier recovery in the receiver, (e.g. battery powered On-Off-Keying
    (OOK) gas end points). Therefore, an SINR metric based on power is required. The
    following SINR estimator, in dB, is uniquely based on power: SIN R e ≈−10log[
    (ψ( P S , P P )⋅ σ( P s ) < P S > ⋅ < P P > σ( P P ) ) −1 −1] (2) View Source
    where, P S is the real-valued signal power array, over the preamble interval P
    P is the real-valued ideal preamble power array ψ is the cross correlation function,
    and σ is the standard deviation Brackets <> indicate the mean value of the array.
    SINRe is not monotonic over the polarization search domain, so the following proxy
    was developed, which is monotonic over the search domain (3). SIN R p =ψ( P s
    , P P ) σ( P S ) < P s > (3) View Source This is an “exact proxy” for SINRe, in
    that the SINRp maximum will always occur at the same domain point as the SINRe
    maximum; but SINRp is well-behaved and monotonic over the entire polarization
    search domain, whereas SINRe is not. So first SINRp is used to find the domain
    location of maximum SINRe, and then SINRe is used to calculate the maximum estimated-SINR.
    The optimal polarization solution is then used to receive the transmission. 1
    Utilizing this proxy metric, a unique closed form solution for the optimal receiver
    polarization was derived. The details of this development can be found in [10].
    The optimal solution is fast and memory efficient with no recursion. It can be
    implemented in low cost coded processors or in dedicated logic on an FPGA or ASIC
    for very high data rate systems. The computational load is similar to Maximal
    Ratio Combining. Furthermore, this method can be applied to any signal-quality
    metric of interest, provided a suitable monotonic proxy can be developed. 2.3
    Max-RfRx and Comparison to Standard Methods Packet Error Rate (PER) comparisons
    provide insight into the average performance of each combining technique. Figure
    11 compares the PER performance of the various methods for the gas meter example.
    Note that MMSE and similar methods are not included here as they require carrier
    recovery. Max-RFRx can be used to find the optimal receive polarization prior
    to carrier recovery in negative SIR environments. Figure 11 Fading & polarization
    scattering plus interference Show All In this comparison the channel characteristics
    are randomized as follows: Signal of Interest: Uncorrelated Rayleigh-distributed
    power at each antenna input, with average power as shown. Interference: AWGN,
    randomized for each packet: Interference power at each antenna is uniform −116
    to −81dBm. Polarization is approximately uniform over the Poincare sphere. *Vertical
    is defined as any linear polarization. ** Ideal Carrier Recovery for MRC. Noise
    = −111dBm each channel. Thus at 1 % PER Max-RFRx provides a 23dB improvement over
    the linearly polarized SISO solution and a 12dB average sensitivity improvement
    over ideal carrier recovery MRC in a high interference environment. These results
    will differ for each industry standard based on the modulation format, packet
    structure and accepted fading models, however, similar and significant SINR improvements
    and economic gains are expected. SECTION 3. Tx Adaptive Polarization Max-RfTx
    Consider the following case: A system with Time Division Duplex (TDD) uplink and
    downlink, with Max-RFRx implemented only at the gas meter collectors and repeaters,
    possibly for cost reasons. It is known that Max-RFRx dramatically improves the
    SINR of the uplink signal in the presence of noise and interference. However,
    can it be used to improve the SINR of the downlink signal, as received at the
    gas endpoints? The answer is yes, although the improvement is not as dramatic
    as for the uplink signals. The absence of Max-RFRx at the endpoints themselves
    does not allow for optimal rejection of forward-link channel interference, because
    the polarization of a given endpoint''s receiver is fixed. Nevertheless, Max-RFRx
    at the collector can optimize the downlink signal polarization based on algorithmic
    analysis of the uplink signal from each endpoint. This completely mitigates the
    SINR degradation due to PDL, significantly improving downlink SINR. 3.1 Optimal
    Downlink Solutions Different solutions are required for optimal uplink and downlink
    polarizations. Channel reciprocity might suggest that the Max-RFTx enabled collector
    should simply generate the same downlink polarization as the optimal receiver
    polarization derived by Max-RFRx, for a given endpoint. However, this is incorrect
    because the system is not symmetric in this scenario; i.e. Max-RFRx is implemented
    at the collector which experiences a different interference environment than the
    end point. Conceptually, the calculation of optimal downlink polarization is fairly
    simple; it should be set to the “received polarization” of the uplink signal from
    the endpoint of interest. Note that “received polarization” includes the endpoint
    transmit polarization, polarization scattering in the path, fading differences
    in vertical and horizontal signal components, etc. Thus “received polarization”
    is the actual polarization of the uplink signal at the collector antenna. However,
    there are two practical problems in setting, or precoding, the downlink polarization
    equal to the received polarization: The received polarization is not known. Recall
    that Max-RFRx generates a direct solution for optimal uplink polarization, which
    in general is not equal to the received polarization; i.e. it is not simply the
    co-polarized state. (This is primarily due to polarized interference in the channel).
    The calculation of received polarization is fairly straightforward for coherent
    systems, but not for non-coherent systems typically used in Automatic Meter Reading
    (AMR) installations. Linear polarization approximations are sometimes used, but
    are clearly not optimal and can actually result in extreme cross-polarization.
    A Max-RFTx enabled transmitter solves these problems and produces the optimal
    downlink signal for each endpoint. It does this by: Providing a fully arbitrarily-polarized
    transmitter. Providing a direct solution of the optimal downlink polarization
    for each endpoint, based on the uplink signal at the same frequency, even for
    non-coherent systems. The details of Max-RFTx can be found in [10]. SECTION 4.
    Max-RfRx Improvement for Receiver Performance Limitations With continued spectrum
    crowding and the growing use of spectrally efficient modulation formats such as
    LTE, receiver performance is becoming more critical. The high Peak to Average
    Ratio (PAR) of these modern systems threatens adjacent systems with insufficient
    out of band rejection in their receivers. For example, receiver nonlinearities
    in the presence of high AM components within the passband can result in energy
    in the Digital IF (DIF) of the receiver as shown in Figure 12. Although the received
    polarization of the interferer is modified, polarization is preserved for the
    Signal of Interest (SOI). Just as with a true co-channel interferer, Max-RFRx
    solves for the optimal rejection of the IP2 energy. Additional receiver impairments,
    such as reciprocal mixing, are mitigated in a similar way. The phase noise of
    a low cost receiver LO can mix closely spaced unwanted signals into the DIF as
    illustrated in Figure 13. The multi-port Max-RFRx enabled receiver utilizes a
    common LO thus the apparent polarization of the unwanted signal is preserved as
    is the polarization of the SOI Again Max-RFRx solves for the optimal SINR for
    the SOI as if the interferer was initially co-channel. These two examples illustrate
    how Max-RFRx can facilitate improved band and channel filtering thus reducing
    the cost and size of SISO transceivers operating in high interference environments.

    13 Receiver desense due to reciprocal mixing Show All SECTION 5. Receiver Test
    Considerations If Max-RFRx is applied to a SISO communication standard then receiver
    test methods and performance thresholds need to be redefined to capture the expected
    performance improvements. For example the Project 25 TIA-102 specification will
    require significant revision. An example performance criterion of Co-Channel Rejection
    (CCR) is considered here. 5.1 Co-Channel Rejection Co-channel rejection is the
    ratio of the reference sensitivity to the level of an unwanted co-channel signal.
    The desired signal is adjusted to 3dB above reference sensitivity. The unwanted
    signal is then increased in amplitude until the bit error rate (BER) returns to
    the same level that it was at reference sensitivity. The measurement set-up is
    shown in Figure 14. To measure co-channel rejection, the desired source (A) is
    applied to the RF combining network, modulated with the standard test tone pattern
    in the absence of the unwanted signal (B). The signal power is then reduced until
    the reference sensitivity is reached. This power level is denoted in dB asPREF.
    Next, PREF is increased by 3dB and the unwanted signal is applied to terminal
    B. Note that the modulation of signal B should be uncorrelated with signal A.
    Signal B is then increased until the standard BER is re-established. The level
    of signal B at this point is P CO , expressed in dBm. The co-channel rejection
    is now calculated in dBm by P REF − P CO . Figure 14 SISO co-channel rejection
    test Show All One of the shortcomings of this test is that it does not allow for
    the possibility that signals A and B could have different polarizations. The acceptable
    level of co-channel rejection specified in TIA-102 [16] is 9dB or less. Dual receivers
    with a Max-RFRx algorithm can dramatically improve this performance, especially
    if the angle a between the incoming signals is sufficiently large. A Polarized
    Co-Channel Rejection (PCCR) specification and test procedure is proposed. Figure
    15 shows that the co-channel rejection is 8dB when the desired signal and the
    interferer are co-polarized. As the interferer is rotated away from the signal
    of interest, the polarization angle a increases. The co-channel rejection of Max-RFRx
    improves dramatically, dropping to a PCCR of −6dB when a is 64°, which represents
    a 12dB improvement in CCR. Note that the vertical antenna, SPD algorithm, and
    the MRC algorithm, all have the same co-channel rejection under this test, since
    none of these methods properly address interference. Figure 15 Polarized co-channel
    rejection (PCCR) Show All The question now is how should the co-channel test be
    modified to allow for evaluation of a Max-RFRx system with two or more receivers?
    Currently TIA-102 does not specify such a test, but it is conceivable that the
    test configuration in Figure 16 could fully accommodate such a test. First, the
    RF fading network would need to be able to adjust the polarization angle a between
    the two input signals. Second, the combining network would need to have two outputs
    containing vertical and horizontal channel polarization information for the two
    receiver inputs. The measurement criteria, though, is not defined. From the curve
    in Figure 15 a single measurement with α= 90 ∘ may suffice as a single point measurement
    as it captures the inflection point of the performance curve for the Max-RFRx
    system and could further reduce the test setup cost. Multi-port signal generators,
    which include fading, are readily available from various test equipment manufacturers.
    Figure 16 SIMO co-channel rejection test Show All SECTION 6. Conclusions The SIMO
    implementation of adaptive polarization interference mitigation, Max-RFRx, demonstrates
    an average 23dB radio link budget improvement compared to competing antenna techniques
    in Automatic Meter Reading. The system is fully backward compatible with existing
    industry SISO standards and thus provides improved performance and cost savings
    for mission critical Public Safety and Smart Utility Networks. Max-RFRx provides
    for the implementation of polarization precoding of the reverse link Max-RFTx,
    which further improves the performance of transceiver systems which could provide
    extended life and cost savings to taxpayer and ratepayer investments in life critical
    communications systems. Future work includes the application of Max-RFRx and Max-RFTx
    to Cognitive Radio, dynamic spectrum sensing, and dynamic spectrum access. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

  description: It is now widely recognized that wireless communications systems don't
    exploit the whole available frequency band. The idea has naturally emerged to
    develop tools to better use the spectrum. Cognitive Radio (CR) is the concept
    that meets this challenge. The CR is a form of wireless communication in which
    a transmitter/receiver can detect intelligently communication channels that are
    in use and those that are not, and can move to unused channels. This optimizes
    the use of available radio frequency spectrum while minimizing interference with
    other users. CRs must have the ability to learn and adapt their wireless transmission
    according to the ambient radio environment. The application of Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) approaches in the CR is very promising because they are essential for the
    implementation of CR networks architecture. They must be able to coexist to make
    CR systems practical, which may cause interference to other users. To solve the
    problem of congestion, CR networks use Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). In order
    to deal with this problem, the idea of cooperation between users to detect and
    share spectrum without causing interferences is introduced. The authors found
    a large number of suggested works relating to spectrum access, those using Auctions,
    a large number of approaches use the Game theory, but those using Markov chains
    are fewer. However, some research has been done in this area using Multi Agent
    Systems (MAS).

    Cognitive Radio The idea of CR was officially presented by Joseph Mitola in a
    seminar at KTH, the Royal Institute of Technology in 1998, later published in
    an article by Mitola and Gerald Q. Maguire, Jr. in 1999 (Mitola J, 1999). The
    term Cognitive Radio is used to describe a system with the ability to sense and
    recognize its context of use, in order to enable it to adjust its radio operating
    parameters dynamically and autonomously and learn the results of its actions and
    its environmental setting operation. CR is a form of wireless communication in
    which a transmitter/receiver (transceiver) can detect intelligently communication
    channels which are in use and those that are not, and can move to unused channels.
    This optimizes the use of available spectrum radio frequency while minimizing
    interference with other users. The principle of CR, included in the IEEE 802.22
    and IEEE 802.16h (Grandblaise, 2006), requires an alternative spectrum management
    (i.e., a mobile called secondary may at any time access to frequency bands that
    are free, that is, not occupied by primary user (PU) of the licensed band). The
    secondary user (SU) will assign the service once completed, or once a PU has shown
    an inclination connection. Continue Reading References Abolhassani, E. M. (2011).

  description: Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) is an emerging paradigm that makes use
    of Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) to communicate opportunistically, in the un-licensed
    Industrial, Scientific and Medical bands or frequency bands otherwise licensed
    to incumbent users such as TV broadcast. The opportunistic mode of data transfer
    introduces network-wide quiet periods for spectrum sensing and increased packet
    losses due to activities by Primary Users. TCP attributes packet delays and losses
    to congestion in the Internet, which does not perform well in wireless networks
    where the medium has inherent higher error rates than wired Internet. Opportunistic
    mode of communication in CRNs aggravates the already error-prone wireless communication
    resulting in further degradation of TCP performance due to higher latency and
    decreased throughput. This paper presents an analysis of TCP performance in IEEE
    802.22 Wireless Regional Area Network (WRAN) based on Cognitive Radio Networks
    and proposes two approaches to improve the networking performance. The first approach
    makes base station resort to local recovery of lost frames between CRN base station
    and its clients, while the second approach implements a modified split TCP connection
    in which the base station sends crafted acknowledgements back to an Internet-side
    host on behalf of the corresponding CRN client to boost transmission speed. To
    the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to study TCP performance in
    IEEE 802.22 based WRANs. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanisms
    result in improvement in TCP performance by as much as 20 times and conserve bandwidth
    by reducing retransmission overheads. © 2013 IEEE.

    packet losses due to activities by Primary Users. TCP attributes packet delays
    and losses to congestion in the Internet, which does not perform well in wireless
    networks where the medium has inherent higher error rates than wired Internet.
    Opportunistic mode of communication in CRNs aggravates the already error-prone
    wireless communication resulting in further degradation of TCP performance due
    to higher latency and decreased throughput. This paper presents an analysis of
    TCP performance in IEEE 802.22 Wireless Regional Area Network (WRAN) based on
    Cognitive Radio Networks and proposes two approaches to improve the networking
    performance. The first approach makes base station resort to local recovery of
    lost frames between CRN base station and its clients, while the second approach
    implements a modified split TCP connection in which the base station sends crafted
    acknowledgements back to an Internet-side host on behalf of the corresponding
    CRN client to boost transmission speed. To the best of our knowledge, this is
    the first effort to study TCP performance in IEEE 802.22 based WRANs. Simulation
    results show that the proposed mechanisms result in improvement in TCP performance
    by as much as 20 times and conserve bandwidth by reducing retransmission overheads.

    IEEE Conference Location: Las Vegas, NV, USA SECTION I. Introduction A Cognitive
    Radio Network (CRN) comprises devices that are capable of sensing their radio
    environment and adjusting operational parameters to communicate in an efficient
    manner while avoiding any interference with the licensed users of the spectrum,
    also known as Primary users (PU). The idea of Cognitive Radio (CR) was first presented
    in [1] which envisioned a CR as a fully cognitive device capable of observing
    and adjusting to all possible radio parameters. However recent research has primarily
    been focused towards spectrum sensing and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) in the
    TV bands. Numerous studies have shown that due to the fixed nature of spectrum
    allocation, large portions of this expensive and very limited resource are being
    under-utilized. One such study in the Chicago metropolitan area [2], carried out
    between 2008 and 2010 showed that the TV bands'' average occupancy was between
    30% and 52% for the three years with overall average spectrum occupancy for 30-3000
    MHz at 14%. In view of this precious yet under-utilized spectrum resource, FCC
    announced that TV channels 5-13 in the VHF band and channels 14-51 in the UHF
    bands could now be used for broadband Internet access [3] by un-licensed or Secondary
    Users (SU). It however requires that the SUs, while making use of the spectrum,
    do not cause interference for any PU''s activities. This opportunistic manner
    of communication opened up numerous exciting challenges to the research community
    resulting in research initiatives, testbeds e.g. [4] and projects such as the
    DoD''s Joint Tactical Radio System, DARPA''s Next Generation (XG) program, IEEE
    802.11af also known as White-Fi or super Wi-Fi and IEEE 802.22 Wireless Regional
    Area network (WRAN) [5], [13]. IEEE 802.22 WRAN is a promising technology which
    is expected to see widespread deployment especially in the rural areas or areas
    lacking communications infrastructure. It is designed to operate in TV bands from
    54-862 MHz with 47 TV channels. These frequency bands allow long range communication
    from 17-30 km with a maximum range of 100 km. The network is organized in a Point-to-Multipoint
    configuration called a Cell with a fixed Base Station (BS) and up to 512 simultaneously
    associated fixed subscribers or customer premises equipment (CPE) per Cell. Majority
    of the research efforts in CRNs have been directed towards the Physical (PHY)
    and Medium Access (MAC) layers of the protocol stack while the upper layers, especially
    the transport layer, have not received that much attention. Unlike traditional
    radio technologies and protocols, much closer interaction among transport layer
    and the MAC/PHY layers is required in cognitive radio network, mainly because
    of network-wide quiet periods, opportunistic/dynamic spectrum access, and nondeterministic
    operation of PUs. These factors can have a devastating impact on the overall throughput
    and increase retransmission overheads significantly. Facing this challenge, in
    this paper we present solutions having close interaction between the transport
    and MAC/PHY layers in order to improve the communication efficiency in a CRN.
    Specifically we have made the following contributions in this paper: Carried out
    an analysis of the impact of DSA on TCP performance in the context of an IEEE
    802.22 based WRAN (simply called a WRAN from here on). Identified the factors
    that result in TCP performance degradation in a WRAN. Proposed two schemes to
    enhance TCP performance. Implemented and evaluated the proposed schemes. Figure
    1. Network Architecture used for Performance Evaluation and Proposed Solutions
    Show All The typical architecture of an IEEE 802.22 WRAN is shown in figure-1,
    which is also the basis for our proposed cross-layer solutions for TCP performance
    enhancement. In our solutions, the BS which is also the WRAN''s gateway to Internet,
    continuously monitors all TCP traffic and takes appropriate measures to mitigate
    the impact of PU activity, spectrum sensing and packet losses in the WRAN. Simulation
    results show that with our proposed schemes, significant performance gains can
    be achieved in a WRAN while hiding packet losses and delays in the cognitive radio
    link due to DSA from the sender. In this paper, the terms WRAN and CRN are used
    interchangeably since we only study WRAN that is built on cognitive radio technology.
    Rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II gives the motivation for
    our work. Section III presents the proposed solutions for TCP performance boost
    in WRANs. Some typical results from the simulation of our proposed solutions are
    given in Section IV, Section V presents related work in the transport layer for
    CRNs and Section VI concludes the paper. SECTION II. Motivation for Cross Layer
    Solutions in CRN In this section, we discuss how TCP congestion control algorithm
    and hence network''s throughput may suffer in the context of Cognitive Radio based
    WRAN. The features of a CRN that could impact TCP performance are: (i) quiet period
    duration, time that is used for spectrum sensing (ii) the amount of PU activity
    in the region of a WRAN and (iii) the accuracy of detecting PU''s presence by
    CRN. A. Quiet Period for Spectrum Sensing In order to protect the incumbent PUs
    from harmful interference, a CRN has to enforce quiet periods in the network to
    effectively sense the spectrum for its availability. The length of these quiet
    periods and spectrum sensing can vary depending on the algorithm used [11]. On
    the other hand, users in a WRAN would expect the same level of QoS (e.g. max delay
    of 20 msec in case of voice traffic) as in any other network. The IEEE 802.22
    WRAN standard therefore, employs a two-stage quiet period management scheme as
    shown in Figure 2, where the stages are fast sensing (∼9-20 μsec) and fine sensing
    ( ∼0.3-160 msec) [17]. The network is synchronized and every time slot (160 msec)
    is called a Channel Detection Time (CDT). Every CDT can have one or more fast
    sensing periods and at most one fine sensing period. However, the BS decides to
    go into fine sensing along with its duration based on the outcome of fast sensing
    periods. The fine sensing period may occupy a whole time slot. TCP uses RTT measurements
    for estimating available bandwidth and calculating a suitable Retransmission Timeout
    (RTO) interval for a particular connection, which is further used in its congestion
    control algorithm [16]. As per standard TCP Timer management [15], RTO values
    should be at least 1 sec and implementations must never be more aggressive by
    selecting smaller values. However, if smaller values of RTO are used e.g. 500
    msec in [10] or 200 msec as in [12] as well as Linux, the RTO values will become
    comparable to WRAN''s fine sensing times. In that case, whenever a packet is delayed
    in WRAN because of fine sensing duration, the source TCP will have a good chance
    to have premature timeout, erroneously attributing it to congestion and will resort
    to un-necessary retransmissions, resulting in increased overheads and decreased
    throughput. Figure 2. Two-stage spectrum sensing in IEEE 802.22 WRAN Show All
    Our simulation study presented in section IV, clearly shows the significant impact
    of CRN''s fine sensing on the performance of TCP communication. For the sake of
    this paper, we call the probability for BS to decide to conduct fine sensing in
    a CDT slot as Fine sensing Probability. The simulation results are shown in Figure
    3, which shows file transfer completion time (Y-axis) for a file size of 4 MB,
    in an FTP application at three different fine sensing probabilities and for fine
    sensing durations kept from 0 to 20% of TCP RTO interval (X-axis). As concluded
    in [12], spectrum sensing quiet periods are most debilitating for TCP performance
    in a DSA network. We believe that a transparent mechanism is therefore needed
    to monitor the interaction of TCP RTO interval and spectrum sensing quiet periods
    in the WRAN and take appropriate measures for DSA not to affect TCP congestion
    control. This would result in boosting TCP throughput while minimizing retransmission
    overheads and if possible, the end-to-end semantics of TCP connections. B. Primary
    User Activity The two-stage quiet period and spectrum sensing mechanism of IEEE
    802.22 WRAN as shown in figure-1, is intended to strike a balance in ensuring
    that the PUs are protected from harmful interference from the un-licensed use
    of their resource i.e. the spectrum, and efficient utilization of it, in the absence
    of PUs. During every time slot, called Channel Detection Time (CDT), every node
    in the WRAN (CPE) carries out fast sensing across a specified number of channels
    and reports its measurements to the BS. Based on these measurements, the BS may
    decide not to resort to fine sensing if it concludes that PU''s presence on a
    specific channel is not detected, or it may ask the CPEs to go into fine sensing
    period, if it suspects presence of a PU and needs further confirmation. Clearly,
    the two stage sensing mechanism is intended to carry out fine sensing of the spectrum
    in each CDT slot only if it is necessary, as it would result in the waste of a
    large chunk of spectrum resource, if the PU was not utilizing the spectrum. Figure
    3. Effects Fine Sensing Probability on TCP Throughput Show All As it is clear
    that the more the PU activity is observed, the WRAN will spend more of its time
    in fine sensing of the spectrum. This would result in the network quiet periods
    adversely affecting TCP RTO calculation and therefore degraded throughput. Simulations
    have confirmed that as the PU activity grows in the WRAN, nodes spend more and
    more time in spectrum sensing thereby adversely affecting TCP throughput. Figures
    4 and 5 show the performance of TCP under various packet loss rates, fine sensing
    durations and fine sensing probabilities. For this reason, a mechanism is needed
    that would monitor the level of PU activity in the WRAN and not let it affect
    TCP congestion control mechanism. C. Primary User Detection Accuracy Another factor
    that will have adverse effects on TCP performance in a CRN is the accuracy of
    PU detection scheme(s). On one hand, false alarms in detection of PU''s signal
    will result in wasted spectrum opportunities. On the other hand, if a PU is transmitting
    in a spectrum band and the CRN is unable to detect its activity, then it will
    result in harmful interference to the PU as well as packet losses for the CRN.
    If the probability of not detecting PU''s presence is high then there will be
    significant amount of packet losses in the CRN due to this false spectrum sensing.
    In a recent study, probability of PU detection in an IEEE 802.22 WRAN was found
    out to be 0.9 while the probability of a false alarm as 0.1 for all signal types
    [13]. Increase in packet loss probability will further deteriorate the already
    error prone nature of wireless communications. Therefore, a CRN must have a robust
    mechanism to recover from packet losses due to spectrum sensing errors. Figure

    of Sensing Duration on TCP Throughput Show All SECTION III. PROPOSED CROSS LAYER
    SOLUTIONS FOR PERFORMANCE BOOST IN WRAN In this section, we present the details
    of our proposed solutions for throughput boost in an IEEE 802.22 WRAN. These solutions
    are transparent because all the proposed enhancements are implemented at the WRAN
    base station (BS) and no changes are required at source or the destination of
    a TCP connection. The reasons for this choice are: (i) On one hand, BS is “controller”
    of all WRAN operations and therefore responsible for scheduling spectrum sensing
    and usage by CPEs, while on the other hand, it also is the gateway to Internet,
    as shown in figure-2. It therefore has the capability to transparently improve
    TCP throughput. (ii) Implementing enhancements at the BS only, and not at the
    sender or receiver, resolves the issue of scalability in the context of Internet,
    and facilitates smooth transition in upgrading BS incrementally. In this section,
    we first explain the network architecture and then present details of the two
    proposed solutions for enhancement of TCP performance. A. Local Loss recovery
    by Base station The first of our proposed solutions to mitigate the effects of
    increased packet losses and errors in CRN wireless medium is local loss recovery
    by the WRAN BS. Specifically, the BS continuously monitors all traffic to/from
    the host(s) in the Internet. It does so by implementing a Loss Recovery Module
    (LRM) which restricts its actions, which are transparent to both the sender and
    the receiver, within the context of WRAN only. The LRM records information regarding
    all TCP traffic traversing through it in both directions and their associated
    TCP state which includes sequence numbers and advertised window sizes as well
    as timers. The LRM restricts the number of un-acknowledged packets sent to the
    CPE, to a parameter ADV_WIN, which represents the current size of the receiver''s
    advertised window. It however, does not implement TCP congestion control mechanism
    because it has little significance within the context of the one-hop WRAN. For
    the lifetime of TCP connections, the BS maintains separate duplicate buffers used
    to maintain copies of all un-acknowledged packets of a particular TCP connection.
    Packet loss is detected if an acknowledgement ACK is not received before expiration
    of the local timer or 3 duplicate acknowledgements of a TCP packet are received.
    Duplicate copy of a lost packet is retransmitted for local recovery of the loss
    and this is repeated for a maximum of MAX_RETRY times. While any packet loss is
    recovered locally, any duplicate ACKs from the receiver are dropped at the BS.
    Values for the retransmission timers at the BS are kept at values selected to
    ensure that these are large enough so that un-necessary retransmissions are avoided
    if the ACKs are delayed due to spectrum sensing, but small enough to ensure that
    packet losses within the WRAN are recovered locally and the sender''s RTO interval
    does not expire. The main advantage of this approach is that the sender''s congestion
    control mechanism does not oscillate unnecessarily, due to losses that occur in
    the WRAN. Pseudo-code for the algorithm implemented in LRM is shown in figure-6.
    The LRM maintains duplicate copies of all TCP packets forwarded to receivers in
    the WRAN and removes the copies for which ACKs have been received and relayed
    to the sender in the Internet (lines 10, 11 and 13 of Process_ ACKS). It however
    keeps track of duplicate ACKs and if 3 duplicate ACKs are received or its local
    timer expires, it is treated as an indication of a lost packet resulting in appropriate
    packets being retransmitted out of duplicate buffer. Sending of new or duplicate
    packets is kept within the limit of advertised window size of the receiver (lines
    4,7, 9 of BS_Process). The Fast Retransmit option enables the BS to recover from
    a packet loss without the expiry of its local timer. B. Split TCP Connection Our
    second approach to boost TCP throughput for data transfers across a WRAN is to
    implement what we call a split TCP. Differences between existing split TCP mechanisms
    [19], [20], [21] and our approach are Our approach does not require modifications
    in either the source or the destination; It is specifically designed for IEEE
    802.22 WRANs; It pre-acknowledges TCP packets to shield the sender from unusually
    large spectrum sensing delays. The BS implements this scheme with a module similar
    to LRM, which Pre-Acknowledges TCP packets received at the BS, on behalf of the
    receiver in WRAN, effectively sending spoofed ACKs to the sender. This module
    is called the Pre-Acknowledgement Module (PAM). PAM maintains the state of all
    TCP connections traversing the BS, and just as the LRM, maintains a duplicate
    buffer for every TCP connection to ensure delivery of all of its packets. PAM
    also does not implement the complete TCP and its congestion control mechanism;
    however it restricts the number of packets transmitted to the receiver''s advertised
    window size along with local timers for reliable delivery. Unlike LRM, values
    for PAM''s retransmission timers are not associated with the sender''s RTO interval
    because in this case the sender''s transmissions are independent of losses or
    delays in the WRAN. Therefore, PAM''s local timers can be configured to suit the
    requirements of WRAN. Figure 6. Pseudo-code for LRM algorithm at Base Station
    Show All Algorithm of PAM is similar to LRM as shown in figure-6, with following
    exceptions: (i) whenever new packets are received at the BS from a sender in the
    Internet, an Acknowledgement is immediately sent to sender, and (ii) when an ACK
    is received from the receiver in WRAN, it is dropped and corresponding duplicate
    packets are dropped from duplicate buffer. Packet retransmissions out of duplicate
    buffer are triggered when the BS''s local timer expires or with the receipt of
    3 duplicate acknowledgements to trigger Fast Retransmission. Figure 7. Performance
    of Proposed Solutions at various Show All C. Discussion and limitations of proposed
    approaches The split TCP connection approach for boosting TCP performance uses
    spoofed acknowledgements by the BS which essentially breaks the end-to-end semantics
    of a TCP connection since a packet is acknowledged to its sender whereas it might
    not have been received by its intended receiver. This situation may not be acceptable
    to certain applications that work on the guarantees from TCP regarding actual
    delivery of a packet that is acknowledged. However, in situations where TCP RTO
    interval is comparable to fine sensing duration of the WRAN, pre-acknowledgement
    might be the only option for preventing the TCP congestion control algorithm to
    timeout repeatedly and incorrectly attributing it to congestion. On the other
    hand, local recovery of lost packets by the BS preserves end-to-end semantics
    of TCP connections and provides a throughput boost as well. Therefore, the solution
    with pre-acknowledgements by BS may be selected for applications such as file
    transfer that may not be concerned with preserving end-to-end semantics while
    local loss recovery may be selected for the rest. The main advantage of our schemes
    is that they provide throughput boost transparently i.e. without any need for
    changes in the end systems making them ideal for initial deployment of a WRAN.
    SECTION IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION Simulation Setup In this section, we evaluate
    the performance of our proposed solutions to boost TCP throughput in the context
    of a WRAN. Specifically, we consider a file transfer application in which a node
    in an IEEE 802.22 WRAN communicates with an FTP server in the Internet. We have
    developed a simulator to model a WRAN in which the BS and its associated CPEs
    resort to DSA to communicate with each other while the BS acts as gateway to Internet
    for the WRAN. Every node (CPE) in the network is equipped with a single radio
    transceiver that can be tuned to one channel at a time, however all nodes in the
    network are tuned to the same channel and the use or switching to/from a specific
    channel is controlled by the BS. The TCP module of our simulator implements slow
    start, congestion avoidance and fast retransmission schemes. However, since there
    have been various values for RTO interval for TCP implementations, we have also
    studied the impact of varying its values in our simulations. The downlink bandwidth
    from BS to CPEs is 1.5 Mbps downlink and uplink bandwidth per CPE is 384 kbps
    [13], [17]. The receiver of a TCP packet never delays an outgoing ACK for piggybacking
    i.e. it sends one ACK for every packet received. Bandwidth between the WRAN BS
    and FTP server is assumed to be 10 Mbps and file size for FTP transfer is 4 MB.
    Measurements for every data point were recorded by averaging the results of 1000
    simulation runs. Figure 8. Performance of Local Loss Recovery at various Loss
    Rates Show All Figure 9. Performance of Split TCP (Pre-ACK) at various Loss Rates
    Show All Figure-7 shows the performance of our proposed solutions in comparison
    with TCP where the figure shows TCP performance at packet loss rates of 0.5% and
    2% for the WRAN link whereas our proposed schemes were run with 10% packet loss
    rate in the WRAN. As it is evident, our proposed schemes increase the throughput
    by 20 times. Figures 8 and 9 show the performance of our proposed schemes individually
    where the simulations were run for packet loss rates from 0.5% to 10% and the
    overall file transfer times (y-axis) were recorded against varying fine sensing
    probabilities (x-axis) form 0 to 90%. The difference in performance of local loss
    recovery and pre-acknowledgement schemes can be observed because in case of local
    recovery, the sender does not send new packets unless the losses in WRAN have
    been recovered by the BS, whereas for pre-acknowledgement, the sender can send
    new packets at the full capacity of the Internet link and is not restricted due
    to losses and delays in the WRAN. In this way, losses in the WRAN have some impact
    on the overall throughput of local loss recovery mechanism but none for pre-acknowledgement
    scheme. Figures 10 and 11 show a comparison of TCP''s performance with our proposed
    solutions, at fine sensing durations 5% and 15% of TCP RTO intervals respectively,
    where the packet loss rate is kept constant at 0.2% for WRAN and 0.01 % for Internet.
    In addition to preventing the fine sensing periods to interfere with TCP RTO interval,
    our schemes provide better throughput even when there are no fine sensing periods,
    because they are also able to recover from packet losses without having the sender
    TCP being affected by them. Our proposed solutions perform up to 20 times better
    than TCP in scenarios where TCP flows suffer heavy packet losses and the sender
    has to invoke its congestion control mechanism very frequently. On the other hand,
    our solutions shield the sender from adverse effects of losses in the WRAN. When
    compared with each other, the two proposed solutions exhibit different performance
    as well. Split TCP connection with Pre-Acknowledgements has better performance
    than the local loss recovery by BS, but may be a less favorable option when it
    comes to preserving the end-to-end semantics of a TCP connection. However, we
    propose that the choice of selecting a transfer mechanism other than TCP, be negotiated
    by CPEs with the BS at the time of joining the WRAN or for specific TCP flows.
    SECTION V. Related Work Researchers have only recently started to lay down the
    requirements for CRNs [6], [7] and novel platforms e.g. [8] are being developed
    for advanced research in software defined cognitive radios. Development of transport
    layer protocols for CRNs is largely an un-explored area with a few exceptions.
    TP-CRAHN [9] is a protocol designed for use within ad hoc CRNs. It incorporates
    a cross-layer design with explicit feedback from every node between the source
    and destination nodes, regarding their sensing schedules and the length of quiet
    periods intended for detecting PUs through spectrum sensing. Its transport protocol
    also interacts with physical layer''s channel information, link layer''s buffer
    management as well as a mobility prediction framework to cater for varying parameters
    and network dynamics. TCPE [10] protocol is designed for heterogeneous networks
    involving CRNs and the wired Internet. It aims to achieve better throughput through
    available bandwidth estimation and round-trip-time (RTT) difference between successive
    TCP segments. It assumes packet delays to have been caused by spectrum sensing
    if the difference between successive RTTs is more than 90% of spectrum sensing
    duration (SSD). The study does not present any results if the source is in the
    Internet and destination node is located in a CRN, in which case the source node
    would have to know the SSD for destination node''s network, which can vary by
    technology [11]. Figure 10. Performance comparison at Fine Sensing Duration 5%
    of TCP RTO Show All Figure 11. Performance comparison at Fine Sensing Duration
    15% of TCP RTO Show All An approach similar to ours, based on local loss recovery,
    has been employed in [18], but the main difference from our approach is that the
    above scheme is designed for Cellular networks to mitigate the effects of losses
    due to high bit-errors and handoffs whereas our scheme is specifically designed
    to cater for additional packet losses and delays that occur due to DSA. Unlike
    [18], our scheme does not require the use of Explicit Congestion Notifications
    (ECN) or Negative Acknowledgements (NACK). If a sender is located in the WRAN,
    then it would be aware of spectrum sensing schedules and its associated delays
    and would therefore be able to discern packet losses or delays due to quiet periods
    from those caused due to factors other than DSA. On the other hand, if the sender
    is in the Internet and packets arrive successfully at BS but losses or delays
    occur within the WRAN due to DSA, then there is no need to use ECN or NACK with
    the sender when the loss can be recovered locally by BS. The use of ECN or NACKs
    is therefore of little use in the context of DSA which would also require modifications
    to both the source and the destination, thereby introducing the problem of scalability
    of the solution. I-TCP [19] was proposed to split a TCP connection at the BS into
    two separate connections, to alleviate TCP poor performance in wireless networks.
    It however required special devices called Mobility Support Routers in the wireless
    network and also required modification to the TCP code in mobile hosts. In [20],
    a split connection approach is proposed for ad hoc cognitive networks to mitigate
    the effects of TCP un-fairness towards nodes that are relatively farther away
    from the source node. It works by forming a chain of suitably selected nodes to
    act as TCP proxies between the source and destination of a connection, both of
    which lie within the ad hoc network. A Semi-Split TCP has been proposed in [21],
    in which a BS never pre-acknowledges a packet, rather it buffers the ACKs received
    from the receiver in cognitive network and controls the amount of ACKs relayed
    back to the sender in order to throttle the sender and to prevent the BS''s buffers
    from starvation. Performance analysis of various flavors of TCP in DSA links is
    presented in [12]. The study concludes that the most dominant factor in TCP throughput
    reduction is spectrum sensing duration and not the PU detection errors. SECTION
    VI. CONCLUSION In this paper we have shown that TCP performance is affected adversely
    due to PU activity in a WRAN, DSA by the un-licensed users and associated quiet
    periods that can be comparable with RTO interval of the sender''s TCP, a scenario
    which can trigger TCP''s congestion control mechanism un-necessarily and fruitlessly.
    We have shown that our solutions transparently remedy this situation by coping
    well with packet losses that are inherent to the wireless medium as well as resulting
    from inaccuracies in detection of PUs and network-wide quiet periods for spectrum
    sensing. To the best of our knowledge, there is however, no work that analyses
    TCP performance in the context of an IEEE 802.22 WRAN, or proposes solutions that
    would result in throughput boost for these networks. Currently we are investigating
    the impact of DSA in a multi-hop cognitive radio network such as IEEE 802.11af.

    Location: Las Vegas, NV, USA SECTION I. Introduction It is a known fact that spectrum
    is a scarce resource and it must be used efficiently and effectively. This means
    the unused (overlay) and under used (underlay) spectrum must be used efficiently
    and at the same time it must generate more finance. These are two different approaches
    (overlay and underlay) targeted together for better use of existing spectrum.
    The concept of cognitive radio (CR) enters automatically with overlay and underlay
    (uses ultra wide band) because they are unused and underused spectrum layers by
    primary user. The game models helps for the opportunistic access of unused and
    under user spectrum by the secondary users. The spectrum underlay functions are
    below the noise level of primary users and similar to spread spectrum techniques
    (SST). The underlay technique is efficient use of underutilized spectrum. In this
    approach (underlay spectrum use) the secondary users can achieve high data rating,
    low power with extremely low transmission power. Overlay technique is opportunistic
    spectrum access or use of spectrum holes (identify and instantaneous use of spectrum).
    The concepts and more explanations are found in [1]–[3], [19], [20]. Dynamic spectrum
    access (DSA) is the sharing of existing spectrum by unlicensed users (secondary
    or cognitive users) with licensed users (primary users) without interference to
    the licensed users. Sharing of spectrum requires following certain rules and policies.
    Spectrum sharing rules and protocols that allow the bandwidth to share is discussed
    in [4]. The important point is the amount of information that the secondary systems
    or cognitive systems need to know to use the unused spectrum. The information
    includes the current state of other cognitive users accessing same resource, unutilized
    and underutilized spectrum. There are many models developed including efficient
    channel utilization, channel modeling, and allocation of resources for underlay
    techniques [9]–[11]. Recently, the concentration increased to design better and
    efficient models for overlay and underlay techniques. The developments include
    game models for spectrum sharing which produces encouraging results and moves
    new direction in research [8]–[11]. The researchers introduced the role of games
    and game models for efficient use of spectrum. Non-cooperative and congestion
    game models are more suitable to the overlay and underlay spectrum usage. Some
    of the game models presently trying to apply for overlay and underlay spectrum
    are zero sum games, nonzero sum games, potential games, cooperative games, non-cooperative
    games, and congestion games. The behavior and stability of game models is measured
    through Nash equilibrium. The fundamental is that the players must reach Nash
    equilibrium to provide stable condition. Some of the models are discussed below:
    The zero sum game is played between two players. The net result of two players
    that equals zero means that the gain of one player equates the loss of another
    player. Zero sum game is not useful in the current problem because we have to
    utilize available spectrum efficiently. There is no loss involved. The non-zero
    sum game model can be used in overlay spectrum utilization because if one or more
    of the players (cognitive users) cooperate then some or all of the players will
    be benefited. The cooperation of primary user with secondary users may not be
    possible but the cooperation of secondary users will help to benefit most of the
    secondary users to use spectrum efficiently. The potential function (game model)
    is a useful tool to analyze equilibrium properties of games since the incentive
    of all players are mapped into single function. In finite potential games [12],
    [13], the change in any player''s payoffs from a unilateral deviation is exactly
    matched by a change in potential which concludes that the Nash equilibrium is
    a local maxima. In ordinal potential games only the signs of the differences have
    to be the same. If we treat the total incentive as utilizing unused spectrum,
    we may use the potential games to find the unused spectrum and make it available
    to the cognitive users. In cooperative games the players stay close together for
    the overall benefit of all players. In noncooperative games each player makes
    independent decisions and any cooperation is self enforcing. The cooperative game
    may be useful in the current problem of efficient utilization of spectrum. Congestion
    games [15], [16] are a class of noncooperative games where players share a common
    set of strategies. The utility of a player from using a certain resource depends
    on the total number of players that are using the same resource. That is the resulting
    payoff is a function of the number of active users (congestion). In this paper
    we use the congestion game model for better utilization of the unutilized spectrum
    by cognitive users. The remaining sections of the paper discusses the recent developments
    related to spectrum overlay and underlay, problem formulation for maximum utilization
    of spectrum resource (capacity), congestion game model for opportunistic spectrum
    access and conclusions. SECTION II. Recent Developments The detailed analysis
    of “evaluation of overlay/underlay waveform via soft decision spectrally modulated,
    spectrally encoded (SD-SMSE) framework for enhancing spectrum efficiency” is available
    in [14]. The thesis discusses the techniques for overlay/underlay and efficient
    use of spectrum. In [7] sensor net with CR is used to use the spectrum in underlay
    mode. The Hidden Markov Model is used to predict the interference at primary user
    so that the secondary user can benefit better. A similar resource allocation in
    underlay mode is discussed in [6]. The authors in [6] proposed the admission control
    algorithm for underlay in code division multiple accesses (CDMA) for better quality
    of service with minimum interference. Xie [17] discussed the overlay cognitive
    radio market model. In this model the primary user imposes the spectral mask so
    that the secondary user gets better spectrum use opportunities. Furthermore, for
    efficient usage of unused spectrum, the primary user uses the economics competition
    for purchase of power allocation on each channel. The model uses the market equilibrium
    while controlling the interferences. Wu et al [18] discussed the auction-based
    dynamic spectrum allocation to lease the spectrum by secondary users. They proposed
    a mechanism called multi-winner spectrum auction with collusion resistant pricing
    strategy to allocate the spectrum optimally. The greedy algorithm helps to reduce
    the complexity in multi-band auctions. The game models for spectrum sharing and
    controlled interference is studied by Nie [5], ji [8], Halldorsson [9], and Liu
    [10]. Nie et al [5] formulated the channel allocation as potential game and showed
    the improvement of overall network performance. Ji [8] discussed the dynamic spectrum
    sharing through game theory approach and discussed the analysis of network, user''s
    behavior, and optimal analysis of the spectrum unused allocation. Halldorsson
    [9] viewed channel assignment as a game and provide the price anarchy depending
    upon the assumptions on the underlying network. Finally, Liu [10] used congestion
    game model for spectrum sharing and base station channel adaptation. In this paper,
    we study the congestion game model for spectrum sharing without interfering with
    primary users. SECTION III. Problem Formulation To transmit the information on
    a data channel the information rate R must be less than or equal to the channel
    capacity C (R≤C) [21]. If R > C, the errors cannot be avoided. In a brand limited
    channel operating in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), the
    Shannon''s channel capacity is given by C=B  log 2 (1+S/N) (1) View Source Where
    C is the capacity in bits per second, B is the band width of the channel in Hertz,
    and S/N is the signal-to-noise ratio. As the bandwidth increases the noise power
    also increases and N can be written as: N=ηB , where noise power spectral density
    is η/2 . The equation (1) becomes C=B log 2 (1+S/(ηB))  C= S η log 2 (1+ s ηB
    ) ηB/S (2) (3) View Source But Li m ηB s →∞ (1∞⊢ s ηB ) ηB/S =e {e is usually
    defined by:e= lim n→∞ (1 + 1 n ) n } View Source The equation (3) becomes C= S
    η log 2 e (4) View Source In equation (3), if we represent the spectral density
    in terms of noise temperature then C will be independent of bandwidth as in equation
    (4) and maximum transmission is possible. This information is subject to the condition
    and is related to any channel, but we need to find the unused and under used bandwidth
    utilization. To use the total capacity of the band (not unlimited use), we must
    include primary users, cognitive users, and users that use ultra wide band. Therefore,
    the total capacity of the transmission occupied by primary users, cognitive users,
    and underlay spectrum users is C=B  log 2 (1+ φu.Bpu+φu.Bsu+μud.Bud N 0 B+ϕd.Bsd
    ) (5) View Source where φpu is the spectral density of primary user and Bpu is
    the corresponding band width φsu is the spectral density of cognitive (secondary)
    user (overlay) and Bsu is the corresponding band width φud is the spectral density
    of underlay user and Bud is the corresponding band width N 0 is the noise for
    power spectrum density AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) ϕsd is the average
    spectrum density and Bsd is the corresponding band width Since we are considering
    the effect of interference temperature on primary signals, we ignore the overlay
    part in the equation (5). Therefore, equation (5) can be written as: C=B  log
    2 (1+ φρu.Bpu+φud.Bud N 0 B+ϕd.Bsd ) (6) View Source We calculate the total channel
    capacity C T of the primary users without any significant interference from underlay
    users (assuming the underlay users are active) as: C T =B log 2 2 C T /B −1 (
    2 C T /B −1). (1+ ∑ k=1 N φ u k Bp u k + ∑ i=1 M φu d i Bu d i N 0 B+ ∑ i=1 M
    ϕ d i Bs d i ) = ∑ k=1 N (φp u k Bp u k + ∑ i=1 N φu d i Bu d i N 0 B+ ∑ i=1 M
    ϕ d i Bs d i ( N 0 B+ ∑ i=1 M ϕ d i Bs d i ) = ∑ k=1 N φP u k Bp u k + ∑ i=1 M
    φu d i Bu d i (7) View Source ( 2 C T /B −1).( N 0 B+ ∑ i=1 M ϕ d j Bs d j )−
    ∑ i=1 M φu d i Bu d i = ∑ k=1 N φ u k Bp u k (8) View Source The primary signal
    will not be disturbed as long as the LHS is positive. That is ( 2 C T /B −1).(
    N 0 B+ ∑ i=1 M ϕ d i Bs d i )− ∑ i=1 M φ 4 d i Bu d i > 0 i.e . ( 2 C T /B −1).(
    N 0 B+ ∑ i=1 M ϕs d i Bs d i )> ∑ i=1 M φu d i Bu d i (9) View Source Therefore
    the maximum band width utilized by underlay user without disturbing the primary
    users is ( 2 C T /B −1).( N 0 B+ ∑ i=1 M ϕs d i Bs d i ) (10) View Source But
    we calculate the interference temperature by multiplying the average spectrum
    density and corresponding bandwidth [22], [23] T I ( f c′ B)= P I ( f c ,B) kB
    (11) View Source where k is 1.38*10−23, Joules per Kelvin degree. PI is the average
    interference power in Watts centered at fc. Using equations (10) and (11) the
    maximum band width occupied by the secondary user is B=( 2 C T /B −1).( N 0 B+
    P I ( f c ,B) kB ) B=B{( 2 C T /B −1).( N 0 + P I ( f c ,B) k B 2 ) (12) View
    Source The power required for underlay user to occupy maximum bandwidth without
    interference to a primary user is ( 1 ( 2 C T /B −1) − N 0 )×k B 2 = P I ( f c
    ,B) (13) View Source But the maximum transit power required by the secondary user
    at each bandwidth is [22] ( 1 ( 2 C T /B −1) − N 0 )×kB= Bk Θ ( T L ( f c )− T
    l ( f c ,B)) ( 1 ( 2 C T /B −1) − N 0 )Θ= T L ( f c )− T I ( f c ,B) (14) (15)
    View Source Θ is the loss factor, T I is the interference temperature, and T L
    is the maximum tolerable interference. Therefore ( 1 ( 2 c T /B −1) − N 0 ) Θ
    >0 , View Source since Θ greater than 0, then ( 1 ( 2 C T /B −1) − N 0 )= λ Θ
    + N 0 View Source where λ is a constant and >0 Therefore, 1 ( 2 C T /B −1) = N
    0 + λ Θ >0 (16) View Source Equation (16) concludes that C T =B loge N 0 + λ Θ
    =Bβ (17) View Source That is, we must maintain the value β>1 , then the spectrum
    capacity will be under control and β is β= loge N 0 + λ Θ View Source The above
    spectrum sharing problem is to determine power allocations (spectrum density multiply
    by corresponding band width) to secondary users which satisfy the power constraint
    utility function. The β value depends upon the λ(<1),Θ (> 1 and <2) and N 0 (10E-10)
    the noise. The figure 1 shows that the capacity or data transfer is low at low
    noise. High data transfer rate is possible by increasing the noise ans band. Figure
    2 shows the capacity calculation with very high noise. From Figure 1 and Figure
    2 we observe that after adjusting the noise to certain level, capacity or transfer
    of data reaches uniform level. If the band width is zero then there is no data
    transfer irrespective of noise level. Figure 1: Capacity as function of noise

    SECTION IV. Game Models The current problem is an efficient use of unused spectrum
    by the secondary users (with selfish nature) that results the potential utilization
    of the scarce resource spectrum. Since the efficient utilization of unused spectrum
    by each selfish user effects global utilization, we can design this problem as
    a congestion game and potential utilization as the utility function. Any change
    in the local utilization of the resource reflects the global activity (utility
    function). The congestion game is a non-cooperative game where players (cognitive
    users) share a common set of strategies (unused spectrum utilization). The payoff
    of a particular player depends upon the number of players (cognitive users) playing
    with the same strategy. The spectrum will be utilized opportunistically by the
    cognitive (secondary) users (CU) at different times. Our main aim is to maximize
    the utilization of the spectrum by the cognitive users without interfering with
    primary users. Let N be the CUs and R be the resource or unused spectrum available
    to CUs. Each user uses a strategy S to get a resource R resulting in a payoff
    U (the utility function). The game G is represented as G=(N,R,S,U) View Source
    where, N= n 1 , n 2 ,⋯⋅⋅, n n the set of users R= r 1 , r 2 ,⋯⋅⋅, r n the set
    of resources S= s 1 , s 2 ,⋯⋅⋅, s r the set of strategies Used by each user to
    get a resource and resulting to payoff U. U= u 1 , u 2 ,⋯⋅⋅, u n the set of utilities
    The payoff is a resulting value of all users N using resources R. The total payoff
    of user i using strategy si is given by u i ( s i )= ∑ r∈ s i U( N r ( s i ))
    (18) View Source where N r (.) is the total number of users using resource r under
    the strategy s If the players share the same set of strategies then the utility
    function is given by U(s)= ∑ K=1 r ∑ m=1 n i S k (m) (19) View Source If any ith
    player shifts to new strategy j then the potential is changed by ΔU= S j ( n j
    +1)− S s i ( n s i ) (20) View Source where s s i ( n s i )≥ S ij ( n j +1) and
    S s i is the strategy tuple of a user selected that particular strategy. This
    is the gain or loss of ith player. If we have reached local maxima and any strategy
    tuple of changing one coordinate will not change the potential function U which
    corresponds to Nash Equilibrium. Let equation (15) the difference between average
    temperature and Interference temperature by secondary users is T L ( f c )− T
    I ( f c ,B)=( 1 ( 2 C T /B −1) − N 0 )Θ (21) View Source Let ΔU be the change
    in interference by any ith player shifts to new strategy, then using equations
    (20) and (21) we obtain ΔU=( 1 ( 2 c T /B −1) − N 0 )Θ ΔU Θ + N 0 = 1 ( 2 c T
    /B −1) 1 ( 2 c T /B −1) = ΔU Θ + N 0 2 c T /B =1+ 1 ΔU Θ + N 0 C T =B log(1+ 1
    ΔU Θ + N 0 ) C T = B ΔU Θ + N 0 loge (22) (23) View Source From equations (17)
    and (23) we get log e N 0 + λ Θ B= B ΛU Θ + N 0 log e (24) View Source That is
    N 0 + λ Θ = N 0 + ΔU Θ It results to λ =ΛU (25) (26) View Source The equation
    (26) shows that shift in new strategy is a small value and > 0 and will not produce
    any significant interference to the primary user while cognitive user is in operation
    under the above constraints. Further, it shows the game model works equally good
    for shifts in new strategy with small change from current strategy. The Figure
    3 is drawn for the equation (23) to show the capacity variation for game model.
    Capacity is uniform after certain noise level but achieves better capacity with
    the same noise level. So, game model achieves the capacity with same level of
    noise as non-game model. The ΔU value is small and its increment is also small
    (0.05) Compare the Figure 3 with Figure 1, the game model performs better and
    higher data rate is possible with same bandwidth. Figure 3: Game model: Capacity
    as a function of Noise Show All SECTION V. Conclusions The model for underlay
    cognitive users (unused spectrum used by cognitive users) without having interference
    with primary users is discussed in this paper. In the current research the relation
    between capacity, noise, and bandwidth was developed using the temperature interference
    formula. The capacity and bandwidth model was designed using the congestion model
    and was compared with the temperature interference model. The results show that
    a shift in strategy using congestion model will not disturb the primary user (do
    not produce significant amount of interference) in the presence of a cognitive
    user and improves the performance. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research work was supported

    Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction Spectrum crowding will continue to increase
    as the demand for higher data rates grows and the number of wireless applications
    and users increases. From an assigned spectrum perspective, a cursory glance at
    the FCC''s spectrum allocation chart can lead one to believe that spectrum is
    scarce [1]. However, recent studies suggest that spectrum congestion is mainly
    due to inefficient spectrum usage rather than spectrum scarcity [2]. Two techniques
    are being considered within the research community to address improved spectrum
    efficiency, including Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and Cognitive Radio (CR).
    DSA approaches can be broadly categorized as being based on one of three models,
    including 1) dynamic exclusive use, 2) open sharing (spectrum commons) or 3) hierarchical
    access [3], [4]. The dynamic exclusive model basically follows present policy
    and governing regulations. Spectrum property rights and dynamic spectrum allocation
    are two methods within this model that add flexibility for spectrum efficiency.
    Under spectrum property rights, a primary user (licensee) is allowed to sell and/or
    trade spectrum and can dictate the employed technology. As introduced under the
    European DRIVE project, the goal of dynamic spectrum allocation is to improve
    spectrum efficiency via dynamic spectrum assignment utilizing spatial and temporal
    statistics of various users. The open sharing model, which is also known as spectrum
    commons, employs sharing among peers as the basis to manage spectral regions.
    This model basically gains support from the success of wireless services operating
    in the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) frequency band. Finally,
    under the hierarchial access model interactions between primary and secondary
    users are considered to achieve spectrum efficiency. The basic idea here is to
    open up the licensed spectrum to secondary users while inducing minimum acceptable
    interference into the primary users. Spectrum overlay and spectrum underlay are
    two approaches commonly considered to accomplish this. Spectrum overlay allows
    unlicensed secondary users to utilize unused spectrum simultaneously with primary
    users on a non-interference basis. This overlay approach was first adapted by
    [5] and subsequently researched under DARPA''s Next Generation (XG) program as
    an “opportunistic spectrum access” approach. Similarly, spectrum underlay allows
    unlicensed secondary users to simultaneously operate in primary user bands but
    under strict transmit power constraints. Of all spectrum access models presented,
    the hierarchical access model is perhaps the most compatible with current FCC
    policies and legacy wireless systems. As proposed in [2], [6], CR technology fits
    within the hierarchial access method. Even though the present CR definition only
    considers overlay approaches, the research trend suggests that a hybrid technique
    combining overlay/underlay concepts can be employed to maximize spectral efficiency
    by using both white and gray spectral regions [3], [7]. Therefore, CR techniques
    can be further categorized as being either overlay-CR or underlay-CR depending
    on the spectral region being used. The choice of physical layer transmission is
    very important in CR implementation. Parameters influencing CR physical layer
    waveform design includes power, frequency, modulation, symbol rate, pulse or spectrum
    shaping and coding to name a few. Multi-carrier modulations such as OFDM and MC-CDMA
    are hailed as promising candidates [8]–[11] for realizing CR applications. The
    work in [9] adopted OFDM modulation for implementing a proposed spectrum spooling
    method to enhance spectrum efficiency. The goal of spectrum spooling is to enhance
    spectral efficiency of mobile radio systems by overlaying secondary mobile radio
    systems. A variant of the OFDM scheme in which arbitrarily selected subcarriers
    are disabled or de-activated to avoid interference to the primary user bands is
    termed as discontiguous or non-contiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
    (NC-OFDM, i.e., non-contiguous OFDM). Work in [12], [13] has proposed and implemented
    a hardware prototype demonstrating the NC-OFDM concept, while work in [14]–[16]
    has considered other physical layer parameters in NC-OFDM such as power, modulation
    and coding to optimize the CR physical layer. While a majority of early research
    focused on OFDM multi-carrier modulation as a suitable candidate for CR applications,
    basic OFDM is generally not utilized in practical applications due to its performance
    degradation in frequency selective fading [17]. Furthermore, the basic OFDM technique
    is more suitable for broadcast only type scenarios such as cellular down links
    or digital audio broadcast applications [16]. To address these problems and help
    satisfy high data rate requirements, while improving spectrum efficiency and avoiding
    interference to primary and other secondary users, other multi-carrier modulations
    such as MC-CDMA [18], CI/MC-CDMA [19], [20] and TDCS [21] have been proposed as
    possible CR candidate waveforms [22]–[26]. Software defined radio (SDR) is another
    promising DSA enabling technology where the radio transceivers perform baseband
    processing in software. SDR has the ability to quickly reconfigure its operating
    parameters, which is a fundamental requirement in the CR scenarios. The synergistic
    union of these two DSA technologies is termed “CR-based SDR”. That is, the SDR
    provides the software controlled communication vehicle (core technology for air
    interface and waveform generation), the control and application of which is based
    on CR principles guided by spectral monitoring to achieve efficient spectrum usage
    [27]. Driven by SDR principles, a general analytic framework was developed to
    encompass a myriad of multi-carrier signals. The framework is applicable to a
    broad class that is called Spectrally Modulated, Spectrally Encoded (SMSE) signals
    [27]–[29]. Depending on CR user needs, various multi-carrier waveforms can be
    generated using this framework, e.g., OFDM, MC-CDMA, CI/MC-CDMA and TDCS. Since
    this original SMSE framework employed hard decision frequency allocation, its
    applicability is limited to overlay-CR signals. To extend its applicability and
    maximize spectrum efficiency by utilizing both unused and underused regions, a
    soft decision SMSE (SD-SMSE) framework was subsequently developed to realize overlay-CR,
    underlay-CR and hybrid overlay/underlay CR signals [30]. This paper expands upon
    previous work and presents a novel multi-function SD-SMSE framework that exploits
    both unused and underused spectrum to maximize CR spectrum efficiency. It is shown
    that the proposed SD-SMSE framework can be utilized to support current cognitive
    radio waveforms, including overlay-CR, underlay-CR, and novel hybrid overlay/underlay
    CR technique that exploits both unused spectrum holes (white space) and underused
    spectrum bands (gray space) to improve the performance and CR spectrum efficiency.
    More specifically, the proposed hybrid technique employs systematic channel coding
    whereby information bits are transmitted using an overlay waveform over unused
    spectrum holes and redundant parity check bits are transmitted using an underlay
    waveform over underused spectrum bands. This novel hybrid scheme significantly
    improves BER performance of the current cognitive radio scheme. Analytic BER performance
    evaluation of both overlay-CR and underlay-CR waveforms is derived. Simulation
    results for an AWGN channel are provided to demonstrate and validate performance
    enhancement of the hybrid overlay/underlay cognitive radio system. The remainder
    of this paper presents a brief overview of the SMSE framework followed by a more
    detailed description of the extended SD-SMSE framework and its components. The
    design of overlay-CR, underlay-CR and hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms that are
    suitable for a “CR-based SDR” platform are then presented. Next, analytic expressions
    for BER performance of cognitive radio centric waveforms are presented. Finally,
    each of the three waveform designs are evaluated via simulation in the context
    of CR applicability. SECTION II. SMSE Overlay Framework Previous work provides
    a general analytic framework for SMSE signals that accommodates multi-carrier,
    CR-based waveforms [27]. Specifically, an arbitrary CR waveform can be expressed
    in terms of its amplitude ( A ), phase (Θ) and frequency ( F ) characteristics.
    These three factors aid in SMSE waveform design through six design variables,
    namely Data modulation ( d ), Code ( c ), Window ( w ), Orthogonality ( o ) and
    two frequency allocation variables. An in-depth treatment of the SMSE analytic
    development and the family of SMSE waveforms is provided in [17], [27]. Considering
    N f total frequency components, the coding c=[ c 1 , c 2 ,…, c N f ], c i ∈C data
    modulation, d=[ d 1 , d 2 ,…, d N f ], d i ∈C , and windowing, w=[ w 1 , w 2 ,…,
    w N f ], w i ∈C vectors account for component-by-component amplitude and/or phase
    variations. A phase only =[ o 1 , o 2 ,…, o N f ], o i ∈C is used for orthogonality
    between symbol streams and facilitate multiple access. The analytic SMSE framework
    development begins by considering data, code and window variables. The m th frequency
    component of the k th symbol is given by S k [m]= c m d m,k w m e j( θ d m,k +
    θ c m + θ w m ) , (1) View Source where m=0,1,…, N F −1 is the frequency index
    and c m , d m are magnitude and phase design variables. The expression in (1)
    is next modified to incorporate frequency and orthogonality variables. Frequency
    component selection is a function of two factors, including an available variable
    a=[ a 1 , a 2 ,…, a N f ], a i ∈{0,1} and a use variable u=[ u 1 , u 2 ,…, u N
    f ], u i ∈{0,1} . Given an N f -point fast Fourier transform (FFT) process, N
    f frequency components or spectral bands are available for waveform design. It
    is important to note that the frequency assignment variable takes on binary values
    0 or 1 indicating the spectrum availability for secondary users. As a direct result,
    this pool of frequencies is reduced by component selection to create a number
    of CR available frequencies and usable frequencies. The m th component of the
    k th CR symbol corresponds to S k [m]= a m u m c m d m,k w m e j( θ d m,k + θ
    c m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) , (2) View Source where the product a i u i ∈{0,1} . The
    discrete time domain SMSE waveform is obtained by taking the Inverse Discrete
    Fourier Transform (IDFT) of (2) according to s k [n] = 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1
    a m u m c m d m,k w m e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) }, (3)
    View Source where t k ≤ t n ≤ t k +T, f m = f c +mΔf,T is the symbol duration
    and Δf=1/T is the frequency resolution [27]. A. OFDM via SMSE Analytic Expression
    The OFDM transmission analytic expression can be derived from the SMSE framework
    by setting variables u i = a i , w i =1 , and θ w i =0 ∀ i : S k [m]= { a m d
    m,k e −j( θ d m,k ) } N f −1 m=0 , (4) View Source Substituting for d i ∈C, d
    m,k e −j θ d m,k =( α m,k +j β m,k ) yields to (5). α m,k and β m,k depend on
    the data modulation being used, e.g., α m,k , β m,k ∈{±1} for QPSK and α m,k ,
    β m,k ∈{±1,±3} for 16-QAM. Finally, applying an IFFT to (5) results in the discrete
    time domain OFDM expression given in (6) [28]. s k [n]= S k [m]={( α m,k +j β
    m,k ) } N f −1 m=0 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 ( α m,k +j β m,k ) e j(2π f m t n )
    } (5) (6) View Source B. MC-CDMA via SMSE Analytic Expression The MC-CDMA analytic
    expression can be derived from the SMSE framework by setting the variables w i
    =1 , θ w i =0 ∀ i, θ o i =0 ∀ i , and the data variable only depends upon k because
    of the spectral spreading: S k [m]= { a m u m c m d k e −j[ θ c m + θ d k ] }
    N f −1 m=0 . (7) View Source Spectral spreading is accomplished using a random
    application of phases, 0 or π , such that c i =1 and θ c i ∈{0,π} ∀ i . For a
    m u m =1 , this further simplifies equation (7) to S k [m]= { d k e −j[ θ c m
    + θ d k ] } N f −1 m=0 . (8) View Source For complex data modulation d k e −j
    θ d k ( α k +j β k ) , (8) can be rewritten as S k [m]= {( α k +j β k ) e −j[
    θ c m ] } N f −1 m=0 , (9) View Source where α k and β k depend on the modulation
    type being employed. After an IFFT operation on (9), the discrete transmitted
    MC-CDMA signal is given by s k [n]= 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 ( α k +j β k ) e j(2π
    f m t n + θ c m ) }. (10) View Source SECTION III. Extended Overlay/Underlay SD-SMSE
    Framework The SMSE framework provides a unified expression for generating and
    implementing a host of multi-carrier type waveforms (e.g., OFDM, MC-CDMA, CI/OFDM,
    TDCS, etc) and satisfies current CR goals of exploiting unused spectral bands.
    However, it does not exploit underused spectrum. This section re-visits the original
    SMSE framework development and the frequency assignment variables to exploit both
    unused and underused spectrum to generate both overlay-CR and underlay-CR type
    waveforms. Figure 1 illustrates a conceptual view of the unused and underused
    spectrum utilization using an arbitrary interference threshold (IT). IT is assumed
    to be a limit set forth by the primary users based on the measured power spectrum
    density in a given bandwidth. Two cases of under utilized spectrum are demonstrated:
    1) when the spectral assignment is based on a binary decision the bands adjacent
    to the primary users are unavailable to overlay-CR users and 2) primary users
    bands below the IT are unavailable to CR users as well. A soft decision CR (SDCR)
    will be able to exploit these underused frequency bands to improve spectral efficiency
    and increase channel capacity. To support the envisioned SDCR system, the original
    SMSE framework is extended to account for both unused and underused frequency
    bands. Fig. 1. Identification of primary users, unused and underused spectral
    region Show All The proposed SD-SMSE framework is first illustrated using Fig.
    2 and Fig. 3, then the design variables are re-defined to extend the SMSE expression
    to account for both unused and underused spectrum. Figure 2a and Fig. 2b show
    how the current CR framework identifies the used and unused spectrum based on
    binary decisions. Figure 2c shows the weighted spectrum estimation resulted from
    spectrum sensing block in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, I T represents the interference threshold,
    P U and S U are the accumulated signal strengths from all the primary users and
    all the secondary users respectively, and N represents the total observed noise.
    The weighted spectrum estimate (WSE) ( a ) is further processed taking into account
    inputs from the IT estimator, primary users, other secondary users requirements
    and channel conditions. Specifically, the weighted spectrum estimate provides
    a metric of the allowable transmission power density at each and every frequency
    component in the entire bandwidth. Hence, the WSE divides the entire bandwidth
    into unused ( u ) and underused ( b ) frequency components and both the unused
    and underused spectrum can be exploited. Notice in Fig. 2 that different underused
    frequency components have different allowable CR transmission power densities.
    It is envisioned that a CR-based SDR will have the option to choose an overlay-CR,
    underlay-CR or hybrid overlay/underlay waveform to improve performance based on
    the scenario, situation and need. Fig. 2. Spectrum parsing using weighted spectrum
    estimation in realization of SD-SMSE waveform. Show All Fig. 3. Block diagram
    representation of SD-SMSE framework [30]. Show All The first step in SD-SMSE framework
    development is to reexamine the design variables in the original SMSE framework.
    For the SD-SMSE development, frequency related factors are termed primary variables
    while amplitude and phase related factors are termed secondary variables. Since
    the objective here is to optimize the spectrum usage, only frequency components
    related design variables are considered. From this point forward the SD-SMSE framework
    development is based on the scenario depicted in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2c,
    the weighted spectrum estimate represents all frequency components which can be
    utilized for secondary user applications. It is represented by variable a with
    the range changed from binary values (hard decision) to real values (soft decision),
    i.e., a=[ a 0 , a 1 ,…, a N f −1 ],0≤ a m ≤1. (11) View Source From the weighted
    spectrum estimate a , the unused spectrum vector u can be derived as u=[ u 0 ,
    u 1 ,…, u N f −1 ], (12) View Source where, u m ={ 1 0 if a m =1 else m=0,1,⋯
    N f −1 (13) View Source The original SMSE hard decision CR design transmits over
    the unused spectrum specified by u . Now introducing a new design variable b to
    account for the underused spectrum, b=[ b 0 , b 1 ,…, b N f −1 ], (14) View Source
    where, b m ={ 0 a m a m =1 a m ≠1 (15) View Source for m=0,1,⋯, N f −1 . Note
    that when a m =1 the value of b m =0 . This is because when a m =1 the spectral
    component is being unused and accounted for in the assignment of u m , It is obvious
    that if one frequency component is underused it cannot also be counted as unused
    and vice versa, i.e., u m =0 if b m >0 and b m =0 if u m =1 . The remaining waveform
    design variables, i.e., code ( c ), data ( d ), window ( w ) and orthogonality
    ( o ), remain unchanged from the original SMSE framework. Applying all these design
    variables, the m th component of the k th data symbol of the SD-SMSE can be expressed
    as S k [m]= a m c m d m,k w m e j( θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m θ o m,k ) ={ u m c
    m d m,k w m e j( θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m θ o m,k ) b m c m d m,k w m e j( θ d
    m,k + θ c m + θ w m θ o m,k ) a m =1 a m ≠1 (16) View Source The expression in
    (16) can be decomposed into unused and underused SMSE waveform representing the
    new SDCR architecture shown in Fig. 3. Applying the IDFT to (16) results in the
    discrete time domain waveform given by: s k [n]= 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 a m c
    m d m,k w m e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) } s k [n]= 1 N
    f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 u m c m d m,k w m e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m
    +θ o m,k ) } + 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 b m c m d m,k w m e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k
    + θ c m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) } (17) (18) View Source where the first summation in
    (18) represents the unused frequency components and the second summation accounts
    for underused frequency components. The SMSE expression in (17) was demonstrated
    by applying it to a number of OFDM based multi-carrier signals [27]–[29]. The
    process of generating these waveforms can be viewed as a two step approach 1)
    generating the frequency related primary variables and 2) applying the secondary
    variables such as the code code, data modulation, windowing and orthogonality
    to the frequency vector. Since the SD-SMSE only focused on manipulating the primary
    variables, all the OFDM based multi-carrier modulations expression such as NC-OFDM,
    NC-MC-CDMA, NC-CI/MC-CDMA and NCTDCS are applicable to both overlay-CR and underlay-CR
    scenarios. A. SD-SMSE Overlay Waveform Current CR techniques commonly employ an
    overlay waveform to exploit unused spectral bands and thus represent a special
    case (subset) of soft decision CR with no underused frequency components being
    exploited. In the SMSE framework, forcing the underused variable b to be zero
    and the frequency assignment variable a to take on binary values results in, b=[0,0,…,0]
    a=[ a 0 , a 1 ,…, a N f −1 ], a m ∈{0,1} (19) (20) View Source where the second
    summation in (18) is eliminated and reduces to current hard decision CR overlay:
    s k [n]= 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 u m c m d m,k w m e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k + θ
    c m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) }. (21) View Source B. SD-SMSE Underlay Waveform Unlike
    overlay-CR waveforms that only operate in unused spectrum bands, underlay-CR waveform
    operates in underused spectrum regions. An underlay-CR waveform spreads its signal
    over a wide bandwidth to minimize interference to existing primary users and to
    achieve the required processing gain to improve its own performance. Underlay-CR
    approaches have been generally associated with UWB technology. By definition,
    a signal is defined as UWB if it occupies a bandwidth that is greater than 500
    MHz. Therefore, not all underlay-CR waveforms can be classified as UWB per this
    definition. For example, a low data rate underlay waveform used as a control channel
    might only require a few mega hertz of bandwidth. In the SD-SMSE context, UWB
    is a special implementation of an underlay-CR waveform. An UWB transmission uses
    underlay waveform which operates across all spectral components while minimizing
    interference to primary users by limiting its transmission power spectral density.
    Hence, its allowable transmission power spectral density is dictated by the primary
    user (among all those present) that is most sensitive to interference. In this
    case, all frequency components are treated as underused components. Hence, by
    setting u=[0,0,…,0] b=[K,K,…K],0<K<1 (22) (23) View Source The first summation
    in (18) can be eliminated which results in a CR underlay waveform corresponding
    to an UWB transmission:   s k [n]= 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 K d m,k w m e j(2π f
    m t n + θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) }. (24) View Source where K is a constant
    obtained by taking the minimum value of the weighted power spectral density shown
    in Fig. 2. Note that b was assumed constant for simplicity, in general each underused
    spectral components can have different spectral weights capable of employing adaptive
    baseband modulations. C. Hybrid Overlay/Underlay For the proposed soft decision
    CR, the waveform achieves benefits of both overlay-CR and underlay-CR waveforms
    by exploiting both unused and underused spectral regions. This is done by employing
    soft decision criteria at each distinct frequency component while minimizing the
    interference to primary users [12], [22], [31]. The expression in (18) represents
    the hybrid overlay/underlay waveform utilizing the SD-SMSE framework. SECTION
    IV. Performance Analysis of Overlay/Underlay Waveforms This section begins by
    considering application of the general SMSE and SD-SMSE frameworks to typical
    multi-carrier modulations including OFDM and MC-CDMA. It has been shown that these
    multi-carrier modulations can be readily adapted to a non-contiguous spectrum
    environment by deactivating undesired subcarriers that are interfering with primary
    user bands [12], [22], [24], [25], [31]. Here, the BER performance of overlay-CR
    and underlay-CR waveforms is evaluated. The total received signal in a CR environment
    under AWGN channel conditions is given by r(t)= ∑ k=1 K S p k (t)+ ∑ l=1 L S s
    l (t)+n(t) (25) View Source where K is the total number of primary users, L is
    the total number of secondary users, S p k (t) represents the k th primary user''s
    signal, S s l (t) is the l th secondary user''s signal, and n(t) represents the
    additive Gaussian noise. Figure 4 illustrates such a dynamic spectrum access scenario
    containing two primary users occupying two non-contiguous frequency bands and
    two spectrum holes that are available for secondary user transmissions. Assuming
    the k th primary user transmits an OFDM signal with BPSK modulation over M k subcarriers,
    the k th primary user''s signal corresponds to S p k (t)= E b k T − − − − √ Re{
    ∑ i=0 M k −1 b (k) i e j2π f k i g(t)} (26) View Source where E b k is the k tk
    user''s bit energy, b (k) i is the k th user''s i th bit, f k i is the i th subcarrier
    of the k th user, g(t) is a rectangular waveform of unity height which time-limits
    the code to one symbol duration T , and the subcarrier bandwidth Δf= f k i − f
    k i−1 =1/T . Fig. 4. Performance of non-contiguous overlay waveform under AWGN
    channel conditions. Show All A. Performance Analysis of Overlay Waveforms When
    the secondary user employs an overlay waveform for transmission, only spectrum
    holes are used. We assume here that only one secondary user is transmitting over
    all available spectrum holes. The signal corresponding to the secondary user waveform
    employing NC-OFDM can be written as: S s (t)= E b s T − − − − √ Re{ ∑ i=0 M h
    −1 b (s) i e j2π f h i t g(t)} (27) View Source where E b s is the secondary user''s
    bit energy, b (s) i is the secondary user''s i th bit, f h i is the i th subcarrier
    of the spectrum holes, and M h is the total number of subcarriers of all spectrum
    holes. Similarly, a secondary user employing NC-MC-CDMA can be written as S s
    (t)= E b s M h T − − − − − √ Re{ b (s) ∑ i=0 M h −1 β i e j2π f h i t g(t)} (28)
    View Source where β i is the i th component of the spreading code of the secondary
    user. Since the secondary user''s transmission is assumed to be synchronized in
    time with the primary users'' transmission, and the secondary user only transmits
    over spectrum holes, there is no interference from the secondary user to primary
    users and vice versa. Hence, the BER performance of the secondary user (and the
    primary users) is simply [32], P(e)=Q( 2 E b N 0 − − − − √ ) (29) View Source
    for BPSK modulation and P(e)= 2 3 Q( 6 E b N 0 − − − − √ sin π 8 ) (30) View Source
    for 8PSK modulation with Gray coding. B. Performance Analysis of Underlay Waveforms
    When underlay waveform is employed by the secondary users for transmission, the
    transmission occupies the entire bandwidth instead of only the spectrum holes.
    Here, multiple secondary users can be accommodated using MC-CDMA. The total secondary
    users'' signal corresponds to: S s (t)= ∑ l=1 L S s i (t) = E b s N f T − − −
    − − √ Re{ ∑ l=1 L b (l) ∑ i=0 N f −1 β (l) i e j2π( f c +iΔf)t g(t)} (31) View
    Source N f is the total number of subcarriers over the entire bandwidth, β (l)
    i is the i th component of l th user''s spreading code. The received signal is
    first decomposed to N f subcarriers then recombined to create the final decision
    variable for the desired secondary user. Specifically, the n th secondary user''s
    decision variable is: R (n) = ∑ i=0 N f −1 r (n) i (32) View Source When one subcarrier
    is in a spectrum hole, there is no primary user''s signal: r (n) i = E b s N f
    − − − − √ b (n) + E b s N f − − − − √ ∑ l=1,l≠n L b (l) β (l) i β (n) i + n i
    (33) View Source where the first term is the desired signal, the second term is
    the MAI (multiple access interference), and the third term represents the additive
    Gaussian noise. However, if one subcarrier is not in a spectrum hole, the secondary
    users'' signal coexists with one primary user''s signal: r (n) i = E b s N f −
    − − − √ b (n) + E b s N f − − − − √ ∑ l=1,l≠n L b (l) β (l) i β (n) i + E b k
    − − − √ b (k) i + n i (34) View Source When orthogonal spreading codes are employed

    Source SECTION V. Simulation Results Performance of the overlay-CR, underlay-CR
    and hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms is demonstrated via simulation under AWGN
    channel conditions. Perfect synchronization is assumed between the primary and
    secondary user. Analytic versus simulated P(e) versus E b / N 0 is used as a performance
    metric to validate these waveforms. When the secondary user is perfectly synchronized
    with the primary user, there is no interference from the secondary user to primary
    user when secondary user employs overlay waveform, hence, the performance of the
    non-contiguous overlay waveform secondary user follows the theoretical performance
    under AWGN channel conditions. A. Overlay Simulation Results In current CR methods
    only the unused spectrum is allocated for secondary users. The overlay spectrum
    allocation scenario is assumed to have 64 subcarriers where only 32 non-contiguous
    subcarriers are available for secondary CR users. Performance of four non-contiguous
    overlay waveforms is demonstrated in Fig. 4. The results demonstrate that with
    perfect synchronization between primary and secondary users, non-contiguous waveforms
    such as NC-OFDM, NCMCCDMA, NC-CI/MC-CDMA and TDCS with BPSK modulation and 8PSK
    modulation respectively, match the theoretical expressions under AWGN channel
    conditions. B. Underlay Simulation Results A CR underlay waveform utilizes the
    underused portion of the spectrum, operating on top of the other primary user
    waveform. In the previous overlay case, since perfect synchronization is assumed
    there was no interference between the primary user and the overlay-CR secondary
    user. Whereas in the underlay-CR case, the primary user and secondary underlay
    user will be interfering with each other causing mutual performance degradation.
    Three scenarios are considered to get some insight and understanding of the mutual
    interference. The first two scenarios examine an underlay-CR waveform with a primary
    user as the interference and the third scenario analyzes primary user performance
    with an underlay-CR waveform as the interference. In the first scenario, the primary
    user is modeled as OFDM with BPSK modulation using a contiguous N=32 subcarrier
    spectrum. The underlay waveform is modeled as MC-CDMA with BPSK modulation. The
    underlay waveform uses much lower power and will spread its spectrum while maintaining
    its own performance requirements and minimizing its interference to the primary
    user. Figure 5 illustrates the performance of an underlay secondary user under
    AWGN channel conditions with primary user interference. In Fig. 5, the underlay
    waveform is operating at −30 dB transmission power relative to that of the primary
    user. It can be seen that as the underlay waveform spectrally spreads its performance
    improves and approaches to the theoretical baseline at N=1024 . Fig. 5. Performance
    of Underlay NC-MC-CDMA BPSK as a secondary user. Primary to secondary user power
    ratio is 30 dB. Show All The second scenario also models the primary user as OFDM-BPSK
    consisting of N=32 contiguous subcarriers. In this case, the underlay spread length
    is fixed to N=512 and the secondary to primary power ratio is set at −20 dB. In
    the previous scenario there was just one single primary user in the entire underlay
    spread bandwidth, where as in this case the entire bandwidth is populated with
    multiple primary users, each operating over 32 subcarriers. It is evident from
    Fig. 6 that as number of primary users increases underlay performance goes down,
    prompting the underlay to use other means such as spread further or add channel
    coding to improve the performance. Fig. 6. Performance of underlay NC-MC-CDMA
    BPSK as a secondary user in the presence multiple primary users. Show All Results
    in Fig. 7 enable a comparison of theoretical and simulated BER performance for
    a secondary user using an underlay waveform. Figure 7 shows results when the secondary
    user''s transmission power is 30 dB lower than that of the primary user. In Figure
    7, the solid lines represent the theoretical BER performance of the secondary
    user specified by (39), the circles represent the simulation results when the
    secondary user spreads to N=256 subcarriers, the stars represent the simulation
    results when the secondary user spreads to N=512 subcarriers, and the squares
    represent the case of N=1024 subcarriers. As seen in these figures, the simulation
    results are well predicted by the theoretical analysis presented in Section V.

    BER performance and the simulation results of the secondary user using underlay

    same transmission power and each primary user occupies 32 subcarriers. The solid
    lines in Fig. 8 represent the theoretical curves, the circles represent the simulation
    results when one primary user is present, the stars represent the simulation results
    with two primary users, the squares represent the simulation results with four
    primary users, and the diamonds represent the simulation result with eight primary
    users. It is evident from these curves that the simulation results perfectly match
    the theoretical analysis described in Section V. Fig. 8. Comparing analytic with
    simulated results for underlay secondary user performance with multiple primary
    users. Show All C. Overlay/Underlay Simulation Results To maximize both spectrum
    efficiency and channel capacity, we have to take advantage of both unused and
    underused portion of the spectrum. In this section we demonstrate performance
    enhancement utilizing both unused and underused spectrum using a hybrid underlay/overlay
    waveform. The block diagram representation in Fig. 9 illustrates the conceptual
    view of the hybrid overlay/underlay approach. Systematic block channel coding
    is introduced to demonstrate the performance improvement gained by combining overlay
    and underlay techniques. Two popular block codes, namely a (7,4) Hamming code
    with t=1 error correction capability and a (15,5) BCH code with t=3 error correction
    capability were chosen for demonstration purposes. In general, channel coding
    improves performance by adding redundant or parity bits. For a given communication
    system this translates into increased transmission bandwidth or a decrease in
    effective data rate. For example, a fixed bandwidth overlay system experiences
    a k/n reduction in effective date rate where k and n represent the number of output
    encoded and input information bits, respectively. Fig. 9. Block diagram of hybrid
    overlay/underlay technique using channel coding. Show All However, in the proposed
    hybrid overlay/underlay system shown in Fig. 9, the information bits are transmitted
    using an overlay waveform (over unused frequency bands) while the redundant bits
    are transmitted using an underlay waveform (over underused frequency bands). Thus,
    both unused and underused frequency bands are exploited. When compared with a
    pure overlay system, the hybrid overlay/underlay system achieves channel coding
    gain without sacrificing data rate. More importantly, the hybrid overlay/underlay
    system possesses an increased degree of flexibility in receiver design: if preferred,
    no channel decoding has to be implemented and the receiver could simply demodulate
    the data from the overlay transmission; on the other hand, with channel decoding
    implemented the overlay/underlay receiver can significantly improve performance.
    Figure 10 shows the simulation results of overlay and overlay/underay concept
    illustrated in Fig. 9. The top solid line represents the OFDM-BPSK overlay system
    without channel coding. The bottom two solid lines represents OFDM-BPSK overlay
    systems using H(7,4) and BCH(15,5) channel coding respectively. The dashed lines
    represent the overlay/underlay combinations. The underlay waveform spread length
    was at N=512 . It is evident from results in the figure that applying channel
    coding improves performance significantly but at the cost of reduced effective
    data rate. Performance of the proposed overlay/underlay system approaches that
    of the channel coded overlay system without experiencing the reduced data rate.
    Fig. 10. Performance of hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms in AWGN channel Show
    All SECTION VI. Conclusion To improve spectrum efficiency and maximize channel
    capacity both unused (white) and underused (gray) spectral regions need to be
    exploited. Using a previously developed SMSE framework based on hard decision
    spectrum usage, an extended soft decision SMSE framework (SD-SMSE) is presented
    for physical layer waveforms that are well-suited for “CR-based SDR” applications.
    Given an established set of SD-SMSE design variables, the “CR-based SDR” is capable
    of dynamically generating overlay, underlay and hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms
    based on a user requirements. Each of these three waveforms were evaluated using
    the SD-SMSE framework in a CR context under AWGN channel conditions. In general,
    the underlay-CR waveform is associated with UWB technology. However, results here
    demonstrate that the underlay-CR waveform is able to adapt its bandwidth based
    on user requirements and environmental conditions. It was also demonstrated that
    the hybrid overlay/underlay waveform can be used to improve spectrum efficiency.

  description: Recent studies suggest that spectrum congestion is mainly due to the
    inefficient use of spectrum rather than its unavailability. Dynamic Spectrum Access
    (DSA) and Cognitive Radio (CR) are two terminologies used in the context of improved
    spectrum efficiency and usage. The advent of CR has created a paradigm shift in
    wireless communications and instigated a change in FCC policy towards spectrum
    regulations. Spectrum overlay and underlay techniques fall within the hierarchical

    spectral regions while spectrum underlay exploits underused (gray) spectral regions.
    Similar to UWB transmissions, underlay approaches utilize much more spectrum than
    overlay approaches and operate below the noise floor of primary users. Spectrally
    modulated, spectrally encoded (SMSE) signals, to include Orthogonal Frequency
    Domain Multiplexing (OFDM) and Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access(MC-CDMA),
    are candidate CR waveforms. The SMSE structure supports and is well-suited for
    CR-based Software Defined Radio (SDR) applications. This paper provides a general
    soft decision CR framework that extends the previously developed SMSE framework
    to achieve synergistic benefits of overlay and underlay techniques. The extended
    framework provides considerable flexibility to design overlay, underlay and hybrid
    overlay/underlay waveforms that are scenario dependent. Overlay/underlay framework
    flexibility is demonstrated by applying it to a family of SMSE signals, including
    OFDM, MC-CDMA, Carrier Interferometry MC-CDMA (CI/MC-CDMA) and Transform Domain
    Communication System (TDCS). A simulated performance analysis of overlay, underlay
    and hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms is presented and benefits discussed which

    With an ever increasing demand for higher data rates, coupled with an increase
    in new applications and the number of users, spectrum crowding and congestion
    continue to increase. At first glance by looking at the FCC''s fully allocated
    spectrum chart it seems like there is a spectrum scarcity [1]. Recent studies
    have suggested that spectrum congestion is mainly due to the inefficient use of
    the spectrum rather than its scarcity [2]. Two terminologies, namely Dynamic Spectrum
    Access (DSA) and Cognitive Radio (CR), are used within the research community
    in the context of improved spectrum efficiency. Fig. 1. Dynamic Spectrum Access
    scenarios [3], [4]. Show All As illustrated in Fig. 1, each DSA approach can be
    broadly categorized as being based on one of three models, including 1) dynamic
    exclusive use, 2) spectrum commons (open sharing) or 3) hierarchical access [3],
    [4]. The dynamic exclusive model basically follows the present policy and regulations.
    Spectrum property rights and dynamic spectrum allocation are two methods introduced
    within this model to add flexibility for spectrum efficiency. Under spectrum property
    rights, a primary user (licensee) is allowed to sell and/or trade spectrum and
    can choose the technology. Under dynamic spectrum allocation which was introduced
    by the European DRiVE project, the goal is to improve spectrum efficiency via
    dynamic spectrum assignment utilizing spatial and temporal statistics of various
    users. The open sharing model, which is also known as spectrum commons, employs
    sharing among peers as the basis to manage a spectrum region. This model basically
    gains support from the success of wireless services operating in the unlicensed
    industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band. Finally, under the hierarchical
    access model interactions between primary and secondary users are considered to
    achieve spectrum efficiency. The basic idea here is to open up the licensed spectrum
    to secondary users while inducing minimum acceptable interference to the primary
    users. Spectrum overlay and spectrum underlay are two approaches under consideration
    to accomplish this. Spectrum overlay allows unlicensed secondary users to utilize
    unused spectrum simultaneously with primary users on a non-interference basis.
    This overlay approach was first adopted by [5] and subsequently researched under
    DARPA''s Next Generation (XG) program as an “opportunistic spectrum access” approach.
    Similarly, spectrum underlay allows unlicensed secondary users to simultaneously
    operate in primary user bands but under strict transmit power constraints. Of
    all the spectrum access models presented, the hierarchical access model is perhaps
    the most compatible with current FCC policies and legacy wireless systems. As
    proposed in [2], [6], CR technology fits within the hierarchical access method.
    Even though the present CR definition only considers overlay approaches, the research
    trend suggests that a hybrid technique combining overlay/underlay concepts can
    be employed to maximize spectral efficiency by using both white and gray spectral
    regions [3], [7]. Therefore, we can further categorize CR as being either overlay-CR
    or underlay-CR depending on the spectral region being used. The choice of physical
    layer transmission is very important in CR implementation. Multi-carrier modulations
    such as OFDM and MC-CDMA are hailed as promising candidates [8] for realizing
    CR applications. To satisfy high data rate requirements, improve spectrum efficiency
    and at the same time avoid interference to primary and other secondary users,
    non-contiguous multi-carrier waveforms have been proposed [9], [10], [11], [12].
    Software Defined Radio (SDR) is another promising DSA enabling technology where
    the radio transceivers perform baseband processing in software. SDR has the ability
    to quickly reconfigure its operating parameters, which is a fundamental requirement
    in the CR scenarios. The synergistic union of these two DSA technologies is termed
    “CR-based SDR”. That is, the SDR provides the software controlled communication
    vehicle (core technology for air interface and waveform generation), the control
    and application of which is based on CR principles guided by spectral monitoring
    to achieve efficient spectrum usage [13]. Driven by SDR principles, a general
    analytic framework was developed to encompass a myriad of multi-carrier signals.
    The framework is applicable to a broad class of signals that are called Spectrally
    Modulated, Spectrally Encoded (SMSE) signals [13], [14], [15]. Depending on CR
    user needs various multi-carrier waveforms can be generated, e.g., OFDM, MC-CDMA,
    CI/MC-CDMA or TDCS, using this SMSE framework. Since this original SMSE framework
    employed hard decision frequency allocation, its applicability is limited to overlay-CR
    signals. To extend its applicability and maximize spectrum efficiency by utilizing
    both unused and underused regions, a soft decision SMSE (SD-SMSE) framework was
    subsequently developed to realize overlay-CR, underlay-CR and hybrid over-lay/underlay
    CR signals [16]. The remainder of this paper presents a brief overview of the
    SMSE framework followed by a more detailed description of the extended SD-SMSE
    framework and its components. The design of overlay, underlay and hybrid overlay/underlay
    waveforms that are suitable for a “CR-based SDR” platform are then presented.
    Each of these three waveform designs are evaluated via simulation in the context
    of CR applicability. SECTION III. Original SMSE Overlay Framework Previous work
    provides a general analytic framework for SMSE signals and accommodates multi-carrier
    based CR waveforms [13]. Specifically, an arbitrary CR waveform can be expressed
    in terms of its amplitude (A) , phase (Θ) and frequency (F) characteristics. These
    three factors aid in SMSE waveform design through six design variables, namely
    Data (d) , Code (c) , Window (w) , Orthogonality (o) and two frequency allocation
    variables. An in-depth treatment of the SMSE analytic development and the family
    of SMSE waveforms is provided in [13]. The coding, c = [ c 1 , c 2 ,…, c N f ],
    c i  ∈ C , data modulation, d = [ d 1 , d 2 ,…, d N f ], d i  ∈ C , and windowing
    function, w = [ w 1 , w 2 ,…, w N f ], w i  ∈ C account for component-by-component
    amplitude and/or phase variations. A phase only variable ∅=[ o 1 , o 2 ,…, o N
    f ], o i  ∈ C is used for orthogonality between symbol streams and to facilitate
    multiple access. The analytic SMSE framework development begins by considering
    data, code and window variables. The m th frequency component of the k th symbol
    is given by: S k [m]= c m d m,k w m e j( θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m ) (1) View Source
    where m=0,1,…, N F −1 is the frequency index and c m , d m are magnitude and phase
    design variables. The expression in (1) is next modified to incorporate frequency
    and orthogonality variables. Frequency component selection is a function of two
    factors, including an available variable a = [ a 1 , a 2 ,…, a N f ],  a i  ∈
    {0,1} and a use variable u = [ u 1 , u 2 ,…, u N f ],  u i  ∈ {0,1} . Given an
    N f -point fast Fourier transform (FFT) process, N f frequency components or spectral
    bands are initially available. It is important to note that the frequency assignment
    takes on binary values 0 or 1 indicating the availability of the spectrum for
    secondary users. As a direct result, this pool of frequencies is reduced by component
    selection to create a number of CR available frequencies and usable frequencies.
    The m th component of the k th CR symbol corresponds to S k [m] =  a m u m c m
    d m,k w m e j( θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) (2) View Source where the product
    a i u i  ∈ {0,1} . The discrete time domain SMSE waveform is obtained by taking
    the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) of (2): s k [n]  =  1 N f Re{ ∑
    m=0 N f −1 a m u m c m d m,k w m e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k + θ c m + θ w m +θ o
    m,k ) } (3) View Source . where t k  ≤  t n  ≤  t k + T sym ,  f m = f c +mΔf
    , and Δf is the frequency resolution [13]. SECTION IV. Extended Overlay/Underlay
    SD-SMSE Framework The original SMSE framework provides a unified expression for
    generating and implementing a host of multi-carrier type waveforms (e.g., OFDM,
    MC-CDMA, CI/OFDM, TDCS, etc) and satisfies current CR goals of exploiting unused
    spectral bands. However, it does not exploit underused spectrum. This section
    re-visits the original SMSE framework development and the frequency assignment
    variables to exploit both unused and underused spectrum to generate both overlay
    and underlay type waveforms. Fig. 2 illustrates a conceptual view of the unused
    and underused spectrum utilization using an arbitrary interfernce threshold (IT).
    IT is assumed to be a limit set forth by the primary users based on the measured
    power spectrum density in a given bandwidth. Two cases of under utilized spectrum
    are demonstrated: 1) when the spectral assignment is based on a binary decision
    the bands adjacent to the primary users are unavailable to overlay CR users and
    2) primary users bands below the IT are unavailable to CR users as well. A soft
    decision CR (SDCR) will be able to exploit these underused frequency bands to
    increase channel capacity and improve performance. To support the envisioned SDCR
    system, the original SMSE framework is extended to account for both unused and
    underused frequency bands. Fig. 2. Identification of primary users, unused and
    underused spectral region. Show All We first illustrate the proposed SD-SMSE framework
    using Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, then re-define the design variables to extend the SMSE
    expression to account for both unused and underused spectrum. Fig. 3a and Fig.
    3b show how the current CR framework identifies the used and unused spectrum based
    on binary decisions. Fig. 3c shows the weighted spectrum estimation resulted from
    spectrum sensing block in Fig. 4. The weighted spectrum estimate (WSE) (a) is
    further processed taking into account inputs from the IT estimator, primary users,
    other secondary users requirements and channel conditions. Specifically, the weighted
    spectrum estimate provides a metric on the allowable transmission power density
    at each and every frequency component in the entire bandwidth. Hence, the WSE
    divides the entire bandwidth into unused (u) and underused (b) frequency components
    and both the unused and underused spectrum can be exploited. Notice in Fig. 3
    that different underused frequency components have different allowable CR transmission
    power densities. It is envisioned that any CR-based SDR will have the option to
    choose overlay, underlay or hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms to improve performance
    depending on the scenario, situation and need. Fig. 3. Spectrum parsing using
    weighted spectrum estimation in realization of SD-SMSE waveform. Show All Fig.
    4. Block diagram representation of SD-SMSE framework [16]. Show All The first
    step in SD-SMSE framework development is to re-examine the design variables in
    the original SMSE framework. For the SD-SMSE development, frequency related factors
    are termed primary variables while amplitude and phase related factors are termed
    secondary vari-ables. Since the objective here is to optimize the spectrum usage,
    only frequency components related design variables are considered. From this point
    forward the SD-SMSE framework development is based on the scenario depicted in
    Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3c, the weighted spectrum estimate represents all frequency
    components which can be utilized for secondary user applications. It is represented
    by variable a with the range changed from binary values (hard decision) to real

    Source where the first summation represents the unused frequency components and
    the second summation accounts for the underused frequency components. The SMSE
    expression in (11) was demonstrated by applying it to a number of OFDM based multi-carrier
    signals [13]. The process of generating these waveforms can be viewed as a two
    step approach 1) generating the frequency related primary variables and 2) applying
    the secondary variables such as the code, data modulation, windowing and orthogonality
    to the frequency vector. Since the SD-SMSE only focuses on manipulating the primary
    variables, all the OFDM based multi-carrier modulations expression such as NC-OFDM,
    NC-MC-CDMA, CI/MC-CDMA and NC-TDCS are applicable to both overlay and underlay
    scenarios. A. SD-SMSE Overlay Waveform Current CR techniques only employ overlay
    waveforms that exploit unused spectral bands. It is apparent that current CR transmission
    is just a special case of the soft decision CR when no underused frequency components
    are exploited. In the SMSE framework, if we force the underused variable b to
    be zero and the frequency assignment variable a to be binary: b=[0,0,…,0] a=[
    a 0 , a 1 ,…, a N f −1 ], a m  ∈ {0,1} (12) (13) View Source The second summation
    in (11) is eliminated and it reduces to current hard decision CR overlay: s k

    m + θ w m +θ o m,k ) } (14) View Source . B. SD-SMSE Underlay Waveform Unlike
    the overlay waveforms which only operate in the unused bands of the spectrum,
    the underlay waveform operates in the underused portions of the spectrum. An underlay
    waveform spreads its signal over a wide bandwidth to minimize its interference
    to the existing primary users and also to achieve the required processing gain
    to improve its performance. In general, UWB technology has been associated with
    underlay approaches. By definition, a signal is defined as UWB if it occupies
    a bandwidth that is greater than 500 MHz. Therefore, not all underlay waveforms
    are UWB by this definition. For example, a low data rate underlay waveform used
    as a control channel might only require a few MHz of bandwidth. In the SD-SMSE
    context, UWB is a special implementation of an underlay waveform. An UWB transmission
    uses underlay waveform which operates across all spectral components but minimizes
    its interference by limiting its transmission power spectral density to avoid
    interference to all primary users. Hence, its transmission power spectral density
    is determined by the primary user who is most sensitive to interference. In this
    case, all frequency components are treated as underused components. Hence, by
    setting u=[0,0,…,0] b=[K,K,…,K],0<K<1 (15) (16) View Source we can eliminate the
    first summation in (11) and the CR underlay signal corresponds to a UWB transmission:
    S k [n]= 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f −1 K d m,k w m e j(2π f m t n + θ d m,k + θ c m +
    θ w m +θ o m,k ) } (17) View Source . where K is a constant obtained by taking
    the minimum value of the weighted power spectral density shown in Fig. 3. Note
    that b was assumed to be constant for simplicity purpose, in general each underused
    spectral components can have different spectral weights capable of employing adaptive
    baseband modulations. C. Overlay/Underlay In our proposed soft decision CR, the
    waveform achieves benefits of both overlay and underlay waveforms by taking advantage
    of both unused and underused spectrum. This is done by employing soft decision
    criteria at each and every frequency component while minimizing the interference
    to primary users [9], [10], [11]. The expression shown in (11) represents the
    hybrid overlay/underlay utilizing the SD-SMSE framework. SECTION V. Analysis of
    Overlay/Underlay Waveforms This section starts with the applications of the general
    SMSE and SD-SMSE framework to a number of multi-carrier modulations such as OFDM,
    MC-CDMA, CI/MC-CDMA and TDCS. It has been shown that these multi-carrier modulations
    can be easily adapted to a non-contiguous spectrum environment by de-activating
    undesired sub carriers interfering with the primary user bands [9], [10], [11],
    [17]. Performance of all three overlay, underlay and hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms
    is demonstrated via simulation under AWGN channel conditions. Perfect synchronization
    is assumed between primary and secondary user. Analytic versus simulated P b versus
    E b / N 0 is used as a performance metric to validate these waveforms. If the
    secondary user is perfectly synchronized with the primary user, there is no interference
    from the secondary user to primary user when secondary user employs overlay waveform.
    Hence, the performance of the non-contiguous overlay waveform secondary user follows
    the theoretical performance under AWGN channel conditions. As mentioned earlier,
    the primary focus of SD-SMSE was to manipulate the variables related to spectrum
    allocation. The secondary variables such as code, data modulation, windowing and
    orthogonality related to the amplitude and phase of a waveform are kept the same
    as in the original SMSE framework. Applying the secondary variables to the primary
    spectrum allocation variables results in expressions for OFDM and MC-CDMA as shown
    in (18) and (19). Similar expressions for CIIMC-CDMA and TDCS are shown in [13],
    [14] respectively. One of the main differences between MC-CDMA, CI/MC-CDMA and
    TDCS is the phase values used in the spreading codes. MC-CDMA employs binary phase
    coding whereas CI/MC-CDMA and TDCS use polyphase coding. S k [n]= 1 N f Re{ ∑
    m=0 N f −1 ( α m,k +j β m,k ) e j(2π f m t n ) } S k [n]= 1 N f Re{ ∑ m=0 N f
    −1 ( α k +j β k ) e j(2π f m t n + θ c m ) } (18) (19) View Source Fig. 5. Spectrum
    response for scenario with non-contiguous spectrum available for CR users. Show
    All A. Overlay Simulation Results In current CR methods only the unused spectrum
    is allocated for secondary users. The overlay spectrum allocation scenario is
    illustrated in Fig. 5. The spectral bins having a value of 1 identify secondary
    user bands and the zeroed-out bins identify primary user bands. It is assumed
    that at any given time, 32 non-contiguous subcarriers will be available for secondary
    CR users. Performance of four non-contiguous overlay waveforms is demonstrated
    in Fig. 6. The results demonstrate that with perfect synchronization between primary
    and secondary users, non-contiguous waveforms such as NC-OFDM, NC-MC-CDMA, NC-CI/MC-CDMA
    and TDCS with BPSK and 8-PSK modulations, match the theoretical expressions of
    BPSK and 8-PSK, respectively, under AWGN channel conditions. B. Underlay Simulation
    Results A CR underlay waveform utilizes the underused portion of the spectrum,
    operating on top of the other primary user waveform. In the previous overlay case,
    since we assumed perfect synchronization there was no interference between primary
    and CR overlay secondary user. Whereas in the CR underlay case, primary and secondary
    underlay user will be interfering with each other causing performance degradation
    to each other. To get an insight and understanding of the mutual interference
    to each other, we have considered three scenarios. The first two scenarios examine
    CR underlay waveform with primary user as interference and the third scenario
    analyzes primary user performance in the presence of CR underlay as interference.
    Fig. 6. Performance of non-contiguous overlay waveform under AWGN channel conditions.
    Show All Fig. 7. Performance of underlay NC-MCCDMA BPSK as a secondary user. Primary
    to secondary user power ratio is 20dB. Show All In the first scenario, the primary
    user is modeled as OFDM with BPSK modulation using a contiguous 32 sub-carrier
    spectrum. The underlay waveform is modeled as MC-CDMA with BPSK modulation. The
    underlay waveform uses much lower power and will spread its spectrum while maintaining
    its own performance requirements and minimizing its interference to the primary
    user. Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 illustrate the performance of an underlay secondary user
    under AWGN channel conditions with primary user interference. In Fig. 7, the underlay
    waveform is operating at −20dB transmission power relative to that of the primary
    user. It can be seen that as the underlay waveform spectrally spreads, its performance
    improves and approaches the theoretical baseline at N = 512 . Similarly, in Fig.
    8 the underlay waveform operating at −30dB relative to the primary user has to
    increase its spreading length to N = 1024 to improve its performance to come close
    to the theoretical expression. Fig. 8. Performance of Underlay NC-MCCDMA BPSK
    as a secondary user. Primary to secondary user power ratio is 30dB. Show All The
    second scenario also models the primary user as OFDM-BPSK consisting of 32 contiguous
    sub-carriers. In this case the underlay spread length is fixed to N=512 and the
    secondary to primary power ratio is set at −20dB. In the previous scenario there
    was just one single primary user in the entire underlay spread bandwidth, whereas
    in this case the entire bandwidth is populated with multiple primary users, each
    operating over 32 sub-carriers. It is evident from Fig. 9 that as number of primary
    users increases, underlay performance goes down, prompting the underlay waveform
    to use other means such as spread further or add channel coding to improve the
    performance. The first two scenarios examined the effects of primary user interference
    to the secondary underlay waveform. In Fig. 10 the effect of secondary underlay
    interference to the primary user is shown. As in the previous cases primary user
    is modeled as length 32 sub-carrier OFDM-BPSK and secondary underlay is modeled
    as MC-CDMA BPSK with length N = 512 , Orthogonal Hadamard-Walsh codes are used
    to support the multi-users using MC-CDMA underlay waveform. It can be seen from
    Fig. 10 that as the number of secondary user increases to 10 (at primary to secondary
    power ratio of −20dB) the primary user performance severely degrades and at that
    point the secondary underlay users drop their power level to −30dB to lessen interference
    to the primary user. Fig. 9. Performance of underlay NC-MCCDMA BPSK as a secondary

    technique using channel coding. Show All C. Overlay/Underlay Simulation Results
    To maximize both spectrum efficiency and channel capacity, we have to take advantage
    of both unused and underused portion of the spectrum. In this section we demonstrate
    performance enhancement utilizing both unused and underused spectrum using a hybrid
    under-lay/overlay waveform. The block diagram representations in Fig. 11 and Fig.
    12 illustrate the conceptual view of the hybrid overlay/underlay approach. Systematic
    block channel coding is introduced to demonstrate the performance improvement
    gained by combining overlay and underlay techniques. Two popular block codes,
    namely, a (7,4) Hamming code with t = 1 error correction capability and a (15,5)
    BCH code with t = 3 error correction capability were chosen for evaluation. In
    general channel coding improves performance by adding redundant or parity bits.
    For a given communication system this translates to increase in transmission bandwidth
    or decrease in effective data rate. Hence, the overlay system experiences a reduction
    in effective date rate by a factor of k/n where k and n represent the number of
    output encoded bits and input information bits, respectively. However, in our
    proposed overlay/underlay system shown in Fig. 12, the information bits are transmitted
    via overlay waveform (over unused frequency bands), and the redundant bits are
    transmitted via underlay waveform (over underused frequency bands). This way,
    we take advantage of both the unused frequency bands and the unused frequency
    bands. Compared to pure overlay system, the new overlay/underlay system exploits
    channel coding gain without sacrificing data rate. More importantly, the overlay/underlay
    system possesses an increased degree of flexibility in receiver design: if preferred,
    no channel decoding needs to be implemented and the receiver simply demodulates
    the data from the overlay transmission; on the other hand, with a channel decoder
    present, the overlay/underlay receiver can improve the performance significantly.
    Fig. 13. Performance of Hybrid Overlay/Underlay Waveform. Show All Fig. 13 shows
    the simulation results of overlay and overlay/undelay concept illustrated in Fig.
    11 and Fig. 12. The top solid line represents the OFDM-BPSK overlay system without
    channel coding. The bottom two solid lines represent OFDM-BPSK overlay systems
    using H(7,4) and BCH(15,5) channel coding respectively. The dashed lines represent
    the overlay/underlay combinations. The underlay waveform spread length was at
    N = 512 . It is evident from these results that applying channel coding improves
    performance significantly but at the cost of reduced effective data rate. The
    proposed hybrid overlay/underlay system performance approaches the performance
    of the channel coded overlay system without experiencing data rate reduction.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion To maximize spectrum efficiency and channel capacity, both
    unused (white) and underused (gray) spectral regions need to be exploited. Using
    a previously developed SMSE framework based on hard decision spectrum usage, we
    have presented an extended soft decision SMSE framework (SD-SMSE) for physical
    layer waveforms that are suitable for “CR-based SDR” platforms. Given a set of
    SD-SMSE design variables, the “CR-based SDR” will be capable of dynamically generating
    overlay, underlay and hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms based on users'' needs.
    All three SD-SMSE waveform types were evaluated in the CR context under AWGN channel
    conditions. In general, the CR underlay waveform is associated with UWB technology.
    However, we have shown that CR underlay has the ability and intelligence to adapt
    its bandwidth based on user requirements and environmental conditions. We have
    also demonstrated that the hybrid overlay/underlay waveform improves the BER performance
    without reducing the throughput. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This material is based upon work

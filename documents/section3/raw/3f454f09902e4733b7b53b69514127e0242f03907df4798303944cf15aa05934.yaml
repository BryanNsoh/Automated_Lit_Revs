    \ climate change contributing to\ngreenhouse gas emissions directly and indirectly.\
    \ There is a trend of agricultural greenhouse gas\nemissions reduction, but any\
    \ practice in this direction should not affect negatively farm productivity\n\
    and economics because this would limit its implementation, due to the high global\
    \ food and feed\ndemand and the competitive environment in this sector. Precision\
    \ agriculture practices using\nhigh-tech equipment has the ability to reduce agricultural\
    \ inputs by site-speciﬁc applications, as it\nbetter target inputs to spatial\
    \ and temporal needs of the ﬁelds, which can result in lower greenhouse\ngas emissions.\
    \ Precision agriculture can also have a positive impact on farm productivity and\n\
    economics, as it provides higher or equal yields with lower production cost than\
    \ conventional\npractices.\nIn this work, precision agriculture technologies that\
    \ have the potential to mitigate\ngreenhouse gas emissions are presented providing\
    \ a short description of the technology and the\nimpacts that have been reported\
    \ in literature on greenhouse gases reduction and the associated\nimpacts on farm\
    \ productivity and economics. The technologies presented span all agricultural\n\
    practices, including variable rate sowing/planting, fertilizing, spraying, weeding\
    \ and irrigation.\nKeywords: precision agriculture technologies; greenhouse gas\

    \ change as its activities accounts for nearly 13.5% of the total global\nanthropogenic\
    \ Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions [1]. During the last decade, there is a trend\
    \ of GHG\nemissions reduction in the agricultural sector, but more effort on this\
    \ direction should be made to fulﬁl\nglobal climate commitments. The main contribution\
    \ of agriculture to GHG emissions is related to\ncropland soil, enteric fermentation\
    \ and manure management [2].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339; doi:10.3390/su9081339\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n2 of 28\nThe\
    \ application of precision agriculture (PA) practices, using the large reservoir\
    \ of Precision\nAgriculture Technologies (PATs) in agricultural ﬁeld operations\
    \ could positively contribute to GHG\nemission reduction due to: (i) the enhancement\
    \ of the ability of soils to operate as carbon stock\nreserve [2] by less tillage\
    \ [3] and reduced nitrogen fertilization [4,5]; (ii) the reduction of fuel\nconsumption\
    \ through less in-ﬁeld operations with the tractor (direct GHG decrease); and\
    \ (iii) the\nreduction of inputs for the agricultural ﬁeld operations (indirect\
    \ GHG decrease) [6]. On the other\nhand, these practices affect farm productivity\
    \ by optimizing agricultural inputs producing higher\nor equal yields with lower\
    \ cost than conventional practices. Therefore, GHG mitigation measures\nthat refer\
    \ to new technologies and techniques on all agricultural practices (precision/variable\
    \ rate\nsowing/planting, fertilizing, spraying and irrigation) can reduce signiﬁcantly\
    \ the amount of inputs\nthat are responsible for GHG contribution and could help\
    \ on the goal of minimum climate change\nimpact of agriculture, always taking\
    \ into account that crop production should be maintained or even\nincreased in\
    \ the challenge of ensuring food security and safety for human food consumption.\n\
    Current use of PA practices in the world and EU basis is in general unclear. There\
    \ was a strong\nuptake of PATs during the 1990s in North America, mainly because\
    \ of the rise of information\ntechnology and the fact that US and Canadian agriculture\
    \ had the appropriate characteristics to\npromote new technologies promising better\
    \ economic results. Those characteristics were: (i) the large\nfarm sizes; (ii)\
    \ the organised extension system mainly by the government and universities; (iii)\
    \ the\nfarmers/entrepreneurs willingness for progress and technology adoption;\
    \ (iv) the high income; (v) the\npossibility of ﬁnancing investment; and (vi)\
    \ the limited or absent subsidies in agricultural products [7,8].\nPA growth rate\
    \ ﬂattened during the ﬁrst years of 2000s, because the results (productivity increase,\n\
    inputs and fuel use reduction, ease of use, low maintenance, and compatibility\
    \ between brands) were\nnot as positive as expected by the agricultural community.\
    \ However, PATs are currently taking up\nagain, because technology problems have\
    \ been gradually resolved and more tangible economic results\nhave been shown\
    \ at farm level (e.g., proﬁt increase). In 2014, PA global market already amounted\n\
    to €2.3 billion, with an expected annual growth rate of 12% through 2020 with\
    \ the mature US and\nEuropean markets considered the most promising [9,10].\n\
    However, most practitioners do not have a clear perspective of the beneﬁts of\
    \ PATs in agricultural\nproduction and do not consider the environmental reimbursements\
    \ that their use could provide [11–14].\nThere is a need to produce evidence of\
    \ the actual impact of these technologies on GHG emissions,\nfarm productivity\
    \ and economics. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to identify and describe\n\
    the PATs that possess the capacity to have positive impact on GHG emissions produced\
    \ from the\nagricultural sector in combination with farm productivity and income\
    \ sustenance or improvement.\nIn the ﬁrst section, the main sources of GHG emissions\
    \ in the agricultural sector are described,\nwhile the second section analyses\
    \ the GHG mitigation practices. Subsequently, the typology of PATs is\npresented\
    \ to sort the PATs that have a potential direct positive impact on GHG emission\
    \ mitigation\ncombined with improved or at least stable farm productivity and\
    \ economics. Then, a list of the most\ninﬂuencing PATs is presented with a short\
    \ description of their technical characteristics and its GHG\nemissions impacts.\
    \ It should be noted that literature on PATs impact on GHG emissions is highly\n\
    limited and therefore the discussion on the mitigation capacity is mainly based\
    \ on the reduction\nof agricultural inputs (e.g., fertilisers, pesticides, fuel,\
    \ and water) that can be achieved using PATs.\nSubsequently, the farm productivity\
    \ and economic impacts of acquiring and using PATs are analysed\nand discussed.\
    \ Finally, a conclusion of the importance of PATs on both reducing GHG emissions\
    \ and\nmaintaining or increasing farm productivity and income is given.\n2. Main\
    \ Sources of Agricultural GHG Emissions\nThe major GHGs produced in the agricultural\
    \ sector are methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O)\nand carbon dioxide (CO2). CH4\
    \ is mainly produced from the anaerobic decomposition of organic\nmatter during\
    \ enteric fermentation and manure management, but also from paddy rice cultivation;\n\
    N2O arise from the microbial transformation of N in soils and manures (during\
    \ the application of\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n3 of 28\nmanure and synthetic\
    \ fertiliser to land) and via urine and dung deposited by grazing animals; and\n\
    CO2 arising from: (i) energy use pre-farm, on-farm and post-farm; and (ii) from\
    \ changes in above and\nbelow ground carbon stocks induced by land use and land\
    \ use change [15].\nThe agricultural sector contributes to the production of 25%\
    \ of CO2, 50% of CH4, and 70% of\nN2O emissions in a global basis summing up to\
    \ nearly 13.5% of the total global anthropogenic GHG\nemissions, as stated above\
    \ [1]. However, in OECD member countries, agriculture produces 8% of the\ntotal\
    \ GHG emissions with a decline between 2000 and 2010 by an average of 0.4% per\
    \ annum with\nsimultaneous agricultural production increase of 1.6% per annum,\
    \ which is interpreted into 1.97% of\nGHG emission intensity reduction. Therefore,\
    \ the developed country members of OECD are trying to\nachieve synchronized GHG\
    \ mitigation and productivity increase, which is the ideal situation and is\n\
    deﬁned as the “absolute decoupling” [16].\nThe larger agricultural economies generally\
    \ produce higher levels of GHG emissions, but they\ndo not follow the same pattern.\
    \ An explanation of this statement is that, for example, France and\nGermany together\
    \ accounted for around one third of the EU-28 agricultural GHG emissions, while\
    \ the\ncombination of the UK, Spain, Poland and Italy covered an additional third\
    \ of the total. To decrease\nEU agriculture impact on GHG emissions, the EU Roadmap\
    \ for moving to a low carbon economy\nrecommends a reduction target of agricultural\
    \ GHG emissions by 36–37% until 2030, and a more\nambitious one (42–49%) for 2050\
    \ in comparison to 1990 levels [17].\nN2O is the main GHG related to agricultural\
    \ soil emissions, essentially due to microbial\ntransformation of nitrogen in\
    \ the soil (the process of nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation to be analysed later\n\
    in this paper). This concerns nitrogen mineral fertilisers, manure spreading and\
    \ nitrogen from crop\nresidues incorporated into the soil or lixiviation of surplus\
    \ nitrogen. N2O has high Global Warming\nPotential (298 times higher than CO2)\
    \ and it should be minimized to reduce agricultural GHG emissions\nin total. An\
    \ example of favourable N2O emissions increase conditions is when soil temperature\
    \ is\nincreased and high moisture conditions exist during cooler months. Another\
    \ example would be the\nincrease of N2O from upland agricultural soils due to\
    \ CO2 concentration [18]. The application of\nmineral nitrogen in the form of\
    \ chemical fertilisers would also increase the N2O emissions.\nEnteric fermentation,\
    \ which is a natural part of the digestive process for ruminants, is the most\n\
    important CH4 emission producer. CH4 is also produced during manure storage (decomposition).\n\
    There are several studies targeting on CH4 measurements [19] and its mitigation\
    \ potential from rice\nﬁelds, mainly through water [20], fertiliser, and manure\
    \ management [21]. CH4 emissions increase\nwhen mulching and organic manure are\
    \ applied in soils [22]. On the other hand, midseason drainage\nof rice farms\
    \ can reduce CH4 emissions signiﬁcantly [23]. Aerobic soils may act as CH4 sinks\
    \ [19,24] or\nemission sources [25].\nAs for CO2, direct combustion of hydrocarbons\
    \ together with soil respiration and residual biomass\ndecomposition are the main\
    \ sources of emissions. However, the majority of the farm operations and\ninputs\
    \ (e.g., fertilisers, pesticides, and energy) also have embodied CO2 content.\
    \ Direct CO2 emissions\nproduced by agriculture as well as indirect CO2 emissions\
    \ from processing of inputs at farm level\nshowed that this gas can represent\
    \ between 10% and 20% of the total GHG emissions in agriculture [2].\n3. Greenhouse\
    \ Gases Mitigation Practices\nClimate change can be mitigated through the reduction\
    \ of GHG emissions, the enhancement of\nGHG removals and the avoidance or displacement\
    \ of emissions [24]. Mismanagement of carbon (C)\nand nitrogen (N) ﬂows in the\
    \ agricultural system is the reason for GHG overproduction. There are\nmethods\
    \ and technologies that reduce GHG emissions, such as the timely and accurate\
    \ application of\nnitrogen fertilization that reduces N2O [26,27]. Regarding enhancing\
    \ GHG removals, any agricultural\npractice that increases photosynthetic processes\
    \ or slows the return of stored C in organic biomass\ncan be considered as C sequestration\
    \ method [28]. In addition, GHG emissions can be avoided or\ndisplaced by the\
    \ conversion of residual agricultural biomass into biofuel of any type [29,30],\
    \ where in\nreality this energy source replace fossil fuels of the same energy\
    \ content.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n4 of 28\nHowever, the mechanisms that\
    \ reduce one GHG can sometimes affect another GHG in a negative\nway through different\
    \ mechanisms resulting in combined effects that are unknown [31,32]. For instance,\n\
    no-tillage practices, which can potentially reduce GHG emissions by 20.6–23.7%\
    \ compared to\nconventional tillage [33], may have unanticipated and unwanted\
    \ effects on other sources or sinks of\nGHG. If, for example, soil water conservation\
    \ associated with no-till were to provide more moisture for\nnitrifying and denitrifying\
    \ bacteria as well as plants, then production of N2O might increase, offsetting\n\
    some or all of the mitigation potential of carbon storage [34].\nSmith et al.\
    \ (2008) [24] listed the GHG emissions mitigation measures in seven categories\n\
    that include different practices: (i) cropland management (nutrient management,\
    \ tillage/residue\nmanagement, water management, rise management, agroforestry,\
    \ set-aside, and land-use change);\n(ii) grazing land management/pasture improvement\
    \ (grazing intensity, increased productivity\nthrough fertilisation, nutrient\
    \ management, ﬁre management, and species introduction including\nlegumes); (iii)\
    \ management of organic soils (avoid drainage of wetlands); (iv) restoration of\
    \ degraded\nlands (erosion control, organic amendments, and nutrient amendments);\
    \ (v) livestock management\n(improved feeding practices, speciﬁc agents and dietary\
    \ additives, longer term structural and\nmanagement changes and animal breeding);\
    \ (vi) manure/biosolid management (improved storage\nand handling, anaerobic digestion,\
    \ and more efﬁcient use as nutrient source); and (vii) bioenergy\nproduction (energy\
    \ crops, solid, liquid, biogas, and residues).\nPA for crop farming is included\
    \ in the ﬁrst category with a special interest on nutrient management\nand water\
    \ management. Agricultural GHG emission mitigation should be focused on increasing\
    \ the\nefﬁciency of agriculture to reduce future land conversion, and also on\
    \ reducing N2O emissions from soil\nN management [35]. Eory and Moran (2012) [35]\
    \ considered four mitigation measures connected with\nPA (improved timing of mineral\
    \ nitrogen (N) application, improved timing of organic N application,\nfull allowance\
    \ of manure N supply and avoiding N excess). All of them showed considerable GHG\n\
    abatement potential with “Improved timing of mineral N application” reaching 0.3\
    \ tCO2-eq/ha.\nA report from the UK Government [36] analysing agricultural emissions\
    \ in the UK reported that,\nto reduce national GHG emissions by 3 MtCO2-eq by\
    \ 2020 compared to 2007, the most promising\nmethod is nutrient management (it\
    \ can reach 1.4 MtCO2-eq), followed by the use of plants with\nimproved nitrogen\
    \ use efﬁciency (potential of 0.8 MtCO2-eq) and improved land and soil management\n\
    (up to 0.45 MtCO2-eq). This work shows the potential of PA practices that are\
    \ directly connected with\nnutrient, land and soil management.\nThe European Commission\
    \ Climate Action also proposes GHG mitigation measures related\nto farming practices,\
    \ such as seeding/planting, harvesting, irrigation and fertilisation of existing\n\
    crops, use of different varieties, diversify crops, implement management practices\
    \ [37]. EU seeks\nfor sustainable agricultural schemes through the new Common\
    \ Agricultural Policy (CAP). Natural\nresources are depleting and agriculture\
    \ has to improve its environmental performance. Sustainable\nmanagement of natural\
    \ resources and climate action represent one of the three main objectives of\n\
    the CAP [38]. Improved sustainability will be achieved ﬁrstly by covering certain\
    \ environmental\nrequirements and obligations in order to receive full CAP funding.\
    \ Secondly, from 2015 onwards, the\nCAP introduced a new policy instrument, the\
    \ Green Direct Payment, that is granted only when there is\nsimultaneous crop\
    \ diversiﬁcation, ecological focus areas and permanent grassland, with environmental\n\
    beneﬁts on biodiversity, water and soil quality, carbon sequestration and landscapes.\
    \ It represents 30%\nof the direct payment budget and it is compulsory. Finally,\
    \ rural development is vital for achieving the\nenvironmental objectives of the\
    \ CAP and combating climate change, as at least 30% of the budget of\neach rural\
    \ development programme must be reserved for targeted measures on this direction.\
    \ All these\npolicy instruments are accompanied by related training measures and\
    \ other support from the Farm\nAdvisory System, insights gained from the Innovation\
    \ Partnership and applied research, which would\nhelp farmers to implement appropriate\
    \ solutions for their speciﬁc situations. Proposed solutions on\nthe farm level\
    \ are the adjustment of farm operations timing; the improvement of the effectiveness\n\
    of pest and disease control through better monitoring, diversiﬁed crop rotations,\
    \ or integrated pest\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n5 of 28\nmanagement methods;\
    \ the use of water more efﬁciently by reducing water losses; improving irrigation\n\
    practices; recycling or storing water; and the improvement of soil management\
    \ by increasing water\nretention to conserve soil moisture.\nPATs could participate\
    \ in the achievement of agricultural sustainability as they increase the\nefﬁciency\
    \ of most agricultural practices by reducing or redistributing inputs to address\
    \ the real\nrequirements of the crop. It is anticipated that the new CAP will\
    \ promote further PATs as one of the\nmethods to increase or maintain productivity\
    \ with simultaneous reduction of environmental impacts,\nand in speciﬁc GHG emissions.\n\
    4. Typology of Precision Agriculture Technologies\nIn the literature, there are\
    \ only three attempts to provide a typology of PATs. One of the\nmost prominent\
    \ studies on PA [12] classiﬁes PATs in three main categories: Hardware and sensors\n\
    (i.e., positioning and guidance, crop sensing for water stress, nutrients and\
    \ yield sensing, environmental\nsensing, seed bed preparation, and fertiliser\
    \ placement in the soil proﬁle); Data Analysis and Decision\nSupport Systems (i.e.,\
    \ protocols and standards for ﬁeld data layers production, methods for data analysis\n\
    for delineation of management zones, and easy-to-use software); and Commodity\
    \ and whole-farm focus\n(i.e., development of DSS to apply commercially in farms\
    \ including environmental impact assessment,\nand apply PA at farm level and not\
    \ at ﬁeld level). Zarco-Tejada et al. (2014) [14] categorised PATs for\ncrop and\
    \ livestock farming in a linear manner following the timeline of use of the technologies\
    \ ending\nup in three categories, namely Remote sensing; Guidance systems; and\
    \ Variable rate applications.\nFinally, Schwarz et al. (2011) [39] have provided\
    \ the most comprehensive typology of PATs\n(selected to be used in this work,\
    \ see Figure 1), divided into three main categories: Guidance systems\n(i.e.,\
    \ hard- and software that guide tractors and implements over a ﬁeld), which include\
    \ all forms of\nautomatic steering/guidance for tractors and self-propelled agricultural\
    \ machinery, such as driver\nassistance, machine guidance, controlled trafﬁc farming;\
    \ Recording technologies (i.e., sensors mounted\non ground-based stations, rolling,\
    \ airborne or satellite platforms, and gathering spatial information),\nwhich\
    \ include soil mapping, soil moisture mapping, canopy mapping, yield mapping,\
    \ etc.; and Reacting\ntechnologies (i.e., implements, hard- and software that\
    \ together can vary the placement of agricultural\ninputs in the ﬁeld), which\
    \ include technologies such as variable rate irrigation and weeding and\nvariable\
    \ rate application of seeds, fertiliser and pesticides.\nGuidance technologies\
    \ can be used for any agricultural practice application (including traditional\n\
    practices) focusing on precise machinery movement within and between ﬁelds with\
    \ tangible results\nin reduced overlapping causing lower input use (seeds, fertilisers,\
    \ and pesticides) in parallel with\ndecreased self-propelled machinery fuel consumption.\
    \ Recording technologies are required in order\nto receive information from the\
    \ ﬁeld (before, during and after the crop period) and after processing,\nextract\
    \ the data useful for any kind of PA application. Reacting technologies are supposed\
    \ to use the\ndata produced by the recording systems and minimize all inputs (seeds,\
    \ fertilisers, pesticides, and\nwater) in the optimum quantity required by the\
    \ crop to grow. The right combination of these three\ncategories is expected to\
    \ increase or at least maintain yield with the advantage of higher quality and\n\
    minimum environmental impact.\nAll three categories of PATs require the use of\
    \ Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs),\nas shown in the ﬁgure. Recording\
    \ technologies and GNSSs remain supportive in the PA process and\nthey will not\
    \ be analysed in the next section of this paper. Hence, reacting technologies\
    \ and guidance\nsystems were selected to be analysed and their potential to reduce\
    \ GHG emissions and improve farm\nproductivity and income was assessed.\nSustainability\

    \ and manure\nby adjusting the mass ﬂow rate and subsequently the application\
    \ rate of nutrients according to the\nspeciﬁc needs of the crop locally within\
    \ the ﬁeld. Inorganic fertiliser is either spread as liquid or solid\ngranules,\
    \ while manure is spread as slurry or solid manure. VR liquid inorganic fertiliser\
    \ is spread\nusing VR pesticide sprayer technology (mentioned later).\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 1339\n7 of 28\nVRNA is executed by either applying a prescription map\
    \ that was designed after receiving\ndata from the ﬁeld using mainly canopy sensors\
    \ that identify the status of the crop and correlate\nit with nutrient needs or\
    \ by combining the recording and reacting procedure on-the-go, meaning\nsimultaneously\
    \ inorganic fertilizers are distributed in the ﬁeld using two main technologies,\
    \ the spinner\nor centrifugal spreaders that are based on a conveyer belt or chain\
    \ that transfers the material (granules)\nfrom the hopper until it falls on one\
    \ or more spinning disks throwing the particles into the ﬁeld and\nthe pneumatic\
    \ spreaders that use airﬂow which divides the granules over a piped spreading\
    \ boom for\nuniform distribution [40,41]. In VRNA through spinner spreaders, the\
    \ application rate is controlled\nby adjusting the gate opening and/or changing\
    \ the speed of the conveyor (and thus the input rate of\nmaterial). In pneumatic\
    \ applicators, VRNA is executed by spreading the material using an adjustable\n\
    controlled air stream through a piped boom [42]. Liquid fertilizers (foliar or\
    \ soil fertilizers) are applied\nusing spraying machinery similarly to pesticide\
    \ application (see Section 5.5.1).\nAs for slurry distribution in the ﬁeld, the\
    \ applicators work by either pressuring the slurry\ntank (by changing the size\
    \ of the gate that brings slurry to the delivery system) or by pumping\nthe slurry\
    \ from the tank (by changing pump or valve settings). VRNA is based on changing\
    \ the\nrequired slurry ﬂowrate based on an application map or real-time soil sensors,\
    \ combined with\nsimultaneous measurements of the nitrogen content of the slurry,\

    \ work with an apron that pushes the manure towards\na dispensing system [43,44].\n\
    5.1.2. GHG Emissions Reduction Potential through VRNA\nPlants require macronutrients\
    \ to perform various metabolic processes. The primary macronutrients\nare Nitrogen\
    \ (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) covering the main needs of plants to\
    \ increase yield,\ngrowth and quality parameters, while the secondary macronutrients\
    \ (Ca, Mg, and S) play an auxiliary\nbut not irrelevant role [45]. Besides this\
    \ proven impact of macronutrients on plant behaviour, literature\nis limited on\
    \ the impact of each macronutrient on GHG emissions (direct and indirect), except\
    \ nitrogen\nthat have been analysed significantly. Nitrogen fertilisation is the\
    \ most significant activity producing\nGHG emissions in the agricultural sector,\
    \ as nitrogen inorganic fertilisers are the cause of CO2 and N2O\nemissions during\
    \ their production and N2O emissions after their application in the soil [15,35,46–48].\n\
    GHG Emissions from Nitrogen Fertiliser Production\nThe production of fertilisers\
    \ generates considerable GHG emissions being responsible for\napproximately 1.2%\
    \ of the total global GHG emissions [47]. In order to produce N fertilisers, it\
    \ is\nrequired to synthesize ammonia, where CO2 is produced from the use of fossil\
    \ energy sources (mainly\nnatural gas) as feedstock and fuel. Methane provides\
    \ 60% of the required H2 (together with 40% from\nwater steam) to react with atmospheric\
    \ N2 and produce ammonia. A portion of CH4 is used to heat\nthe process. On the\
    \ other hand, nitric acid production process is the source of N2O emissions [46].\n\
    Ammonium nitrate (AN-N), which is the base of nitrogen fertilisers, can be produced\
    \ at different levels\nof technology and the emitted GHGs are different in each\
    \ case.\nTechnology advancement has decreased total GHG emissions from 7.9 tCO2-eq/t\
    \ AN-N to a level\nbelow 3 tCO2-eq/t AN-N, which can be achieved by adopting de-N2O\
    \ catalyst systems that reduce\nN2O emissions from nitric acid production using\
    \ catalytic systems that break down N2O under high\ntemperature into harmless\
    \ nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These systems are being ﬁtted to many nitric\n\
    acid plants and virtually all operating plants in Europe had abatement systems\
    \ since the mid-2010s.\nAn example of the effect of de-N2O catalyst systems is\
    \ the respective GHG emissions from wheat\nproduction at the economic optimum\
    \ N fertilizer application rate that is signiﬁcantly reduced by about\n40%, from\
    \ 2.55 tCO2-eq/ha to 1.6 tCO2-eq/ha [46].\nTherefore, if variable rate nitrogen\
    \ fertilization is applied in combination with the ﬁtting of\nde-N2O catalytic\
    \ systems in the production line of N fertilizers, the result in the total GHG\
    \ emissions\nderived by N application is expected to be even more positive.\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n8 of 28\nGHG Emissions from Nitrogen Fertiliser\
    \ Application\nLarge quantities of fertilisers are being applied in agriculture\
    \ forming one of the primary\nanthropogenic activity producing GHG emissions [48],\
    \ particularly in rice cultivation [49,50]. Inorganic\nor organic N within soil\
    \ is subject to various natural microbial conversion processes, some of which\n\
    may produce N2O. The main inorganic forms of N in the soil are ammonium (NH4+)\
    \ and nitrate\n(NO3−). Ammonium originates either directly from mineral fertilisers,\
    \ from the conversion of manure\nor crop residues or from urea fertilisers. Nitrate\
    \ is either directly applied as nitrate mineral fertiliser\nor results from the\
    \ microbial oxidation of ammonium. Nitrate is dissolved in the water of the soil\n\
    and cannot be stored in the soil over the long term. During the period of crop\
    \ growth, nitrate is taken\nup at high rates. However, at times of low or zero\
    \ crop demand, and under certain environmental\nconditions, nitrate can be lost\
    \ either to the air via denitriﬁcation or to water by leaching. Ammonium\nis not\
    \ mobile and most of it has to be converted into nitrate before crops can take\
    \ it up. Losses of\nammonium from the soil occur via volatilisation of ammonia\
    \ (NH3) [48].\nNitriﬁcation is the oxidation of ammonium to nitrate. This natural\
    \ process supplies energy\nto the nitrifying bacteria.\nDuring the oxidation of\
    \ ammonium to nitrite, N2O is produced as\na by-product. Denitriﬁcation means\
    \ the reduction of nitrate to di-nitrogen gas (N2). During this\nprocess N2O is\
    \ emitted to the atmosphere.\nThe quantity of N2O released from denitriﬁcation\n\
    depends on the environmental conditions—more or less N2O is produced instead of\
    \ N2. The more\nfavourable the conditions for denitriﬁcation (e.g., completely\
    \ water-saturated soil), the more N2 is\nproportionally produced. Changing the\
    \ conditions (e.g., from wet to dry soils) favours N2O release [48].\nAn example\
    \ of the effect of nitrogen fertilisation is the allocation of the total GHG emissions\
    \ from\nwheat when cultivated in the economic optimum N rate showing that almost\
    \ 90% of the total GHGs\nare associated with N fertilisers (CO2 and N2O from production\
    \ and N2O from ﬁeld nitriﬁcation and\ndenitriﬁcation) [46].\nA number of studies\
    \ have concluded that many farmers over apply nitrogen [51–53]. According to\n\
    Eurostat (2016) [54] in the period of 2005–2008 the average nitrogen surplus coming\
    \ from inorganic and\norganic fertilizers, manure and other nitrogen inputs, such\
    \ as seeds and planting material, biological\nﬁxation by leguminous crops and\
    \ free living organisms, atmospheric deposition of the EU-28 member\nstates was\
    \ 51 kg N/ha that is an indication of the amount of nitrogen fertilisation that\
    \ could be\ndiminished in EU agricultural production. It can be that there is\
    \ a trend of nitrogen surplus reduction\nas in the period 2009–2012 the EU-28\
    \ surplus was reduced to 48 kg N/ha.\nVR fertiliser application (including manure\
    \ spreading) allows for the optimum application of\nnitrogen according to the\
    \ crop needs, reducing the ﬁnal fertiliser (or manure) quantity and its associated\n\
    GHG emissions both CO2 (from fuel reduction due to timely fertilization and reduced\
    \ weight of the\nhopper) and N2O (from N fertiliser production and use). In the\
    \ case of manure CH4 can also be\ndecreased. GHG emissions can be further reduced\
    \ when N fertilisation is combined with precipitation\nprediction or appropriate\
    \ irrigation scheduling (where applicable).\nAlthough the potential exists, there\
    \ is limited data on the GHG mitigation potential of VRNA.\nHowever, there is\
    \ adequate work on the impact of reducing nitrogen ﬁeld applications on N2O\n\
    emissions. Bates et al. (2009) [55] identiﬁed an abatement potential with VRNA\
    \ of 5% reduction in\nthe baseline GHG emission rate that is assigned to mineral\
    \ fertiliser application without yield impact.\nThey also pointed out that there\
    \ is abatement by making effective allowance for manure and residual\nN with VR\
    \ technology and can reach another 5% GHG emission reduction to the baseline emission\n\
    rate for mineral fertiliser application. Millar et al. (2010) [52] found that\
    \ nitrogen fertilizer application\nrates correlate with N2O emissions. However,\
    \ the relationship between nitrogen application and N2O\nemissions is not necessarily\
    \ linear [56,57], but the relationship of N2O emissions to nitrogen application\n\
    rate increases proportionally with the application rate [27]. Another study estimated\
    \ that an average\nof 1.19% of total nitrogen added to soils is released as N2O\
    \ [58]. Babcock et al. (2004) [59] pointed out\nthat as cropped soils emit N2O\
    \ at a rate of 0.2–3% of their nitrogen inputs, when nitrogen inputs are\ndecreased,\
    \ N2O emissions could be reduced directly by approximately 1.25% of nitrogen inputs\
    \ saved.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n9 of 28\nSehy et al. (2003) [60] examined\
    \ the use of VRNA and GPS in ﬁeld nitrogen application and found out\nthat N2O\
    \ emissions decreased by up to 34% in low-yielding areas.\nGHG Emissions from\
    \ Variable Rate Application of other Macronutrients and Lime\nLiterature on the\
    \ impact of VR application of other macronutrients than N and lime on GHG\nemissions\
    \ is not available, but it could be stated that VR application can affect carbon\
    \ footprint\nindirectly because excess and/or deﬁcit of macronutrients may change\
    \ the overall growth and\nperformance of crops.\n5.1.3. Impacts of the Use of\
    \ VRNA on Productivity and Farm Economics\nProductivity and Farm Economics Impact\
    \ from Variable Rate Nitrogen Fertiliser Application\nFarm productivity is inﬂuenced\
    \ by nitrogen fertilization rates, as it is one of the most signiﬁcant\nparameters\
    \ for increasing yield, while nitrogen constitutes an essential factor of farm\
    \ economics.\nSogaard and Kierkegaard (1994) [61] described the relation between\
    \ nitrogen supply and plant yield\nwith a quadratic equation. The parabolic shape\
    \ reﬂects that each further added unit of nitrogen causes\nsmaller yield increase\
    \ of the crop. At a certain point, the beneﬁts of an added unit of nitrogen (i.e.,\
    \ extra\ncrop yield) barely outweigh the costs of this unit, and an economic optimum\
    \ is reached. This economic\noptimum is found at lower application rates than\
    \ the yield optimum. By fertilising each management\nzone near the economic optimum,\
    \ higher returns can be achieved. Thus, the highest returns for VRNA\nare expected\
    \ on ﬁelds with high and spatially variable nutrient requirements [62].\nExcessive\
    \ application of nitrogen fertilisation decreases ﬁnancial returns and increases\
    \ the\npotential for nitrogen leaching into the environment. Insufﬁcient application\
    \ can reduce yields and net\nfarm income [53]. A landowner who beneﬁts from fertiliser\
    \ savings and yield gains through VRNA\nwould not require additional incentives,\
    \ although in case of yield losses such motivations would be\nneeded. Additional\
    \ revenue gains from VRNA could be realized with decreased need for fuel, labour,\n\
    or other chemicals [63].\nSeveral authors have analysed the impact of VRNA on\
    \ farm productivity and economics. Tekin\n(2010) [64] estimated that VRNA can\
    \ increase wheat production between 1% and 10% offering\nsavings in nitrogen fertilisation\
    \ between 4% and 37%. He also made an economic analysis using\nthe prices of the\
    \ VR equipment, the fertilisers and the price of the wheat seed and found out\
    \ that\nthe investment cost over a 5-year depreciation period would vary between\
    \ 11.45 € and 115.39 € for\na 500 ha and 50 ha farm size. Koch et al. (2004) [65]\
    \ investigated a 18.5-ha furrow-irrigated site\nand a 58-ha center-pivot–irrigated\
    \ site of corn ﬁelds in northeastern Colorado, USA during 2001\nand 2002 concluding\
    \ that nitrogen VR fertilization showed always better results than conventional\n\
    application with nitrogen savings of 6–46%. According to ICF (2013) [63], VR fertilisation\
    \ was found to\nproduce economic beneﬁts through increased yields, improved crop\
    \ quality, and decreased fertiliser\napplications. This report states that 8%\
    \ increase in wheat yields (for 10% less nitrogen) and 5% increase\nin corn yield\
    \ (for 21% less nitrogen) was shown when GreenSeeker (https://agriculture.trimble.com/\n\
    precision-ag/products/greenseeker/) technology was used in Maryland, USA. In Virginia,\
    \ USA, using\nagain GreenSeeker technology in corn ﬁelds resulted in nearly 27\
    \ kg/ha less nitrogen application\nthan the conventional method with a nearly\
    \ equivalent yield. GreenSeeker technology costs between\n17,616 € and 19,378\
    \ €, depending on whether farmers already have electronic ﬂow control technology\n\
    on their fertiliser application equipment. Based on the GreenSeeker price, current\
    \ fertilisers prices and\nthe reduction mentioned above from the results from\
    \ Maryland, the capital cost per acre for small\nfarms was 77.5 €, for medium\
    \ farms 35.23 € and for large farms 19.37 €.\nHydroSense project (2013) [66] identiﬁed\
    \ a net beneﬁt of 113 €/ha/year when the simpler form of\nprecision farming was\
    \ used in cotton production by using N sensors to estimate uniform application\n\
    of fertiliser through pre-existing drip irrigation systems. A variable-rate irrigation\
    \ system applied in\nthe drip irrigation circuit resulted in a net beneﬁt of 310\
    \ €/ha/year, while the net beneﬁt climbs to\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n10\
    \ of 28\n480 €/ha/year when deploying the emerging real-time and VR technology\
    \ for N inputs even though\nthe farmer needs to make signiﬁcant investment on\
    \ new equipment. It should be noted that the VR\nfertigation technique (fertilization\
    \ + irrigation) can only be applied in crops that are irrigated using\ndrip irrigation\
    \ systems.\nAn experiment was conducted in four wheat ﬁelds in Oklahoma, USA in\
    \ 2000 and compared to\nuniform fertiliser application, in-season VR application\
    \ of granular fertiliser at 1 m2 spatial resolution\n(based on optical sensing)\
    \ increased revenue (grain revenue minus fertiliser cost) by 9.69 €/ha when\n\
    fertiliser was also applied before seeding (ﬁxed rate) and more than 24.66 €/ha\
    \ when fertiliser was\nonly applied in-season [62,67]. Mamo et al. (2003) [68]\
    \ executed an experiment for three years (1995,\n1997, 1999) in corn ﬁelds in\
    \ rotation with sybean in Minnesota, USA and found a proﬁt increase of\n7 to 20.25\
    \ €/ha for corn when using VR fertilizer application compared to uniform application\
    \ due to\nreduction in the use of fertiliser. Koch et al. (2004) [65] found an\
    \ increase of 25.6 to 38.6 €/ha in net\nreturns for VRNA on Colorado corn based\
    \ on site-speciﬁc management zones compared to uniform\napplication rates, both\
    \ in a farmer and custom applied scenario.\nNext to fertiliser costs also other\
    \ costs can be attributed to VR fertiliser application, such as soil\nsampling\
    \ or online sensing, delineation of management zones, ﬁxed or variable costs associated\
    \ with\nVR equipment (GPS receiver, on-board computer, software, VR system). However,\
    \ the cost of these\nequipment or services is not only associated with VR fertiliser\
    \ application and is interconnected to\nother PA applications. Large farm holding,\
    \ due to economics of scale, allow ﬁxed costs associated\nwith VR equipment to\
    \ be distributed over a larger area, and therefore decrease the expense of VR\n\
    equipment per hectare. VR application based on grid soil sampling results to the\
    \ lowest net return in\ncomparison to the use of VR equipment, primarily due to\
    \ increased fertiliser uses and soil sampling\ncosts [65].\nManaging manure as\
    \ fertiliser resource for crop production can increase the return for the\nproducer\
    \ and the overall production efﬁciency of an animal-crop farming system in much\
    \ the same\nway as granular fertiliser management [69]. Precision management of\
    \ manure has the potential\nto further improve farming system production efﬁciency\
    \ by applying the exact required manure\ninstead of inorganic fertilizers, thus\
    \ increasing the return to the farmer, as waste management becomes\ncheaper and\
    \ the pollution potential of animal waste is minimized [70]. As with VR granular\
    \ fertiliser\napplication, the key element to VR manure application is the existence\
    \ of an application map, which is\nlaborious and time consuming to generate when\
    \ acquired without sensor technology [71]. Although\nno literature is available\
    \ considering the economic return of VR manure application, many similarities\n\
    with VR granular (inorganic) fertiliser applications can be seen. The main difference\
    \ is that the applied\nproduct is much bulkier, heterogeneous and lower in nutrient\
    \ content and ﬁnancial value [70]. It should\nbe noted that some VR manure systems\
    \ can be retroﬁtted to the tankers that farmers already have [44],\nwhich removes\
    \ the need for large investments.\nProductivity and Farm Economics Impact from\
    \ Variable Rate Lime Application\nVariable rate (VR) lime (which is primarily\
    \ CaCO3) application can increase crop yields and\nthe economic return of the\
    \ farm [72]. Lime application increases the soil pH to a desired level and\nan\
    \ optimal pH level in the soil is important to achieve optimum yields and consistent\
    \ quality [73].\nIn addition, lime improves the uptake and availability of plant\
    \ nutrients and can also improve\nwater penetration.\nVR lime application can\
    \ lead to improved adjustment of soil acidity at a lower cost and with\na (slightly)\
    \ better yield response than uniform lime application [73]. Under-application\
    \ of lime can\ncause large yield losses. Over-application of lime can be as detrimental\
    \ as under-liming [72], as it\nis costly and can create problems with availability\
    \ of some nutrients (for example inhibiting P and\nZn, or leading to toxic levels\
    \ of Mn), disease pressure, reduced herbicide performance and herbicide\ndegradation\
    \ [72,73]. Over- and under-liming cannot be avoided if lime is applied uniformly\
    \ throughout\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n11 of 28\nthe ﬁeld. It should be noted\
    \ that VR liming appears to be only proﬁtable for high value crops, because\n\
    even small effects of liming on yield produce favourable economic results in these\
    \ crops [74].\nThe main cost in a VR lime application is the cost of grid sampling.\
    \ The actual amount of lime\nused depends on the soil variability, ﬁeld acidity,\
    \ environmental factors, the sampling method and the\nsampling resolution [72].\
    \ Weisz et al. (2003) [72] concluded that when performing grid sampling and\n\
    VR lime for 3 consecutive years in Piedmont no-till soybean ﬁelds, the net loss\
    \ is €11.44/ha compared\nto uniform lime application. However, when they performed\
    \ grid sampling only in year 1 and 3, and\nperformed the VR lime in each year\
    \ (with year 2 based on the PH map of year 1) this turns into a net\ngain of €4.28/ha\
    \ over 3 years. Similarly, using the pH map from year 1 to apply lime for 3 years\
    \ only\nin the areas were lime was initially required leads to a net gain of €6.44/ha\
    \ estimated.\nField studies have shown that VR application of lime, as opposed\
    \ to uniform application, increases\nsoil pH, reduces in-ﬁeld variability and\
    \ increases soybean yield but not corn yield [75]. In 75% of the\nstudies (4 in\
    \ total) reviewed by Lambert and Lowenberg-DeBoer (2000) [76] investigating VR\
    \ lime,\na positive economic effect was found, while in 25%, the articles indicated\
    \ mixed results. The lime\napplication can be more effective in legumes than in\
    \ corn and wheat, as the response of the latter is\nlimited to pH 5–5.5, where\
    \ in legumes this can go up to pH 6 [72]. Kuang et al. (2014) [73] found that\n\
    VR approach in Danish spring barley can be compared to the traditional approach\
    \ pointing out that the\nconsumption of lime consumption was increased, but it\
    \ was followed by an increase in yield resulting\nin net proﬁt (€3.61/ha) for\
    \ the VR approach compared to the traditional approach. BonGiovanni and\nLowenberg-Deboer\
    \ (2000) [77] also found an increase of net proﬁt of €6.51/ha for Indiana corn\
    \ and\nsoybean production systems by the use of VR lime application technologies.\n\
    5.2. Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI)\n5.2.1. Description of VRI Technologies\n\
    Variable rate irrigation (VRI) can either be executed using a retroﬁtted self-propelled\
    \ irrigation\nsystems or more recently micro-irrigation. The main types of self-propelled\
    \ irrigation systems are\ncentre pivot and linear move sprinkler systems that\
    \ apply water above the canopy of the irrigated\ncrop [78]. The most used self-propelled\
    \ irrigation systems are the Mid Elevation Spray Application\n(MESA) with irrigation\
    \ efﬁciency of 85%. New developments are the Low Energy (elevation) Precision\n\
    Application (LEPA) and Low Energy (elevation) Spray Application (LESA) with irrigation\
    \ efﬁciency\naround 97% [79].\nVRI systems are commercially available and can\
    \ easily be retroﬁtted onto moving sprinkler\nsystems. There are different methodologies\
    \ available to deliver varying irrigation amounts along\na lateral. One approach\
    \ is to use parallel sprinkler control [80,81] or multiple manifolds; each valved\n\
    separately [82,83]. Another is to regulate the ﬂow of water through each sprinkler\
    \ drop hose by\ncontrolling the “on/off” cycle of a hydraulic valve positioned\
    \ above the drop hose [84–86]. A third\ndesign changes the cross-sectional area\
    \ of a sprinkler nozzle by cycling a retractable pin in and out of\nthe nozzle\
    \ in a controlled manner [87]\nThe most common site-speciﬁc sprinkler irrigation\
    \ systems in use today are speed control\nsystems [88]. However, zone (=boom section)\
    \ control systems can achieve the same effects provided\nby speed control, but\
    \ with greater ﬂexibility, and provide more management options. In Europe, both\n\
    centre pivot and linear move sprinkler systems are applied with a preference in\
    \ the latter, in contrast\nto USA where centre pivot is the most common.\nMicro-irrigation,\
    \ a high-tech type of VRI system (drip or trickle emitters, micro-sprinkling and\n\
    microspray, and subsurface irrigation), is used in areas with very scarce water\
    \ supply where high\nvalue crops are installed (orchards, vineyards), as they\
    \ increase crop yield, use more efﬁciently water,\nmaintain warmer soil temperature\
    \ and might result in less pesticide use [89]. This type of VRI is ideal\nfor\
    \ Mediterranean countries, where drip irrigation is already in extensive use due\
    \ to water scarcity\nand such systems reduce further irrigation water use.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 1339\n12 of 28\n5.2.2. GHG Emission Reduction Potential through VRI\n\
    The contribution of VRI to GHG emission abatement lies on the reduction of water,\
    \ leading\nto lower pumping energy needs and proper irrigation scheduling preventing\
    \ extreme soil water\navailability to boost N2O emissions.\nComputer simulation\
    \ studies comparing conventional and “optimized” advanced site-speciﬁc\nzone control\
    \ by centre pivot irrigation have reported water savings of 0–26% [88]. VRI systems\
    \ can\nprovide 8–20% reduction in irrigation water use [90]. LaRue and Evans (2012)\
    \ [91] using centre pivot\nspeed control determined that irrigation efﬁciency\
    \ (the ratio between irrigation water actually utilized\nby growing crops and\
    \ water diverted from a source) can be increased by more than 5%, while if speed\n\
    control is also combined with zone control then the irrigation efﬁciency can be\
    \ further improved by 14%.\nHydroSense project [66] applied VRI in three experimental\
    \ ﬁelds with cotton in Greece and showed\nthat variable irrigation in cotton cultivation\
    \ achieved 5 to 34% savings in water consumption with yield\nimpact that was rated\
    \ between −18% and +31%. As a result, water use efﬁciency showed variation\nbetween\
    \ −12% and +54%. It should be noted that negative results were only shown in one\
    \ ﬁeld that\ndid not affect the total positive impact of VRI. The GHG emissions\
    \ linked to soil water availability\ndepend very much on the soil type. Sandy\
    \ soils will generate substantial water savings, while heavy\nsoils will not (compared\
    \ to surface irrigation systems). Lower quantities of water irrigation require\n\
    lower pumping energy which, when powered by either fossil fuel motors or electricity,\
    \ indirectly\ninﬂuence GHG emissions.\nA review by Trost et al. (2013) [92] compared\
    \ N2O emissions from irrigated and non-irrigated\nﬁelds showing an increase of\
    \ N2O emissions (about 50% to 140%) under irrigation, in most cases\nstudies.\
    \ This shows that VRI may signiﬁcantly inﬂuence N2O emission from irrigated soils.\
    \ VR\nirrigation systems can also assist irrigation scheduling combined with meteorological\
    \ prediction\nmodels and fertilization schedules in order to keep soil water availability\
    \ in such levels to avoid\nprovoking more GHG emission production through N2O.\n\
    5.2.3. Impacts of VRI Use on Productivity and Farm Economics\nVRI systems have\
    \ been tested to identify their direct impact on water use reduction and indirect\n\
    impact on farm productivity and economics. Few hard ﬁgures are available about\
    \ the economic beneﬁts\nof VRI. LaRue and Evans (2012) [91] reported that speed\
    \ control in pivot irrigation systems is simply\nactivated by changing the control\
    \ unit of the system with a one-off cost of 1321–2202 €. However, zone\ncontrol\
    \ is a more complex system that can reach an investment of 10,570 € up to 24,663\
    \ €. Tomasiewicz\net al. (2013) [93] indicated that VRI modiﬁcation of centre\
    \ pivot with control system may cost between\n13,212 € and 35,233 €. They also\
    \ mentioned that, in 2013, 200 centre pivot systems (around 0.1% of all\ninstalled\
    \ US pivots) were VRI enabled. However, it may be expected that adoption will\
    \ be crop-value\nrelated: adoption will go faster in high-value crops. Threshold\
    \ prices can be calculated for speciﬁc\ncrops (e.g., for precision irrigation\
    \ in the Texas High Plains, it was calculated the threshold of cotton\nprice to\
    \ be set above 1.40 €/kg to make the use of precision irrigation proﬁtable) [94].\
    \ Hydrosence\nproject [66], calculated that VRI adoption in drip irrigation may\
    \ cost up to 40 €/ha.\nLambert and Lowenberg-DeBoer (2000) [76] reported economic\
    \ beneﬁts by the use of VRI, due\nto higher corn yields and better water use efﬁciency.\
    \ However, these beneﬁts were not quantiﬁed.\nAs mentioned above, VRI systems\
    \ can add signiﬁcant costs to the farm, but additional beneﬁts have\nbeen identiﬁed\
    \ by the installation of such systems, such as possible yield increase, work load\
    \ reduction,\nwater use decrease and even pesticide use saving, especially in\
    \ climatic unfavourable years such as\nin big draughts [90,95,96]. For water use\
    \ reduction, Hedley and Yule (2009) [97] tested VRI scenarios\nin a 156-ha pastoral\
    \ farm and a 53-ha maize ﬁeld in New Zealand after modelling and mapping by\n\
    relating high resolution apparent electrical conductivity maps to soil available\
    \ water holding capacity\nat two ﬁeld sites. They showed signiﬁcant potential\
    \ water savings of 21.8 for the ﬁrst site and 26.3%\nfor the second, while these\
    \ potential water savings suggest that VRI will become more affordable\nas irrigation\
    \ costs increase. Daccache et al. (2015) [98] conducted an experiment with VRI\
    \ in lettuce\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n13 of 28\nopen ﬁeld production in\
    \ Cambridge, UK during 2012 and estimated the beneﬁt to the grower in the\nreduced\
    \ cost of water and energy to be typically around 30 €/ha to areas that are over-irrigated\
    \ in\nhumid climates. These authors also claim that the development and uptake\
    \ of PI would need to be\njustiﬁed more in terms of the wider beneﬁts to crop\
    \ quality and reduced environmental impacts.\nCurrently, no economic data about\
    \ VR micro-irrigation is available because VRI combined with\nmicro-irrigation\
    \ is still in its infancy.\n5.3. Machine Guidance (MG)\n5.3.1. Description of\
    \ MG Technologies\nMachine guidance refers to the applications of GNSS for steering\
    \ and guidance though two main\nsystems: driver assistance and machine auto-guidance.\
    \ Driver assistance helps the driver keep his line in\nthe ﬁeld through add-ons\
    \ that are not integrated in the tractor’s systems and can be simply installed.\n\
    The most common driver assistance system is the lightbar guidance system that\
    \ consists of a horizontal\nseries of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) in a plastic\
    \ case in front of the operator, so he or she can see the\naccuracy indicator\
    \ display without taking their eyes off the ﬁeld. If the light is on the centreline\
    \ of\nthe lightbar, the machine is on target, while if a bar of light extends\
    \ to one side, the machine is off the\npath and needs to be corrected. Auto-guidance\
    \ is a more advanced navigation system that has the\nadditional beneﬁt of automatic\
    \ steering of the tractor, also called auto-steering. Machine auto-guidance\n\
    systems are integrated in the tractor’s hydraulics and can directly take over\
    \ steering operations. These\nmore advanced systems are coupled to on-board computers\
    \ that allow for headland steering, section\ncontrol and that accept drive-maps\
    \ (routing) and task maps to operate implements. Auto-guidance\nhelps farmers\
    \ in avoiding gaps and overlaps in multiple passes with the tractor, which is\
    \ mainly\ncaused by operator error or fatigue. It is the most adopted PAT because\
    \ the impact on the farm is\nmeasurable and accurate. However, farm size matters\
    \ for the technology to provide tangible results,\nespecially in terms of environmental\
    \ impact.\n5.3.2. GHG Emissions Reduction Potential through MG\nGuidance technologies\
    \ improve pass-to-pass efﬁciency, reduce overlapping and application\ngaps. Guidance\
    \ can be used for many ﬁeld operations such as seeding, tillage, planting, weeding,\n\
    and harvesting [99] and for enabling autonomous vehicles. Therefore, it is expected\
    \ that all main\nagricultural inputs (seeds, fertiliser and pesticides) will be\
    \ reduced\nGuidance technology saves as standalone fuel of the self-propelled\
    \ machine and inputs (fertilisers,\npesticides) even if implements used are conventional\
    \ type. In the case it is combined with VR\napplication of agricultural inputs,\
    \ they are also reduced further. An example is the work of Shockley et\nal. (2011)\
    \ [100] that modelled a commercial Kentucky corn and soybean farm under no-till\
    \ conditions\nwhere machine guidance during planting and fertiliser application\
    \ led to cost savings of approximately\n2.4%, 2.2% and 10.4% for seed, fertiliser\
    \ and tractor fuel, respectively, which is translated to GHG\nemission mitigation.\
    \ Guidance systems such as lightbar and auto-steering can reduce fuel consumption\n\
    by 6.32% [101].\nMachine guidance is based on high accuracy GNSS receivers and\
    \ can be used with all kind of\nVR application machinery. As GNSS increases the\
    \ accuracy of ﬁeld applications, it will increase the\nreduction efﬁciency of\
    \ the technology itself. As machine guidance is indirectly interconnected with\
    \ the\nrecording technologies, this combination is expected to reduce GHGs.\n\
    5.3.3. Impacts of MG Use on Productivity and Farm Economics\nGuidance systems\
    \ such as lightbar and auto-steering can beneﬁt crop growers by reducing\nworking\
    \ hours as operators in the ﬁeld by 6.04% and reducing fuel consumption by 6.32%\
    \ [101].\nIn peanut digging operations, a study in Alabama during 2005–2007 growing\
    \ seasons revealed\naverage net returns between 83 and 612 €/ha for the use of\
    \ auto-steering [102]. More particularly, they\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n\
    14 of 28\nidentiﬁed that increasing the peanut digger efﬁciency by accurate placement\
    \ over the target rows could\nminimize damaged pods and yield losses. Therefore,\
    \ they studied row deviation between manual\ndriving (90–180 mm) and RTK auto-steering\
    \ system (0 mm). Data showed that for every 20 mm row\ndeviation, expected yield\
    \ loss was 186 kg/ha. When RTK auto-steering system was used the expected\nadditional\
    \ net returns from row deviation of 90 mm was 83 to 356 €/ha and from row deviations\
    \ of\n180 mm was 285 to 612 €/ha.\nAn experiment was conducted in south-central\
    \ Alabama during 2003–2005 to evaluate how the\ndistance of cotton row from deep\
    \ tillage can affect cotton yield and economic performance and it\nwas shown that\
    \ as distance between the planted row and tillage pass increased cotton yields\
    \ were\nreduced by 24–52% and net revenues from cotton production by 38–83%. An\
    \ economic analysis\nof farms adopting auto-guidance systems showed that systems\
    \ with inaccuracies below 2.5 cm are\nmost proﬁtable for larger farms, while systems\
    \ with less than 10 cm inaccuracy are a better economic\nalternative for smaller\
    \ farms [103]. The accuracy level of these systems is based on the quality of\n\
    differential correction and internal data processing (as the accuracy improves,\
    \ the corresponding cost\nincreases).\nFarmers identify as the most frequently\
    \ mentioned disadvantage of machine guidance the up-front\ncost [104]. Machine\
    \ guidance has scalable cost according to the accuracy obtained from each system.\n\
    The cost starts from 1320 € if a GNSS device is already held by the farmer. Commercial\
    \ applicators\nthat require a system that combine recording of all operations\
    \ (to different customers) together with\nfull navigation can reach more than\
    \ 12,770 €. A fully automatic navigation system with operator\nengagement only\
    \ at ﬁeld ends could range from 5284–44,040 €. It is important to select between\
    \ simple\nswathing aids such as foam-marker systems that cost between 440 € and\
    \ 2642 € and machine guidance\nsystems. As a rule-of-thumb, a navigation system\
    \ could cost six times more than a foam-marker\nsystem, which means that justiﬁcation\
    \ for GNSS navigation over foam markers must be computed\nfrom the beneﬁt side\
    \ [104].\nMachine guidance can have a variety of indirect economic impacts that\
    \ are due to the accurate\napplication of different agricultural practices. For\
    \ example, it is complicated to estimate the economic\nimpact of sprayer skips,\
    \ as inﬂuence of weed control on crop yield varies by crop and weed population\n\
    and long-term weed seed-bank effects have to be evaluated and assessed. When a\
    \ ﬁeld is relatively\nweed-free, the skip impact to yield-loss might be minimal,\
    \ but in a heavily infested ﬁeld the yield\nmay drop to almost zero in the skipped\
    \ area. The most important about pesticide application\ngaps in economic terms\
    \ is the creation of a weed seed bank all through the ﬁeld that will lead\nto\
    \ management problems and greatly increased weed control costs in future years.\
    \ Another case is\nthe impact of application gaps in fertilizer application, because\
    \ skipping a part of the ﬁeld is more\ncostly in a high-value crop (fruits and\
    \ vegetables) than in a bulk commodity such as corn, soybeans, or\nwheat [104].\n\
    5.4. Controlled Trafﬁc Farming (CTF)\n5.4.1. Description of CTF Technology\nControlled\
    \ Trafﬁc Farming is a system which conﬁnes all machinery loads to the least possible\n\
    area of permanent trafﬁc lanes. It is based on machine guidance, but it keeps\
    \ record of each ﬁeld\nand application to follow the same route every year. CTF\
    \ allows optimised driving patterns, more\nefﬁcient operations (i.e., reduced\
    \ overlaps) and targeted input applications. It increases sustainability\nby reducing\
    \ soil compaction and allows farming intensiﬁcation as it prevents yield loss,\
    \ nutrient and\nwater efﬁciency reduction, soil degradation and alleviation costs.\n\
    5.4.2. GHG Emission Reduction Potential through CTF\nCTF can reduce GHGs emissions\
    \ as it affects the quantity of agricultural inputs used in ﬁeld\noperations (fuel,\
    \ fertilisers, and pesticides). A study on the potential impact of site-speciﬁc\
    \ application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n15 of 28\nand controlled trafﬁc systems\
    \ implemented on larger farms in Denmark (300 ha and above) has stressed\nhow\
    \ a reduction of fuel costs by 25–27% in cereals can be traced back to a lesser\
    \ overlap, but also how\n3–5% savings in fertiliser and pesticide in cereals can\
    \ be obtained (in comparison to fertilizers and\npesticides application in a conventional\
    \ manner) [105]. In the same work, fuel reduction was mainly\ndue to ease of cultivation\
    \ (loose soil due to minimum compaction) and of course due to minimum\noverpassing.\
    \ Better soil structure means that conditions will be more favourable for the\
    \ absorption of\nGHG emissions that can be stored into the soil (e.g., CH4) and\
    \ for prevention of harmful gases being\nproduced through anaerobic conditions,\
    \ such as N2O and CH4. The greater number and larger size\nof pores in a non-trafﬁcked\
    \ soil means that more water inﬁltrates and is captured within the proﬁle.\nThis\
    \ means that not only there is less potential for run-off and erosion, but also\
    \ that there will be more\nplant available water that will probably increase yield.\
    \ Higher yields can be translated into increased\ncarbon stock in the crop itself,\
    \ but also will reduce GHG emission intensity as even if all agricultural\ninputs\
    \ remain constant their ration with yield will decrease.\nTullberg (2016) [106]\
    \ has analysed the impact of CTF in GHG emissions directly and indirectly,\nby\
    \ reducing energy inputs, facilitating zero tillage and increasing fertiliser\
    \ efﬁciency. Primarily,\nhe referred to an approximate reduction of tractor fuel\
    \ requirements of 40% and 70% while using\nuncontrolled trafﬁc zero tillage and\
    \ controlled trafﬁc zero tillage farming, respectively, in comparison\nto conventional\
    \ tillage. The CTF effect is a result of improved tractive efﬁciency and reduced\
    \ draft\nat planting, reduced rolling resistance at harvest and spraying operations,\
    \ and the total elimination\nof tillage. Then, he explained that there is no work\
    \ in literature about how CTF reduce herbicide\nrequirement, but he pointed out\
    \ that there is reduction due to more timely spraying from permanent\nlanes and\
    \ the overall mean reduction can reach 25%. Fertilizers were also referred, as\
    \ in CTF they are\nnot applied to permanent wheel tracks, which is translated\
    \ to fertilizer cost reduction of 10–15% for\nnarrow-spaced crops, while yield\
    \ increases by about the same amount. CTF was also mentioned to\nincrease nitrogen\
    \ efﬁciency (40–80%), due to reduced soil compaction and improved soil biological\n\
    activity when CTF is applied. In addition, as nitrogen fertilisers are applied\
    \ at seeding time in a moist\ncompacted seed zone with limited drainage, it is\
    \ expected that denitriﬁcation is increased and as\na consequence N2O will also\
    \ increase. However, CTF will minimise this problem because it reduces\nseed zone\
    \ compaction and waterlogging and allows the farmer to split fertilizer applications\
    \ with\ndenitriﬁcation reduction as a side effect. Finally, it was explained that\
    \ CTF increase soil carbon stock\nas it reduces soil disturbance and improves\
    \ the potential for cropping to mimic natural vegetation in\nmaximising dry matter\
    \ production (and water use) by double or cover cropping.\n5.4.3. Impacts of the\
    \ Use of CTF on Productivity and Farm Economics\nHeavy machinery passing on soil\
    \ causes damage mainly due to compaction especially in wet\nconditions. If trafﬁc\
    \ is reduced or stopped, soil becomes more friable, it requires little or no tillage\
    \ and\nits structure gets better year after year. CTF reduces compaction by conﬁning\
    \ wheels or tracks to the\nleast possible area of permanent trafﬁc lanes. CTF\
    \ is used to create and maintain healthy soils and crops\nin combination with\
    \ sustainable farm proﬁt. CTF typically releases 57–115 €/ha extra proﬁt including\n\
    the required investment, cost savings and increased yields [107]. Investment has\
    \ to do with the machine\nguidance installed in the agricultural machinery in\
    \ use (tractors, self-propelled sprayers, harvesters)\nand it was analysed in\
    \ machine guidance section. Cost savings include improved ﬁeld efﬁciency, less\n\
    tillage and signiﬁcant capital savings on machinery due to lower powered tractors\
    \ needed.\nField efﬁciency is increased by reducing agricultural inputs and simultaneously\
    \ increase yield.\nUsing CTF can decrease fertiliser use by 10–15% for narrow-spaced\
    \ crops and pesticide reduction can\nreach 25% [106]. Horsch company [108] pointed\
    \ out that fuel use for crop establishment with CTF is\nreduced by at least 35%,\
    \ while Jensen et al. (2012) [105] estimated that it may be possible to reduce\n\
    costs of fuel by 25–27% in cereals due to less overlap. Horsch company [108] also\
    \ mentioned that\ntime and energy for crop establishment can even be reduced by\
    \ 70%, while it was pointed out that\nCTF can increase yield about 15% more (averaged\
    \ across 15 crops) than randomly trafﬁcked soils as\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n\
    16 of 28\na result of improved root growth that uses water and fertiliser more\
    \ efﬁciently. According to Chamen\n(2016) [109], CTF is focused on the reduction\
    \ of compaction, while the system in Australia already\nshows yield gains of 15%\
    \ in sandy soils and 5% in heavier soils. The same source pointed out that\na\
    \ 1400 ha wheat/oilseed rape rotation farm converted from minimum tillage farming\
    \ to CTF no-tillage\nwas found to increase yield by 4% in wheat and 7.5% in oilseed\
    \ rape [109].\nIn addition, machinery costs are reduced as lighter machines with\
    \ less power are needed. Some\nfarmers in Australia have cut their machinery costs\
    \ by as much as 75%, while their crop yields have\nrisen [109]. Horsch company\
    \ [108] explains that CTF planning can decrease the costs, because on the\none\
    \ hand existing equipment may be enough for the new farming system and on the\
    \ other farmers\nconverting to CTF can sell a lot of their equipment and invest\
    \ in lower powered tractors (15% more\nproﬁt and 20% reduction in machinery costs\
    \ have been recorded).\nGrain research and development corporation of Australia\
    \ [110] reported that the total cost for\nadopting CTF varies signiﬁcantly from\
    \ farm to farm due to farm’s equipment level, ranging between\n21,140 € and 52,850\
    \ €. A 1400 ha wheat/oilseed rape rotation farm that converted from minimum\n\
    tillage farming to CTF no tillage was examined, and it was found that farm proﬁt\
    \ was increased by\n8% and the return on capital investment was 14% [109]. It\
    \ was also shown that 290,000 € savings on\nmachinery investment was achieved.\
    \ The cost of UK consultants for providing farm survey to the\nfarmer, including\
    \ the present production constraints, the machinery and equipment requirements\
    \ to\napply CTF was estimated to 927 € plus expense and VAT. If the farmer requires\
    \ a full action plan to\ninstall CTF the service cost is increased to 1390 € plus\
    \ expense and VAT [109].\n5.5. Variable Rate Pesticide Application (VRPA)\n5.5.1.\
    \ Description of VRPA Technologies\nVariable rate pesticide application (VRPA)\
    \ technologies enable changes in the application rate to\nmatch actual or potential\
    \ pest stress in the ﬁeld and avoid application to undesired areas of the ﬁeld\
    \ or\nplant canopies [111]. They can also be used to apply fertiliser at variable\
    \ rates [112].\nThere are two types of VR pesticide application technology.\n\
    The map-based VR pesticide\napplication adjusts the application rate based on\
    \ a prescription map, using a GPS receiver to identify\nthe ﬁeld position and\
    \ the input concentration is changed as the applicator moves through the ﬁeld\
    \ [42].\nThe real-time sensor-based VR pesticide application changes the application\
    \ rate using the current\nsituation of pest stress or canopy characteristics that\
    \ is identiﬁed by the difference on colour, shape,\nsize, texture, reﬂectance,\
    \ and temperatures of pests that is detected by different sensor types (colour\n\
    cameras, photodetectors, laser scanners, multispectral and hyperspectral cameras,\
    \ thermal cameras,\nand ultrasonic sensors). The sensor input can also be used\
    \ to control the direction and rate of\nchemical application [111]. There are\
    \ also technologies of VR pesticide application that combine\nsensor-based and\
    \ map-based applicators to achieve higher precision (Greenseeker, Isaria, etc.).\
    \ VR\npesticide application technologies use other PATs (GNSS, machine guidance,\
    \ crop sensing, and leaf\nwetness sensors) to apply the optimum pesticide quantity\
    \ site-speciﬁcally. The common use of crop\nsensor technologies for both VR fertilizer\
    \ and pesticide application is possible and can reduce cost\nof use.\n5.5.2. GHG\
    \ Emission Reduction Potential through VRPA\nPesticide application using variable\
    \ rate technologies have the advantage of applying reduced\nquantities of pesticides,\
    \ not exceeding the application rate indicated for the diagnosed disease (e.g.,\n\
    fungicides), or enemy (e.g., insecticides) or weed type (e.g., herbicide).\nThis\
    \ means that the crop yield will not be affect negatively, as the enemy or rival\
    \ will be treated at\nlease as efﬁciently as before. At the same time, the reduction\
    \ of chemical application will affect the\nquality of the ﬁnal product that could\
    \ increase farm proﬁtability due to increase product prices.\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 1339\n17 of 28\nThe environmental beneﬁts from pesticide application reduction\
    \ are numerous as ground and\nwater contamination is reduced and the inﬂuence\
    \ on biodiversity becomes lower [113]. In addition,\nlimiting insecticide use\
    \ and precision application of pesticides to only infested spots, provide ﬂoral\n\
    resources and shelter habitats that can increase the abundance, diversity and\
    \ ﬁtness of natural enemies,\ndecrease pest damage, increase crop yield and the\
    \ farmer’s proﬁt [114]. There is signiﬁcant work\non the saved pesticide quantity\
    \ that ranges from 11 to 90% for herbicide use in different arable crop\ntypes\
    \ [113,115–117]. Other work recorded pesticide use reduction in perennial crops\
    \ between 28%\nand 70% [118–121]. VRPA can also cause reductions in insecticide\
    \ use by 13.4% in winter wheat [122],\nwhile spray overlap can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ decreased with impact on the total pesticide use [123].\nThe impact of the high\
    \ pesticide reduction shown from the literature is environmentally signiﬁcant,\n\
    but, in terms of GHG emission reduction, the contribution of this technology to\
    \ the total agricultural\neffect is slight. The reason is that in this case GHG\
    \ emissions are mitigated only during the industrial\nproduction of the pesticide.\
    \ Even if the index of GHG emission production for every kg of pesticide\nis very\
    \ high in comparison to other agricultural inputs (seed, fertilisers, and fuel),\
    \ the total applied\nquantity is very low, mirroring a low total impact on GHGs\
    \ [124].\n5.5.3. Impacts of the Use of VRPA on Productivity and Farm Economics\n\
    Beneﬁts of variable rate pesticide spraying are mainly associated with savings\
    \ on pesticide use.\nSince most research has been done in the area of herbicide\
    \ application (vide supra), the focus of this\nsection lies on the economic impact\
    \ of VR herbicide application.\nOriade et al. (1996) [125] suggested that weed\
    \ patchiness is the most important factor economically\njustifying the use of\
    \ site-speciﬁc weed control. Using simulation, they showed that economic and\n\
    environmental beneﬁts are almost zero at low weed pressures, particularly if weeds\
    \ are evenly\nspread. The beneﬁts were larger as weed populations and level of\
    \ patchiness increased. At high\nweed patchiness, return values of 17 €/ha to\
    \ 33 €/ha were found in corn and soybean. The authors\nconcluded that returns\
    \ from site-speciﬁc management of less than 14 €/ha are not sufﬁcient to warrant\n\
    the practice. The costs of information collection, time application effects, and\
    \ human capital were not\nconsidered in this model. Beside pesticide saving, more\
    \ savings are possible from shorter times per\nhectare for ﬁlling the tank and\
    \ carrying the spray mixture to the ﬁeld by reducing the volume that is\nneeded\
    \ per hectare [113].\nSwinton (2003) [126] states that research results on the\
    \ proﬁtability of site-speciﬁc weed\nmanagement are very variable, because certain\
    \ studies focus only on potential reduced cost from less\nherbicide spraying,\
    \ while ignoring the increased capital cost of VR application equipment and the\n\
    increased variable cost of information processing. Other studies do take these\
    \ last two factors into\naccount, which results in more realistic numbers on proﬁtability.\
    \ Timmermann et al. (2003) [113]\nfound that the monetary savings resulting from\
    \ the reduction in herbicide use varied between crops,\ndepending on the amount\
    \ of herbicides saved and the price of herbicide. In maize, winter wheat,\nwinter\
    \ barley and sugar beet, savings of, respectively, 42 €/ha, 32 €/ha, 27 €/ha,\
    \ and 20 €/ha were\nrealised. In this regard, savings also depend on the different\
    \ economic thresholds for pest control\nand the different competitive power of\
    \ the crops. Batte and Ehsani (2006) [123] estimated spray\nmaterial savings of\
    \ about 4 €/ha for a map-based spraying system compared to a self-propelled\n\
    sprayer without any form of GPS for guidance assistance or sprayer control. The\
    \ magnitude of input\nsavings further increased as waterways were added to the\
    \ ﬁeld. Those authors also calculated the\ncosts of the map-based spraying system,\
    \ being 2911 €, 3004 € and 3096 € per year in extra costs for\nsprayers with a\
    \ boom width of 18.3, 27.4 and 36.6 meter, respectively. Most of the costs are\
    \ related\nto the ﬁxed investment which diminishes per hectare as farm size increases.\
    \ They also conclude that\nthe beneﬁts increase proportionally to the cost of\
    \ the pesticide being applied, the number of annual\napplications, and the driver\
    \ error-rate of the non-precision spraying system.\nGerhards and Sökefeld (2003)\
    \ [127] evaluated the economic beneﬁts of a real-time, automatic,\nsite-speciﬁc\
    \ weed control system compared to conventional ﬁeld spraying. They found that,\
    \ although\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n18 of 28\nthe costs (ﬁxed + variable)\
    \ for the VR technology were larger (9.56 €/ha vs. 5.20 €/ha), the average\ncosts\
    \ for weed control were lower due to herbicide savings (32 €/ha vs. 68 €/ha in\
    \ winter wheat and\nwinter barley, 69 €/ha vs. 148 €/ha in sugar beet, and 96\
    \ €/ha vs. 103 €/ha in maize). Based on these\neconomic calculations, Dammer and\
    \ Wartenberg (2007) [117] comment that, if sensors were available\non the market,\
    \ it would be proﬁtable for farmers to invest in VR technologies.\nCosts of map-based\
    \ VRPA are attributed to mapping, data processing, decision making and\nsite-speciﬁc\
    \ application technology. Commercial mapping services typically charge 4.5–9.0\
    \ €/ha to\nmap ﬁeld boundaries including waterways and other physical features\
    \ [123]. Gerhards and Sökefeld\n(2003) [127] estimated the costs of a direct injection\
    \ system at 3.9 €/ha (in addition to the costs of the\nsprayer) for weed control\
    \ in sugar beet, maize, winter wheat and winter barley in a German study.\nBatte\
    \ and Ehsani (2006) [123] stated that the extra cost of a precision sprayer equipped\
    \ with individually\ncontrolled nozzles based on GNSS information would be about\
    \ 8000 €. However, Timmermann et al.\n(2003) [113] commented that several components\
    \ of VR technology, including GNSS, board computer\nand GIS, can also be used\
    \ for other precision farming activities such as planting, fertilisation and\n\
    harvest, and can therefore not be considered as a cost that is solely related\
    \ to VRPA.\nIn contrast to map-based VRPA, an additional step of generating an\
    \ application map with the\nhelp of GIS is not necessary. Therefore, there are\
    \ no additional costs for computers, GIS software or\nDGPS. However, the sensor\
    \ technology can be very expensive, although cheap sensors are available as\n\
    well. Gerhards and Sökefeld (2003) [127] estimated the cost of a camera system\
    \ for weed detection at\n40,000 €, whereas Dammer and Wartenberg (2007) [117]\
    \ used an optoelectronic weed sensor of about\n2000 €. The latter could however\
    \ not distinguish between crops and weeds and was therefore limited\nin its operations.\
    \ In a study on maize-based cropping systems, experts within Europe evaluated\
    \ that\nprecision spraying using GPS spray maps can result in a net proﬁt within\
    \ a time frame of 3–4 years [128].\n5.6. Variable Rate Planting/Seeding (VRP/VRS)\n\
    5.6.1. Description\nVariable rate planting/seeding (VRP/VRS) is the method of\
    \ varying the rate of plants or seeds\naccording to local soil potential. Regular\
    \ planters/seeders are based on the constant rate of plants or\nseeds through\
    \ a ground drive wheel, while VR systems is equipped with independent gear box\n\
    or hydraulic drive that is controlled according to the needs of the certain part\
    \ of the ﬁeld [42].\nMore advanced systems have independent planting/seeding elements\
    \ that can also differentiate\nthe application rate on-the-go per row [129]. A\
    \ prescription map is required. VRP/VRS eliminate\ndouble planting in headlands\
    \ and point rows and in very heterogeneous ﬁelds redistribute within\nﬁeld seeds\
    \ in the optimum quantity. VRP/VRS can perform better in heterogeneous ﬁelds because\n\
    seed rate differentiation will affect the yield in low crop performance zones\
    \ and the ﬁnal output will\nbe in favour of the farmer.\nAnother technology developed\
    \ in recent years is multi-hybrid planting/seeding. Machine\nmanufacturers have\
    \ started developing seeding machines that are able to seed two or more different\n\
    hybrids at the same time: one high demanding and high yielding hybrid which is\
    \ sown on the high\nperformance zones of a ﬁeld, while the other hybrid is a more\
    \ resilient, but less yielding hybrid, which\nis sown on the low performance zones\
    \ of the same ﬁeld. The input-side of the technology is similar\nto the input\
    \ used for VRA planters/seeders. The difference between the two technologies is\
    \ found\non the output side. Multi-hybrid planting/seeding needs two (or more)\
    \ separate seed hoppers and\nan adapted seed dispensing system.\n5.6.2. GHG Emission\
    \ Reduction Potential through VRP/VRS\nWhen applying VRP/VRS it is possible that\
    \ the total plant/seed quantity used in the ﬁeld will\nbe lower (less GHG emissions\
    \ coming from the production of the plant or the seed) or the same as\nin conventional\
    \ seeding. Nevertheless, an effect of VRP/VRS on GHG emissions can be expected\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n19 of 28\nthrough the increased yield [130]. Another\
    \ means of GHG reduction is the decreased fuel required for\ngenerating the same\
    \ amount of harvest, since through VRP/VRS more harvest can be produced on\na\
    \ given soil surface.\n5.6.3. Impacts of the Use of VRP/VRS on Productivity and\
    \ Farm Economics\nThe main beneﬁt from VRP/VRS is an increase in yield (vide infra).\
    \ The main factor driving the\neconomic performance of VRP/VRS is soil variability.\
    \ In very uniform ﬁelds, the return on investment\nof VRP/VRS will be low, while,\
    \ in heterogeneous ﬁelds with differentiated performance zones, the\nreturn on\
    \ investment will be much higher. In the early years of VRP/VRS development, its\
    \ economic\nimpact was unclear.\nVariable seeding rate of winter wheat can offer\
    \ increase in yield from 3% compared to uniform\nseeding [131]. Another research\
    \ showed that farmers using variable rate seeding have achieved\nan average winter\
    \ wheat yield beneﬁt of 4.6% over and above farmers drilling at a ﬂat rate. This\
    \ makes\nthe average winter wheat yield beneﬁt over the four years of study (2011–2014)\
    \ to be 6.45% [132].\nCorn yields can be increased by 6% using VRS [133]. Although\
    \ VRS dates back at the ﬁrst years of\nprecision agriculture movement, its importance\
    \ was recently acknowledged by farmers. Speciﬁcally,\n10–12% climb in acquisition\
    \ of VRS drills and planters was noticed in USA in 2007 [134].\nBullock et al.\
    \ (1998) [135] observed differences in economically optimal plant densities for\
    \ different\nﬁeld qualities: they estimated that areas of the ﬁeld with higher\
    \ yield potential could beneﬁt from\na higher plant density. At the time, they\
    \ concluded that VRS would be infeasible, because of the high\ncost associated\
    \ with characterizing site variability. Another work stated that the investments\
    \ necessary\nfor adopting variable rate corn seeding would only be economically\
    \ justiﬁable for farmers with some\nlow yield potential land, where signiﬁcant\
    \ seeds savings and yield gains can be made, but not for\nfarmers with a mix of\
    \ solely medium and high potential land [136]. Taylor and Staggenborg (2000) [137]\n\
    concluded that VRS was only economically feasible on their ﬁelds of study if less\
    \ expensive ways to\ngenerate the prescription map were available or if corn showed\
    \ a greater yield response to seeding\nrate. Shanahan et al. (2004) [138] stated\
    \ that “site-speciﬁc management of plant densities may be [ed:\neconomically]\
    \ feasible”, most likely due to technological advances. Dillon et al. (2009) [139]\
    \ performed\nsensitivity analysis with respect to alternative soils, seed price,\
    \ wheat price and cost of VRS technology\nto determine the economic feasibility\
    \ of VRS and concluded that the practice of VRS of wheat in\nFrance is economically\
    \ feasible. Hörbe et al. (2013) [130] performed two experiments that tested the\n\
    economic returns of VRS in maize according to a prescription map with three management\
    \ zones, i.e.\na low crop performance zone (LZ), receiving 31% less seeds/ha,\
    \ a medium crop performance zone\n(MZ), receiving the normal seeding rate, and\
    \ a high crop performance zone (HZ) receiving 13% more\nseeds/ha. This resulted\
    \ in a yield increase of 1.20 and 1.90 tons/ha in the LZ of the two experiments,\n\
    and 0.89 and 0.94 tons/ha in the HZ. In the second experiment, carried out one\
    \ year after the ﬁrst,\nin growing season 2010–2011, this resulted to a partial\
    \ net income (excluding extra costs for the VR\nseeder) that was around 7% higher\
    \ than in the same ﬁeld seeded with a ﬂat rate over the entire ﬁeld.\nIn total,\
    \ 71.5% of this higher net income was gained in the LZ, although the LZ area was\
    \ smaller than\nthe HZ area (22% vs. 28% of the total ﬁeld area, respectively).\n\
    A study of automatic section control systems in VR planters among 52 ﬁelds showed\
    \ a percentage\nof double-planted area to reach up to 15.5% and the savings from\
    \ the use of VR planters ranged from\n3.5 to 22.9 €/ha depending on the farming\
    \ operation and the ﬁeld type [140].\nNo independent scientiﬁc research on the\
    \ economic impact of multi-hybrid planting/seeding is\ncurrently available, because\
    \ this technology has been developed very recently.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n\
    20 of 28\n5.7. Precision Physical Weeding Technology (PPW)\n5.7.1. Description\
    \ of PPW Technology\nPrecision physical weeding (PPW) technology is the method\
    \ of weed control through burning,\nmechanical weed control with knives, discs,\
    \ hoes or harrows with minimum crop damage and no\nchemical herbicide use. The\
    \ technology is still in its infancy, with some prototypes that use precise\n\
    guidance and detection systems being available.\nThe most promising approach for\
    \ weed detection is a continuous ground-based image analysis\nsystem that locate\
    \ crop row in the ﬁeld [141]. In this work, the design and development of an automatic\n\
    machine able to perform, at the same time, mechanical and thermal weed control\
    \ on maize was\nreported. Other detection system would be ultrasonic sensors that\
    \ detect plant density that when\nit is increased the harrow treats this part\
    \ more aggressively [142]. In this work, a system for online\nweed control was\
    \ developed. It automatically adjusts the tine angle of a harrow and creates different\n\
    levels of intensity (gentle to aggressive). A hybrid physical/chemical weeding\
    \ system is mentioned\nby Norremark (2010) [143]. A robotic physical weeding system\
    \ is applied in sugar beet that execute\nreal-time weed infestation survey and\
    \ apply four-row intra-row precision weed control implement\ncombined with four-row\
    \ precision spraying (10% of normal herbicide dose rate). It can also combine\n\
    an inter–row weed control implement that increases its efﬁciency.\n5.7.2. GHG\
    \ emission Reduction Potential through PPW\nPrecision physical weeding technology\
    \ might have an effect on reducing GHG emissions\nthrough the production of the\
    \ avoided pesticides. In the case of mechanical precision weeding,\nfuel consumption\
    \ will also be reduced (and the respective GHGs) because the tractor pulling the\n\
    weeding implement will confront lower draught forces coming from soil tilling\
    \ when the angle of the\nharrow tines will be less aggressive than with the conventional\
    \ tillers [142]. In the case of precision\nthermal weed control, the fuel for\
    \ weed burning is expected to be lowered reﬂecting in GHG emissions\nin comparison\
    \ to conventional weed burning implements that have continuous ﬂame covering all\
    \ ﬁeld\nsurface. However, if thermal weed control is applied in ﬁelds that the\
    \ conventional weeding is based\nin mechanical tillage then the GHGs from burning\
    \ weeds will contribute negatively in climate change.\nIn addition, when conventional\
    \ chemical weeding is substituted from precision thermal weeding, the\nGHG emissions\
    \ coming from pesticides reduction will be partially compensated from the emissions\n\
    emitted from weed burning. As in the case of VR pesticide application, the impact\
    \ on the avoided\nGHG emissions of the total agricultural system is expected to\
    \ be low.\n5.7.3. Impacts of PPW on Productivity and Farm Economics\nThe hybrid\
    \ mechanical/chemical system showed total estimated cost reduction for 10-year\n\
    depreciation and 5% interest rate was 12% (in particular 260 €/ha, while conventional\
    \ weeding\ncosts 297 €/ha) in a 80 ha ﬁeld size working 667 hours per year. When\
    \ the inter-row weed control\nimplement is added to the system, the cost reduction\
    \ can reach 24%. This is due to the reduction in\ntotal weed management costs\
    \ compared to the conventional [143]. Peruzzi et al. (2008) [144] worked\non physical\
    \ weed control in open ﬁeld tomatoes by applying a rolling harrow and a ﬂaming\
    \ machine\nin pre-transplanting together with precision hoeing in post-transplanting.\
    \ It was noticed that yield\nincreased by 15–20% due to better weed management\
    \ which resulted in 400–700 €/ha on top of the\nnormal harvest.\n6. Conclusions\n\
    Climate change is a fact, and anthropogenic activities are one of the parameters\
    \ accelerating the\nphenomenon. Through the years, agriculture did not receive\
    \ great attention in terms of GHG emission\nproduction, as yield increase was\
    \ the target. In the recent past, analysis of the impact of this sector on\nclimate\
    \ change has been executed and several mitigation measures were proposed.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 1339\n21 of 28\nPA has several positive impacts on agricultural systems\
    \ translated to increased farm productivity\nand income and recently there is\
    \ signiﬁcant interest on the possible GHG emission mitigation using\nPATs. However,\
    \ literature is limited on data regarding the effect of PA on climate change.\
    \ All categories\nof PATs (guidance, recording, and reacting) contribute to the\
    \ reduction of GHG emissions due to their\ninterconnections and it is difﬁcult\
    \ to separate them according to importance. Recording and GNSS\ntechnologies are\
    \ supportive in the PA process, while reacting technologies and guidance systems\
    \ have\na direct visible result on the agricultural system that are applied on.\
    \ Hence, these PATs were analysed\naccording to their potential to reduce GHG\
    \ emissions and improve farm productivity and income.\n•\nVariable rate nutrient\
    \ application (VRNA) technologies can reduce the fertilizer quantities applied\n\
    in modern agriculture by using technology to cover site-speciﬁc nutrient needs.\
    \ VRNA can be\napplied to all nutrient application, with nitrogen being the most\
    \ important to be regulated through\nthese technologies as it is the element that\
    \ is mostly used for crop growth increase and covers the\nhighest percentage of\
    \ fertilizers globally. Therefore, VRNA can signiﬁcantly contribute in accurate\n\
    nutrient management, which can be translated to reduction of GHG emissions and\
    \ especially\nnitrogen that is responsible for N2O release (the GHG derived from\
    \ agricultural activities with the\nhighest global warming potential). They can\
    \ also affect positively farm productivity and income\nby increasing ﬁnal yield\
    \ especially in low productivity sections of a farm and by reducing the\nfertilization\
    \ costs that follows optimized application of nitrogen according to the plants’\
    \ needs.\n•\nVariable rate irrigation (VRI) systems have the following GHG emission\
    \ reduction potential, as its\nimpact is dual: primarily, the decrease of irrigated\
    \ water reduces the energy for water pumping,\nand, secondly, the optimum irrigation\
    \ scheduling affect signiﬁcantly the release of GHG emissions\nderived from fertilisers\
    \ through the soil (mainly N2O). In terms of productivity, the impact is\nalso\
    \ signiﬁcant, particularly in dry areas, as irrigation scheduling kai dosage can\
    \ be optimized\nresulting in economic beneﬁts (lower pumping costs combined with\
    \ higher yields).\n•\nControlled Trafﬁc Farming (CTF) and machine guidance (MG)\
    \ limit the use of tractors to only the\nnecessary passes through the ﬁelds avoiding\
    \ overlapping with respective decrease in agricultural\ninputs and fuel (translated\
    \ into GHG emissions reduction and lower cost of production). Variable\nrate pesticide\
    \ application (VRPA) is also expected to have GHG reduction potential by reducing\n\
    the pesticide application and its industrial production. However, the actual environmental\
    \ effect\ncan be extremely signiﬁcant, but through lower chemical substances application\
    \ that contaminates\nall natural resources (water, air, and soil). The effect\
    \ on farm economics is also major, especially in\ncrops that receive many chemical\
    \ applications, such as herbicides and fungicides.\n•\nVariable rate planting/seeding\
    \ (VRP/VRS) and precision physical weeding (PPW) show lower,\nbut not irrelevant\
    \ GHG emission mitigation. VRP/VRS is mainly important for optimising\nplant density\
    \ in the ﬁeld that can increase farm productivity, while the reduction in seed/plant\n\
    population is associated with GHG emissions during their production. PPW reduces\
    \ pesticide\napplication and fuel used for ﬂame burning of weeds.\nIt is believed\
    \ that PA adoption can be increased signiﬁcantly if the PATs available in the\
    \ market\nwould combine more precise and robust sensors specialised for each activity\
    \ and the end-users\n(farmers) will receive quantiﬁed information of the farm\
    \ proﬁt augmentation and the positive\nsustainability impact, combined with reduced\
    \ investment cost for PAT purchase. Therefore, there\nis a necessity that more\
    \ research should be carried out on quantifying the impact of PATs on GHG\nemissions\
    \ reduction and the respective productivity and income inﬂuence, as there is strong\
    \ evidence\nof the contribution of PATs to climate change mitigation and the increase\
    \ of production efﬁciency (yield\nand economics). Speciﬁc attention should be\
    \ given to research of different macronutrients impact\n(direct and indirect)\
    \ on GHG emissions by regulating the status of each element in crops. Optimised\n\
    methods of application could maintain the amount of essential nutrients in desired\
    \ quantity that will\nprimarily reduce undesired yield loss that could be due\
    \ to unknown stresses coming from unbalanced\nnutrient combination, and secondly\
    \ will improve the carbon footprint of crops.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 1339\n\

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Despite the perception people may have regarding
    the agricultural process, the reality is that today''s agriculture industry is
    data-centered, precise, and smarter than ever. The rapid emergence of the Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) based technologies redesigned almost every industry including “smart agriculture”
    which moved the industry from statistical to quantitative approaches. Such revolutionary
    changes are shaking the existing agriculture methods and creating new opportunities
    along a range of challenges. This article highlights the potential of wireless
    sensors and IoT in agriculture, as well as the challenges expected to be faced
    when integrating this technology with the traditional farming practices. IoT devices
    and communication techniques associated with wireless sensors encountered in agriculture
    applications are analyzed in detail. What sensors are available for specific agriculture
    application, like soil preparation, crop status, irrigation, insect and pest detection
    are listed. How this technology helping the growers throughout the crop stages,
    from sowing until harvesting, packing and transportation is explained. Furthermore,
    the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for crop surveillance and other favorable
    applications such as optimizing crop yield is considered in this article. State-of-the-art
    IoT-based architectures and platforms used in agriculture are also highlighted
    wherever suitable. Finally, based on this thorough review, we identify current
    and future trends of IoT in agriculture and highlight potential research challenges.

    I. Introduction To improve the agricultural yield with fewer resources and labor
    efforts, substantial innovations have been made throughout human history. Nevertheless,
    the high population rate never let the demand and supply match during all these
    times. According to the forecasted figures, in 2050, the world population is expected
    to touch 9.8 billion, an increase of approximately 25% from the current figure
    [1]. Almost the entire mentioned rise of population is forecasted to occur among
    the developing countries [2]. On the other side, the trend of urbanization is
    forecasted to continue at an accelerated pace, with about 70% of the world’s population
    predicted to be urban until 2050 (currently 49%) [3]. Furthermore, income levels
    will be multiples of what they are now, which will drive the food demand further,
    especially in developing countries. As a result, these nations will be more careful
    about their diet and food quality; hence, consumer preferences can move from wheat
    and grains to legumes and, later, to meat. In order to feed this larger, more
    urban, and richer population, food production should double by 2050 [4], [5].
    Particularly, the current figure of 2.1 billion tons of annual cereal production
    should touch approximately 3 billion tons, and the annual meat production should
    increase by more than 200 million tons to fulfill the demand of 470 million tons
    [6], [7]. Not only for food, but crop production is becoming equally critical
    for industry; indeed crops like cotton, rubber, and gum are playing important
    roles in the economies of many nations. Furthermore, the food-crops-based bioenergy
    market started to increase recently. Even before a decade, only the production
    of ethanol utilized 110 million tons of coarse grains (approximately 10% of the
    world production) [7], [8]. Due to the rising utilization of food crops for bio-fuel
    production, bio-energy, and other industrial usages, food security is at stake.
    These demands are resulting in a further increase of the pressure on already scarce
    agricultural resources. Unfortunately, only a limited portion of the earth’s surface
    is suitable for agriculture uses due to various limitations, like temperature,
    climate, topography, and soil quality, and even most of the suitable areas are
    not homogenous. When zooming the versatilities of landscapes and plant types,
    many new differences start to emerge that can be difficult to quantify. Moreover,
    the available agricultural land is further shaped by political and economic factors,
    like land and climate patterns and population density, while rapid urbanization
    is constantly posing threats to the availability of arable land. Over the past
    decades, the total agriculture land utilized for food production has experienced
    a decline [9]. In 1991, the total arable area for food production was 19.5 million
    square miles (39.47% of the world’s land area), which was reduced to approximately
    18.6 million square miles (37.73% of the world’s land area) in 2013 [10]. As such,
    the gap between demand and supply of food is becoming more significant and alarming
    with the passage of time. Further examination showed that every crop field has
    different characteristics that can be measured separately in terms of both quality
    and quantity. Critical characteristics, like soil type, nutrient presence, flow
    of irrigation, pest resistance, etc., define its suitability and capability for
    a specific crop. In most of situations, the differentiations of characteristics
    can exist within a single crop field, even if the same crop is being cultivated
    in entire farm; hence, site-specific analyses are required for optimal yield production.
    Further, adding the dimension of time, specific crops in the same field rotate
    season-to-season and biologically reach different stages of their cycle within
    a year in areas where locational and temporal differences result in specific growth
    requirements to optimize the crop production. To respond to these demands with
    a range of issues, farmers need new technology-based methods to produce more from
    less land and with fewer hands. Considering the standard farming procedures, farmers
    need to visit the agriculture sites frequently throughout the crop life to have
    a better idea about the crop conditions. For this, the need of smart agriculture
    arises, as 70% of farming time is spent monitoring and understanding the crop
    states instead of doing actual field work [11]. Considering the vastness of the
    agriculture industry, it incredibly demands for technological and precise solutions
    with the aim of sustainability while leaving minimum environmental impact. Recent
    sensing and communication technologies provide a true remote “eye in the field”
    ability in which farmers can observe happenings in the field without being in
    the field. Wireless sensors are facilitating the monitoring of crops constantly
    with higher accuracy and are able to, most importantly, detect early stages of
    unwanted state. This is the reason why modern agriculture involves the usage of
    smart tools and kits, from sowing to crop harvesting and even during storage and
    transportation. Timely reporting using a range of sensors makes the entire operation
    not only smart but also cost effective due to its precise monitoring capabilities.
    Variety of autonomous tractors, harvesters, robotic weeders, drones, and satellites
    currently complement agriculture equipment. Sensors can be installed and start
    collecting data in a short time, which is then available online for further analyses
    nearly immediately. Sensor technology offers crop and site-specific agriculture,
    as it supports precise data collection of every site. Recently, the Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) is beginning to impact a wide array of sectors and industries, ranging from
    manufacturing, health, communications, and energy to the agriculture industry,
    in order to reduce inefficiencies and improve the performance across all markets
    [12]–[16]. If looking closely, one feels that the current applications are only
    scratching the surface and that the real impact of IoT and its uses are not yet
    witnessed. Still, considering this progress, especially in the near past, we can
    predict that IoT technologies are going to play a key role in various applications
    of the agriculture sector. This is because of the capabilities offered by IoT,
    including the basic communication infrastructure (used to connect the smart objects—from
    sensors, vehicles, to user mobile devices—using the Internet) and range of services,
    such as local or remote data acquisition, cloud-based intelligent information
    analysis and decision making, user interfacing, and agriculture operation automation.
    Such capabilities can revolutionize the agriculture industry which probably one
    of most inefficient sectors of our economic value chain today. To summarize this
    discussion, figure 1 provides the main drivers of technology, while figure 2 highlights
    the major hurdles of technology implementation in smart agriculture. FIGURE 1.
    Key drivers of technology in agriculture industry. Show All FIGURE 2. Major hurdle’s
    in technology implementation for smart agriculture. Show All Researchers and engineers
    around the globe are proposing different methods and architectures and based on
    that suggesting a variety of equipment to monitor and fetch the information regarding
    crop status during different stages, considering numerous crop and field types.
    Focusing on the market demand, many leading manufactures are providing a range
    of sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robots, communication devices, and
    other heavy machinery to deliver the sensed data. In addition, various commissions,
    food and agriculture organizations, and government bodies are developing polices
    and guidelines to observe and regulate the use of these technologies in order
    to maintain food and environment safety [17]–[20]. There are reasonable efforts
    that highlight the role of the IoT in the agriculture industry, but most of the
    published work focuses only on applications [10], [21], [22]. Most of the existing
    articles either provide no insight or show limited focus on the various IoT-based
    architectures, prototypes, advanced methods, the use of IoT for food quality,
    and other future issues considering the latest facts and figures. This manuscript
    examines the trends in IoT-based agriculture research and reveals numerous key
    issues that must be addressed in order to transform the agriculture industry by
    utilizing the recent IoT developments. The major contribution of this article
    is to provide real insight regarding: Expectations of the world from the agriculture
    industry Very recent developments in IoT, both scholarly and in industry are highlighted
    and how these developments are helping to provide solutions to the agriculture
    industry. Limitations, the agriculture industry is facing. Role of IoT to cope
    these limitations and other issues like resources shortage and their precise use,
    food spoilage, climate changes, environmental pollution, and urbanization. Strategies
    and policies that need to be considered when implementing IoT-based technologies
    Critical issues that are left to solve and possible solutions that are further
    required, while suggestions are provided considering these challenges. This article
    is a compendium of knowledge that can help the researchers and agriculture engineers
    implementing the IoT-based technologies to achieve the desired smart agriculture.
    The rest of this document is organized as follows. Section II provides a deep
    overview of major applications of IoT in agriculture and what we can achieve by
    utilizing these technologies. Section III gives insight regarding the role of
    IoT in advanced agriculture practices, like vertical farming (VF), hydroponics,
    and phenotyping, to manage the issues of increased urban population. Section IV
    highlights various technologies and equipment, like sensors, robots, tractors,
    and communication devices, being used to implement IoT in this industry. Accepting
    the worth of UAVs in precision agriculture, Section V caters application achievements
    that are not possible even using other latest technologies. Food safety and transportation
    are other critical areas requiring focus to overcome the hunger issues which did
    not get the attention of researchers as it deserves. Section VI supplies the role
    of the IoT to ensure food quality for longer periods and to deliver to remote
    areas. Section VII identifies current and future trends of this technology in
    the crop industry by highlighting potential research challenges. Finally, Section
    VIII concludes this article. SECTION II. Major Applications By implementing the
    latest sensing and IoT technologies in agriculture practices, every aspect of
    traditional farming methods can be fundamentally changed. Currently, seamless
    integration of wireless sensors and the IoT in smart agriculture can raise agriculture
    to levels which were previously unimaginable. By following the practices of smart
    agriculture, IoT can help to improve the solutions of many traditional farming
    issues, like drought response, yield optimization, land suitability, irrigation,
    and pest control. Figure 3 lists a hierarchy of major applications, services and
    wireless sensors being used for smart agriculture applications. While, major instances
    in which the advanced technologies are helping at various stages to enhance overall
    efficiency are discussed below. FIGURE 3. General hierarchy of possible applications,
    services and sensors for smart agriculture. Show All A. Soil Sampling and Mapping
    Soil is the “stomach” of plants, and its sampling is the first step of examination
    to obtain field-specific information, which is then further used to make various
    critical decisions at different stages. The main objective of soil analysis is
    to determine the nutrient status of a field so that measures can be taken accordingly
    when nutrient deficiencies are found. Comprehensive soil tests are recommended
    on an annual basis, ideally in Spring; however, based on soil conditions and weather
    consents, it may be done in in Fall or Winter [23]. The factors that are critical
    to analyze the soil nutrient levels include soil type, cropping history, fertilizer
    application, irrigation level, topography, etc. These factors give insight regarding
    the chemical, physical, and biological statuses of a soil to identify the limiting
    factors such that the crops can be dealt accordingly. Soil mapping opens the door
    to sowing different crop varieties in a specific field to better match soil properties
    accordingly, like seed suitability, time to sow, and even the planting depth,
    as some are deep-rooted and others less. Furthermore, growing multiple crops together
    could also lead to smarter use of agriculture, simply making the best use of resources.
    Currently, manufacturers are providing a wide range of toolkits and sensors that
    can assist farmers to track the soil quality and, based on this data, recommend
    remedies to avoid its degradation. These systems allow for the monitoring of soil
    properties, such as texture, water-holding capacity, and absorption rate, which
    ultimately help to minimize erosion, densification, salinization, acidification,
    and pollution (by avoiding excessive use of fertilizer). Lab-in-a-Box, a soil
    testing tool kit developed by AgroCares, is considered a complete laboratory in
    itself based on its offered services [24]. By using this, any farmer, without
    having any lab experience, can analyze up to 100 samples per day (overall, more
    than 22,000 nutrient samples a year) without visiting any lab. Drought is a major
    concern which limits the productivity of crop yield. Most of the regions around
    the globe face this issue with various intensities. To deal with this issue, especially
    in very rural areas, remote sensing is being used to obtain frequent soil moisture
    data which helps to analyze the agricultural drought in far regions. For this
    purpose, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite was launched in
    2009 which provides global soil moisture maps every, one to two days. Authors
    in [25] used SMOS L2 to calculate the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) in Spain
    in 2014. In this effort, they followed different approaches to obtain the soil
    water parameters in order to compare with the SWDI acquired from in situ data.
    In [26], authors used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    sensor to map various soil functional properties to estimate the land degradation
    risk for sub-Saharan Africa. The soil maps and field survey data, which covered
    all major climate zones on the continent, were used to develop the prediction
    models. Sensors and vision based technologies are helpful to decide the distance
    and depth for sowing the seed efficiently. Like in [27], sensor and vision based
    autonomous robot called Agribot is developed for sowing seeds. The robot can perform
    on any agricultural lands on which the self-awareness of the robot’s placement
    is ascertained through the global and local maps generated from Global Positioning
    System (GPS) while the on-board vision system is paired with a personal computer.
    Advancing further, various non-contact sensing methods are proposed to determine
    the seed flow rate as in [28] where the sensors are equipped with LEDs; consist
    of infrared, visible light and laser-LED as well as an element as a radiation
    receiver. The output voltage varies based on the movement of the seeds through
    the sensor and band of light rays, and falling of shades on the elements of receiver.
    The signal information, linked to the passing seeds, is used to measure the seed
    flow rate. B. Irrigation About 97% of Earth’s water is salt-water held by oceans
    and seas, and only the remaining 3% is fresh water—more than two-third of which
    is frozen in the forms of glaciers and polar ice caps [29], [30]. Only 0.5% of
    the unfrozen fresh water is above the ground or in the air, as the rest lies underground
    [31]. In short, humanity relies on this 0.5% to fulfill all its requirements and
    to maintain the ecosystem, as enough fresh water must be kept in rivers, lakes,
    and other similar reservoirs to sustain it. It is worth mentioning that solely
    the agriculture industry uses approximately 70% of this accessible fresh water
    [32], [33]. In many countries, situation rises to 75% e.g. Brazil, further in
    some underdeveloped countries, even it exceeds 80% [34]. The main reason for this
    high water consumption is the monitoring procedure as even in 2013, crops visual
    inspection for irrigation decision-making was very common, as nearly 80% of farms
    in United States were observed by this [10], [35]. According to the UN Convention
    to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) estimates in 2013 show that there were 168 countries
    affected by desertification and by 2030, almost half of the world population will
    be living in areas with high water shortages [36]. Considering the figures of
    water crises around the globe, same time its increasing demands in agriculture
    and many other industries, it should be provided to places only where it is needed,
    most importantly, in required quantities. For this purpose, increased awareness
    has been implemented to conserve the existing under-stress water resources by
    employing more efficient irrigation systems. Various controlled irrigation methods,
    like drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation, are being promoted to tackle the
    water wastage issues, which were also found in traditional methods like flood
    irrigation and furrow irrigation. Both the crop quality and quantity are badly
    affected when facing water shortage, as irregular irrigation, even excess, leads
    to reduced soil nutrients and provokes different microbial infections. It is not
    a simple task to accurately estimate the water demand of crops, where factors
    like crop type, irrigation method, soil type, precipitation, crop needs, and soil
    moisture retention are involved. Considering this fact, a precise soil and air
    moisture control system using the wireless sensors not only makes an optimal use
    of water but also leads to better crop health. The current situation of irrigation
    methods is expected to be changed by adopting the emerging IoT technologies. A
    significant increase in crop efficiency is expected with the use of IoT based
    techniques, such as crop water stress index (CWSI)-based irrigation management
    [10], [35]. For this, attaining crop canopy at different periods and air temperature
    are needed for the calculation of CWSI. A wireless sensors based monitoring system
    where all the field sensors are connected to collect the mentioned measurements,
    further transmit to processing center where corresponding intelligent software
    applications are used to analyze the farm data. Not only this but information
    from other sources including weather data and satellite imaging is applied to
    CWSI models for water need assessment, and finally specific irrigation index value
    is produced for each site. A prominent example is VRI (Variable Rate Irrigation)
    optimization by CropMetrics [37], which works according to topography or soil
    variability, ultimately improves the water use efficiency. C. Fertilizer A fertilizer
    is a natural or chemical substance that can provide important nutrients for the
    growth and fertility of plants. Plants mainly need three key macronutrients: nitrogen
    (N) for leaf growth; phosphorus (P) for root, flowers, and fruit development;
    potassium (K) for stem growth and water movement [38]. Any sort of nutrients deficiency
    or applying them improperly can be seriously harmful for the plant health. More
    importantly, excessive use of fertilizer not only results in financial losses
    but also creates harmful impacts to the soil and environment by depleting the
    soil quality, poisoning ground water, and contributing to global climate changes.
    Overall, crops absorb less than half the nitrogen applied as fertilizer, while
    remaining either emitted to the atmosphere or lost as run off. Unbalanced use
    of fertilizer leads to an imbalance in both soil nutrient levels and global climate
    as, reportedly, around 80% of the world’s deforestation has occurred due to agricultural
    practices alone [39]. Fertilization under smart agriculture helps to precisely
    estimate the required dose of nutrients, ultimately minimize their negative effects
    on the environment. Fertilization requires site-specific soil nutrient level measurements
    based on various factors, such as crop type, soil type, soil absorption capability,
    product yield, fertility type and utilization rate, weather condition, etc. The
    reason is that the measurement of soil nutrient level is not only expensive but
    also time consuming, as, typically, investigations of soil samples at each location
    are required. To better depict this discussion, figure 4, summarizes the major
    inputs, processes and resultant outputs of smart agriculture. FIGURE 4. Some key
    inputs, processes involved and possible outputs of smart farming. Show All New
    IoT-based fertilizing approaches help to estimate the spatial patterns of nutrients
    requirements with a higher accuracy and minimum labor requirements [40], [41].
    For example, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) uses aerial/satellite
    images to monitor crop nutrient status [42], [43]. Basically, NDVI is based on
    the reflection of visible and near-infrared light from vegetation and is used
    to estimate the crop health, vegetation vigor, and density, further contributing
    to assess the soil nutrient level. Such precise implementation can significantly
    improve the fertilizer efficiency, simultaneously reducing the side effects to
    the environment. Many recent enabling technologies, like GPS accuracy [44], geo
    mapping [45], Variable Rate Technology (VRT) [46], [47], and autonomous vehicles
    [48], are strongly contributing to IoT-based smart fertilization. Other than precision
    fertilization, fertigation [49] and chemigation [50], [51] are other benefits
    of IoT. In these methods, water-soluble matters, such as fertilizers, soil amendments,
    and pesticides, can be applied through the irrigation system. Although, these
    methods are not new to agriculture and have been applied over last three decades,
    their precise use with real results has been witnessed only with IoT integration
    [52], [53]. Based on recent outcomes, fertigation is considered as the best management
    practice to improve the effectiveness of many agriculture matters; most importantly,
    it can be integrated with IoT-based smart farming infrastructure seamlessly. D.
    Crop Disease and Pest Management The Great Famine, also known as the Irish Potato
    Famine, in which approximately one million Irish people died around 1950, resulted
    due to crop failure and yield reduction caused by “potato blight” disease [54].
    Even today, corn growers in the US and southern Canada are facing an economic
    loss of approximately one billion USD due to “southern corn leaf blight” disease
    [55]. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 20–40% of global
    crop yields are lost annually due to pests and diseases [56]. To control such
    vast production losses, pesticides and other agrochemicals became an important
    component of the agriculture industry during the last century. It is estimated
    that, in each year, around half a million tons of pesticide are used in the US
    alone, while more than two-million tons are used globally [57]. Most of these
    pesticides are harmful to human and animal health, leaving severe, even irreversible,
    impact to the environment, ultimately causing significant contamination to entire
    ecosystems [58], [59]. Recent IoT based intelligent devices, such as wireless
    sensors, robots and drones are allowing the growers to slash pesticide uses significantly
    by precisely spotting crop enemies. Compared to traditional calendar or prescription
    based pest control procedures, modern IoT-based pest management provides real-time
    monitoring, modeling, disease forecasting, hence proving more effective [60],
    [61]. Generally, the reliability of crop disease monitoring and pest management
    depends on three aspects: sensing, evaluating, and treatment. The advanced disease
    and pest recognition approaches are based on image processing in which raw images
    are acquired throughout the crop area using field sensors, UAVs, or remote sensing
    satellites. Usually, remote sensing imagery covers large areas and, hence, offers
    higher efficiency with lower cost. On the other hand, field sensors are capable
    to support more functions in collecting data, like environment sampling, plant
    health, and pest situations, in every corner throughout the crop cycle. For example,
    IoT-based automated traps [62], [63] can capture, count, and even characterize
    insect types, further uploading data to the Cloud for detailed analysis, which
    is not possible through remote sensing. Approaches like vehicle precise spray
    and automatic VRT chemigation [64], commonly used under smart fertilization, can
    also be utilized for disease treatment and other pesticide applications. Moreover,
    the advancement of robotic technology offers new solutions. When equipping an
    agricultural robot with multispectral sensing devices and precision spraying nozzles,
    it can locate and deal with pest problems more precisely under the manipulation
    of a remote IoT disease management system. This IoT-based pest management system
    has many advantages, as it can reduce the overall expenditures while, at the same
    time, support the restoration of the natural climate. For example, recently, it
    has been found that yields of many crop types are facing severe threat due to
    the lack of pollination [65], [66]. In fact, the pollination is being affected
    due to bee colony collapse disorder resulting from the uncontrolled pesticides.
    E. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting, and Harvesting Yield monitoring is the mechanism
    used to analyze various aspects corresponding to agricultural yield, like grain
    mass flow, moisture content, and harvested grain quantity. It helps to accurately
    assess by recording the crop yield and moisture level to estimate, how well the
    crop performed and what to do next. Yield monitoring is considered an essential
    part of precision farming not only at the time of harvest but even before that,
    as monitoring the yield quality plays a crucial role. Yield quality depends on
    many factors, e.g. sufficient pollination with good quality pollen especially
    when predicting seed yields under changing environmental conditions [67]–[69].
    Currently, when we are dealing with more open markets, buyers around the world
    become more particular about fruit quality; hence, effective production depends
    on the right fruit size to the right market at the right time [13]. Crop forecasting
    is an art to predict the yield and production (tons/ha) before the harvest takes
    place. This forecasting helps the farmer for near-future planning and decision
    making. Furthermore, analyzing the yield quality and its maturity is another critical
    factor which enables the determination of the right time for harvesting. This
    monitoring covers various development stages and uses fruit conditions like its
    color, size, etc., for this purpose. Predicting the right harvesting time not
    only helps to maximize the crop quality and production but also provides an opportunity
    to adjust the management strategy. Although, harvesting is the last stage of this
    process, proper scheduling can make a clear difference. To obtain the real benefits
    from crops, farmers need to know when these crops are actually ready to harvest.
    Figure 5 represents a snapshot of a farm area network (FAN) that can portrait
    the whole farm to the farmer in real time. FIGURE 5. An IoT based farm area network
    (FAN). Show All A yield monitor, developed in [70], can be installed on any harvester
    combine and linked with the mobile app FarmRTX, which displays live harvest data
    and uploads it automatically to the manufacturer’s web-based platform. This app
    has the ability to generate high-quality yield maps and share these maps with
    an agronomist, and the farmer also has the option to export to other farm management
    software to analyze them. To estimate the production and quality of yield precisely,
    the measurement of fruit growth can be highly beneficial. This idea is used in
    [71], where authors considered the fruit growth as the most basic and relevant
    parameter to estimate that how well the crop is progressing. Satellite images
    can be a good option to monitor the yield of crops with vast areas. This method
    is utilized in [72], where authors used Sentinel-1A Interferometric images to
    map the rice crop yield and intensity in Myanmar. As we mentioned earlier in this
    section, fruit size always plays a critical role to estimate its maturation, making
    decisions regarding harvesting, and targeting the right market, for this purpose,
    color (RGB) depth images are used in [73] to track the different fruit conditions
    in mango farms. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used in [74] to monitor
    the shrinking of papayas, especially during drying conditions. SECTION III. Advanced
    Agricultural Practices Adopting the novel methods to enhance the quality and quantity
    of food is not something new, as humans have been doing this for centuries. Initially,
    we tried to enhance the crop production by focusing on seed variety, fertilizers,
    and pesticides. Soon it was realized that these conventional ways were not adequate
    enough to fit this demand gap; hence, agriculture scientists have begun thinking
    of other alternatives, like bioengineered (BE) foods. BE foods, also known as
    genetically modified (GM) or genetically engineered (GE) foods, are foods produced
    by introducing changes into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering.
    However, several studies highlight their serious effects on human health, including
    infertility, disruption in immune system, accelerated aging, faulty insulin regulations,
    etc. [75], [76]. All these and many other similar technologies did not receive
    much popularity and acceptance in society because people prefer bio and organic
    food. In this regards, massive research has been conducted for decades in which
    sensors and IoT-based technologies are helping to improve conventional agriculture
    processes to enhance yield production without, or with minimum, effect on its
    originality. For this purpose, new sophisticated and more controlled environments
    are projected to tackle the above-mentioned issues. The importance and involvement
    of new technologies is more critical, as we are moving toward more cultured and
    urban farming. In fact, it would not be incorrect for one to say that the success
    of these advanced practices is in doubt without using sensor-based technologies.
    A. Greenhouse Farming Greenhouse farming is considered the oldest method of smart
    farming. Although, the idea of growing plants in controlled environment is not
    new as found since Roman times but it gained popularity in 19th century where
    largest greenhouses were built in France, Netherlands and Italy. Further, the
    practice was accelerated in the mid-20th century and highly promoted in countries
    that facing harsh weather conditions [77]. Crops grown indoors are very less affected
    by environment; most importantly, they are not limited to receiving light only
    during the daytime. As a result, the crops that traditionally could only be grown
    under suitable conditions or in certain parts of the world are now being growing
    anytime and anywhere. This was the actual time in which sensors and communication
    devices started to support various agriculture applications genuinely. The success
    and production of various crops under such controlled environment depend on many
    factors, like accuracy of monitoring parameters, structure of shed, covering material
    to control wind effects, ventilation system, decision support system, etc. A detailed
    analysis is provided in [78], where all these factors, their impacts, and how
    wireless sensors can help for all this are considered. Precise monitoring of environment
    parameters is the most critical task in modern greenhouses, where several measurement
    points of various parameters are required to control and ensure the local climate.
    In [79], an IoT-based prototype is proposed to monitor the greenhouses where MicaZ
    nodes are used to measure the inside parameters like humidity, temperature, light,
    and pressure. B. Vertical Farming The world needs more farmable lands to fulfill
    increased food demands, but reality is that one-third arable land was lost during
    the last four decades due to erosion and pollution [80], [81]. Unfortunately,
    current agricultural practices based on industrial farming are damaging the soil
    quality far faster than nature can rebuild it. Overall, it is estimated that erosion
    rates from cultivated fields is 10 to 40 times greater than the soil formation
    rates [82]. Considering the reduction of arable land issues, it could be a disaster
    for food production in the near future with current agriculture practices. Further,
    as we mentioned, 70% of fresh water is only used for agriculture purpose, which
    can increase the burden on existing limited water reservoirs. Vertical Farming
    (VF) is an answer to meet the challenges of land and water shortages. VF in the
    form of urban agriculture offers an opportunity to stack the plants in a more
    controlled environment resulting in, most importantly, significant reduction in
    resource consumption. By following this method, we can increase the production
    multiple times, as only a fraction of ground surface is required (depending on
    the number of stacks) as compared to traditional agriculture practices. Not only
    for ground surface, this system is highly efficient in terms of other resources,
    as well. For example, according to Mirai, a Japan based indoor farm developer
    presented the figures regarding a Japanese farm comprised of 25,000 square meters.
    The figures are highly encouraging, as it is producing 10,000 heads of lettuce
    per day (double the production when compared with traditional methods) and is,
    most importantly, consuming 40% less energy and up to 99% reduced water consumption
    compared to outdoor fields [83]. Aerofarms, a leader in VF, growing agricultural
    products with upto 390 times higher yields while utilizing 95% less water at Newark
    [84]. Under this farming method, many parameters are important, but CO2 measurements
    are most critical; hence, non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO2 sensors play a critical
    role to track and control the conditions in vertical farms. Boxed Gascard, developed
    by Edinburgh Sensors [85], is especially designed by considering such an environment,
    which employs a pseudo dual beam NDIR measurement system to enhance the stability
    and reduced optical complexity. Human hands are not required to touch the crops
    at any stage when following the IoT-connected vertical farm; this is the claim
    made by Mint Controls [86] developers who offer a wide range of solutions, like
    waste containers and sensors and their integration for various VF applications.
    C. Hydroponic In order to enhance the benefits of greenhouse farming, agriculture
    experts moved forward another step and provided the idea of hydroponic, a subset
    of hydroculture in which plants are grown without soil. Hydroponic is based on
    an irrigation system in which balanced nutrients are dissolved in water and crop
    roots stay in that solution; in some cases, roots can be supported by medium like
    perlite or gravel. When combining hydroponics with VF, a farm of 100 sq. meters
    can produce the crop equivalent to 1 acre of traditional farm, most importantly
    upto 95% less water and fertilizers utilization and without pesticides/herbicides
    [87]. Currently, available systems and sensors e.g. [88], [89] are not only used
    to monitor a range of parameters and take readings at predefined intervals but,
    also, the measurements are stored so that can be used to analyze and diagnostic
    purpose later on. Under this application, the precision of nutrient measurements
    is crucial, as such, a highly reliable wireless control system for tomato hydroponics
    is proposed in [90] in which they focused on various communication standards that
    are least effected by plants’ presence and their growth. The monitoring of solution
    contents and their precision is most critical under this method; for this purpose,
    many systems are offered to check the presence of contents considering the plant
    demands. In [91] a wireless-sensor-based prototype is proposed to deliver a turn-key
    solution for the hydroponic cultivation which offers real-time measurements for
    soilless indoor growing. Further, a compact sensor module is presented in [92],
    which uses oscillator circuits to measure the presence and concentrations of various
    nutrients and water levels. D. Phenotyping The previously discussed smart methods
    look more promising for the future of agriculture, as they are already being used
    to produce different crop products under precise environments. Other than these,
    a few advanced techniques are under experiment to further enhance the crop capabilities
    by controlling their limitations with the help of advanced sensing and communication
    technologies. Among these methods, the more prominent is phenotyping, which is
    based on emerging crop engineering, which links plant genomics with its ecophysiology
    and agronomy, as shows in Figure 6. The progress in molecular and genetic tools
    for various crop breeding was significant in the last decade. However, a quantitative
    analysis of the crop behavior, e.g. grain weight, pathogen resistance, etc., was
    limited due to the lack of efficient techniques and technologies that we can now
    enjoy. FIGURE 6. The process of phenotyping [96]. Show All Research investigations,
    completed in [93], conclude that plant phenotyping can be highly beneficial to
    investigate the quantitative characteristics, such as those are responsible for
    its growth, yield quality and quantity, and resistance capabilities to handle
    various stresses. Similarly, the role of sensing technologies and image-based
    phenotyping are highlighted in [94] and describes how these solutions can help
    to boost the progress not only for screening numerous biostimulants but also their
    role in understanding the mode of actions. Furthermore, an IoT-based phenotyping
    platform, CropQuant, is designed to monitor the crop and relevant trait measurements
    that can provide facility for crop breeding and digital agriculture [95]. Here,
    an automatic in-field control system was developed to process the data generated
    by platform. The provided trait analyses algorithms and machine-learning modeling
    help to explore the relation among the genotypes, phenotypes, and environment
    where it grows. SECTION IV. Major Equipment and Technologies Different from ancient
    farming, most of the tasks in modern, large-scale agriculture are being done by
    heavy and urbane equipment, such as tractors, harvesters, and other robots which
    are fully or partially supported by remote sensing and other communication technologies.
    In precision agriculture, when tasks like sowing, fertilizing, irrigation, and
    harvesting are being performed, the operating vehicles are equipped with GPS and
    GIS facilities so that they can work precisely, site-specifically, and autonomously.
    In fact, the idea of site-specific crop management is not possible without involving
    the recent advanced technologies. The success of precision agriculture is based
    on the accuracy of collected data, which is usually done in two ways [10]. The
    first entails the usage of multifunctional imaginary devices equipped with remote
    sensing platforms, such as satellites, agriculture airplanes, balloons, and UAVs;
    the second is from various types of sensors—those that are mostly deployed for
    specific purpose across various sites of our interest. The gathered data is identified
    with the precise location information by using GPS devices so that the site-specific
    treatment can be provided afterwards. Agriculture has transformed during the last
    few decades from small/medium farming operations to highly industrialized and
    commercial farming. This transition allows the leading corporations to treat agriculture
    like other industries, e.g., manufacturing where the measurements, data, and control
    are very important to provide a balance between costs and production in order
    to boost the profits. Accordingly, every aspect of agriculture that can be automated,
    digitally planned, and managed will benefit from IoT technologies and solutions.
    Based on this fact, efforts are being focused to offer more sophisticated tools
    such as agricultural robots to perform a range of activities, like planting, watering,
    weeding, picking, thinning, fertilizing, spraying, packing and transporting. This
    revolution is being driven not only due to the advancement of technology, but
    is also a result of factors like fear of losing the low-cost labor, most importantly
    need for better and cheaper food. Based on these facts, during the period of 2017
    to 2022, the global smart farming market is predicted to rise at a growth rate
    of 19.3% per year to touch $23.14 billion in 2022 [97]. Here it is worth mentioning
    that UAV/drones are generating and further expected to generate the highest revenue
    amongst all agricultural robots utilized in smart farming (UAVs are discussed
    in Section V). Evergreen demand for higher crop yield, increased incorporation
    of information and communication technology (ICT) in farming and the rapid global
    climatic changes are some of the major drivers resulting to such high market growth.
    Manufacturers in the market offer a variety of products and solutions, mostly
    based on sensors and efficient communication for a range of applications; a few
    are shown in figure 7. The key technologies and equipment’s that are currently
    available for this purpose are discussed in following. FIGURE 7. Selected IoT
    based products and prototypes for smart agriculture. Show All A. Wireless Sensors
    Among all the equipment for smart farming currently available in the market, wireless
    sensors are the most crucial and play a key role when it comes to collecting the
    crop conditions and other information. Wireless sensors are being used standalone
    wherever required, further integrated with almost every portion of advanced agricultural
    tools and heavy machinery, depending on application requirements. In the following,
    major sensor types are discussed according to their working procedure and purpose
    and the benefits they offer. 1) Acoustic Sensors Acoustic sensors offer a miscellaneous
    appliance in farm management, including soil cultivation, weeding, fruit harvesting,
    etc.; the main benefit of this technology is its low-cost solutions with fast
    response, especially when considering portable equipment. It functions by measuring
    the change in the noise level as the tool interacts with other materials, e.g.,
    soil particles [98]. Acoustic sensors are commonly used for pest monitoring and
    detection [99] and classifying the seed varieties according to their sound absorption
    spectra [100]. 2) Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-Based Sensors FPGA based
    sensors are starting to be used in agriculture recently due to their flexibility
    of reconfiguration. The major options where these can be employed include measuring
    real-time plant transpiration, irrigation, and humidity [101], [102]. However,
    their utilization in agriculture is in the early stages due to their limitations,
    such as size, cost, and power consumption. These sensors require more power; hence,
    they are not suitable for continuous monitoring, further high in cost even compromising
    on performance [103]. By overcoming these issues, FPGA-based sensors can offer
    satisfactory solutions according to specific application requirements. 3) Optical
    Sensors These sensors use light reflectance phenomena and help to measure soil
    organic substances, soil moisture and color, presence of minerals and their composition,
    clay content, etc. [104], [105]. These sensors test the soil’s ability to reflect
    light based on different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. The changes occurred
    in wave reflections help to indicate the changes in soil density and other parameters.
    Fluorescence-based optical sensors are used for basic plant assessment, especially
    to supervise the fruit maturation [106]. Further, when integrating optical sensors
    with microwave scattering, it can be used for characterizing grove canopies, like
    olives and other similar crops [107]. 4) Ultrasonic Ranging Sensors Sensors of
    this category are considered a good choice being low cost, potential to operate
    in a variety of applications, and ease of use and adjustability, such as the sampling
    rate. Common uses are tank monitoring, spray distance measurement (e.g., boom
    height and width control in order to perform uniform spray coverage, object detection,
    and collision avoidance), and monitoring crop canopy [108], [109]. When combined
    with a camera, these sensors can then be used for the weed detection [110], where
    the heights of plants are identified using the ultrasonic sensors and the camera
    determines the weed and crop coverage. 5) Optoelectronic Sensors Optoelectronic
    sensors can differentiate plant type; hence, they help to detect weeds, herbicides,
    and other unwanted plants, especially in wide-row crops [111]. When combining,
    an optoelectronic sensor and location information, it can map the weed distribution
    and resolution [112]. Optoelectronic sensors are also capable of differentiating
    between vegetation and soil from their reflection spectra. 6) Airflow Sensors
    These sensors are capable of measuring soil air permeability and percentage of
    moisture and identifying soil structure to distinguish different types of soils.
    Measurements can be made at singular locations or dynamically while in motion,
    e.g., can be used on a fixed position or in mobile mode. The desired output is
    the pressure required to push a predetermined amount of air into the ground at
    a prescribed depth. It follows the procedure of various soil properties, including
    compaction, structure, and moisture levels, producing unique identifying signatures
    [113]. 7) Electrochemical Sensors These are mostly used to assess the significant
    soil characteristics to analyze the soil nutrient levels, such as pH [114]. The
    standard chemical soil analysis, which are mostly expensive and time consuming,
    can be easily substituted with these sensors. To be more precise, the macro and
    micro nutrients in the soil, salinity and pH [115], are measured using sensors
    of this nature. 8) Electromagnetic Sensors Electromagnetic sensors are used to
    record electrical conductivity and transient electromagnetic response, identify
    electrical response, and adjust variable rate applications in the actual situation.
    Sensors based on this technology use electric circuits to measure the capability
    of soil particles to conduct or accumulate electrical charge, which is mostly
    done by the following two methods: contact or non-contact [116]. Residual nitrates
    and organic matter in the soil can also be measured using the electromagnetic
    sensors, as done in [117]. 9) Mechanical Sensors Mechanical sensors assess the
    soil mechanical resistance (compaction) to indicate the variable level of compaction.
    The mechanical sensors enter or cut through the soil and record the force assessed
    by strain gauges or load cells [118]. A pressure unit is used to measure the soil’s
    mechanical resistance, which is actually the ratio of the force needed to go into
    the soil medium using the frontal part of the tool, actually engaged with the
    soil. 10) Mass Flow Sensors Category of this sensors are used for yield monitoring,
    as it provides the yield information by measuring the amount of grain flow, e.g.,
    when passing through the combine harvester. Sensing the mass flow of grain to
    determine the crop yield is not new, as it has been performed the last two decades
    [119]. The mass flow sensor is the most critical component, but, overall, the
    yield monitoring system consists of several other modules, like the grain moisture
    sensor, data storage device, and an internal software to analyze the data, which
    are within the interface provided in the John Deere tractors [120]. 11) Eddy Covariance-Based
    Sensors This type of sensors can be used for quantifying exchanges of carbon dioxide,
    water vapor, methane or other gases, and energy between the surface of the earth
    and the atmosphere. This method offers an accurate way to measure surface-atmosphere
    fluxes of energy and trace gas fluxes over a variety of ecosystems for, most importantly,
    agricultural applications [121]. Currently, the sensors based on this technology
    are preferred over other similar options, like the close chamber, due to high
    precision and its ability to measuring continuous flux over large areas [122].
    12) Soft Water Level-Based (SWLB) Sensors SWLB sensors are being utilized in agriculture
    catchments to characterize hydrological behaviors, such as water level and flow,
    at adjustable time-step acquisitions. This is done by measuring rainfalls, stream
    flows, and other water presence options [11], [123]. 13) Light Detection and Ranging
    (LIDAR) This technology is widely used in a range of agriculture applications,
    such as land mapping and segmentation, determining soil type, farm 3D modelling,
    monitoring erosion and soil loss, and yield forecasting [124]–[126]. LiDAR is
    also commonly used to obtain dynamic measurement information regarding fruit-tree
    leaf area, and, when combined with GPS, it can produce a 3D map [127]. Moreover,
    this technology is often used when estimating the biomass of various crops and
    trees [128]. 14) Telematics Sensors Telematics sensors support telecommunication
    between two places—more precisely, among two vehicles when considering the agriculture-based
    applications. Telemetry sensors are used to collect data from remote locations
    (especially inaccessible points), operations of machines that report on how the
    components are working, and record location and travel routes to avoid visiting
    the same patch [129]. These services enable farm managers to record and store
    all information related to farm operations automatically, which maximizes the
    utilization of environmental benefits, further can minimize threats like farm
    equipment theft as utilized in [130], [131]. 15) Remote Sensing Sensors belong
    to this category are used to capture and store the geographic information, further
    analyze, manipulate, manage and present all types of spatial or geographical data.
    Similar to LiDAR, these sensors also found significant use in agriculture applications
    including crop assessment, forecasting yield dates, yield modelling and forecasting,
    identification of plants and pests, land cover and degradation mapping etc [132]–[134].
    Argos sensor is one of leading example, a satellite-based sensor system used to
    collect, process and disseminates environmental data from fixed and mobile platforms
    worldwide [135]. Moreover, automatic packet reporting system (APRS) is being integrated
    to report telemetry data through satellite communication [136]. Table 1 lists
    a few sensors to provide the idea about their possible uses and the environment
    where they can be placed. TABLE 1 Some Selected Sensors and Their Possible Uses
    in IoT Based Agriculture B. IoT Based Tractors As rural labor resources have started
    to come under stress due to the expansion of the crop industry, tractors and other
    automatic heavy machinery started to enter the agriculture sector. Where available,
    an average size tractor can work 40 times faster with significantly less expenses
    than traditional farm labor [157]. To fulfill the continuously increasing demands,
    agricultural-based equipment manufacturers, like John Deere, Hello Tractors, Case
    IH and CNH (New Holland), have started to provide better solutions focusing on
    the grower’s requirements. With the advancement of technology, most of these manufacturers
    are offering tractors with automatic-driven and even Cloud-computing capabilities.
    This technology is not new, as self-driving tractors have been in the market even
    before semi-autonomous cars. One of the main advantages of self-driving tractors
    is their ability to avoid revisiting the same area or row by reducing the overlap
    even less than an inch. In addition, they can make very precise turns without
    a driver’s physical presence. This facility offers better precision with reduced
    errors, especially when spraying insecticide or targeting weeds; those are mostly
    unavoidable when a human controls the machinery. Although, at the moment, no fully
    autonomous tractor is available in market, many researchers and manufactures are
    hardly working to mature the technology. Based on current progress and future
    demands of high-tech tractors, it is predicated that around 700,000 tractors equipped
    with facilities like autosteer or tractor guidance will be sold in 2028 [158],
    while the same study expects that around 40,000 unmanned, fully-autonomous (level
    5) tractors will be sold in 2038 [159]. When talking about such cultured machines,
    most farmers can’t afford to own them while most of the tractor service providers
    and manufacturers operate well below their potential. Considering the challenge,
    Hello Tractor has developed a solution to sort these issues. The company has developed
    a low-cost monitoring device that can be placed on any tractor, provides powerful
    software and analytics tools [160]. The benefits of this device are twofold- on
    one side it ensures that overall cost of tractor remains affordable for the most
    of growers while at the same time it monitors the condition of the tractor and
    reports if any problems occur. The software connects tractor’s owner to farmers
    in need of tractor services, just like Uber for tractors. Another major example
    is Case IH’s Magnum series [161] tractor which uses on board video cameras and
    LiDAR sensors for object detection and collision avoidance. Recently, Case IH
    used this tractor to plant soybeans by following the concept of autonomous tractors.
    In another development made by standards group ETSI where world’s first tractor
    connected to a car in France, using IoT [162] to control the accidents due to
    farm vehicles. After collecting all the important crop data, the next step is
    pushing computing from the Cloud to the edge, as John Deere [163] wants. In their
    proposed system, an analytics engine works locally on the farmer’s tractor rather
    than in the Cloud in order to adjust the local inputs. For this purpose, they
    considered all the existing analytics and recommendations to modify the current
    data in real time depending on the field conditions. Based on this phenomenon,
    the manufacturer is bringing their tractors to next level by connecting their
    machine to the Internet and creating a method to display the information wherever
    farmer wants to see it. C. Harvesting Robots Harvesting is the most critical stage
    during the production process, as this last phase dictates the crop’s output and,
    ultimately, its success. In some crops, this is done a single time while, in some
    others, performed several times, even on a daily basis, as crop reaches a certain
    stage. Harvesting the crop at the right time is very critical, as doing so either
    early or late can affect the production significantly. When talking about the
    labor, it is estimated that the US faces a $3.1 billion decline in crop production
    on a yearly basis due to labor shortage [164]. Not only this, but, according to
    a study conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture, overall 14 %
    of farm costs go to wages and labor costs, while it can be upto 39% in some labor
    intensive farms [165]. Considering the worth of this stage and labor issues, farm
    experts expect that involvement of agriculture robotics may not only ease the
    labor pressure but also provide the flexibility to harvest whenever needed. In
    order to automate the harvesting process and make it more precise, the role of
    robots has been increasing over the recent decades. Considering the robot services,
    many researchers have done intensive research in order to mature the sensitivity
    of fruit detection, its shape, size, color, and localization [166]–[169]. Automatic
    harvesting of fruits requires deep investigation of sophisticated sensors that
    are capable of collecting precise and unambiguous information of that particular
    crop and fruit. The task of detecting the right target in natural scenes is not
    simple since most of the fruits are occluded partially—sometimes even fully—under
    the leaves and branches or are overlapped with other fruits [170]. Here, most
    of the prominent studies found in regard to this purpose are deeply based on computer
    vision, image processing, and machine learning techniques. This process needs
    very specialized and sophisticated tools to differentiate the fruit conditions,
    as there are more than sixty shapes, sizes, and colors for a pepper alone when
    it is ready to harvest. Considering such complexity, many robots are being developed
    for specific crops. Some of the leading robots being used for crop harvesting
    include SW 6010 [171] and Octinion [172] for strawberries, SWEEPER robot [173]
    for peppers, and FFRobot [174] for tree-based fruits like apples which can pick
    up to 10,000 fruits per hour. Strawberries are one of the most consumed fruits,
    available mostly throughout the year while labor is the major contributor to the
    high cost of this fruit, especially during harvesting and packaging stages [175].
    As the strawberry farms are grown mostly under greenhouse systems hence the harvesting
    robots are designed to move on defined paths like rails where the translational
    motion is restricted and robots can move backward and forward only. Robots developed
    by Agrobot are able to collect strawberries along the side of strawberry plant
    rows in the field, further packed by human operators [176]. For example, SW6010
    by Agrobot is a specialized and semi-automatic robot towards the specific task
    of strawberry harvesting [177]. Tektu T-100 is an all-electric rechargeable strawberry
    harvester run silently with zero emission inside the poly-tunnels [178]. The installed
    pickers are able to position over the crop rows and gather the fruit quickly and
    efficiently, directly into punnets. D. Communication in Agriculture Communication
    and reporting the information on a timely basis are considered the backbone of
    precision agriculture. The real purpose cannot be achieved unless a firm, reliable,
    and secure connection among various participating objects is provided. To achieve
    communication reliability, telecom operators can play a crucial role in the agricultural
    sector. If we truly want to implement IoT on a large scale in the agriculture
    industry, we have to provide a suitably large architecture. Here, the factors
    like cost, coverage, energy consumption, and reliability are critical and have
    to be considered before choosing the mean of communication. Low-energy networks
    can provide connectivity only on one site and mostly do not offer services in
    remote areas where sensed data need to be transmitted to the farm management system
    (FMS). Depending on availability, scalability and application requirements, various
    communication modes and technologies are being used for this purpose, most common
    are discussed here, 1) Cellular Communication Cellular communication modes from
    2G to 4G can be suitable, depending on the purpose and bandwidth requirement;
    however, the reliability, and even availability, of a cellular network in rural
    areas is a major concern. To tackle this, data transmission via satellite is another
    option, but, here, the cost of this communication mode is very high, which makes
    it not suitable for small- and medium-sized farms. The choice of communication
    mode also depends on application requirements, such as some farms required sensors
    that can operate with low data rate but need to work for long periods hence demand
    long battery life. For such scenarios, a new range of Low Power Wide Area Network
    (LPWAN) is considered a better solution for cellular connectivity, not only in
    terms of long battery life but also a larger connectivity range with affordable
    rates (2 to 15 USD per year) [179]. Currently, crop and pasture management are
    two of the main applications where LPWAN networks are highly suitable, and, further
    considering its success, it can be utilized in many other farming-related uses.
    Besides WAN connectivity option, many short range and medium level communications
    are being used in mesh networks [180]. For example, a mesh-network of sensor nodes
    collects data and transmits it to the gateway which is located somewhere in the
    same area. The gateway further sends this data to the farm management system using
    the WAN network. The communication technologies used within the mesh networks
    vary e.g. Bluetooth and Zigbee can be used to provide connectivity for peer-to-peer
    wireless communications. From here, the sensed data forwarded to the FMS, which
    gathers and analyses the information about all the activities happening at different
    parts even the historical data regarding the weather and climate updates, economic,
    products being used and their specifications etc, in short making it decision
    farming. It is important to mention that, the communication technology has its
    own worth but the FMS also plays a critical role which must be custom designed
    considering the specific application requirements. Generally, based on communication
    data rates and power consumption, wireless sensors for agriculture applications
    are divided in three broad categories as shown in table 2. TABLE 2 Data and Power
    Specifications of Wireless Sensors Commonly Used for Agriculture Applications
    2) Zigbee Zigbee is primarily designed for a wide range of applications especially
    to replace existing non-standard technologies. Depending on the application requirements,
    the devices based on this protocol can be one of three types including Coordinator,
    Router and End User. Further, three different topologies are supported by Zigbee
    networks named, Start, Cluster Tree and Mesh [34]. Based on these characteristics,
    and further considering the agriculture application requirements, Zigbee can play
    vital role especially targeting the greenhouse environment where usually short
    range communications are required. During monitoring the various parameters, the
    real time data from the sensor node is transferred through Zigbee to end server.
    For the applications like, irrigation and fertilization, Zigbee modules are networked
    for communication, e.g. in drip irrigation used to monitor soil contents like
    moisture. Further, SMS is forwarded to the farmer to update about the field data
    where GSM is required at long distance or Bluetooth module can help at the shorter
    distances. 3) Bluetooth Bluetooth is a wireless communication standard that connects
    small-head devices together over shorter distances usually cooperating in a close
    proximity. Due to its advantages of low power requirements, easy to use and low
    cost, this technology is being utilized in many smart farming applications. Further,
    Bluetooth making advancements in many IoT systems with the release of Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) or commonly known as Bluetooth Smart. The study conducted in
    [181] which tests Bluetooth and PLC (programmable logic controller) with ICS (integrated
    control strategy), timer control and soil moisture control approach for smart
    irrigation. The target of this study is to find an optimum utilization of water
    and energy consumption for various greenhouse or field applications. A moisture
    and temperature sensor based on BLE is developed in [182] especially focusing
    on the agriculture environments and weather conditions of crop fields. Here the
    reason of choosing BLE for communication purpose is due to its inherent support
    for smart phone accessibility. Further, a similar effort is done in [183] where
    a new sensor node is designed to monitor ambient light and temperature employing
    BLE communication protocol preferable for IoT based agriculture applications.
    Other than short range, WiFi is utilized whenever LAN communications are required
    in smart agriculture. Along short range connectivity, WiFi is utilized whenever
    LAN communications are required in smart agriculture. Study presented in [184]
    investigates a remote monitoring system using WiFi, where the sensor nodes were
    based on WSN802G modules. The deployed nodes communicate wirelessly with a central
    server, which is responsible to collect and store the monitored data and further
    allow displaying the information after required analysis. 4) LoRa LoRa wireless
    technology is a long-range, low-power platform used extensively in IoT applications.
    Being low in power consumption, it offers LPWAN connectivity between the wireless
    sensors and the Cloud. It has proved itself much more effective and reliable than
    Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. especially in restaurants or kitchen environments. Sensors
    based on LoRa can be installed in smaller devices for reliable monitoring. Most
    importantly, LoRa signals can penetrate thick and insulated objects, even buildings,
    and can, hence, cover a larger network area. Overall, LoRa-based networks perform
    higher in terms of lifespan and, at the same time, pose reduced maintenance and
    upkeep burden [185]. Considering the advantages, many researchers tested this
    communication method in kitchens, storage rooms, and transport systems. In [186],
    a test was conducted in a warehouse with a capacity to store 40 tons of apples,
    and results show that it provided full coverage, where the temperature and airflow
    readings transferred successfully with a packet rate of more the 96%. Similarly,
    [187] presents a system to achieve information traceability in the grain transport
    system to ensure the food quality by monitoring the temperature and humidity levels.
    5) Sigfox Sigfox is also used to provide network connectivity services to low-powered
    objects as “things” required. It is based on narrowband or ultra-narrowband technology;
    hence, it takes very narrow chunks of spectrum and changes the phase of the carrier
    radio wave to encode the data. Based on these characteristics, it offers high
    level performance, even if 100 sensors need to transmit data at the same time,
    as experiments done in [188]. Figure 8 gives an idea that how end-to-end communication
    possibilities can be divided in various layers to interact with each other in
    order to provide the services for smart agriculture. FIGURE 8. End to end communication
    for smart farming. Show All E. Smartphones Despite its availability concerns for
    remote fields, cellular communication is the major technology in rural areas;
    mobile phones are a very common source and primary mode of communication whenever
    the need arises to contact or update most of the farming community. Recent advancements
    in the smartphone industry have resulted in sharp price decreases, making this
    industry more attractive, especially to the smallholder growers in remote areas.
    The rapid spread of cellular networks in developing countries offers the opportunity
    to reach remote and dispersed farms with improved services. Mobile-phone-based
    agriculture services (m-services) are far from their assumed potential; according
    to an analysis done by GSM Association, only at 8 per cent [189]. However, the
    flexibility and functionality, such as the camera, GPS, microphone accelerometer,
    proximity, and gyroscope, attract the IT experts, and they are developing more
    appealing mobile apps that consider the farmer’s various needs [190], [191]. The
    conclusion of FAO’s 10-year investigations states that “solid information is needed
    regarding the impact of previous initiatives, including lessons learned, in order
    to inform the design and approach of future efforts” [192]. Interestingly, the
    smartphone is the first device that comes to mind when planning how to achieve
    this goal, especially considering the often dispersed and poorly serviced areas.
    Recent years have seen rapid expansion of research, with researchers conducting
    a growing number of studies and developing various models to highlight the scope
    of smartphone crop applications. These researchers mostly belong to developing
    nations, as proposed systems are based primarily in countries like Kenya [193],
    [194], Ghana [195], [196], Nigeria [197], [198], Mali [199], Uganda [200], and
    Zimbabwe [201], [202]. Although, the scope of smartphone utilization in agriculture
    has been more commonly observed in Africa, experiments in countries like Cameroon
    [203], China [204], [205], Turkey [206], [207], and India [208], [209] are also
    increasing. Analysing the success of m-services depends on many factors. One of
    the most comprehensive studies regarding the use of mobile phones for various
    agriculture applications was conducted to review all the important factors [210].
    This study concludes that the service will be of no effect if the developer of
    the application does not truly understand the farmer needs. Obviously, the most
    important factor for such applications is that the farmer should access and use
    them. In other words, an easy-to-use, free or low-cost app that supports various
    languages could attract the farmer’s attention. In addition, developers should
    study and consider the relevant factors before making their suggestions. For example,
    market prices are of great interest to farmers, but would be of no use in cases
    of bad roads and unavailability of proper transport vehicles. The developers should
    target the problems of the wider community instead of focusing only on farmers,
    considering the transporters, brokers, and other agriculture experts as well.
    Unfortunately, most of the applications are developed on growers’ perceptions,
    instead of using independent and verified market data. For this purpose, the developer
    should not only focus on the data retrieved by independent investigators but also
    assess it under various usage patterns covering longer durations. Table 3 lists
    smartphone based sensors that are attracting the researchers to utilize them for
    various agriculture purposes. While, last column provide some of the references
    where these sensors have been used. Further, Table 4 includes some of the important
    mobile apps developed for various agriculture applications along their features
    and achievements. TABLE 3 Smartphone Based Sensors That Being Used in Various
    Agriculture Applications TABLE 4 Selected Important Smartphone Applications for
    Various Agriculture Applications F. Cloud Computing Precision agriculture is showing
    its potential and benefits by improving agricultural operations through better
    data-driven decision making. However, to continue this success, precision agriculture
    not only requires better technology and tools to process data efficiently but
    also at a reasonable cost such that the received data can be used to make field
    decisions efficiently. For this purpose, farmers can use Cloud services to access
    information from predictive analysis institutes so that they can choose the right
    product available according to their specific requirements. Cloud computing offers
    an edge to farmers to use knowledge-based repositories that contain a treasure
    of information and experiences related to farming practices as well as on equipment
    options available in the market with the necessary details. In most cases, all
    this comes along with expert advice from a wide range of sources (for example,
    on farming and the processing of agricultural products). To make it more effective,
    the scenario can be extended further to include access to consumer databases,
    supply chains, and billing systems. Surely, moving towards Cloud-based services
    offer opportunities to explore advancements, but it comes with new challenges,
    as well. First, a vast range of sensors are being developed and used in precision
    agriculture, each of which has its own data format and semantics. Secondly, most
    of the decision-support systems are application-specific while, on the other hand,
    a farmer can be in the need of accessing various systems for a specific application,
    e.g., soil monitoring. Considering both of these cases, the Cloud-based decision-support
    system not only needs to handle the diversity of data and their formats but also
    must be able to configure these formats for different applications. An open Cloud-based
    system has been established by AgJunction [243] which gathers and disseminates
    the data on a form from different precise agriculture controllers, leading to
    a decrease in costs and environmental impacts. Furthermore, “Akisai” Cloud [244],
    proposed by Fujitsu, focuses on food and agricultural industries and incorporates
    information communication technology for increasing the food supply in the coming
    years. Similarly, SourceTrace developed and offering Cloud-based mobile applications
    to provide visibility and relations between farms and markets, further tracking
    the value chain at the source, e.g., ’eService Everywhere’ [245]. An important
    note about their applications is that, during the development, they considered
    the farms’ remoteness and low bandwidth environments. Figure 9 presents possible
    infrastructure and relationship scenario of fluid computing including Edge, Mist
    and Fog for smart agriculture. FIGURE 9. Fluid computing infrastructure for smart
    farming. Show All SECTION V. UAVs in Agriculture Recently, the IoT has made remarkable
    progress in many industries, including farming sectors like poultry, fishing,
    etc. but when we talk about agriculture, the communication facilities like base
    stations or Wi-Fi are very limited, which prevents the growth of the IoT in this
    sector. Such communication infrastructure and related facilities are even worst
    in developing counties and rural areas, which is one of the major hurdles when
    introducing the IoT in the agriculture industry. The data acquired through the
    wireless sensors cannot be transmitted in the absence of reliable communication
    infrastructure. In such a scenario, UAVs offer an alternative, as they visit and
    communicate with the wireless sensors spread over large areas in order to harvest
    data for further processing and analysis. Furthermore, UAVs, better known as drones,
    fitted with high-resolution cameras and precise sensors, can be flown over thousands
    of hectares of farms. The role of surveillance in all agriculture applications
    is highly critical, especially in forestry and crop monitoring due to the need
    to cover large areas [246]. Therefore, a fast, low-cost, real-time, and large-scale
    surveillance supported with an accurate data acquisition and transmission facility
    is crucial for agriculture production. Currently, mostly two options are used
    to obtain aerial images of a field area: satellite and airplanes. Both of them
    are good for a macro view of a landscape, but they face serious issues in terms
    of quality when it comes to micro views. These macro-view images are not good
    in resolution and cannot offer the image quality which is required during the
    analyses and decision making. Secondly, not only the resolution but visiting frequency
    also matters and, through both of these, it is not simple to take and collect
    images frequently (on average, four times a month [247]). Another serous issue
    is that these operate above the cloud level where there is a strong possibility
    that both are obstructed in bad weather. When we talk about UAVs that provide
    an “eye in sky”, we can overcome— or even eliminate— the above mentioned issues
    when we consider the micro views. The quality of images taken through UAVs depends
    on the attached camera’s resolution—normally dozens of times better than satellite
    images—and, most importantly, we can adjust according to application requirements.
    More specifically, UAVs supports faster and better NDVI to assess crop conditions,
    like weed mapping, leaf assessments, etc., and provide immediate feedback so that
    farmers can take timely actions. Similarly, UAVs are better in terms of frequency,
    even if requires multiple times in a single day, and are also the option least
    affected by weather conditions, unless it is raining. Due to the mentioned advantages,
    UAVs are considered the future of precision agriculture, and this is the reason
    they are generating the highest revenue amongst all agricultural robots developed
    for precision agriculture. According to quoted figures by a report published by
    FAO in 2018, it is estimated that the agriculture drone-related market to be worth
    USD 32.4 billion [248]. The current condition of the entire field is one of the
    most valuable pieces of information to obtain in the precision program. With the
    help of this collected data, a farmer can spot problems early and rapidly; hence,
    appropriate interventions can be applied. Agricultural drones represent a new
    way to collect field-level data; the results are on-demand whenever and wherever
    needed, as the drone can be easily and quickly deployed. Most importantly, it
    is not all about their hardware but the convenience, quality, and utility they
    are offering, as the drone-enabled surveillance offers the real facility to have
    an idea of what is happening in the farm fields at that moment. The UAVs, used
    for agricultural applications usually fall into two categories: fixed-wing and
    multi-rotor drones [249] (figure 10). Although both are available in various ranges
    in terms of cost, payload capacity and mostly distinguished based on hardware
    differences. For example, when it is required to cover a large area, fixed-wing
    drones are suggested due to their long-range flight capacity, most importantly
    they are crash tolerant e.g senseFly’s eBee SQ [250] and DATAhawk [251]. On the
    other hand, multi-rotor drones are more common due to their easy and faster set
    up as can take off and land vertically. Multi-rotors actually have many advantages
    over the fixed wings as they are easier to operate, require no advance wind planning
    and have the ability to fly more precisely. Moreover, in scenarios where low altitude
    flight is required in order to capture extremely detailed images, which is more
    common in agriculture applications then the multi-rotor are considered the better
    choice, some major examples belongs to this type are DJI Matrice 200 [252] and
    Introducing Scout by American Robotics [253] which considered a fully autonomous
    drone for daily agriculture scouting. FIGURE 10. Types of agricultural drones.
    Show All Generally, drones collect information through the light reflected by
    the ground it is maneuvering, over, either from soil or plants. For agricultural
    applications, specific cameras and sensors are used, depending on the grower’s
    interest—most commonly mentioned are thermal and hyper-spectral. Thermal sensors
    can help to recognize the water quantity, as leaves of plants with more water
    access appear cooler in an image. The same phenomenon is used in near-infrared
    (NIR) sensors; commonly used to note the difference between the NIR reflectance
    and the visible reflectance, such as NDVI [254]. The resultant NDVI-based images
    help to distinguish the water stress areas, as shown in figure 11. Hyper-spectral
    based sensors or cameras record the wavelengths of both visible and invisible
    lights, are able to identify the specific type of plant by measuring the color
    of reflected light. This reflected light is used to distinguish various plant
    types, ultimately helping to detect the unwanted herbicide and weeds [255]. The
    idea is used in [256], where authors used the multispectral images to classify
    various weeds. FIGURE 11. NDVI based water stress map of 160 acre walnut orchard
    [258]. Show All Due to their nature and flexibility, UAVs are being used in a
    range of agricultural applications, including crop health monitoring, planting,
    plant counting, spraying, agriculture photography, and many other variable rate
    applications. After being equipped with automation and GPS capabilities, they
    are ready to take the agriculture sector to a further-modernized level. With every
    passing day, drones are becoming more inexpensive and reliable, hence, making
    themselves an ideal choice for new farming applications. Focusing on the success
    of this technology, SAP (Systems, Applications, and Products), one of the largest
    vendors of enterprise resource planning, has brought three of its major technologies
    together in order to make the information harvested through UAVs more effective
    [257]. The technologies include the HANA, a Cloud database which supports speedy
    data capture, retrieval, and analytics; the Leonardo IoT suite to connect and
    exchange information over any protocol; and the Connected Agriculture suite to
    provide a GUI-based, graphical-use interface to the farmers. While it depends
    on the situation, in most cases, few hours delays doesn’t leave serious impact
    in most of the agriculture applications but flight time is more important as need
    to cover larger areas due field vastness. Not only vastness, but in some applications
    of pesticide and fertilizer, UAVs need to carry heavy payloads. In such situations,
    optimum battery utilization becomes crucial to extend the flight time. For this
    purpose, many factors can be considered to increase the drone efficiency. Firstly,
    when flying, choose right conditions e.g. weather or air direction. Next, try
    to include optimum payload and place it appropriately. For this situation, it
    can be helpful to attach the payload near the field, better in smaller quantities
    and the refilling again instead of putting heavy quantities. Further, depending
    on area size and visiting frequency, optimum path selection plays a critical role.
    For this purpose, many routing schemes like [259], [260] are proposed especially
    for the UAVs so choosing and implementing the right scheme can provide clear difference.
    Considering the application of pesticide and UAV based irrigation where drone
    need to fly with heavy payloads then new procedures like tethering system can
    be helpful. In UAV tethering, a connection that provide power through the long
    cable, is provided so that it can fly as long as you have power backup on the
    ground, most importantly it doesn’t require to lift heavy batteries. Currently,
    agriculture is being considered one of the most favorable fields where UAVs can
    offer solutions to resolve many dominant and long-lasting issues. Some of key
    areas in which drones are already playing key roles to assist farmers throughout
    the crop cycle are highlighted below. A. Soil and Field Analysis Drones are able
    to produce precise information to analyze the soil before sowing the crop, which
    helps to determine the most suitable crop for specific land; furthermore, it suggests
    the seed type and its planting patterns. In [261] authors shared their experimental
    results using Sirius I, a fixed-wing aircraft, affixed with a Lumix GF1 digital
    camera by Panasonic to capture images from different sites to monitor the soil
    erosion issues in Morocco. Similarly, authors in [262] targeted the issues of
    soil analyses where they used Lumix DMC-LX 3 to take the images and Pix4UAV for
    mapping the results. B. Planting Millions of acres of land are currently under-utilized
    due to being human inaccessible or lack of suitable workers. Safety concerns of
    rough terrain are main reason not to utilize these areas for forestry or agriculture
    purpose. For this purpose, drone based planting systems are being developed that
    decrease planting costs upto 85 percent [263]. Not only cost, but within shorter
    time as some recently developed drones can plant 100,000 trees in a single day
    [264]. These systems shoot pods which include the seeds and necessary nutrients
    required to grow the plant. This method is found very effective for rough terrain;
    most importantly the success rate is more than 75% [265]. Due to the success and
    flexibility they offer, UAVs are being considered the best candidate for plantation
    all over the world, from NASA engineer [266] to countries like Pakistan [267]
    and India [268]. C. Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is one of tough jobs and facing
    low efficiency due to covering large area. Drones are offering the solutions by
    allowing real-time monitoring of far farms, more accurately and cost-effectively
    comparing with previously used satellite imagery. The Microdrones +m [269] is
    an accessory toolkit which provides aerial imaging facility to observe the crop
    nutrients, moisture levels and monitoring of other necessary parameters. A study
    conducted in [270] where authors used UAVs along digital camera to monitor the
    crop conditions. The purpose of the study was to find the relationship between
    the crop spectral characteristics and effect of fertilizer availability for plant
    health. Further, [271] presents an innovative procedure to compute and map the
    3-dimensional geometric characteristics of trees and tree-rows. The generated
    maps can be helpful to understand the relation between the trees’ growth and field
    related factors like its geometry and nutrients ultimately help to optimize the
    crop management operations. D. Irrigation Use of drones for irrigation applications
    is, again, two-fold. On one side, equipping UAVs with a variety of sensors and
    cameras can help to identify areas that are under water stress and conclude what
    irrigation changes are required. At the same time, they can be used for sprinkling
    water and pesticides on the crops precisely, especially in emergency cases, which
    would save both time and wastage. In [272], multispectral images of citrus crops
    were acquired using the fixed-wing UAV, where the retrieved data was used to assess
    and detect structural and physiological changes in the targeted crop. Further,
    [273], [274] are similar efforts in which UAVs were used to estimate the crop
    water stress. Furthermore, UAVs are not only used to analyze the irrigation properties
    but also provide solutions by sprinkling water precisely over the water stress
    areas as in [275]. Due to this application of UAVs, they are being considered
    the newest water-saving tool, while their use is helping not only to increase
    watering efficiency but also detect possible pooling or leaks in irrigation. Examples
    like ’JT20L-606’ [276] and ’AGRASMG-1’ [277] are specialized drones that were
    developed and are being used for this purpose. E. Plant Counting and Gap Detection
    Precision agriculture critically needs the spatial data on crop density when making
    decisions during various applications. The quantity and plant numbering not only
    reflects the field emergence but allows better and more precise assessment of
    the yield production, in fact, determining the crop fate. Again, UAVs are offering
    flexible solutions for this purpose. In [278], authors performed digital counting
    of Maize plants with the help of UAVs. Further, in [279], authors proposed a method
    in which they used UAVs to estimate the density of wheat plants at the emergence
    stage while a Sony ILCE α5100L RGB camera was used to take the images. F. Spraying
    the Pesticides/Herbicides Similar to irrigation, UAVs can be used to spray herbicides/
    pesticides on crops, but their use for these applications is more critical. Spraying
    application would be highly efficient compared to current procedures; herbicides/pesticides
    are usually sprayed over the entire farm, which is not required in most cases.
    If using an UAV to spray herbicide, it can spray directly on the unwanted weeds
    or can target the affected areas only. Furthermore, as spraying using drones would
    be highly targeted, the drone would figure out and spray as per requirements,
    helping to reduce the overall expenditures. Handling the sudden environment changes
    like wind direction or speed is another issue for an UAV especially when being
    used for spraying applications. For this purpose, [280] proposed a computer based
    system that autonomously adopt the UAV control rules to keep precise pesticide
    deposition. G. Health Assessment Scanning crops with visible and Infrared (IR)
    light sensors fitted on drones can identify which plants may be infected by bacteria
    or fungus. Using UAVs, this can be done frequently and with flexibility. The early
    detection of any such issues helps to prevent the disease being spread to other
    plants or crop areas. Multispectral images can help to detect the disease or sickness
    at early stages even before reaching the level in which it is possible to detect
    with the human eye. Experiments done in [280] present the data collection campaign
    performed over a sorghum crop which was severely damaged by white grubs. Further,
    in [281], UAVs are used to collect data from ground-based sensors, including a
    chlorophyll meter, water potential meter, and spectroradiometer, and the collected
    information was used to evaluate the plant health and crop condition, ultimately
    reflecting the ground truth. H. Detection/Recognition of Plant Species Recently,
    UAVs are being started to detect and recognize the plant species, especially those
    are considered extinct or remains only few on our Earth. An UAV is a best candidate
    to perform this task as it can go in very remote locations those are almost inaccessible
    to humans. As National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) stated that, Hibiscadelphus
    woodi, a Hawaiian flower, which thought to be extinct in 2009, is discovered on
    a vertical cliff face using the drone [282]. Similarly, using the special cameras
    that can detect the forest biomass and fuel, forest fuel estimation is possible
    through UAVs which is mostly being done from radars and satellites [283], [284].
    SECTION VI. Food Safety and Transportation With the increasing population, we
    have to feed around 25% more mouths until 2050, as compared to 2010, which appears
    to be a monumental task when considering the vast hunger issues that the world
    is currently facing. The numbers are shocking, as more than one-quarter of the
    planet’s population suffers from malnutrition [285] and nearly one billion people
    are chronically hungry [286]. Considering this current hunger scenario, it could
    be big ask to feed the new billions of mouths in the future. In order to handle
    the situation, some believe the solution lies simply in growing more food. This
    has also been reinforced by a latest research, published in the journal Bioscience,
    which concludes that from the present time until 2050, the rise in total food
    production should be in the bracket of 25–70%. [287]. However, what if someone
    tells you that there’s already enough food currently grown on farms to feed 10
    billion people? [288]. Yes, the good news is that we are already producing enough
    food for that many people; however, it is a crucial matter to figure out that
    how to distribute this food while maintaining its quality. Considering this fact,
    one can say that increasing the food production is also important, but transporting
    the existing available food safely and efficiently to more people is the real
    subject of issue of the food industry [289]. A comprehensive report regarding
    the future food requirements published by World Resources Institutes (WRI) in
    2018, highlights that we need sustainable food industry to feed 10 billion people
    by 2050. The report suggests a five-course menu of solutions to tackle the future
    food issues where “reduction in food losses and waste” is declared as the first
    and most important course [290]. Further it conclude that, reducing the food loss
    and waste only by 25% can help to reduce the food gap by 12%, the land gap by
    27% and greenhouse gas mitigation gap by 15%. To have better idea, detailed figures
    about the food loss are highlighted in figure 12 based on various geographical
    locations and considering the stages along food supply chain where these losses
    are occurring. FIGURE 12. Food losses occurring along food supply chain [290].
    Show All Other than WRI, the figures released by United Nations’ FAO are also
    shocking as it is estimated that one-third of all the global food produced for
    human use, valued at $1 trillion, is lost or wasted each year [291]. The US food
    waste alone represents 1.3% of its total GDP [292]. Based on these scary figures,
    it can be concluded that food waste is massive market inefficiency—the kind of
    which does not persist in other industries [293]. Although, the loss of $1 trillion
    has its own worth, but, more crucially, environmental implications of these losses
    are real, such as the water wasted to produce the food that is never eaten being
    equal to the water that can fulfill the needs of all of Africa [285]. Furthermore
    the CO2 emissions that resulted during the growing process of this food are equivalent
    to removing every car off the road across the world [290]. Moreover, according
    to another study conducted by FAO, if you consider food waste as a source of greenhouse
    gas emissions, it would be the third biggest emitter in the world behind only
    China and the United States [294]. In addition, when food waste goes to the landfill,
    where it mostly ends up, it decomposes in the absence of oxygen and produces methane,
    which is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of negative effects.
    In short, every which way you look at it; food waste is a major culprit in destroying
    our planet. Among all perishable food produced in the world today, only 10% is
    preserved properly [295]. When we talk about most of the developed countries,
    a robust food cold chain is maintained where essential quality checks are followed,
    entailing temperature-regulated refrigerated warehouses to refrigerated trucks
    to ensure that food gets from farm to market safely. On the other hand, many developing
    countries lack such proper cold chain infrastructure, simply resulting the majority
    of food spoiling when being transported to the end-user. Considering this fact,
    there is a huge opportunity to cut food waste and improve food distribution by
    simply implementing a controlled-temperature transportation system. Based on the
    facts, one can conclude that increasing food production is not sufficient to achieve
    food security, but, rather, some practical actions are required to find skillful
    ways for efficient distribution of the already available food. There are different
    ways to monitor and control food temperature. The manual method of checking a
    thermometer and recording the temperature has many drawbacks, where someone must
    actually do it and, most importantly, take the readings correctly. On other side,
    implementing an automatic method that uses wireless sensors to electronically
    measure and record temperatures can substantially improve food safety. This method
    allows for a continuous data stream of temperatures simply—24 hours a day, 7 days
    a week. By doing so, temperatures can be recorded consistently and on time, leaving
    little room for interpretation; in short, the entire process is based on facts
    and nothing more. Further, utilizing the recent technologies, the recorded data
    can be stored in the Cloud and accessed via any type of internet-connected device.
    Notifications can be established that will send real-time alerts if the temperature
    strays outside preset limits, allowing for immediate action to remedy the situation.
    Further, IoT offers predictive maintenance and indicate when the monitoring equipment
    itself is going to end its useful life so it can be replaced before it fails and
    compromises product quality. These are only couple of scenarios, now if we consider
    the figures presented in figure 12, IoT has the potential to monitor and keep
    the food quality at every stage of the supply chain, from production to consumption.
    A research study conducted by Indian School of Business in which students worked
    with a local grower to transport fruits and vegetables in refrigerated trucks
    from Punjab to Bangalore, a distance of more than 2,500 km through rough roads
    under high temperatures. The results were highly encouraging to implement the
    cold chain to transport the agriculture products. The out of conducted study brought
    benefits in three ways: (1) increased food shelf-life from one week to two months;
    (2) an up to 23% higher profit for everyone linked in the supply chain was observed;
    (3) a 76% reduction of food wastage (post-harvest). Besides all this, another
    critical factor is the emission of greenhouse gases was observed to be reduced
    by 16% [296]. To provide the recommended environment, a device with supported
    technology can be installed at the storage site, even in transport trucks. Further,
    it is linked to an online dashboard that can be configured to send alerts in the
    event of abnormal temperature levels to trigger swift remedial action. Some of
    key technologies available for this purpose and their use cases are mentioned
    here. A. Compliancemate Compliance with hazard analysis and critical control points
    (HACCP) offers a food safety and quality monitoring program which collects temperature
    data inside coolers and other kitchen equipment continuously. For example, its
    integration with Touchblock is used to capture temperatures in coolers and prep
    rooms at every minute [297]. B. Laird’s Sentrius A battery-powered and long-range
    integrated sensor platform that leverages the benefits of LoRaWAN and Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) connectivity. It provides LoRaWAN options at 868/915 MHz, based
    on the Semtech SX1272 and Nordic nRF51 silicon. Further, it offers high RF performance
    in a precise temperature and humidity. Two major series, including RS1xx and RG1xx
    (multi-wireless gateways), work together in order to provide Cloud-based services.
    Most importantly, it requires an inexpensive endpoint radio and a more sophisticated
    base station to manage the network. As compared to LoRa, Sigfox communication
    tends to be better if it is headed up from the endpoint to the base station. Although
    it supports the bidirectional functionality, its capacity going from the base
    station back to the endpoint is constrained, as it provides less link width going
    down than going up. C. CCP Smart Tag (RC4) CCP claims to be a complete monitoring
    solution for the food service and food retail industry [298]. It is capable to
    automate the temperature environment which meets the food safety regulations suggested
    for various food items. Further, temperature and other data are interpreted and
    viewed on a service provider Cloud platform via web and mobile applications. D.
    Tempreporter In compliance with HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points),
    it is used to monitor temperatures 24/7. Further, it logs the readings automatically.
    Reports are auto-filled by considering HACCP & HPRA (Health Products Regulatory
    Authority) recommendations regarding temperature monitoring. According to Finistere
    Ventures report, as of 2018, around $2 billion has been invested globally in AgTech.
    Several investments are expected to cross these figures in 2019. Considering the
    future needs of IoT in agriculture applications, almost all leading technological
    giants are supporting this progress in their own way. Table 5 provides a list
    of several of the leading global organizations who have proposed and are proposing
    initiatives in AgTech, especially in regard to IoT-based agriculture solutions.
    TABLE 5 Current Status and Future Vision of Major Technological Giants Regarding
    the IoT in Agriculture Industry SECTION VII. Current Challenges and Future Expectations
    According to a plan announced in 2015 under “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”,
    the UN and international community set a target to end hunger by 2030. However,
    recent figures released by WHO (World Health Organization) do not look encouraging
    enough to support the agenda, as more than 800 million people worldwide are facing
    the food shortage—one out of every nine people [313]. Although these figures are
    quite alarming on their own, what is more shocking is the quality of food. Other
    than availability, the quality of food is becoming another serious issue and even
    more critical. According to a research supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
    published in “The Lancet”, either shortage or poor diets are diverting 11 million
    people to an early grave annually, making it more deadly than smoking [314]. The
    research, which reflects the effect of poor diet on health, was conducted in 195
    countries from 1990 to 2017 and concluded that one out of five deaths per year
    could be prevented by providing better diet. The report summarizes that, globally,
    a diet lower in whole grains was the most common and leading risk factor for deaths.
    Other than the basic food needs, per capita incomes of most of the countries in
    2050 are expected to be a multiple as compared to today’s levels [315]. Such an
    increase in income will result in a more health-conscious population that expects
    quality food that is rich in fiber and other minerals. Trends, like increased
    population where the world needs to feed one third more mouths with increased
    demand of quality food, show that food demands continue to grow rapidly. In response
    to all this, overall crop production needs to increase not only for food but cash-crops
    are also required to grow in order to fulfill the demands of industry, like cotton
    and rubber, and, most importantly, increasing demands for bioenergy like ethanol.
    Figure 13 presents a snapshot of major challenges that future agriculture expected
    to face in 2050. This diagram, basically presents three major issues: how to feed
    around 10 billion people; without using more land and; by reducing the emission
    of greenhouse gasses by more than 60%. However, when we look closely then these
    three challenges lead to many new, including smaller rural labor, continuously
    shrinking arable land, water scarcity, harsh weather conditions, and many more.
    As the world moves toward urbanization, the rural populations are not only shrinking
    but are rapidly aging; hence, fewer and younger growers need to step up to take
    the responsibility. Such population imbalance and generation shift can create
    serious implications, not only for the remaining workforce but also for production
    patterns and land tenure. Furthermore, on one side, arable land is shrinking while,
    among the remaining regions, many are only suitable for specific crops due to
    certain geographic and environmental limitations. Moreover, harsh climate changes
    are starting to affect almost every aspect of crop production. These changes are
    expected to enhance the intensity of many of the existing long-term environmental
    issues, like droughts, floods, groundwater depletion, soil degradation, etc. FIGURE
    13. Major challenges for sustainable future agriculture. Show All During the 20th
    century, in most regions, growers kept following the traditional agricultural
    methods while trying to meet the food demands by greater utilizing fertilizers
    and pesticides. Implementation of such chemicals is facing two issues: these can
    help to increase the production to only a certain level and, at the same time,
    their blind use is creating irreversible implications to the environment. Furthermore,
    implementation of any resource, like water, seed, fertilizers, and pesticides,
    uniformly across an entire field is not going to solve the problem. Rather than
    dealing with every farm and crop in same way, farmers need to use these resources
    according to the requirement of specific areas, even if they have to consider
    the requirement of every plant. Focusing on the above discussion, one can feel
    that the farms and relevant crop operations need to be run differently than the
    past practices. One of the major reasons is the advancements in technology, including
    sensors, communication methods, machines, and even robots. In fact, technology
    has proved this already, as, in most developing countries; more than 50% of the
    population is somehow engaged in the agriculture industry yet are far behind in
    providing both the quantity and quality when compared with the developed countries,
    where less than 2% of the population is performing much better. The difference
    is clear, as countries like Australia, the US, and most of Europe are pioneers
    to employ the advanced tools and methods multiplying the crop yields during the
    last five decades. These comparisons show that recent technologies and advanced
    methods are making the farms not only highly profitable but safe and environmentally
    friendly. Considering this scenario, future agriculture is expected to evolve
    as a high-tech industry where interconnected systems will enjoy the luxury of
    artificial intelligence and Big Data facilities. The resultant systems will converge
    into a single unit where farm machinery and management, starting from seeding
    to production forecasting, are combined. By involving the advanced technologies
    like agricultural robots, Big Data, and cloud-computing artificial intelligence,
    agriculture can create a new era of superfusion. Following are some of the key
    technologies and methods that need to apply; focusing to achieve sustainable future
    agriculture. A. Wireless Sensors and the IoT Wireless sensors placed strategically
    around fields are providing farmers with up-to-date information in real time,
    allowing them to adapt the care that the crops need, which results in higher food
    production with less waste. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are also being used
    to inform farmers about nearly all aspects of their crop growth as well as about
    the readiness state of the farm’s machinery, thus, helping in preventing loss
    of crop as well as enhancing the readiness of the equipment which cultivates it.
    WSNs with GPS capability are helping tractors in compensating for uneven terrain
    and optimizing land preparation for growing crops. Recently, advances in image
    recognition and digital signal processing gave even more capabilities to WSN to
    accurately determine crop quality and health. In order to make agriculture sustainable,
    the use of the IoT will be at the center and forefront in agricultural operations.
    This includes everything from water and power usage, crop transportation, farm
    machinery operation and maintenance alerts, and market price updates. The IoT
    has the capability to make these tasks streamlined and more predictable by recognizing
    the crop’s needs at every stage. It has already proved a breakthrough and is further
    going to change the way we look at various agriculture activities by providing
    the farmer control over their land and assets in an unprecedented way, thus, maximizing
    their effectiveness and efficiency. Further, the future of the IoT can be shaped
    by the phenomenal advances in WSNs and the fifth generation (5G) of cellular mobile
    communication technologies to provide farmers with real-time data and information
    anytime and everywhere their land is. Based on recent success, it is estimated
    that more than 75 million IoT-based devices will be operating in the agriculture
    industry by 2020. Further, the average farm is expecting to generate 4.1 million
    data points on a daily bases by 2050 [316]. B. Communication Real success of IoT
    in agriculture largely depends on advances in connectivity. From telecom’s perspective,
    providing mainly connectivity and other value-added services has an immense potential
    and can influence the entire chain greatly [317]. Most of the telecom operators
    around the globe offer connectivity services, but such services only represent
    a tiny amount of the entire smart agriculture market. Considering its worth, especially
    in rural areas, the cellular operators have to offer a new range of services targeting
    the growers’ demands. Accepting the fact that most of the community belong to
    this industry are not highly educated and mostly unaware of new technologies,
    hence the operator should provide end-to-end solutions other than just providing
    the connectivity. If so, then it will certainly help to increase the market share
    of mobile and telecom operators. Further, these operators need partnerships with
    the investors to provide end-to-end solutions, which demands higher investment,
    even before advantages can be seen. The results of success when inviting the investors
    depend on the nature of the partnership and the involved bodies, like device manufacturers,
    solution providers, non-cellular connectivity service providers, system integrators,
    etc. On one side, the outcome of this partnership would help operators to enter
    deeper into the industry, ultimately boosting their market share. At the same
    time, this opportunity can create strong relationships among the organizations
    and farmers to help to educate them about the benefits of smart agriculture. The
    success of cellular technology is only possible when service providers leverage
    its real benefits like portability, flexibility and luxury of two way communication
    to offer low cost but customized solutions. They must provide what the farmer
    is in need, at the place they choose. Furthermore, to provide fast penetration
    in agriculture industry, policy changes are required in order to provide access
    of reliable and quality inputs. The research conducted in [172] which considers
    23 studies where mostly belong to developing countries, concludes that the cellular
    services and smartphone technology carry a promising future for smallholder farmers
    being capable to improve their yields. Furthermore, licensed LPWA (low-power wide-area)
    technology is expected to be a game changer for smart agriculture. Due to its
    characteristics and supported services including low power consumption and efficient
    coverage are well suited to the geography and economics of agriculture hence expected
    to play a critical role in future smart farming. Consequently, narrowband IoT
    (NB-IoT) got strong industry support and becoming an effective global standard
    for LPWA connectivity. It has the potential to provide major connectivity changes
    in agriculture industry by changing the perceptions about Internet capabilities.
    Believing in its future success, it is expected that leading cellular operators
    with strong IoT ambitions can generate significant revenues by providing smart
    agriculture services when collaborating with LPWA technology providers. In order
    to achieve long term success of these short, mid and long range communication
    technologies, necessary steps for infrastructure construction are required towards
    attaining the technology-based agriculture. C. UAVs and Other Robots Drones are
    being widely used by farmers for crop growth monitoring and as a means to combat
    hunger and other harmful environmental impacts. Furthermore, they are being used
    to spray water and other pesticides efficiently, considering the tough terrains,
    especially when the crops possess different heights. Drones have proven their
    value, not only in terms of spraying speed but precision, as well, when compared
    with traditional machinery of same purpose. With recent advances in swarm technology
    and mission-based control, groups of drones equipped with heterogeneous sensors,
    including 3D cameras, can work together to provide farmers with comprehensive
    capabilities to manage their land. With the inclusion of UAVs in agriculture,
    farmers are able to put their eye in sky, but many challenges need to be addressed
    in order to enjoy the real advantages of this technology, especially the integration
    of other technologies and how to use them in poor weather conditions. Beside drones,
    robotics within agriculture have improved productivity and resulted in higher
    and faster yields. Such robots, like spraying and weeding robots, are reducing
    agrochemical use. Robots equipped with laser and camera guidance are being used
    for identifying and removing weeds without human intervention. They navigate between
    rows of crops on their own, ultimately increasing the yield with reduced manpower.
    More recently, plant-transplanting and fruit-picking robots are emerging to add
    a new level of efficiency to traditional methods. D. Machine Learning and Analytics
    Machine learning and analytics are used to mine data for trends. In farming, machine
    learning is used, for example, to predict which genes are best suited for crop
    production. This has been giving growers all over the world the best seed varieties,
    those which are highly suitable to respective locations and climate conditions.
    Machine-learning algorithms, on the other hand, have indicated which products
    are of high demand and which products are currently unavailable in the market.
    Thus, for the farmer, this has given valuable clues for future farming. Recent
    advances in machine learning and analytics will make it possible for farmers to
    accurately classify their products and weed out less desirable crops before they
    arrive to customers. E. Power Consumption, Renewable Energy, Microgrids, and Smart
    Grids Despite its future opportunities, smart agriculture facing some limitations
    that are holding back the growth of IoT. One of them is power issue as due to
    its nature; smart farming requires wide use of energy. Among the main reasons
    of extensive power consumption some are including, long term sensor deployment,
    use of GPS repeatedly and transmission of sensed data via GPRS. Traditionally,
    farmers in remote areas have bought and utilized renewable energy sources randomly
    and at a hefty price, which has limited their ability to use them in farming to
    a great extent. However to solve the power issues in long term, deep analysis
    of power consumption sources like remote data transmission can help to tackle
    the problem at some extent. Further, smart grids and microgrids, however, lend
    themselves to seamless integration of distributed energy sources (DERs), thus,
    making them appealing for adoption by farmers. The emergence of smart power meters
    has further given the farmers the confidence to invest in DER, especially since
    they have the option to sell the excess power to the grid. Recent advances in
    energy storage devices, integrated electricity and heat systems will make DER
    even more attractive for farmers, as they will be able to store energy and use
    the heat generated by cooling and heating when needed. However, healthy investment
    requirements and public perceptions are two other barriers on the way to making
    these solutions successful. F. Hydroponics and Vertical Farming (VF) Other than
    employing the advanced technologies, new agricultural practices can be very crucial
    to overcome the geographic and resource limitation challenges. On one side, arable
    land is shrinking, and, at the same time, it is estimated that three million people
    around the globe are migrating to cities, resulting in more pressure on the existing
    limited urban resources [318]. Considering this rapid migration, it is estimated
    that by 2030, 60% of the world’s population is going to depend on cities, and
    this number is further expected to rise to 68% until 2050 [319]. Considering both
    of these issues, it could be disaster for food production in the near future with
    current agriculture practices. VF is an answer of these issues, as it meets the
    challenges of land and water shortage and, at the same time, looks highly suitable
    to be adopted near the cities. VF is portrayed as the answer to the looming shortage
    of food and shrinking arable land, at least in some areas of the world. Further,
    hydroponics can play a key role, as this method lowers the requirements of water
    and space to a great extent. Rapid growths in computer power are propelling scientific
    discoveries in plant nutrition and growth that would make VF even more appealing
    to growers. Along VF and hydroponics, new and advanced solutions are required
    to increase the arable land without disturbing the forests and other natural animal
    habitats. For this, we have to focus on the deserts as these cover one third of
    the Earth’s land surface. The solutions are started already as Norwegian and Chinese
    firms/experts are doing efforts in Dubai, Qatar, Jordan and Chinese deserts [320]–[322].
    Agriculture is not just an industry; in fact, it provides the basis of human society,
    as the goal is not just to grow crops, but the target is the perfection of human
    being. A vibrant and prosperous agriculture sector can provide the basis for a
    happy and healthy society, as recent decades witnessed this. The presence of advance
    technologies, especially the involvement of the IoT, matters a great deal in regard
    to reaching this goal. Environmental issues continue to cage the planet, which
    increases the need for safe and clean agriculture. This is the reason humanity
    is witnessing a second green revolution, largely based on the IoT. The use of
    these technologies makes the farming industry highly productive with reduced labor
    and other resource consumption; same time, minimizing the impact on the environment.
    Our planet has the resources, but we have to learn how to utilize them wisely
    and precisely. Sensible use of technology can lead us where we can utilize these
    resources efficiently in order to ensure the food security of the current and
    coming generations. For this purpose, we need collective efforts to build such
    institutions that can shape long-term decisions and polices to eliminate hunger
    effectively. On this route, the experience, tools, and support from those nations
    that have succeeded in overcoming hunger should provide to those regions that
    are fighting to feed its local mouths. Although growth in every industry matters,
    growth in agriculture, particularly among small growers, can be highly effective
    to control the undernourishment issues, as more than 70% of the population of
    developing countries belongs to rural areas and somehow depends on agriculture
    sector. SECTION VIII. Conclusion The focus on smarter, better, and more efficient
    crop growing methodologies is required in order to meet the growing food demand
    of the increasing world population in the face of the ever-shrinking arable land.
    The development of new methods of improving crop yield and handling, one can readily
    see currently: technology-weaned, innovative younger people adopting farming as
    a profession, agriculture as a means for independence from fossil fuels, tracking
    the crop growth, safety and nutrition labeling, partnerships between growers,
    suppliers, and retailers and buyers. This paper considered all these aspects and
    highlighted the role of various technologies, especially IoT, in order to make
    the agriculture smarter and more efficient to meet future expectations. For this
    purpose, wireless sensors, UAVs, Cloud-computing, communication technologies are
    discussed thoroughly. Furthermore, a deeper insight on recent research efforts
    is provided. In addition, various IoT-based architectures and platforms are provided
    with respect to agriculture applications. A summary of current challenges facing
    the industry and future expectations are listed to provide guidance to researchers
    and engineers. Based on all this, it can be concluded that every inch of farmland
    is vital to maximize crop production. However, to deal with every inch accordingly,
    the use of sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication technologies is not
    optional—it is necessary. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    1. Introduction\nAgriculture is the biggest consumer of freshwater in the world,\
    \ amounting to up to 70% of the\ntotal use [1], which makes the case for smart\
    \ water management in order to guarantee water and food\nsecurity to the world’s\
    \ population. Irrigation systems and ﬁeld application methods for the cultivation\n\
    of crops play an important role therein. In an attempt to avoid loss of productivity\
    \ caused by water\nSensors 2019, 19, 276; doi:10.3390/s19020276\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 276\n2 of 20\nstress (under-irrigation), farmers spray more\
    \ water than needed (over-irrigation) and as a result not\nonly productivity is\
    \ challenged but also water and energy are wasted. Precision irrigation, in its\
    \ turn,\ncan use water more efﬁciently and effectively, avoiding both under-irrigation\
    \ and over-irrigation.\nThe smart management of water for precision irrigation\
    \ in agriculture is essential for increasing crop\nyield and decreasing costs,\
    \ while at the same time contributing to the environmental sustainability.\nThe\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) [2] emerges as the natural choice for smart water management\n\
    applications, even though the integration of different technologies required for\
    \ making it work\nseamlessly in practice is still not fully accomplished. The\
    \ emergence of IoT is a phenomenon that owes\nto the conjunction of several factors\
    \ such as inexpensive devices, low-power wireless technologies,\navailability\
    \ of cloud data centers for storage and processing, management frameworks for\
    \ dealing\nwith unstructured data from social networks, high-performance computing\
    \ resources in commodity\nplatforms, and computational intelligence algorithms\
    \ to deal with this monumental amount of data\n(aka big data analytics).\nCurrently,\
    \ there are some challenges to be overcome that still prevent the widespread use\
    \ of\nIoT for precision irrigation. Firstly, software development for IoT-based\
    \ smart applications, such as\nirrigation for agriculture, is not yet fully automatized\
    \ [3]. Secondly, advanced IoT software platforms\nare still missing, for automating\
    \ part of the process and integrating different technologies such as IoT,\nbig\
    \ data analytics, cloud computing and fog computing, for the deployment of pilot\
    \ applications for\nsmart water management. Thirdly, the integration of heterogeneous\
    \ and advanced sensors requires\nadequate standards and information models.\n\
    The SWAMP project developed and assessed an IoT-based smart water management platform\n\
    for precision irrigation in agriculture with a hands-on approach based on four\
    \ pilots in Brazil, Italy\nand Spain [4]. The SWAMP Platform can be conﬁgured\
    \ and deployed in different ways thus making\nup different SWAMP Systems, customized\
    \ to deal with the requirements and constraints of different\nsettings, countries,\
    \ climate, soils, and crops, which requires a good deal of ﬂexibility to adapt\
    \ to a\nrange of deployment conﬁgurations involving a varied mix of technologies.\n\
    This paper presents the SWAMP project, its architecture, platform and pilots,\
    \ as well as a\nscenario-based development process of derived systems. The SWAMP\
    \ layered architecture considers\nthree categories of services to ensure its replication\
    \ and adaptability. Entirely replicable services\ndeal with IoT services, storage\
    \ services, and data analytics and machine learning. Fully customizable\nservices\
    \ deal with water data management issues that specialize generic analytic services\
    \ into particular\ntechniques for different types of irrigation and water distribution.\
    \ Finally, application speciﬁc services\nrequire higher development effort since\
    \ they serve particular farms.\nThe SWAMP Platform contains the mainstream components\
    \ of FIWARE [5] and semantic features\nprovided by a SPARQL-based context engine\
    \ [6]. The platform may be deployed in a range of\ndifferent conﬁgurations for\
    \ component placement in the cloud or in the fog, involving the use of IoT\ncommunication\
    \ technologies and smart algorithms and analytics in the cloud, and fog-based\
    \ smart\ndecisions located on the farm premises. This is aimed at experimenting\
    \ with different deployment\npossibilities of the SWAMP Platform and providing\
    \ additional insights in terms of the replicability\nand adaptability of its components\
    \ to different settings. In other words, experimenting different\ndeployment conﬁgurations\
    \ is an important step for speeding up the learning process on how to deal\nwith\
    \ such a platform.\nAs scalability is a major concern for IoT applications, a\
    \ performance analysis of key software\ncomponents of its FIWARE-powered platform\
    \ was conducted, personalized for each pilot scenario.\nThe results show that\
    \ this platform can deal with the requirements of the pilots, but scalability\
    \ comes\nat a price. It was found that some FIWARE components must be ﬁne-tuned\
    \ to provide improved\nperformance and other ones must be completely re-engineered\
    \ to provide higher scalability using less\ncomputational resources. In addition,\
    \ MongoDB was identiﬁed as the bottleneck of the FIWARE tested\ninstallation that\
    \ may cause system crashes.\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n3 of 20\nThe contributions\
    \ of this paper are threefold. Firstly, the SWAMP approach that is the result\
    \ of\na collaborative interdisciplinary project involving researchers and practitioners\
    \ in two continents is\nintroduced. Secondly, different system deployments for\
    \ the SWAMP Platform are presented. Thirdly,\nthe results of a performance analysis\
    \ study that reveals important ﬁndings for the scalability of SWAMP\nIoT Platform\
    \ based on FIWARE are shown.\nIn the remainder of this paper, Section 2 introduces\
    \ background and related work. Section 3\nintroduces SWAMP concepts, while Section\
    \ 4 presents the four pilots and Section 5 details the system\ndeployment scenarios\
    \ for the SWAMP Platform. Section 6 presents performance analysis results\nfocusing\
    \ on scalability of the SWAMP Platform. Section 7 discusses the key ﬁndings and\
    \ results and\nﬁnally Section 8 draws conclusions and future work.\n2. Background\
    \ and Related Work\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no open IoT-based Platform\
    \ speciﬁcally focused on precision\nirrigation for agriculture, so that a clear\
    \ comparison with SWAMP is not possible. On the other\nhand, IoT has many security\
    \ requirements, such as privacy, conﬁdentiality, integrity, authentication,\n\
    authorization and accounting [7], as well as the signiﬁcant challenges posed by\
    \ security threats to the\nsuccess of IoT platforms [8]. However, this is out\
    \ of the scope of this paper.\n2.1. IoT Systems for Precision Irrigation\nCurrent\
    \ open source IoT-based systems for precision irrigation are mostly theoretical\
    \ with limited\nproof of concept experiences. They are either too generic or too\
    \ speciﬁc and do not explicitly address\neasy system deployment for facilitating\
    \ replicability and streamlining the deployment of new systems.\nWhen it comes\
    \ to providing advanced features to water management, there are some isolated\
    \ initiatives\nnot necessarily connected to the existing platforms and architectures.\
    \ For example, the FIGARO project\naims at increasing water productivity and improving\
    \ irrigation practices through the development\nof a precision irrigation management\
    \ platform, but not directly involving IoT [9]. Also, Popovi´c\net al. [10] present\
    \ a case study of a specially designed and currently limited IoT-enabled platform\n\
    for collecting data in precision agriculture and ecological monitoring domains.\
    \ Agri-IoT [11] is a\ntheoretical IoT-based framework for data analytics and real-time\
    \ processing for smart farming that\nshares some similarities with SWAMP.\nIn\
    \ the last years, much has been said about the prospective uses for IoT combined\
    \ with cloud-based\nservices and big data analytics. In Europe, there is a current\
    \ concern to understand the challenges\nand compelling impacts of IoT in large-scale\
    \ pilots for smart agriculture. Brewster et al. discuss the\ndeployment of those\
    \ large-scale pilots for IoT in agriculture and describe technologies and solutions\n\
    that might be present in some agrifood domains, such as dairy, fruit, arable crops\
    \ and meat & vegetable\nsupply chain [12].\nFIWARE has been used as a computing\
    \ platform for many IoT-based applications for smart\nfarming.\nRodriguez et al.\
    \ [13] compiled a short literature review and presented the Agricolus\nplatform\
    \ for precision farming. López-Riquelme et al. presented an implementation of\
    \ FIWARE\nfor a speciﬁc scenario of precision irrigation in agriculture in the\
    \ south of Spain [14], however, it is\nfocused on a speciﬁc use case, providing\
    \ details of devices and equipment, as well as irrigation\ntechniques. In contrast,\
    \ this paper presents an architecture and a platform based on FIWARE, as well\n\
    as conﬁgurations for system deployments in four scenarios.\nFog computing is a\
    \ fairly new paradigm aimed at dealing with challenges related to the huge\namount\
    \ of data that will be generated with the increasing utilization of IoT-based\
    \ systems [15].\nA new technological trend to implement the fog is container-based\
    \ virtualization, which provides a\nlightweight alternative to traditional hypervisors\
    \ [16]. FIWARE Generic Enablers are also distributed\nas Docker containers in\
    \ order to be used in the SWAMP fog computing approach.\nFogFlow\nprovides a programming\
    \ model for IoT-based applications for smart cities distributed over the cloud\n\
    and the fog located in the network edge [17]. Even though FogFlow is integrated\
    \ into FIWARE,\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n4 of 20\nthe SWAMP project takes a clean\
    \ approach and uses directly the components provided by FIWARE,\nin combination\
    \ with new components developed speciﬁcally for the SWAMP precision agriculture\n\
    scenarios whenever needed.\n2.2. The FIWARE Platform\nFIWARE [5] has been attracting\
    \ general attention for being an open source EU-funded solution,\ncomprised of\
    \ a series of software components called Generic Enablers (GE) that perform functions\n\
    needed in IoT-based smart applications. GEs can be used to build different applications\
    \ that exchange\ninformation through a REST API following the OMA NGSI [18] standard\
    \ based on JSON. The central\naspect of the FIWARE NGSI Context Management information\
    \ model is the concept of entities and\ntheir attributes. There has been an ongoing\
    \ effort to develop a Context Information Management API\nbased on recent advances\
    \ in Linked Data (LD) [19] based on JSON-LD called NGSI-LD, deﬁned in\nRDF (Resource\
    \ Description Framework) [20]. Both NGSI and NGSI-LD are currently supported by\n\
    FIWARE, even though the NGSI-LD speciﬁcation is preliminary [21].\nSome FIWARE\
    \ GEs are considered key enablers, such as:\n•\nOrion: A publish/subscribe context\
    \ broker, considered the heart of FIWARE. Orion only stores\nthe latest version\
    \ of entity attributes and it needs to work together with other applications in\n\
    order to maintain historical data.\n•\nIoT Agent: Maps data coming from sensors\
    \ and going to actuators to the FIWARE NGSI information\nmodel to be stored in\
    \ Orion and further processed by other GEs or external applications.\n•\nQuantum\
    \ Leap: New GE that preserves Orion NGSI historical entity data as times series,\
    \ replacing\nthe old and less scalable STH Comet.\n•\nCygnus: A data processing\
    \ and distribution system for applications that require more elaborate\ndata ﬂow\
    \ management than simple historical data.\n•\nCosmos: A set of tools that interface\
    \ with popular Big Data Platforms.\nIt has been shown that different architectural\
    \ choices of IoT platforms affect system scalability\nand that automatic real-time\
    \ decision-making is feasible in an environment composed of dozens\nof thousands\
    \ of sensors continuously transmitting data [22]. Cruz et al. present a comprehensive\n\
    study that proposes qualitative and quantitative metrics and evaluates the performance\
    \ of various\nIoT platforms [23]. They did not focus on speciﬁc features of FIWARE\
    \ and did not evaluate different\nscenarios and infrastructures, such as fog computing.\
    \ Martínez et al. [24] give a detailed description\nof the architecture of a testbed\
    \ of the FIWARE platform conﬁgured for the precision agriculture\ndomain. It differs\
    \ from our approach because their test application connects directly to FIWARE\
    \ using\nNGSI JSON interface, while this paper uses an IoT Agent for MQTT and\
    \ an IoT sensor simulator for\ngenerating synthetic data.\nA preliminary performance\
    \ analysis of FIWARE for SWAMP revealed that fog computing does\nnot always improve\
    \ the overall system performance and can even make it worse [25]. This paper\n\
    differs from previous work as it evaluates different conﬁgurations of FIWARE and\
    \ its focus is on the\nscenarios of smart irrigation in agriculture deﬁned for\
    \ the SWAMP project.\n2.3. The SEPA Platform\nThe SPARQL Event Processing Architecture\
    \ (SEPA) [6] enables the detection and communication\nof data changes for the\
    \ Semantic Web of Things [26]. SEPA is based upon W3C SPARQL 1.1 [27],\na RDF\
    \ query language, where publishers and subscribers exchange data. The SEPA framework\n\
    offers developers a solution for implementing Dynamic Linked Data applications\
    \ and services.\nLinked Data refers to a set of best practices for publishing\
    \ and connecting structured data on\nthe Web [18]. Dynamic aspects of Linked Data\
    \ involve discovery, granularity level, description\nof changes, detection algorithms,\
    \ and notiﬁcation mechanisms. The SEPA broker is the core element\nof the architecture,\
    \ implementing a content-based publish-subscribe mechanism where publishers\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 276\n5 of 20\nuse SPARQL 1.1 Updates to generate events and\
    \ subscribers use SPARQL 1.1 Queries to subscribe to\nevents. The latter receives\
    \ SPARQL query results and subsequent notiﬁcations generated by changes\nin the\
    \ RDF knowledge base are expressed in terms of added and removed query results\
    \ since the\nprevious notiﬁcation.\n3. SWAMP: Concept and Overview\nThe SWAMP\
    \ project is developing a high-precision smart irrigation system concept for agriculture.\n\
    Within SWAMP, water management for agriculture is partitioned into three phases:\
    \ water reserve,\nwater distribution and water consumption. For Water Consumption\
    \ SWAMP provides real-time\nresponses for adapting irrigation as crop conditions\
    \ change. On the other hand, changes in water\ndistribution are performed in a\
    \ longer timescale. Distribution and Consumption management systems\nare integrated,\
    \ as water usage triggers water distribution. The management of water reserves\
    \ is\nnot considered.\nThe SWAMP Architecture is divided into ﬁve layers, as depicted\
    \ by Figure 1.\nSensors 2019, 19, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n6 of 21 \n \nFigure 1. SWAMP\
    \ Layered Architecture. \nDifferent layers of the architecture are comprised of\
    \ more generic components that are more \nprone to be ported to other settings,\
    \ whereas others are more application-specific and thus porting \nrequires new\
    \ development efforts. When it comes to the generality/specificity scale, the\
    \ SWAMP \narchitecture provides three categories of components: (a) Fully Replicable\
    \ Services: Layers 1, 2 and 3 \nof the architecture are generic enough to allow\
    \ them to be replicable in different settings; (b) Fully \nCustomizable Services:\
    \ Layer 4 provides services that are closer to the final application and therefore\
    \ \nmust be aware of a level of detail that may vary for different techniques\
    \ and models of water \ndistribution and irrigation, which may require customization\
    \ for every new deployment; (c) \nApplication Specific Services: Services in Layer\
    \ 5 address particularities of pilots. \n4. SWAMP Pilots \n4.1. MATOPIBA Pilot\
    \ (Luís Eduardo Magalhães—Brazil) \nThe MATOPIBA region encompasses the Brazilian\
    \ states of Maranhão (MA), Tocantins (TO), \nPiauí (PI) and Bahia (BA), and is\
    \ one of the most critical irrigated agriculture frontiers in the country, \n\
    located in the cerrado, a savannah climate subtype. Typical crops are soybeans,\
    \ corn and cotton \nwhere irrigation is mostly performed by center pivots. Figure\
    \ 2 depicts the map of Northeastern \nBrazil showing the precise location of the\
    \ pilot in the municipality of Luís Eduardo Magalhães (a), \nFigure 1. SWAMP Layered\
    \ Architecture.\n•\nLayer 1: Device & Communication: a variety of sensor and actuator\
    \ technologies to acquire soil\n(e.g., moisture), plant (e.g., growing stage)\
    \ and weather (e.g., air temperature), as well as LPWAN\ncommunication technologies\
    \ (e.g., LoRaWAN [28]) are abstracted in this layer. The SWAMP pilots\nuse commercial\
    \ sensors as well as a homemade multiparametric sensor probe. Also, commercial\n\
    drones have been used to take images but a speciﬁc drone is under development\
    \ since one of\nthe partners is a drone maker. A complete description of the sensing\
    \ infrastructure is outside the\nscope of this paper.\n•\nLayer 2: Data Acquisition,\
    \ Security & Management: protocols and software components for\ndata acquisition\
    \ (e.g., MQTT [29] and LoRa Server [30]) are the key characteristic of this layer,\n\
    in addition to security and device management functions. The FIWARE IoT Agent\
    \ GE also belongs\nto this layer as it translates the internal FIWARE data representation\
    \ in JSON from/to devices.\n•\nLayer 3: Data Management: contains software components\
    \ in charge of data storage, processing\nand distribution based on FIWARE GEs\
    \ (Orion, QuantumLeap, Cygnus and Cosmos) and SEPA\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n6 of\
    \ 20\nSPARQL engine. A mapper between FIWARE JSON NGSI and SEPA RDF data models\
    \ also belong\nto this layer, as well as a mapper from external data sources,\

    \ useful to make a clear distinction between the SWAMP Platform and a SWAMP System.\n\
    The platform is a set of generic components depicted in Figure 1, used to build\
    \ SWAMP Systems.\nWhereas there is only one SWAMP Platform, each pilot requires\
    \ a system to be deployed to fulﬁll its\nspeciﬁc needs of irrigation or water\
    \ distribution. Generic components, mainly those from the lower\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 276\n9 of 20\nlayers of the architecture belong to the platform and may\
    \ be deployed in different ways in any system.\nOn the other hand, speciﬁc components\
    \ such as user interfaces belong to the system.\n5.1. SWAMP Baseline Scenario\n\
    Figure 6 depicts a baseline deployment scenario for the SWAMP platform that includes\
    \ three\nkey components, which are the SWAMP Cloud, the SWAMP Fog Hub and SWAMP\
    \ Field Fog Node.\nThis scenario represents the most complete and distributed\
    \ version of the SWAMP Platform, which is\nnot necessarily deployed as is in the\
    \ four pilots. For example, a fog infrastructure is not necessary in\nevery system\
    \ deployment of the SWAMP platform.\n \nkey components, which are the SWAMP Cloud,\
    \ the SWAMP Fog Hub and SWAMP Field Fog Node. \nThis scenario represents the most\
    \ complete and distributed version of the SWAMP Platform, which \nis not necessarily\
    \ deployed as is in the four pilots. For example, a fog infrastructure is not\
    \ necessary \nin every system deployment of the SWAMP platform. \nFigure 6 also\
    \ highlights a hierarchical organization of the fog, divided into Fog Field Nodes\
    \ \n(FFN) and a Fog Hub in the farm office. A FFN has a stable power source and\
    \ provides data \ntransmission, storage and processing capabilities to the sensors\
    \ spread in a farm plot, i.e., behaving \nas an aggregation point for LPWAN devices\
    \ [28]. Irrigation systems like the center pivot can host a \nFFN or even drones.\
    \ Its implementation may be as simple as a LoRaWAN Gateway that forwards \ndata\
    \ to the Fog Hub or may include storage and processing. \nThe role played by the\
    \ Fog Hub may also vary depending on farmer’s requirements of \nrobustness to\
    \ Internet disconnections, which may be frequent in agriculture frontiers. The\
    \ \nfunctionalities provided by a Fog Hub may vary from a sensor aggregation point\
    \ to a full-fledged \nmini cloud data center if farmers are willing to have full\
    \ control of their irrigation systems. The \nSWAMP Cloud stores and processes\
    \ data and smart algorithms are based on existing agriculture \nmodels and on\
    \ novel computational intelligence techniques, such as machine learning. \n \n\

    \ for the MATOPIBA Pilot \nThe deployment of the SWAMP Platform for the MATOPIBA\
    \ pilot has to deal with \ncommunication instability, distance from the farm office\
    \ to the center pivot, and even distance from \nFigure 6. SWAMP Baseline Scenario\
    \ including SWAMP Cloud and SWAMP Fog (further organized\ninto SWAMP Fog Hub and\

    \ of the fog, divided into Fog Field Nodes (FFN)\nand a Fog Hub in the farm ofﬁce.\
    \ A FFN has a stable power source and provides data transmission,\nstorage and\

    \ of the SWAMP Platform for the MATOPIBA pilot has to deal with communication\n\
    instability, distance from the farm ofﬁce to the center pivot, and even distance\
    \ from the farm to\nthe nearest downtown area A center pivot irrigates a circular\
    \ agricultural plot of 100 hectares that\nalternates soybeans and cotton and the\
    \ plot is further divided into different management zones based\non differences\
    \ in the soil properties. The center pivot controls the variable rate irrigation\
    \ sprinklers\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n10 of 20\n(actuators). The authors developed\
    \ multiparametric probes for soil sensing, which include moisture,\ntemperature\

    \ areas the plan\nis also to experiment ultra-low-power wireless sensor solutions\
    \ based on wake-up radios combined\nwith LoRaWAN [32].\nFigure 7 depicts the MATOPIBA\
    \ scenario where cloud and fog software components of the\nSWAMP Platform are\
    \ based on the SWAMP architecture (Figure 1). In order to represent different\n\
    system deployment possibilities, the picture shows two plots, where the topmost\
    \ plot uses a Field Fog\nNode (FFN) to aggregate sensor data and the bottommost\
    \ plot represents the sensors sending data\ndirectly to the Fog Hub. Currently,\
    \ both alternatives are under consideration but only one will be used\nin the\
    \ ﬁnal version of the pilot scenario.\n \nIn its simplest possible implementation,\
    \ the Field Fog Node only contains a LoRaWAN \ngateway. On the other hand, the\
    \ complexity of the communication and processing of sensor data is \ndealt with\
    \ by the Fog Hub. A LoRaWAN Gateway (located either in the FFN or in the Fog Hub)\
    \ \nforwards sensor data via a Mosquitto MQTT Broker [33] to a LoRa Server that\
    \ in turn sends the data \nto the FIWARE IoT Agent. The IoT Agent converts the\
    \ data format into NGSI, which goes to \nFIWARE Orion Context Broker. FIWARE Quantum\
    \ Leap is needed for different applications, such \nas the User Interface and\
    \ the Drone Platform. Also, a lightweight Fog Analytics component based on \n\
    simpler statistical techniques is used for computing the irrigation prescription\
    \ map whenever the \nInternet connection with the cloud is not available. \nThe\
    \ Cloud is represented with its essential components, which include a FIWARE central\

    In the Intercrop scenario, depicted by Figure 9, the communication and storage\
    \ infrastructure is\nagain a simpliﬁcation of both MATOPIBA and Guaspari scenarios,\
    \ where no Fog Hub is deployed\nin the farm ofﬁce. However, since in this case\
    \ the sensor data have no route to the Internet (and the\ncloud), it needs to\
    \ reintroduce the Field Fog Node (FFN) using LoRa Gateway and LoRa Server for\n\
    soil sensors and WiFi for drones and weather stations. In this scenario the Mosquitto\
    \ MQTT Broker is\nalso placed in the cloud, thus becoming the entry/exit point\
    \ for all incoming and outgoing messages.\nThis conﬁguration of the SWAMP Platform\
    \ is based on the premise that there is a stable cellular\nconnection (3G/4G)\
    \ for the FFN to interact with the cloud. In this scenario, apart from the FFN,\n\

    \ is\nan additional step, because of the cascading Orion solution, where the Cloud\
    \ Orion has to subscribe to\nthe fog Orion and the messages are then transferred\
    \ from one to the other.\nA lab testbed emulated the scenario for the experiments.\
    \ Both fog and cloud were implemented\nusing virtual machines (VM) in OpenStack.\
    \ The following standard Amazon AWS VM conﬁgurations\nwere deployed: cloud VM\
    \ equivalent to a t2.medium instance (2vCPU—4 GB of RAM) and the fog VMs\n(both\
    \ fog ﬁeld node and fog hub) equivalent to a t2.small instance (1vCPU—2 GB RAM).\
    \ The cloud\nwas composed of 6 VMs. Two different physical machines were used,\
    \ with the following conﬁguration:\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1240 V2 @ 3.40 GHz—8\
    \ cores and 8 GB of RAM.\nThree categories of metrics were used in the reported\
    \ experiments:\n•\nApplication metric: The elapsed time is the average time taken\
    \ since a sensor data point is\ngenerated by SenSE until the Consumer receives\
    \ it. This metric represents how long it takes for\nsensor data to be available\
    \ to any subscribed application.\n•\nSystem metrics: CPU and RAM usage per Docker\
    \ container, which allows observing each\napplication, collected every 5 s.\n\
    •\nExperiment metrics: The duration of the experiment given by the number of replications\
    \ (because\nsome components crashed after some time) and the number of received\
    \ messages are used to\nunderstand how experiments unfolded.\nThe experiments\
    \ involved a large number of sensors, sending data every 10 min. The scenarios\n\
    were executed with four different workloads determined by the number of sensors\
    \ sending messages\nsimultaneously. For the MATOPIBA, Guaspari and Intercrop scenarios,\
    \ 1000, 5000, 10,000 and\n15,000 sensors were used. For the CBEC scenario, as\
    \ depicted by Figure 11d, the workload was tripled,\ntotaling 3000, 15,000, 30,000\
    \ and 45,000 sensors. Each experiment took 1 min and was replicated\n30 times,\
    \ totalizing 16 h of running experiments. Asymptotic conﬁdence intervals were\
    \ calculated\nwith a 99% conﬁdence level.\nThe conﬁguration of WANem captured\
    \ characteristics of a connection from a farm to a cloud\nbased on a simple experiment\
    \ that obtained the network parameters by pinging a public cloud using a\n4G connection,\
    \ which resulted in a connection of 10 Mbps with 45 ms of delay and 5 ms of jitter.\n\
    6.2. Results\nFigure 12 depicts the main scalability results according to the\
    \ elapsed time metric and following\nthe methodology described above. MATOPIBA,\
    \ Guaspari and Intercrop scenarios are shown in\nFigure 12a and Table 1 and CBEC\
    \ scenario in Figure 12b. These results highlight important observations\nand\
    \ ﬁndings:\n•\nScalability limits: For MATOPIBA, Guaspari and Intercrop scenarios\
    \ the viable workload goes\nup to 10,000 sensors transmitting packets every 10\
    \ min (Figure 12a) where an elapsed time less\nthan 1 s was observed. Under a\
    \ workload of 15,000 sensors, Table 1 shows that the elapsed time\nincreases to\
    \ dozens of seconds with a high variation.\n•\nLightweight fog = no fog: The Guaspari\
    \ and Intercrop scenario yield very similar results for\nthe elapsed time, which\
    \ reveals that from a performance point of view there is no signiﬁcant\ndifference\
    \ if the MQTT Broker is placed in the fog or in the cloud.\n•\nCascading Orion:\
    \ The elapsed time is higher for the MATOPIBA compared to the Guaspari and\nIntercrop,\
    \ caused by the two cascading Orion components, in the fog and in the cloud, according\n\
    to Figure 11a. Whenever Orion receives a message it notiﬁes all subscribers of\
    \ the involved entity.\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n16 of 20\nIn this scenario, the\
    \ cloud Orion is a subscriber to the fog Orion, which means that in order for\
    \ the\nSubscriber to receive a message, it passes through two Orion notiﬁcation\
    \ steps, which is causing\nthe additional delay (up to one second with 10,000\
    \ sensors) and larger conﬁdence interval.\n•\nDivide and conquer: The CBEC scenario\
    \ has three farms represented by three SenSE trafﬁc\ngenerators in Figure 11d.\n\
    In order to scale up to 15,000 sensors per farm (which gives\n45,000 sensors),\
    \ the IoT Agent needed to be replicated in the cloud, each one in a new VM\nand\
    \ using a separate MongoDB instance. That solution increased the scalability for\
    \ the CBEC\nscenario, which were able not only to deal with 15,000 (which is not\
    \ viable in the other three\nscenarios), but also up to 45,000 sensors.\n \n\
    \ \nLightweight fog = no fog: The Guaspari and Intercrop scenario yield very similar\
    \ results for the \nelapsed time, which reveals that from a performance point\
    \ of view there is no significant \ndifference if the MQTT Broker is placed in\
    \ the fog or in the cloud. \n \nCascading Orion: The elapsed time is higher for\
    \ the MATOPIBA compared to the Guaspari and \nIntercrop, caused by the two cascading\
    \ Orion components, in the fog and in the cloud, \naccording to Figure 11a. Whenever\
    \ Orion receives a message it notifies all subscribers of the \ninvolved entity.\
    \ In this scenario, the cloud Orion is a subscriber to the fog Orion, which means\
    \ \nthat in order for the Subscriber to receive a message, it passes through two\
    \ Orion notification \nsteps, which is causing the additional delay (up to one\
    \ second with 10,000 sensors) and larger \nconfidence interval. \n \nDivide and\
    \ conquer: The CBEC scenario has three farms represented by three SenSE traffic\
    \ \ngenerators in Figure 11d. In order to scale up to 15,000 sensors per farm\
    \ (which gives 45,000 \nsensors), the IoT Agent needed to be replicated in the\
    \ cloud, each one in a new VM and using a \nseparate MongoDB instance. That solution\
    \ increased the scalability for the CBEC scenario, \nwhich were able not only\

    \ in \nsome cases), which leads us to assume that there is a memory leak. On the\
    \ other hand, the response \ntime for publishing messages to Orion increases steeply\
    \ thus increasing the number of simultaneous \nNGSI messages allocated inside\
    \ the IoT Agent (which cannot free the memory until it receives a \nconfirmation\
    \ from Orion). In other words, the increased response time together with a very\
    \ likely \nmemory leak are causing the IoT Agent to crash. \n \n \n(a) CPU used\

    \ As shown in this paper, the four SWAMP pilots provide\nenough diversity to assist\
    \ us in understanding the levels of generality and speciﬁcity to be provided\n\
    by different software components. Initially we identiﬁed three levels of components\

    \ of a component for collecting sensor data, like the FIWARE IoT Agent, which\
    \ must deal\nwith different combinations of data formats of sensors and wireless\
    \ technologies.\nDeployment: A variety of factors inﬂuence the design choices\
    \ for deployment alternatives of\nvarious fog/cloud conﬁguration scenarios: (a)\
    \ the stability and robustness of the Internet connection\nin the farm area, which\
    \ in some cases faces frequent disconnections that must be dealt with, such as\
    \ in\nthe Brazilian MATOPIBA pilot; (b) the availability of resources and interest\
    \ of farmers in maintaining\nan in-house fog-based IoT system in operation with\
    \ associated service level guarantees similar to a\ncloud environment, compared\
    \ to the disruptions caused by cloud intermittent access; (c) the capacity\nand\
    \ dependability of the fog nodes; (d) the use of LPWAN technologies for collecting\
    \ sensor data\nthat might require some minimum farm level infrastructure, such\
    \ as LoRaWAN, or relying on some\nyet-to-be-deployed or limited coverage public\
    \ service, such as NB-IoT or Sigfox [28]. There is no\n“one size ﬁts all” in IoT\
    \ systems for precision irrigation, which makes the case for ﬁnding different\
    \ ways\nof conﬁguring and connecting software components in cloud- and fog-based\
    \ deployments. The need\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n18 of 20\nfor an automated mechanism\
    \ for system deployment, given different requirements, infrastructures\nand constraints\
    \ was identiﬁed and it is currently handled within the project, but this is out\
    \ of the scope\nof this paper.\nScalability: Currently, most open IoT-based systems\
    \ that report results are proof-of-concept\npilots or small-scale IoT-based services.\
    \ Currently there is no de facto IoT Platform even though\nthere are many candidates,\
    \ including commercial solutions such as Amazon AWS IoT and Google\nCloud IoT.\
    \ FIWARE was adopted as the underlying IoT platform for the most common functions\n\
    of data distribution and storage. However, as our performance analysis revealed,\
    \ FIWARE still\nneeds signiﬁcant improvements to become a scalable solution for\
    \ extreme scenarios with heavy data\ngeneration. For example, the CBEC consortium\
    \ provides irrigation water for about 5000 farms and in\norder for the optimization\
    \ of water distribution to succeed they will need everything to be dealt with\n\
    by a single platform. For sure these large scenarios will require a considerable\
    \ number of devices that\nwill stress the platform even more than our experiments.\n\
    Complexity: There is a tradeoff in terms of dealing with complexity when it comes\
    \ to developing\nIoT-based applications. The approach taken in the CBEC scenario\
    \ is based on a hybrid solution that\ncombines a FIWARE-enabled context broker\
    \ and a semantic engine based on the linked data ontology\nmodel. While FIWARE\
    \ Orion Context Broker notiﬁes all subscribers whenever an entity is changed by\n\
    a publisher, the SEPA engine notiﬁes subscribers whenever the results of a semantic\
    \ query is changed,\nwhich is more powerful than a single entity. This conﬁguration\
    \ of the SWAMP Platform allows us to\ncompare a solution where the context broker\
    \ is simpler and the complexity dwells in the applications\n(FIWARE) to a solution\
    \ where the context broker is more complex and thus the applications can be\n\
    simpler (SEPA).\n8. Conclusions\nThe emergence of IoT is a phenomenon that owes\
    \ to the conjunction of several factors and now\nstarts to become real with huge\
    \ effort both in research and business areas. In this context, the SWAMP\nproject\
    \ develops IoT-based methods for smart water management in precision irrigation,\
    \ and pilots\nthem in Italy, Spain, and Brazil. This paper introduced the SWAMP\
    \ architecture, pilots and deployment\nscenarios for the four pilots using FIWARE\
    \ as the underlying IoT platform.\nA performance analysis of key FIWARE components\
    \ personalized for each SWAMP pilot scenario\nwas undertaken to understand the\
    \ scalability limits of the system. The results show that this platform\nmight\
    \ be able to deal with the performance requirements of our pilots, even though\
    \ requiring specially\ndesigned deployment conﬁgurations and the re-engineering\
    \ of some components to provide higher\nscalability using less computational resources.\
    \ Particularly, our experiments showed that MongoDB is\nCPU greedy, which negatively\
    \ impacts system performance.\nSWAMP is an ongoing project and therefore there\
    \ are multiple paths for future work. Some\nexamples are improving the platform\
    \ deployment scenarios, reporting the overall working of the\nSWAMP approach in\
    \ the pilots, including the experience with irrigation models and analytics and\n\
    more advanced performance analysis.\nAuthor Contributions: SWAMP is a collaborative\
    \ project and therefore concepts, architecture, platform, pilots\nand deployment\

    \ can provide signiﬁcant potential\nin Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture\
    \ applications, enabling the acquisition of real-time\nenvironmental data. IoT\
    \ devices such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be exploited\nin a variety\
    \ of applications related to crops management, by capturing high spatial and\n\
    temporal resolution images. These technologies are expected to revolutionize agriculture,\
    \ enabling\ndecision-making in days instead of weeks, promising signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in cost and increase in the\nyield. Such decisions enable the effective application\
    \ of farm inputs, supporting the four pillars of\nprecision agriculture, i.e.,\
    \ apply the right practice, at the right place, at the right time and with the\n\
    right quantity. However, the actual proliferation and exploitation of UAVs in\
    \ Smart Farming has not\nbeen as robust as expected mainly due to the challenges\
    \ confronted when selecting and deploying\nthe relevant technologies, including\
    \ the data acquisition and image processing methods. The main\nproblem is that\
    \ still there is no standardized workﬂow for the use of UAVs in such applications,\
    \ as it\nis a relatively new area. In this article, we review the most recent\
    \ applications of UAVs for Precision\nAgriculture. We discuss the most common\

    \ of investments in the agricultural sector has increased by\n80%. The goal of\
    \ these investments is to achieve productivity growth of at least 70% by 2050\
    \ [1] to meet\nthe increased needs of the population of the Earth considering\
    \ the fact that the area under cultivation\nwill decrease. Emerging technologies\
    \ such as Internet of Things (IoT) can provide signiﬁcant potential\nin Precision\
    \ Agriculture and Smart Farming, enabling the long-term increase in productivity\
    \ [2].\nThe IoT (Internet of Things) paradigm offers a new perspective for precision\
    \ agriculture enabling the\nreal- time and site speciﬁc management of the cultivated\
    \ ﬁelds. In IoT-based Smart farming, a system\nis built for monitoring the crops\
    \ targeting in the automation of various important farming operations\nsuch as\
    \ monitoring of the growth, irrigation process, application of fertilizers, disease\
    \ detection, etc.\nIn this context, technologies such as IoT can assist in the\
    \ acquisition of real-time information from the\nagricultural ﬁelds. This information\
    \ can be timely processed and exploited to support critical decisions\nregarding\
    \ the management of the crops.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349; doi:10.3390/info10110349\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/information\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n2 of 26\nRemote sensing\
    \ is generally considered one of the most important technologies for Precision\n\
    Agriculture and Smart Farming. It is commonly used for monitoring cultivated ﬁelds,\
    \ providing\neffective solutions for Precision Agriculture in the last 35 years\
    \ [3]. Remote sensing can monitor many\ncrops and vegetation parameters through\
    \ images at various wavelengths. In the past, remote sensing\nwas often based\
    \ on satellite images [4,5] or images acquired by using manned aircraft in order\
    \ to\nmonitor vegetation status at speciﬁc growth stages. However, satellite imagery\
    \ is often not the best\noption because of the low spatial resolution of images\
    \ acquired and the restrictions of the temporal\nresolutions as satellites are\
    \ not always available to capture the necessary images. In addition, it is often\n\
    required to wait long periods between acquisition and reception of images. In\
    \ addition, environmental\nconditions, such as clouds, often hinder their reliable\
    \ use. Considering the use of manned aircrafts,\nusually it results in high costs,\
    \ and many times it is not possible to carry out multiple ﬂights to obtain\nmore\
    \ than a few crop images.\nThe development of UAV-based remote sensing systems\
    \ have taken remote sensing and Precision\nAgriculture (PA) one step further.\
    \ The use of UAVs to monitor crops offers great possibilities to acquire\nﬁeld\
    \ data in an easy, fast and cost-effective way compared to previous methods. UAV-based\
    \ IoT\ntechnology is considered as the future of remote sensing in Precision Agriculture.\
    \ UAVs’ ability to ﬂy\nat a low altitude results in ultra-high spatial resolution\
    \ images of the crops (i.e., a few centimeters).\nThis signiﬁcantly improves the\
    \ performance of the monitoring systems. Furthermore, UAV-based\nmonitoring systems\
    \ have high temporal resolution as they can be used at the user’s will. This enhances\n\
    the ﬂexibility of the image acquisition process. In addition, UAVs are a lot simpler\
    \ to use and also\ncheaper than manned aircrafts. Moreover, they are more efﬁcient\
    \ than the ground systems as they can\ncover a large ﬁeld in a short amount of\
    \ time and in a non-destructive way, which is very important.\nUAVs are not a\
    \ recent technology since the ﬁrst attempt to construct a powered UAV was recorded\n\
    in 1916 [6]. UAVs were initially exploited for military purposes; however, in\
    \ recent years, their use has\nrapidly expanded to other types of applications\
    \ (commercial, scientiﬁc, agricultural, etc.). The wider\nuse of UAVs was led\
    \ by the technology advancements and the miniaturization of the associated\nhardware\
    \ during the 1980s and 1990s.\nUnmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are now very commonly\
    \ used in remote sensing applications\nfor Precision Agriculture. Equipped with\
    \ sensors of different types, UAVs can be exploited to identify\nwhich zones of\
    \ the crops need different management, e.g. some kind of input. This gives the\
    \ farmers the\nability to react on time in any problem detected. UAS can be used\
    \ in a plethora of different applications\non Precision Agriculture, such as health\
    \ monitoring and disease detection, growth monitoring and\nyield estimation, weed\
    \ management and detection, etc. As the use of UAVs in PA applications is very\n\
    frequent in the last years and it is considered the future of remote sensing,\
    \ it is a ﬁeld that draws a\nlot of attention. Thus, several reviews exist for\
    \ their application in Precision Agriculture and Smart\nFarming. Most of the reviews\
    \ focus mainly on the different types of applications that UAVs can have in\n\
    agricultural crops [7–12] or environmental monitoring in general [13]. In [14],\
    \ the authors reviewed the\nhyperspectral imagery and the techniques used in these\
    \ cases. Maes et al. [15] focused on the suitability\nof the different available\
    \ sensors for each application, providing with important perspectives for the\n\
    use of UAVs in PA. However, this work does not review the techniques used for\
    \ exploiting the acquired\ninformation. In addition, a survey that discusses the\
    \ use of Deep Learning in agricultural data has\nbeen conducted [16].\nTo the\
    \ best of the authors knowledge, a review focusing also on the most frequently\
    \ used\ntechniques exploiting and processing UAV imagery from agricultural ﬁelds\
    \ is currently missing from\nthe literature, despite its necessity. We believe\
    \ that it is very important mainly because the absence of a\nstandardized workﬂow\
    \ is one of the major drawbacks that affects the wider use of UAV systems in\n\
    commercial PA applications. This fact results in the adoption of a variety of\
    \ heterogeneous procedures\nand methods by different researchers, for the same\
    \ goal. This results to not always having the best\noutcome. Furthermore, we believe\
    \ that a study reviewing the most recent works is of paramount\nimportance, as\
    \ it is a research area that is advancing really quickly. In this work we extend\
    \ [17],\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n3 of 26\nreviewing the most recent studies\
    \ about UAV-based applications for PA, focusing on the most common\ntechniques\
    \ applied on UAV imagery in recent works to monitor crop ﬁelds in Precision Agriculture.\n\
    The goal is to identify the most used sensors and practices for each type of application.\n\
    To properly perform a review on UAV applications in Precision Agriculture, we\
    \ formulated the\nfollowing research questions (RQs):\n1.\nWhich are the different\
    \ types of UAV applications in Precision Agriculture? In this research\nquestion,\
    \ we aim to explore the current trends in the application of UAVs in precision\
    \ agriculture.\nThe initial goal of UAVs in their early application in agriculture\
    \ was to derive direct image-based\nproducts.\nNowadays, this has changed, and\
    \ the applications of UAVs in agriculture are\nintelligence-based oriented products\
    \ that process images and provide informed decision-making\napplications to the\
    \ farmers. In this question, we provide a thorough description of the different\n\
    types of applications that UAVs can support based on the different operational\
    \ needs of\nagriculture ﬁelds.\n2.\nWhat types of crops are monitored by UAV systems?\
    \ In this research question, our target is\nto record the different types of crops\
    \ that have been monitored so far with the help of UAVs.\nAdditionally, we provide\
    \ general information regarding the geographical distribution of these\ncrops,\
    \ their size and the different stages of growth where monitoring can take place.\
    \ By answering\nthis research question, we can identify how the different characteristics\
    \ of each crop and its life\ncycle affect the use of UAVs.\n3.\nWhich UAV system\
    \ technologies are adopted in Precision Agriculture?\nIn this research\nquestion,\
    \ we identify the system characteristics of UAV-based applications for Precision\n\
    Agriculture. By answering this question we can locate the speciﬁc UAV types and\
    \ sensors\nthat can be used for monitoring crops.\n4.\nWhat types of data can\
    \ be acquired by UAVs? In this research question, we record the different\ntypes\
    \ of data that can be acquired by UAVs based on the sensor technology employed.\
    \ We also\nprovide a review of the advantages and disadvantages of the different\
    \ types of data that can be\ngathered with the help of different sensors based\
    \ on the associated cost and the types of the ﬁeld\noperations applied.\n5.\n\
    Which data processing methods can be used to exploit the agricultural data acquired\
    \ by UAVs?\nIn this research question, we identify the methods that are used for\
    \ image analysis in agricultural\ncrops. We distinguish between three types of\
    \ data processing methods that can be used alone or\ncomplementary so as to gain\
    \ insights regarding a ﬁeld namely: (a) Photogrammetric techniques;\n(b) Machine\
    \ Learning techniques; and (c) Vegetation Indices.\nTo answer these research questions,\
    \ we reviewed 100 recent papers [18–117] published during the\n2017–2019 period.\n\
    The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the basic\
    \ UAV-based applications\nfor Precision Agriculture, including the types of crops\
    \ being monitored, the application domains and\nthe UAV technologies being used\
    \ for Precision Agriculture purposes. In Section 3, we focus on the\nbasics of\
    \ UAV-based data acquisition and the types of sensors used. Section 4 discusses\
    \ the most\nused image processing methods that stood out in the literature: the\
    \ photogrammetry techniques, the\nvegetation indices calculation and machine learning.\
    \ Next, Section 5 focuses on the limitations in the\nuse of UAVs for Precision\
    \ Agriculture. Finally, Section 6 discusses the results of the review and make\n\
    some concluding remarks.\n2. UAV-Based Monitoring of Crops\nIn this section, we\
    \ introduce the applications of UAVs for Precision Agriculture, along with the\n\
    types of crops being monitored and the UAV technologies adopted.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 349\n4 of 26\n2.1. Types of UAV Applications in Precision Agriculture\n\
    To date, UAV technologies have been successfully employed in a variety of applications\
    \ for\nPrecision Agriculture such as site-speciﬁc herbicide applications, water\
    \ deﬁciency identiﬁcation,\ndetection of diseases, etc. Using the information\
    \ acquired by the UAVs several decisions can be made\nto handle the problem(s)\
    \ detected and/or optimize harvesting by estimating the yield.\nThe most common\
    \ applications of UAVs for Precision Agriculture, as recorded in the literature,\n\
    are the following:\n•\nWeed mapping and management [70,98]\n•\nVegetation growth\
    \ monitoring and yield estimation [48,65,87]\n•\nVegetation health monitoring\
    \ and diseases detection [46,77]\n•\nIrrigation management [64,118]\n•\nCorps\
    \ spraying [89,95]\nAmong the most popular application of UAVs in Precision Agriculture\
    \ is Weed mapping.\nWeeds are not desirable plants, which grow in agricultural\
    \ crops and can cause several problems.\nThey are competing for available resources\
    \ such as water or even space, causing losses to crop yields\nand in their growth.\
    \ In addition to the problems in the growth of the crops, weeds can cause problems\n\
    at harvesting. The use of herbicides is the dominant choice for weed control.\
    \ In conventional farming,\nthe most common practice of weed management is to\
    \ spray the same amounts of herbicides over the\nentire ﬁeld, even within the\
    \ weed-free areas. However, the overuse of herbicides can result in the\nevolution\
    \ of herbicide-resistant weeds and it can affect the growth and yield of the crops.\
    \ In addition,\nit poses a heavy pollution threat to the environment. In addition,\
    \ the above practice signiﬁcantly\nincreases the cost. To overcome the above problems,\
    \ in Precision Agriculture practices, Site-Speciﬁc\nWeed Management (SSWM) is\
    \ used. SSWM refers to the spatially variable application of herbicides\nrather\
    \ than spraying them in the whole ﬁeld. In this context, the ﬁeld is divided into\
    \ management\nzones that each one receives a customized management, as usually\
    \ weed plants spread through only\nfew spots of the ﬁeld. To achieve this goal,\
    \ it is necessary to generate an accurate weed cover map for\nprecise spraying\
    \ of herbicide. UAVs can gather images and derive data from the whole ﬁeld that\
    \ can\nbe used to generate a precise weed cover map depicting the spots where\
    \ the chemicals are needed:\n(a) the most; (b) the least; or (c) they should not\
    \ be applied at all.\nUAVs are also frequently used for Monitoring the growth\
    \ of the vegetation and providing\nestimation regarding the yield. The lack of\
    \ means for systematically monitoring the progress of\ncultivation is considered\
    \ as one of the major obstacles to increasing the agricultural productivity\n\
    and quality. This problem is also compounded by the variability of weather conditions\
    \ that alter the\nmicro-climate of crops jeopardizing the agricultural production.\
    \ Regular collection of information\nand visualization of crops using UAVs, provides\
    \ increased opportunities to monitor crop growth\nand record the variability observed\
    \ in several parameters of the ﬁeld. Many recent works focus on\nmonitoring the\
    \ biomass and nitrogen status of the crops along with yield estimation. Biomass\
    \ is the\nmost common crop parameter, which together with information related\
    \ to nitrogen content can be\nused to determine the need for additional fertilizer\
    \ or other actions. In addition, the information\nacquired by the UAVs can be\
    \ used for the creation of three-dimensional digital maps of the crop, and\nfor\
    \ the measurement of various parameters, such as crop height, distance between\
    \ rows or between\nplants, and the index Leaf Area Index (LAI). UAVs offer the\
    \ potential to systematically collect crop\ninformation, therefore farmers can\
    \ plan in a controlled manner the crop management, use of inputs\n(e.g., use of\
    \ nutrients), timing of harvesting and soil and yield pathogens, or even identify\
    \ possible\nmanagement errors.\nUAVs are also used to monitor vegetation health.\
    \ Crop health is a very important factor that\nneeds to be monitored, as diseases\
    \ in crops can cause signiﬁcant economic loss due to the reduced yield\nand the\
    \ reduction of quality. Crops should be monitored constantly to detect the diseases\
    \ in time and\navoid spreading problems. Traditionally, this task is performed\
    \ by human experts directly in the ﬁeld.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n5 of 26\n\
    However, this can be very time consuming, as it can require months to inspect\
    \ an entire crop preventing\nthe potentials of “continuous” monitoring. Another\
    \ common disease control method is the application\nof pesticides in certain dates.\
    \ Such a strategy incurs a high cost and also increases the likelihood of\nground\
    \ water contamination as pesticide residues in the products. In Precision Agriculture,\
    \ site-speciﬁc\ndisease control takes place. PA practices adopt a decision-based\
    \ disease management strategy, in which\nautomated non-destructive crops disease\
    \ detection plays a very important role. Disease detection\nis feasible as diseases\
    \ induce changes in biophysical and biochemical characteristics of the crops.\n\
    UAV-based data processing technologies use crop imaging information to identify\
    \ changes in plant\nbiomass and their health. Therefore, diseases can be detected\
    \ in their early stages enabling farmers\nto intervene in order to reduce losses.\
    \ In this context, UAVs can be used in the two different stages\nof disease control:\
    \ (a) at the initial stage of infection by collecting crop health relevant information,\n\
    during which UAVs can detect a possible infection before visual indications appear\
    \ and map the size of\nthe infection to different parts of a culture; and (b)\
    \ during the treatment of infection when farmers can\nuse UAVs for targeted spraying\
    \ as well as for accurately monitoring the course of their intervention.\nCrop\
    \ irrigation management is a very important area of application of UAV technologies\
    \ in\nPrecision Agriculture. Currently, 70% of the water consumed worldwide is\
    \ used for the irrigation of\ncrops [119,120], a fact that highlights the need\
    \ for precision irrigation techniques. Precision irrigation\ntechniques can improve\
    \ the efﬁciency of water use, so that the resource is applied effectively: (a)\
    \ in\nthe right places; (b) at the right time; and (c) in the right quantity.\
    \ The detection of the areas where\nmajor irrigation is needed can help the farmers\
    \ to save time and water resources. At the same time,\nsuch precision farming\
    \ techniques can lead to increased crop productivity and quality. In the context\n\
    of precision agriculture, the ﬁeld is divided in different irrigation zones, to\
    \ precisely manage the\nresources. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles incorporating\
    \ suitable sensor types makes it possible\nto identify parts of a crop that need\
    \ more water. At the same time, the above technologies allow for the\nproduction\
    \ of specialized maps that illustrate the morphology of the soil, thus supporting\
    \ the more\nefﬁcient irrigation planning of each crop separately.\nAn application\
    \ of UAVs in precision agriculture that is more rarely met is Crop spraying. The\
    \ main\nspraying equipment used in conventional farming are the manual air-pressure\
    \ and battery-powered\nknapsack sprayers. However, these conventional sprayers\
    \ can cause major pesticide losses. In addition,\nthe operators need to be present\
    \ when spraying, which leads to exposure of the operators. In addition,\nit may\
    \ be time-consuming to spray the entire ﬁeld, which is not only limiting the resources\
    \ but also can\nlead to not-timely spraying. In this manner, UAVs can be useful\
    \ due to the lower operator exposure\nand improved ability to apply chemicals\
    \ in a timely and highly spatially resolved manner. The use\nof precision systems\
    \ for measuring distances allows UAVs to follow the morphology of the ground,\n\
    keeping their height constant. Therefore, an aircraft has the ability to spray\
    \ the appropriate amount\nof herbicide spatially, adjusting both its height and\
    \ the amount it sprays depending on the crop site\nin which it is located. Crop\
    \ spraying is particularly important in cases where diseases have been\nidentiﬁed\
    \ where it is important to reduce pesticide use without affecting crop yield.\
    \ In conclusion,\nUAV-based systems can make a decisive contribution to crop spray\
    \ management.\nIn addition to the common applications mentioned above, UAVs have\
    \ also been used for soil\nanalysis [108,112], cotton genotype selection [48],\
    \ mammal detection [24], and assessment of soil\nelectrical conductivity [66].\n\
    2.2. Types and Properties of Crops Monitored by UAV-Based Systems\nIn the recent\
    \ years, UAV technologies have been employed to monitor a variety of different\
    \ types\nof crops, located in several countries all over the world. UAV applications\
    \ in Precision Agriculture\nhave been carried out in 29 different countries. The\
    \ majority of applications are located in economically\ndeveloped countries, with\
    \ the US and China standing out. Lately, however, the applications in Europe\n\
    have increased as well.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n6 of 26\nRegarding the different\
    \ types of crop species that can be monitored with the help of UAVs, more\nthan\
    \ 30 different species were identiﬁed. Among the most common crop species monitored\
    \ by UAV\ntechnologies are Maize, Wheat, Cotton, Vineyards, Rice and Soya. In\
    \ addition, we observe that these\ntechnologies have been used to monitor crops\
    \ with completely different characteristics, such as olive\ntrees and rice crops.\n\
    Another observation is that the monitoring of crops can take place during the\
    \ different stages\nof growth, even at the early ones before being able to draw\
    \ inferences from soil characteristics.\nThe purpose of constant and continuous\
    \ monitoring of crops at different stages of development\nis to record various\
    \ factors that may affect the ﬁnal performance of crops, as well as to evaluate\n\
    the effectiveness of actions taken to address problems identiﬁed at an earlier\
    \ stage of development.\nRegarding the size of the crops monitored we observe\
    \ in this review that it is possible:\n•\nTo monitor large ﬁelds (>10 ha), where\
    \ data are collected from all areas.\n•\nTo monitor small farms or small parts\
    \ of a ﬁeld.\n•\nTo monitor areas of great heterogeneity. This is achieved by\
    \ using a UAV equipped with automatic\npilot systems and ground-level sensors.\n\
    2.3. UAV System Technologies\nAn Unmanned Aerial System that applies to Precision\
    \ Agriculture usually includes the following\nkey elements [121]:\n•\nOne or more\
    \ UAVs: Flying vehicles that have no operator on their spindle but operate either\n\
    autonomously or remotely.\n•\nA Ground Control Station (GCS): It is a computer\
    \ that either communicates with the UAV Control\nSystem or controls and monitors\
    \ the UAV directly. The GCS monitors information related to the\nﬂight of the\
    \ UAV. The user has the ability to receive data relevant to the ﬂight of the aircraft,\
    \ but\nalso data recorded by the sensors that support the ﬂight (i.e., ground-based\
    \ sensors or sensors\nembedded in the aircraft). In addition, the GCS contains\
    \ the software required for the processing\nof data acquired by the UAV and the\
    \ extraction of the information needed by the system operator\nfor the crop monitoring.\n\
    •\nUAV Control System (UAV CS): It is used to control the UAV. It can be either\
    \ a two-way data\nlink, such as a remote control, or a built-in computer (usually\
    \ with a built in GPS). The UAV CS\nincludes the ﬂight control system and/or the\
    \ autopilot system, which controls the operation of\nthe UAV. This system receives\
    \ and processes data from the autopilot or ﬂight control system for\nthe proper\
    \ operation of the UAV. It usually contains sensors to monitor the ﬂight properties,\
    \ such\nas sensors for measuring distance from ground, air force, etc. The control\
    \ system has the ability to\nprocess information from sensors to correct any problems\
    \ that may arise, and to communicate\nwith the GCC wireless and in real time by\
    \ sending and receiving the necessary information.\n•\nSensors for data acquisition:\
    \ They are cameras intended to collect the information needed. The\nnext section\
    \ provides a detailed presentation of possible ways of collecting information\
    \ and the\ntechnologies exploited. In the case that UAVs are not intended to collect\
    \ information but are used\nfor another purpose, such as spraying, the sensors\
    \ are replaced with the necessary components.\nFocusing on the UAV technologies\
    \ being used for PA, the types of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles can\nbe divided into\
    \ ﬁve basic categories, based on their design characteristics (see Figure 1).\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 349\n7 of 26\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\nFigure 1.\n\
    (a) Fixed-wing (eBeeTM) [23]; (b) helicopter (Hornet Maxi) [122]; (c) octocopter\
    \ [25];\n(d) blimp [123]; (e) ﬂapping-wing (SmartBird) [122]; and (f) parafoil-wing\
    \ (Tetracam) [90].\n1.\nFixed-wing: These are unmanned planes with wings that\
    \ require a runway to take off from\nthe ground or a catapult. This type of UAVs\
    \ has high endurance as well as the ability to\nﬂy at high speeds. In addition,\
    \ ﬁxed-wing UAVs have the ability to cover large areas on\neach ﬂight and can\
    \ carry more payload. However, they are more expensive than the other\ntypes.\
    \ In the works reviewed, 22% used ﬁxed-wing UAVs. One type of ﬁxed-wing UAVs that\n\
    has not been identiﬁed in the reviewed literature, but is a very promising technology,\
    \ is the\nsolar-powered UAVs [124]. Solar-powered UAVs offer signiﬁcantly increased\
    \ ﬂight times because\nthey exploit and store the sun’s energy during the day.\
    \ This is the reason that they are preferred\nfor long-endurance operations.\n\
    2.\nRotary-wing: The rotary-wing UAVS, also called rotorcrafts or Vertical Take-Off\
    \ and Landing\n(VTOL), offer the advantages of steady ﬂying at one place while\
    \ keeping the maneuverability\nattribute. These features are useful for many different\
    \ types of missions. However, they cannot\nﬂy at very high speed or stay in the\
    \ air for a long time. They are generally the most widely used\nUAVs in all kinds\
    \ of applications, but especially in Precision Agriculture. One reason for this\n\
    is the fact that they present lower cost compared to the other types of UAVs.\
    \ In addition, this\ntype of UAVs is suitable when the monitored crops are not\
    \ very large, which is usually the case.\nA UAV of this type may be:\n•\nAn unmanned\
    \ helicopter: They include main and tail rotors such as conventional helicopters.\n\
    Overall, 4% of the works used this type.\n•\nMulti-rotor: This category includes\
    \ rotary-wing UAVs with four or more rotors (quadcopter,\nhexacopter, octocopter,\
    \ etc.). These aircraft are generally more stable in ﬂight than unmanned\nhelicopters.\
    \ Overall, 72% of the works used this type.\n3.\nBlimps: This type of UAV is lighter\
    \ than air, has high endurance, ﬂies at low speeds and is\ngenerally larger in\
    \ size compared to the other types. Their manufacturing characteristics allows\n\
    them to remain in the air even in the event of a total loss of power, while being\
    \ considered\nrelatively safe in the event of a collision. Usually, they are not\
    \ used in Precision Agriculture\napplications. In the recent works reviewed, no\
    \ application was found using this type of UAVs.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n\
    8 of 26\n4.\nFlapping wing: These UAVs are very small and they have ﬂexible, shaped\
    \ little wings inspired by\nthe way birds and insects ﬂy. They are not often used\
    \ in Precision Agriculture as they require\nhigh energy consumption due to their\
    \ size. No work was found in the literature review using\nthis type of UAVs.\n\
    5.\nParafoil-wing. Usually aircrafts of this type have one or more propellers\
    \ at the back in order to\ncontrol the course of their ﬂight, but at the same\
    \ time for harnessing the power of the air to ﬂy\nwithout consuming much energy.\
    \ They are also capable of carrying a larger payload. They are\nnot usually exploited\
    \ for PA applications. Only 2% of the works analyzed use this type.\nIn addition\
    \ to the above classiﬁcation, UAVs can also be categorized according to their\
    \ size [121].\nHowever, the categorization used in this study is more common,\
    \ as it takes into account more factors\naffecting the performance of UAVs and\
    \ their use in Precision Agriculture.\nThe majority of the recent works in Precision\
    \ Agriculture use multi-rotor UAVs. This is mainly\ndue to the fact that in most\
    \ applications the area under consideration is not very large. For this reason,\n\
    it is not necessary to use UAVs with high speed and the ability to cover large\
    \ areas in a few ﬂights, such\nas ﬁxed-wing UAVs. Thus, rotary-wing aircraft are\
    \ preferred because of the following advantages:\n•\nEasy to operate\n•\nSlower\
    \ speeds\n•\nAbility to maneuver\n•\nRelatively low cost\nThese advantages provide\
    \ greater opportunities for collecting information from crops through\nimaging,\
    \ which is the main use of UAVs in vegetation monitoring. In cases where the monitoring\
    \ area\nis relatively large, ﬁxed-wing aircraft are preferred, which enable the\
    \ monitoring of the entire area in a\nshort time.\n3. UAV Data Acquisition\nEquipped\
    \ with specialized sensors, UAVs are becoming powerful sensing systems that\n\
    complement the IoT-based techniques. The role of the sensors is to capture images\
    \ of high-spatial and\ntemporal resolution, which can assist in monitoring many\
    \ different characteristics of the vegetation.\nA variety of different types of\
    \ sensors can be used in an agricultural UAV depending on the different\ncrop\
    \ parameters that should be monitored [9]. However, the needs for low payload\
    \ capacity and the\nutilization of small platforms pose several limitations on\
    \ the selection s of the sensor(s) to be used.\nThe main criteria that the sensors\
    \ have to meet are the low weight, the low energy consumption\nand the small size.\
    \ Of course, all of the above must be combined with the ability to capture high\n\
    resolution images.\nModern commercial on-board sensors complying with the above\
    \ restrictions that are used for PA ,\nmainly belong to the following four types:\n\
    •\nVisible light sensors (RGB)\n•\nMultispectral sensors\n•\nHyperspectral sensors\n\
    •\nThermal sensors\nIn addition to the above types of sensors, other types of\
    \ sensors can be used, such as laser\nscanners, also mentioned in the literature\
    \ as light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Laser scanners\nare a well-established\
    \ technology used extensively for environmental sciences, however they are\nmostly\
    \ used for terrestrial scanning. Airborne laser scanning has been exploited since\
    \ 1994 [125], when\ncommercial systems became available. However, they were not\
    \ widely used in the studies reviewed,\nmainly due to the increased cost compared\
    \ to other types of sensors used for data acquisition [84].\nEach sensor type\
    \ can monitor different characteristics of the vegetation, such as the color and\n\
    texture of vegetation or the geometric outline of the crops. In addition, some\
    \ sensors can measure\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n9 of 26\nthe radiation in certain\
    \ wavelengths. The data acquired by these sensors can be further processed to\n\
    monitor plant biomass, vegetation health, soil moisture and other important crop\
    \ characteristics at the\ndifferent growth stages. Figure 2 presents examples\
    \ of the main types of sensors used.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 2. Examples of\
    \ sensors used by UAVs for PA: (a) thermal sensor [103]; (b) RGB sensor [59];\n\
    (c) multispectral sensor [26]; and (d) hyperspectral sensor [88].\n•\nVisible\
    \ light sensors (RGB): RGB sensors are the most frequently used sensors by UAV\
    \ systems\nfor Precision Agriculture applications. They are relatively low cost\
    \ compared to the other types\nand can acquire high resolution images. In addition,\
    \ they are easy to use and operate and they\nare lightweight. In addition, the\
    \ information acquired requires simple processing. The images\ncan be acquired\
    \ in different conditions, on both sunny and cloudy days, but a speciﬁc time frame\n\
    is required based on weather conditions to avoid inadequate or excessive exposure\
    \ of the image.\nConsidering the drawbacks of these sensors, the main disadvantage\
    \ is the fact that they are\ninadequate for analyzing a lot of vegetation parameters\
    \ that require spectral information in the\nnon-visible spectrum. They are commonly\
    \ used in tandem with the other types of sensors.\n•\nBy using multispectral or\
    \ hyperspectral imaging sensors, UAVs can acquire information about\nthe vegetation’s\
    \ spectral absorption and reﬂection on several bands. Spectral information can\n\
    be signiﬁcantly helpful in assessing a lot of biological and physical characteristics\
    \ of the crops.\nFor example, unhealthy parts of the crops can be discriminated\
    \ in an image, as visible radiation\nin the red channel is absorbed by chlorophyll,\
    \ while near infrared (NIR) radiation is strongly\nreﬂected. Thus, even if it\
    \ is not yet visible in the red channel, it can be identiﬁed by the information\n\
    in the NIR channel. Spectral information can be used to calculate several vegetation\
    \ indices and\nmonitor several crop characteristics based on them.\nMultispectral\
    \ and hyperspectral sensors are frequently used, despite their higher costs. However,\
    \ a\ndrawback of these sensors arises from the fact that it is required to apply\
    \ more complex\npre-processing methods in order to extract useful information\
    \ from the captured images.\nThe pre-processing procedure of spectral images often\
    \ contains the radiometric calibration,\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n10 of 26\n\
    geometric correction, image fusion and image enhancement. The main difference\
    \ between\nmultispectral and hyperspectral sensors is the number of bands (or\
    \ channels) that each sensor\ncan capture and the width of the bands. Multispectral\
    \ sensors capture 5–12 channels while\nhyperspectral images can usually capture\
    \ hundreds or thousands bands, but in a narrower\nbandwidth. Although in the recent\
    \ works studied multispectral sensors are used a lot more\nfrequently than hyperspectral\
    \ because of their lower cost, hyperspectral technology seems to have\na lot of\
    \ potential and is considered as the future trend for crop phenotyping research\
    \ [9].\n•\nThermal infrared sensors capture information about the temperature\
    \ of the objects and generate\nimages displaying them based on this information\
    \ and not their visible properties. Thermal\ncameras use infrared sensors and\
    \ an optical lens to receive infrared energy. All objects warmer\nthan absolute\
    \ zero (−273 ◦C/−459 ◦F) emit infrared radiation at speciﬁc wavelengths (LWIR\
    \ and\nMWIR bands) in an amount proportional to their temperature. Hence, thermal\
    \ cameras focus\nand detect the radiation in these wavelengths and usually translate\
    \ it into a grayscale image for\nthe heat representation. Many thermal imaging\
    \ sensors can also generate colored images. These\nimages often show warmer objects\
    \ as yellow and cooler objects as blue. This type of sensors\nis used for very\
    \ speciﬁc applications (e.g., irrigation management). As a result, they are not\n\
    frequently used in PA applications of UAV systems that focus on monitoring other\
    \ characteristics\nof the crops.\nIn the image acquisition by UAVs, it is typical\
    \ to acquire several overlapping images of the\ncrops. In the most cases they\
    \ capture both front and side overlapping images. This is desired as the\noverlapping\
    \ images can be used for the construction of 3D models and/or orthophotos of the\
    \ crops, as\nthe next section discusses. The rate of the overlap depends on the\
    \ type of the application. The front\noverlap usually ranges 60–95% while the\
    \ side overlap ranges 40–95% to generate three-dimensional\nmodels and 25–40%\
    \ for other uses.\nIn addition, the altitude of the UAV ﬂights varies according\
    \ to the application and spatial accuracy\nof the information we want to collect.\
    \ The distance between the target (crop) to be visualized and the\nUAV plays an\
    \ important role in determining the detail of the information acquired. This is\
    \ something\nthat depends on both the sensors and the resolution they offer. In\
    \ the majority of cases, depending on\nthe purpose of the application, the spatial\
    \ resolution of the photographs is between 0.5 cm/pixel and\n10 cm/pixel.\nQuite\
    \ often, RGB sensors are modiﬁed to acquire information about the radiation in\
    \ other bands\ntoo, usually the Near Infrared (NIR) or the Red Edge (RE) band.\
    \ This approach is observed when\nthe stakeholders want to avoid the higher costs\
    \ of buying multispectral cameras. This is achieved by\nreplacing one of the original\
    \ optical ﬁlters with one that enables the perception of near-infrared channel,\n\
    resulting often in a hybrid (e.g., NIR-RGB) sensor. The visible channel that is\
    \ no longer captured by\nthe modiﬁed RGB sensor is often captured by using another\
    \ embedded RGB sensor. The use of both\nmultispectral and visible sensors was\
    \ observed in many cases [22,23,27,31,33,49,50,55,56,61,65,69,72,\n87,103,107,113,117].\n\
    4. UAS Data Processing\nThis section focuses on the data processing techniques\
    \ utilized to analyze the UAV imagery. To be\nmore precise, we discuss the different\
    \ ways the information UAVs capture can be exploited to study\ndifferent vegetation\
    \ features. The most common features that can be monitored with UAV-based\nremote\
    \ sensing for Precision Agriculture are presented in Table 1:\nInformation 2019,\
    \ 10, 349\n11 of 26\nTable 1. Crop features that can be monitored with UAVs.\n\
    Crop Features\nVegetation\nbiomass [22,103]\nnitrogen status [22,99,103,110]\n\

    \ shape of different elements and plants\nvegetation indices [54–56]\nSoil\nmoisture\
    \ content [109,112]\ntemperature [66,69]\nelectrical conductivity [66]\nWith the\
    \ use of specialized sensors, UAVs can acquire information for various features\
    \ of the\ncultivated ﬁeld. However, as mentioned above, there is still no standardized\
    \ workﬂow or well\nestablished techniques to follow for analyzing and visualizing\
    \ the information acquired. The most\ncommonly used image processing methods y\
    \ to analyze UAV imagery for Precision Agriculture\npurposes are the following:\n\
    •\nPhotogrammetry techniques: Photogrammetry regards the accurate reconstruction\
    \ of a scene or\nan object from several overlapping pictures. Photogrammetric\
    \ techniques can process the 2D data\nand establish the geometric relationships\
    \ between the different images and the object(s), obtaining\n3D models. To construct\
    \ the 3D models, photogrammetry requires at least two overlapping\nimages of the\
    \ same scene and/or object(s), captured from different points of view. These kind\
    \ of\ntechniques can be used for extracting three-dimensional digital surface\
    \ or terrain models [37,40,43]\nand/or orthophotos [50,55]. UAV low-altitude data\
    \ acquisition enables the construction of 3D\nmodels with a much higher spatial\
    \ resolution compared to other remote sensing technologies\n(such as satellites).\
    \ However, the collection of many images is required to have information for\n\
    the entire ﬁeld under study. Thus, in most cases, it is necessary to collect many\
    \ overlapping\nimages to construct Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the crops\
    \ and/or create orthophotos\n(also referred to as orthomosaics). The 3D models\
    \ and the orthophotos include information about\nthe 3D characteristics of the\
    \ crops based on the structure of the vegetation (e.g., the vegetation\nheight,\
    \ the canopy, the density, etc.) and can be very useful for applications that\
    \ can exploit only\nRGB imagery. The works reviewed showed that photogrammetric\
    \ techniques are very commonly\nused in all types of applications as they are\
    \ also required to create vegetation indices maps.\nIn addition, the 3D information\
    \ they include is very important and is often used in tandem with\nother techniques.\n\
    •\nMachine learning methods: Machine Learning (ML) has been used to process the\
    \ data acquired,\nfor prediction and/or identiﬁcation purposes, with great results\
    \ in many domains, such as medical\nsystems [126,127], marketing [128], biology\
    \ [129], etc. Machine learning techniques are often\nbeen applied in Precision\
    \ Agriculture to exploit the information from the large amount of data\nacquired\
    \ by the UAVs. ML is able to estimate some parameters regarding the crop growth\
    \ rate,\ndetect diseases or even to identify/discriminate objects in the images.\
    \ Machine learning usage\nhas increased a lot recently due to the fast advancements\
    \ taking place especially in the deep\nlearning ﬁeld.\n•\nVegetation Indices calculation:\
    \ Vegetation Indices (VIs) are one of the most popular products\nof remote sensing\
    \ applications for Precision Agriculture.\nThey use different mathematical\ncombinations/transformations\
    \ of at least two spectral bands of the electromagnetic spectrum,\ndesigned to\
    \ maximize the contribution of the vegetation characteristics while minimizing\
    \ the\nexternal confounding factors. They can deliver reliable spatial and temporal\
    \ information about the\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n12 of 26\nagricultural crops\
    \ monitored. In most cases, many VIs are extracted and used to draw conclusions.\n\
    They can be calculated based on information of either each photograph individually\
    \ or after the\nproduction of orthophotos depicting the whole crop. Calculating\
    \ vegetation indices may serve\nin the identiﬁcation of useful crop characteristics,\
    \ such as biological and physical parameters of\nthe vegetation.\nSince the processing\
    \ of data may be time consuming, several software tools and techniques have\n\
    been developed to enable faster data processing. The most commonly adopted software\
    \ solutions in\nthe works reviewed to support and accelerate the data analysis\
    \ procedure are summarized in Table 2.\nIn addition to the software tools referenced\
    \ in the table, there are several other promising software\ntools that can assist\
    \ in the data analysis process, such as Erdas Imagine [130], eCognition [131],\
    \ and\nPixelWrench 2 [132].\nTable 2. Most common software tools used in the literature\

    \ for the calculation of the vegetation indices from\nmultispectral data\nMATLAB\
    \ [35,100]\nApplied mainly for the calculation of vegetation indices. It can also\
    \ be\nexploited for other image processing methods\nPix4D [29,35,55]\nThe most\
    \ commonly used tool. It can be used for calculating VIs and/or\nconstructing\
    \ of 3D models and orthomosaics\nIn the following subsections, we provide the\
    \ details of the three most commonly used data\nprocessing techniques to analyze\
    \ data acquired from UAV ﬂights in the agricultural domain.\n4.1. Photogrammetric\
    \ Techniques\nPhotogrammetric techniques are mainly be applied for the construction\
    \ of orthomosaics and/or\nDigital Elevation Models (DEMs) in order to exploit\
    \ the 3D information regarding the vegetation.\nAs mentioned above, this can be\
    \ done by acquiring many overlapping images of the agricultural crops\nmonitored.\
    \ The advancements in computer vision and photogrammetric techniques have lead\
    \ to many\ndifferent techniques and algorithms that are able to match large numbers\
    \ of overlapping images and\ndetect common objects and scenes in them. The images\
    \ are processed by applying aerial triangulation\nand adjusting camera orientation.\
    \ Computer vision methods are used for matching the overlapping\nimages and the\
    \ common characteristics. To achieve object tracking as well as to identify the\
    \ scale and\nthe orientation of a particular image; in some cases, Ground Control\
    \ Points (GCPs) are being used.\nGCPs distributed in the cultivated ﬁeld can be\
    \ identiﬁed within the overlapping images: (a) to link the\nimages; and (b) to\
    \ identify the coordinates of each image and its slope. However, recent advancements\n\
    have made this redundant, as many techniques can be used without GCPs, with similar\
    \ precision.\nThe construction of the 3D Digital Elevation Models can provide\
    \ to the producer information\nabout the altitude of the earth surface, the natural\
    \ and artiﬁcial objects/structures on the surface, the\ndensity of the vegetation,\
    \ and their growth, among others. There are two types of DEMs used:\n•\nThe Digital\
    \ Terrain Model (DTM) represents the altitude of the surface of the Earth, i.e.,\
    \ of the\nterrain. These models do not take into account either artiﬁcial or natural\
    \ (e.g., trees, vegetation,\nbuildings) objects that exist in the ﬁeld. DTMs just\
    \ present the elevation of the bare Earth. Figure 3\nshows a Digital Terrain Model\
    \ from Ronchetti et al. [79].\n•\nThe Digital Surface Model (DSM) represents the\
    \ altitude of the surface that is ﬁrst encountered by\nthe remote sensing system\
    \ (i.e., when the aerial image captures the top of a building, tree, the\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 349\n13 of 26\nvegetation etc.). Hence, the elevation model generated\
    \ includes the elevation of the bare Earth\nalong with artiﬁcial and natural objects\
    \ that may exist in the ﬁeld.\nThe DEMS constructed can be exploited either for\
    \ the extraction of 3D information directly\nor to construct orthomosaics of the\
    \ crops. An orthoimage, orthomosaic or orthophoto is an aerial\nphotograph that\
    \ is orthorectiﬁed (i.e., geometrically corrected). Thus, the scale of the constructed\n\
    image is uniform. As a result, the ﬁnal orthophoto has the same lack of distortion\
    \ as a map. In contrast\nwith a simple aerial image of a ﬁeld, an orthophoto can\
    \ be used to measure true distances as it contains\nthe 3D characteristics of\
    \ the crops.\nThe use of photogrammetry techniques have the following procedure:\
    \ create point cloud\nrepresentations of the 3D surface and either combine all\
    \ objects into a single Digital Elevation Model\nor use the DEMs to generate an\
    \ orthophoto. The most commonly used set of algorithms for this\npurpose is Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) [133]. The main advantage of SfM is that it does not require\n\
    any information regarding the camera parameters or the environmental settings.\n\
    (a)\n(b)\nFigure 3. (a) A Digital Terrain Model [79]; and (b) a Digital Surface\
    \ Model [109].\nPhotogrammetric techniques are commonly used in all types of applications\
    \ as they are also\nrequired for constructing the vegetation indices maps. Photogrammetric\
    \ techniques are used in the\nmajority of recent works (93%) to exploit and extract\
    \ information regarding the 3D characteristics of\nthe crops. However, photogrammetric\
    \ techniques are in most cases used to compliment other types of\ndata processing\
    \ methods.\n4.2. Using Machine Learning\nMachine Learning (ML) and Data Mining\
    \ methods are widely used in PA to exploit the\ninformation acquired by the UAVs.\
    \ Taking into account the large amounts of data collected from\nagricultural ﬁelds,\
    \ machine learning can be applied to enhance the performance of UAV-based systems\n\
    for PA, by extracting knowledge for several parameters of the vegetation. ML is\
    \ used in many cases\nand for different purposes. Both unsupervised and supervised\
    \ learning techniques are being exploited,\nvia clustering, classiﬁcation and\
    \ regression methods.\nRegression methods are widely used in UAV applications\
    \ for PA for a variety of purposes.\nRegression has been used to estimate spectral\
    \ vegetation indices by analyzing data acquired from RGB\nimages [35], presenting\
    \ generally good results. Additionally, regression has been used to examine the\n\
    correlation of some vegetation indices with vegetation features such as nitrogen\
    \ [22,38,99], leaf are\nindex [36,103], and biomass [22,36,103]. For this purpose,\
    \ both linear (simple and multiple) regression\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n14\
    \ of 26\nand nonlinear regression methods have been used. In a comparison of different\
    \ regression algorithms,\nfor estimating leaf nitrogen content, Random Forests\
    \ presents the best results among 14 algorithms,\nwith the coefﬁcient of determination\
    \ (R2) being up to 0.79 [38]. Regression methods are also used\nto predict crop\
    \ water status, by using information derived from RGB, multispectral and thermal\n\
    sensors [64,92,104]. In this context, Artiﬁcial Neural Networks present generally\
    \ good results (R2 up\nto 0.87 by using and information from some spectral bands).\n\
    Classiﬁcation methods are also very commonly used for weed mapping [18,33,44,73,106,111]\
    \ and\ndisease detection [46,77,97]. The most popular and precise classiﬁcation\
    \ techniques are the Artiﬁcial\nNeural Networks (ANNs) family [18,44,73,104] and\
    \ the Random Forest algorithm [22,38,49]. These\nalgorithms directly use the RGB\
    \ colors, the intensity, spectral information or other features derived\nfrom\
    \ the image acquired. In some cases, data about the neighborhood of each pixel\
    \ are also considered.\nApart from the above data, classiﬁcation algorithms can\
    \ also use vegetation indices as features in\nthe model to achieve higher accuracy.\
    \ In general, ANNs present higher accuracy, compared to other\nclassiﬁcation algorithms,\
    \ that reaches up to 99% for weed mapping in some cases [98]. The accuracy\nof\
    \ the method depends on the type of the crops monitored [73] as expected. Convolutional\
    \ Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), is among the most used family of algorithms. CNNs belong\
    \ to deep learning\nalgorithms that have been proved to be very effective in object\
    \ detection in large datasets.\nThe use of Deep Learning (DL) in Precision Agriculture\
    \ applications is a recent, modern and\npromising technique, having increasing\
    \ popularity. Deep learning techniques extend typical ML by\nadding more complexity\
    \ into the derived models. DL techniques transform the data using various\nfunctions\
    \ that allow data representation in a hierarchical way, through several levels\
    \ of abstraction.\nAdvancements and applications of Deep Learning into other domains\
    \ indicate its large potential.\nAs indicated in [16,134], the use of Machine\
    \ Learning and more particular Deep Learning will be even\nmore widespread in\
    \ the next years.\nA very common application of Machine Learning methods in PA\
    \ is Object Based Image Analysis\n(OBIA). The purpose of OBIA is to discriminate\
    \ objects within agricultural images obtained from\nUAVs [32,43].\nIn contrast\
    \ to traditional pixel-based image classiﬁcation, which classiﬁes each\npixel,\
    \ OBIA groups small pixels together into vector objects. With the higher spatial\
    \ resolution\nof UAV imagery, pixel-based classiﬁcations have become much less\
    \ effective.\nThat is due to\nthe fact that the relationship between the pixel\
    \ size and the object size has changed signiﬁcantly.\nTherefore, object-oriented\
    \ classiﬁcation methods are increasing in popularity. They use segmentation\n\
    methods to divide the image pixels into homogeneous segments/groups. Then, these\
    \ segments/objects\nare arranged into classes based on their geometric, spectral,\
    \ textural and other characteristics.\nOBIA is usually composed of two main steps:\n\
    1.\nImage segmentation\n2.\nFeature extraction and classiﬁcation\nThese methods\
    \ are exploited to recognize and detect weeds or discriminate different species\
    \ in\nthe ﬁeld. A detailed review of algorithms and challenges for OBIA, from\
    \ a remote sensing perspective,\nwas reported by Hossain and Chen [135].\n4.3.\
    \ Vegetation Indices\nVegetation Indices (VIs) have been widely used in remote\
    \ sensing applications for Precision\nAgriculture. They are considered to be very\
    \ effective for monitoring the growth and health of crops\nin qualitative and\
    \ quantitative vegetation analysis [25,29,30]. Vegetation Indices are based on\
    \ the\nabsorption of electromagnetic radiation by the vegetation.\nThey are mathematical\
    \ transformations of the absorption and scattering in different bands of\nthe\
    \ electromagnetic spectrum. The reﬂectance in several bands is affected by parameters\
    \ such as\nvegetation biochemical and physical properties, environmental effects,\
    \ soil background properties,\nmoisture content, etc. The understanding of the\
    \ spectral behavior of the vegetation is fundamental\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n\
    15 of 26\nto remote sensing applications to monitor various vegetation features\
    \ (e.g., biomass [22], nitrogen\nstatus [19,22], vegetation health [46], etc.)\
    \ It has been shown that certain VIs are signiﬁcantly related\nwith different\
    \ parameters of the vegetation.\nSimple Vegetation Indices that can combine RGB\
    \ information and some spectral bands such as\nNIR and RE have signiﬁcantly improved\
    \ the ability to detect green and healthy vegetation. Several VIs\nhave been developed,\
    \ as different environments have their own complex characteristics, which needs\n\
    to be taken into account when using a Vegetation Index. Thus, each VI has its\
    \ own speciﬁc combination\nof the reﬂectance in different bands, in order to detect\
    \ vegetation. Hence, its VI is suitable for speciﬁc\nuses. The main concept is\
    \ to combine the reﬂections of different bands to decrease the “noise” from\n\
    external factors (e.g., sensors calibration, lighting, atmosphere, soil properties,\
    \ etc.). For example, as\nmentioned in the previous section, visible radiation\
    \ to the red is absorbed by the chlorophyll while the\nradiation in the NIR band\
    \ is strongly reﬂected. In this way, vegetation can be discriminated by the soil\n\
    in an image. In way, unhealthy vegetation can also be detected.\nVegetation Indices\
    \ that are based on the radiation in the Red and NIR channels, such as the RVI\n\
    or the NDVI index, are designed to increase the contrast between the vegetation\
    \ and the soil. The\nrelationship between the reﬂections of the two zones allows\
    \ the elimination of disturbances by factors\nthat affect the radiation of each\
    \ zone in the same way.\nThe effort to model the biophysical parameters of vegetation\
    \ has led to the creation of several\ndifferent vegetation indices [136–139].\
    \ The vegetation indices can be divided into two main categories:\n1.\nVegetation\
    \ Indices based on multispectral or hyperspectral data. Most of the developed\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices use multispectral and/or hyperspectral information that\
    \ can combine several bands.\n2.\nVegetation Indices based on information from\
    \ the visible spectrum. Several VIs in the visible\nspectrum have been developed\
    \ and are widely used due to the high cost of multispectral and\nhyperspectral\
    \ sensors.\nA list of the most used vegetation indices is presented in Table 3.\
    \ For the interpretation of\nthe following formulas, the following abbreviations\
    \ represent the reﬂection in the respective color\nor spectrum:\n•\nR: Red (620–670\
    \ nm)\n•\nG: Green (500–560 nm)\n•\nB: Blue (430–500 nm)\n•\nNIR: Near Infrared\
    \ (720–1500 nm)\n•\nRE: Red Edge (670–720 nm)\nConcerning the multispectral vegetation\
    \ indices, one of the ﬁrst well-known indices was Ratio\nVegetation Index (RVI).\
    \ This index enhances the contrast among vegetation and soil. However, it is\n\
    sensitive to the optical properties of ground. The best known and most widely\
    \ used vegetation index\nis the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),\
    \ which is the evolution of RVI and is calculated\nby the visible and near infrared\
    \ light reﬂected from the vegetation. Unhealthy or sparse vegetation\nreﬂects\
    \ more visible light and less near infrared light, making it easy to monitor the\
    \ growth and health\nof many agricultural crops. It is based on absorption in\
    \ Red due to chlorophyll and reﬂectance in NIR.\nRVI and NDVI are calculated as\
    \ shown in Table 3.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n16 of 26\nTable 3. Most used vegetation\
    \ indices.\nVegetation Index\nAbbreviation\nFormula\nVegetation Indices derived\

    Several other VIs have been developed based on NDVI. NDRE uses the method of NDVI\
    \ to\nnormalize the ratio of NIR radiation with Red Edge (RE) radiation. The same\
    \ applies for GNDVI with\nNIR and Green (G) bands.\nFigure 4 shows examples of\
    \ crop maps constructed from information of spectral VIs (NDVI and\nNDRE) in different\
    \ growth stages. We can see that the difference in the maps while the vegetation\n\
    grows is quite clear.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.\nVegetation indices maps of crops in\
    \ different growth stages [29]:\n(a) NDVI maps;\nand (b) NDRE maps\nFocusing on\
    \ the VIs extracted from RGB images, Excess Greenness Index (ExG) and Normalized\n\
    Difference Index (NDI) are the most used indices. ExG is based on the assumption\
    \ that plants display\na clear high degree of greenness, and soil is the only\
    \ background element. Thus, it is calculated\nby doubling the radiation in the\
    \ Green channel minus the radiation in Red and Blue channels.\nNDI was proposed\
    \ to separate plants from soil and residue background images, using only green\
    \ and\nred channels.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n17 of 26\nAlthough the VIs that\
    \ use information in the visible light can be useful for crop monitoring,\nthey\
    \ cannot provide information for several parameters of the vegetation and also\
    \ they are sensitive\nto working environment properties such as the atmosphere,\
    \ lighting, etc. Hyperspectral remote\nsensing is expected to be the future trend\
    \ in crop monitoring and this is mainly because it allows the\ndevelopment of\
    \ new bands combination of vegetation indices. In many cases, it has been proved\
    \ that\nhyperspectral vegetation indices are less sensitive to saturation, change\
    \ in viewing/lighting geometry,\nand atmospheric contamination. The combination\
    \ of new bands can eliminate noise from the working\nenvironment and in the same\
    \ time exploit the information of certain bands and extract information for\n\
    more biophysical features of the vegetation.\n5. Limitations in the Use of UAVs\
    \ for Precision Agriculture\nAlthough the use of UAVs for PA is expanding there\
    \ are several limitations that prevent their\nwider use. The absence of a standardized\
    \ workﬂow leads to the adoption of ad-hoc procedures for\ndeploying PA applications,\
    \ a fact that discourages the relevant stakeholders. In addition, as PA requires\n\
    data-intensive procedures for the exploitation of the images acquired, skilled\
    \ and expert personnel\nis usually needed. This means that an average farmer may\
    \ need training or even been forced to hire\nexperts to assist with the image\
    \ processing, which may be costly. This fact may prohibit the adoption\nof UAV\
    \ technologies from individual farmers with only a few and small agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds.\nThe high investment cost to purchase the Unmanned Aerial System is another\
    \ prohibitive factor.\nProducers with larger cultivated areas and higher proﬁt\
    \ rates are able to use more sophisticated,\nhigh-cost systems, though this is\
    \ not the case for the majority of the ﬁelds in Europe. There were\n10.5 million\
    \ agricultural holdings in the EU in 2016, two-thirds of which were less than\
    \ 5 hectares in\nsize, as shown in the Eurostat survey [140].\nAnother drawback\
    \ stems from UAV technology limitations. Most commercial UAVs have a short\nﬂight\
    \ time, ranging from 20 min to 1 h, covering a very restricted area at every ﬂight.\
    \ UAVs that can\noffer longer ﬂight time are relatively expensive. In addition,\
    \ the effective use of UAVs is prone to\nclimatic conditions. For example, on\
    \ a very windy or rainy day, the ﬂight should be postponed.\nAs the use of UAVs\
    \ for agriculture purposes is considered to be commercial, UAV ﬂights should\n\
    also adhere to the related legislation and national rules. However, the EU regulations\
    \ [141,142] for the\nuse of UAVs will replace national rules from July 2020. In\
    \ practice, these regulations report that, once\nan UAV pilot has received the\
    \ appropriate authorization, he/she will be allowed to freely use UAVs in\nthe\
    \ EU. The EU legislation will cover all types of possible UAVs operations, fostering\
    \ the development\nof innovative applications (e.g., for PA).\nThe EU regulations\
    \ consider three categories of operations:\n1.\nOpen category: Operations in this\
    \ category do not require authorization or pilot license.\nThis category is limited\
    \ to operations: in visual line of sight (VLOS), up to 120 m ﬂight height and\n\
    performed with UAVs compliant with some technical requirements deﬁned.\n2.\nSpeciﬁc\
    \ category: This is the second level of operations, which covers operations that\
    \ are not\ncompliant to the restrictions of the open category and are considered\
    \ “medium risk” operations.\nOperators must perform a risk assessment (using a\
    \ standardized method) and deﬁne mitigation\nmeasures. Operations involving UAVs\
    \ of more than 25 kg or not operated in VLOS will typically\nfall under this category.\
    \ The technical requirements for this category depend on the speciﬁc\nauthorized\
    \ operation.\n3.\nCertiﬁed category: This category is considered high risk and\
    \ includes operations involving large\ndrones in controlled air-spaces. Rules\
    \ applicable to this category will be the same as for manned\naviation. This category\
    \ does not concern the use of UAVs for Precision Agriculture.\nTaking into account\
    \ the rapid developments in UAV technology and the sensors use in PA,\nthe cost\
    \ of the Unmanned Aerial Systems will be reduced in the near future. Practical\
    \ limitations,\nsuch as the short ﬂight time, are also expected to be solved by\
    \ the advancements in technology.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n18 of 26\nThese\
    \ improvements will ensure that farmers can reap more from the use of UAVs for\
    \ remote sensing\nin Precision Agriculture.\n6. Discussion and Conclusions\nIn\
    \ this work, we review 100 recent applications of UAVs for Precision Agriculture.\
    \ We present the\nmost frequent applications, the UAV types used and the Unmanned\
    \ Aerial systems architecture for\nPA. Then, we focus on the most used sensors\
    \ for monitoring the crops and the processing methods\nexploiting UAV imagery.\
    \ We show that UAVs can have several applications, however monitoring crop\ngrowth\
    \ is the one that stands out. The following three main processing techniques stand\
    \ out in the\nliterature for exploiting the information acquired:\n1.\nPhotogrammetry\
    \ techniques are used to construct Orthophotos or DEMs from the overlapping\n\
    images acquired. They are used in most of the applications to create vegetation\
    \ maps considering\nseveral characteristics; however, they are also used standalone\
    \ mainly when only RGB sensors\nare available, to exploit the 3D characteristics\
    \ of the vegetation.\n2.\nMachine Learning methods can be used to monitor several\
    \ different characteristics of the crops.\nThey can exploit RGB and/or multispectral/hyperspectral\
    \ images. A very frequent technique\nexploited in the literature is the Object\
    \ Based Image Analysis.\n3.\nVegetation Indices use combinations of the reﬂection\
    \ of several bands obtained by RGB or spectral\nsensors. They are proved to be\
    \ most effective when multispectral or hyperspectral information is\nused. They\
    \ have been used in many recent studies. They have been proved to be very effective\
    \ in\nmonitoring various parameters of the crops, by using different combinations\
    \ of spectral bands.\nIn Figure 5, we present some statistics for the use of sensors\
    \ and processing methods for the\ndifferent applications.\nFigure 5. The use of\
    \ sensors and processing techniques in the different UAVs applications.\nWe can\
    \ observe that there is no standardized workﬂow in most cases and different techniques\n\
    are used to exploit UAV-acquired information for the same type of application.\
    \ For example, looking\nat the sensors and techniques used for monitoring the\
    \ health of the crops, we can see that it is\nrelatively premature. Disease detection\
    \ is mainly applied through temporal analysis of the vegetation’s\ngrowth. However,\
    \ multispectral and hyperspectral sensors seem to have great potential in this\n\
    context. An approach using multispectral sensing technologies could reliably deliver\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices, discriminating healthy and unhealthy portions of the vegetation.\
    \ In such an approach, the\nfarmer could locate the “weak” corps ﬁeld areas and\
    \ take timely decisions to save the parts of the crop\nproduction that seem unhealthy.\n\
    On the contrary, considering weed mapping, we can see that some studies use machine\
    \ learning\ntechniques to detect weeds, mainly OBIA, while others use the 3D characteristics\
    \ of the crops though\nDEMs, VIs or other processing methods. Weed detection with\
    \ UAVs based on object-based image\nanalysis seems to be at an advanced stage\
    \ and can be used for site-speciﬁc weed management. We can\nsee that machine learning\
    \ techniques are exploited in 62.50% of the applications that used RGB sensors\n\
    and in all the applications with multispectral sensors.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 349\n19 of 26\nFocusing on UAV-based growth monitoring, many different methods\
    \ are really promising but it\nseems that their integration in a standardized\
    \ workﬂow can improve its applicability and efﬁciency.\nGrowth monitoring and\
    \ yield prediction is most commonly performed with the use of RGB (30%)\nand multispectral\
    \ (59%) sensors. The information acquired is exploited for estimating the density\
    \ of\nproduction and the biomass. The ﬁndings of this review appoint that combining\
    \ information coming\nfrom Vegetation Indices with the 3D characteristics of the\
    \ crops coming from RGB images can improve\nthe accuracy of growth and yield estimation\
    \ methods.\nIn contrast with the above, the use of UAV systems for irrigation\
    \ management is closer to\na standard workﬂow, which involves the use of thermal\
    \ and/or multispectral sensors to monitor the\nneeds of water of different parts\
    \ of the crops. Equipped with thermal sensors, the Unmanned Aerial\nVehicles are\
    \ able to detect possible deﬁciencies in the irrigation of different sites. This\
    \ information\ncan be processed through photogrammetry techniques into a single\
    \ high-resolution vegetation map,\nhighlighting the stressed areas. A map in this\
    \ context can be constructed though the use of some VIs\nwhen multispectral imagery\
    \ is used. Thus, a map such as this can support the producers to apply\nVariable\
    \ Rate Irrigation (VRI) applications.\nFunding: This research was co-funded by\

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Agriculture plays a vital role in the economic growth
    of any country. With the increase of population, frequent changes in climatic
    conditions and limited resources, it becomes a challenging task to fulfil the
    food requirement of the present population. Precision agriculture also known as
    smart farming have emerged as an innovative tool to address current challenges
    in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology
    is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn without being
    explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm
    machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution. In this article,
    authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the field of agriculture.
    The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon
    and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops
    and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification
    of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield
    assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production
    by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour
    based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation
    which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also
    reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent. This article demonstrates
    how knowledge-based agriculture can improve the sustainable productivity and quality
    of the product. A graphical abstract for Machine Learning Applications for Precision

    Bluetooth Low Energy SECTION I. Introduction The population of the world will
    increase to 9.1 billion approximately thirty-four percent as of today by the end
    of 2050. Food requirement will increase by 70 percent and due to rapid urbanization,
    land availability for agriculture will decrease drastically in the coming years.
    India will be the most populated country by 2050 and presently it is already lagging
    the domestic food production. The main reason for reduced food production is the
    lack of planning, unpredictable weather conditions, improper harvesting and irrigation
    techniques and livestock mismanagement. In the last few years, nature has experienced
    a drastic change in weather conditions due to global warming. The average temperature
    of the earth has been increased due to which there is uncertainty in climatic
    conditions. Frequent droughts, heavy rainfall are the biggest challenge for poor
    farmers. According to the government of India annual economic survey, adverse
    climatic conditions, reduce the farmer’s income by 20-25%. Precision agriculture
    [1], [2] is one of the solutions to ensure food security for the entire world
    [3]. Precision agriculture also abbreviated as digital agriculture is a technology-enabled
    data-driven sustainable farm management system. It is basically the adoption of
    modern information technologies, software tools, and smart embedded devices for
    decision support in agriculture [4] as shown in figure 1. Mechanized agriculture
    and the green revolution are the two key components of the first and second agriculture
    revolution. Precision farming is an important part of the third agriculture revolution
    [5]. FIGURE 1. Precision agriculture. Show All John Deere introduced this technology
    in 1990 for the sowing of seeds and spraying of fertilizers using global positioning
    system (GPS) controlled tractors. The main focus of precision farming is to reduce
    the production cost and environmental effects to increase the farm’s profitability.
    Digital technologies such as IoT [6], AI, data analytics, cloud computing, and
    block-chain technology play a key role in precision agriculture. In precision
    farming, IoT based smart sensors are deployed in the agriculture land for collecting
    data related to soil nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements as well as
    for analysing the crop growth. Autonomous and semi-autonomous devices such as
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [7] and robots are used for identifying weed
    and disease in the plants using computer vision techniques. Satellite images are
    also used in precision agriculture for monitoring the field and identifying the
    diseases in the plants. The data obtained from the deployed sensors [8] are processed
    and analyzed using ML algorithms to make farming practice more controlled and
    optimized. ML algorithms are also used for weather and rainfall prediction based
    on the data obtained from sensors, climatic records, and satellite images. This
    could save the lives of thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop
    loss due to uncertainty in weather conditions. Smart livestock management is an
    important component of precision agriculture. It helps in monitoring the health,
    welfare, productivity, and reproduction of animals throughout their life cycle.
    Sensors and cameras monitor animal’s health and computer vision techniques help
    in making intelligent decisions such as stopping the communal spread of diseases.
    Autonomous tractors and automated irrigation systems provide modern farming solutions
    to farmers. The widespread utilization of precision farming across the world is
    due to the presence of innovative machine and deep learning (DL) algorithms, high-speed
    internet access, and efficient computational devices. In [10] authors have discussed
    applications of ML for sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) performance.
    Authors have presented a unique ML-ASC framework that can guide researchers and
    agriculture practitioners to understand the role and importance of digital technologies
    in the agriculture industry. In [11] authors reviewed different ML applications
    in agriculture and discussed how digital technologies will benefit the agriculture
    industry. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of
    the ML application for precision agriculture. This review article will provide
    an insight into the research community about the adoption of digital practices
    in the agriculture management system. It is anticipated that government agencies
    will frame policies to promote precision farming across the world. The main contribution
    of the article is outlined as follows: Applications of artificial intelligence
    and IoT in precision agriculture are discussed along with their practical implications.
    Foundation of ML and DL algorithms which find their application in precision agriculture
    has been discussed. Performance comparison for various ML, DL algorithms in precision

    II. Impact of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture The term AI was first
    coined in the Dartmouth conference in the year 1956 by John McCarthy and he defined
    it as a science and engineering of making intelligent machines or more specifically
    intelligent computer programs. AI technology provides computational intelligence
    to machines so that they can learn, understand and react according to the situation.
    ML, DL, natural language processing (NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems,
    fuzzy logic, and computer vision are the subfields of AI as shown in figure 2.
    This field finds endless applications across different sectors of human life.
    Intelligent AI programs are widely explored in health-care, agriculture, finance,
    robotics, e-commerce and the automation industry. Samsung, Apple, and other electronics
    giant companies announced that they will be utilizing this technology in every
    device they will manufacture in the near future. IoT is another emerging technology
    in which smart sensors, devices are interconnected through the internet. These
    smart sensors can be utilized to gather data across different disciplines such
    as solar plants, agriculture fields, disaster-prone areas, manufacturing industry
    for efficient resource utilization. With the increase in population over the year’s
    demand for agriculture products is increasing day by day. However, with limited
    land availability for farming and reduce interest among the young generation to
    adopt farming as their profession, it has become a challenging task for the agriculture
    industry to satisfy the food requirement of millions of people. Now, the agriculture
    industry is widely adopting smart technologies like IoT and AI to efficiently
    cultivate organic products in limited land areas as well as to overcome the traditional
    challenges of farmers. FIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence techniques. Show All
    IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil
    moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum
    amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are
    revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and
    are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying
    of pesticides, and drip irrigation. The images captured by the drones over the
    entire lifecycle of crops can be examined using DL and computer vision algorithms
    for disease and weed identification. Thereafter, these drones are used for spraying
    pesticides over the weeds and infected crops. Over the years uncertainty in weather
    conditions is the main concern of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an
    efficient AI-empowered irrigation system which is basically trained on weather
    pattern and can effectively reduce the water problems of farmers. AI-enabled robots
    can be used for harvesting the crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes.
    Robots can reduce human labour to a large extent and can be used along with drones
    for monitoring the field. Livestock management is another major concern for farmers.
    IoT based sensors can be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle.
    This information can be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased
    cattle. NLP based virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the
    farmers with the latest advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can
    finds solutions for their problems and incorporate the latest technology in their
    farming for improving their field productivity. Thus, AI and IoT are the two major
    technologies that will play a vital role in the agriculture industry. SECTION
    III. Machine Learning Algorithms ML is the subfield of computer science that gives
    computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel,
    1959) [12]. Alan Turing in the year 1950 proposed the concept of learning machines
    and wrote a research article “The Turing Test for Machine Intelligence” [13].
    He performed a test and examined the machine’s ability to demonstrate intelligent
    behaviour similar to humans. A machine or intelligent computer program learns
    and extract knowledge from the data, builds a framework for making predictions
    or intelligent decisions. Thus, the ML process is divided into three key parts,
    i.e. data input, model building, and generalization as shown in figure 3. Generalization
    is the process for predicting the output for the inputs with which the algorithm
    has not been trained before. ML algorithms are mainly used to solve complex problems
    where human expertise fails such as weather prediction, spam filtering, disease
    identification in plants, pattern recognition. FIGURE 3. A Machine learning process.
    Show All Today, due to the availability of innovative algorithms and large data
    sets through internet resources industries and research communities are widely
    using ML algorithms for solving a diverse set of problems. DL is the subfield
    of the family of ML algorithms which is trained from large sets and uses an artificial
    neural network (ANN) to make intelligent decisions. ML algorithms are categorized
    as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning as shown
    in figure 4. Supervised learning as the name suggests is learning with the supervisor
    or teacher. This set of algorithms works with labeled data-set which means corresponding
    to each input there are outputs. The algorithm builds an input-output relationship
    with this labeled data set and thereafter generalize or predicts outputs for unseen
    inputs. Supervised learning algorithms used for predicting the categorical value
    are known as classification algorithms and the algorithms that are used for predicting
    the numerical value are known as regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning
    algorithms works with unlabelled data and discovers unknown objects by grouping
    similar objects. The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to extract
    hidden knowledge from the training data set thus this approach is difficult to
    implement than supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is another
    approach that learns from the environment through reward and punishment. AlphaGo,
    a chess-playing game developed by DeepMind utilized reinforcement learning for
    defeating the world’s best chess-playing computer program. FIGURE 4. Categorization
    of machine learning algorithms. Show All In this paper the performance of different
    ML algorithms are analysed and discussed in the field of agriculture. Table 2
    presents different types of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    algorithms utilized for soil and weather prediction, disease and weed identification,
    intelligent irrigation and harvesting techniques as well as livestock management.
    TABLE 2 Machine Learning Algorithms SECTION IV. Machine Learning Applications
    in Precision Agriculture In many countries, the farmers rely on the traditional
    ways of farming which is based on the reliability of the suggestions from the
    elderly and their experience. This method leaves farmers at the mercy of random
    climatic conditions which are already getting random due to global warming and
    uneven rainfall patterns. The manual spraying method for pesticides led to improper
    usage of resources and harms the environment. AI and IoT enabled precision agriculture
    removes the randomness and assist new age farmer to optimize every step of the
    farming process. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents a pictorial view of traditional
    agriculture and technology enabled farm management system. FIGURE 5. (a) Traditional
    agriculture cycle (b) Precision agriculture cycle. Show All Gaitán [14] provided
    a systematic study of the impact of extreme weather events, such as hail events,
    cold waves, heat waves, and their impact on agricultural practices. The author
    reported floods, droughts, frost, hail, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks are impacted
    by climatic conditions. The AI systems are applicable in each farming operation
    as depicted in figure 4 and some of them even extend beyond the conventionally
    recognized steps. In this section we will discuss the state of art techniques
    proposed/implemented by various researchers and practitioners worldwide. A. Soil
    Properties and Weather Prediction Prediction of soil properties is the first and
    the most crucial step which influences the selection of crop, land preparation,
    selection of seed, crop yield, and selection of fertilizers /manure. The soil
    properties are directly related to the geographic and climatic conditions of the
    land in use and hence is an important factor to take into consideration. The soil
    properties prediction mostly consists of predicting nutrients in the soil, soil
    surface humidity, weather conditions during the lifecycle of the crop. Human activities
    have highly affected the properties of soil and hence our ability to cultivate
    the crops [15]. In general, there are 17 essential elements as listed in table
    3 which play an important role in plant growth [16]. The growth of crops depends
    on the nutrients available in a particular soil. The soil nutrients are mostly
    monitored by electric and electromagnetic sensors [8]. Depending on the nutrients
    farmers make informed decisions as to which crop is optimal for the land. However,
    the nutrients can be added through fertilizers, manure, etc. but with an additional
    cost. Some of them may also damage the environment and have an adverse effect
    on the soil cycle. TABLE 3 Essential Plant Nutrients [2] A scientific analysis
    of soil nutrients, soil moisture, pH is important for determining the soil properties.
    Acar et al. [17] employed an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model
    for prediction of soil surface humidity. The author selected two terrains having
    area 4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis.
    The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which
    was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the
    help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the
    pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based
    regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested
    with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out
    cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function. Wang et al.
    [19] deployed soft sensors based on ELM for the measurement of nutrient solution
    composition in the soilless cultivation method. The soilless cultivation method
    is an emerging planting method. It is imperative to monitor the pH value, temperature
    and concentration changes in nutrient solution composition as the performance
    of soilless cultivation is highly dependent on these parameters. The significant
    variables in a nutrient solution cannot be measured directly hence these are determined
    with the help of auxiliary variables. The authors utilized conductivity, pH value,
    flow rate, and temperature measurements for auxiliary measurements. These auxiliary
    measurements are fed to a deep belief network-based ELM which predicts the values
    of significant variables. For experimental analysis, the authors deployed the
    model to measure the concentration of SO 2− 4 , and H 2 PO − 4 in a nutrient solution.
    The authors reported an average RMSE of 1.2414 for predictions in SO 2− 4 and
    RMSE of 0.8892 for prediction of H 2 PO − 4 . Park et al. [20] utilized ML algorithms
    to predict the soil moisture using data from MODIS. The authors downscaled the
    AMSR2 soil moisture to 1KM using random forest (RF) and Cubist algorithms. An
    ensemble of these algorithms was used to obtain soil moisture data. The results
    obtained through the ML methods were compared with the statistical ordinary least
    squares technique. The ML model exhibited a R 2 (coefficient of determination)
    of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.06, whereas a R 2 of 0.47 and a RMSE of 0.16 was associated
    with the statistical ordinary least squares. Reda et al. [21] explored ML algorithms
    to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples
    collected from four agricultural lands of Moroccan. Data set of near-infrared
    spectroscopy is utilized in comparison to traditional chemical methods as this
    technique reduces the computation time and resource utilization. The ensemble
    learning modeling algorithm presents the best performance among other regression
    models and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
    presents R 2 of 0.96, RMSE of 1.92, performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.87 for
    SOC and R 2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 0.57, RPD of 4.91 for TN prediction. Morellos
    et al. [22] also utilized visible and infrared spectroscopy to determine TN, SOC,
    and moisture content (MC) in the arable field in Premslin Germany. Spectroscopy
    dataset is used for building the predictive ML model for estimating all three
    soil properties. Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and cubist ML algorithms
    outperform principal component regression and partial least square regression
    multivariate methods in terms of RMSE and residual prediction deviation (RPD).
    LS-SVM best predict SOC and MC with RMSE of 0.062 and 0.457, RPD of 2.24, and
    2.20. Cubist best predicts for TN with RMSE of 0.071 and RPD of 1.96. Andrade
    et al. [23] build ordinary least square regression, RF, cubist regression, XGboost
    prediction model for determining soil properties from portable X-ray fluorescence
    (pXRF) spectrometry dataset in Brazilian coastal plains. Three soil properties
    total nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) were
    analyzed using RF, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression
    (CR), XGBoost (XGB). RF algorithm gives the best performance with R 2 of 0.50
    for TN, R 2  0.75 for CEC and 0.56 for SOM. Deiss et al. [24] estimated the soil
    properties (clay, sand, pH, SOC) in northern Tanzania and USA Midwest from the
    spectroscopy dataset using ML algorithms. THE tuned SVM model outperforms the
    partial least square (PLS) regression model in terms of predicting all the soil
    parameters. Mahmoudzadeh et al. [25] explored the ML algorithm to predict SOC
    in the Kurdistan province of Iran. The simulation results suggest that RF accurately
    predicts SOC with R 2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 0.35% in comparison to SVM, kNN, Cubist,
    and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm. The study also suggests
    that air temperature, annual rainfall, valley depth, texture of terrain surface
    are some of the important factors that influence SOC spread over the Kurdistan
    region. Veres et al. [26] explored DL architecture such as CNN for predicting
    the soil properties from the infra-red spectroscopy dataset. Benke et al. [27]
    predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and SOC in different regional locations
    of Victoria, Australia using pedotransfer function (PTF) based on ML algorithm.
    PTF basically converts soil measurement into soil properties and provides inputs
    for ML simulation algorithms. In the proposed approach PTF use Generalised Linear
    Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) model and Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) to predict‘
    the soil properties. Traditional approaches to soil properties and crop yield
    prediction require time-consuming field surveys and the deployment of expensive
    sensors. Khanal et al. [28] proposed an alternative approach in which the dataset
    for the prediction of soil properties and crop yield is generated using remotely
    sensed aerial images of agricultural land. Five soil properties, viz. pH value,
    magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), SOM, CEC, and crop yield were predicted using RF,
    SVM, Cubist, NN, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) ML algorithms. NN presents the
    highest prediction accuracy for SOM having R 2 of 0.64, RMSE of 0.44 and CEC having
    R 2 of 0.67, RMSE of 2.35; SVM best predicts K having R 2 of 0.21, RMSE of 0.49
    and Mg having R 2 of 0.22, RMSE of 4.57; and GBM best predicts pH having R 2 of
    0.15, RMSE of 0.62. RF outperforms other algorithms in terms of crop yield prediction
    and presents higher accuracy having R 2 of 0.53 and RMSE of 0.97. Labrador et
    al. [29] estimate calcium and Mg content in soil using generalized regression
    NN and genetic algorithm (GA). The digital elevation model and satellite images
    were used as input to the prediction model for estimating the soil properties.
    Chlingaryan et al. [30] discussed different ML approaches used in precision agriculture
    for accurate crop yield prediction and soil nitrogen estimation over the last
    fifteen years. Ju-Young et al. [31] investigated a seasonal climatic forecasting
    model using regularized ELM to predict day-wise mean air temperature at field
    level for a period of 90 days. The authors selected data from Korea Metrological
    Administration using the Met GloSea5GC2 model [32]. The authors fed 240 days of
    forecast data and hindcast data from the ensemble based model to the RELM algorithm.
    The algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring: RMSE, mean absolute error
    (MAE) the model prediction vs the actual values. The authors achieved an RMSE
    in the range of 1.02 to 3.35 which outperformed the meteorological data which
    has an RMSE range of 1.61 to 3.37. Soil moisture content is an important parameter
    to acknowledge in the agriculture industry as it addresses precise irrigation
    scheduling. Stamenkovic et al. [33] build a support vector regression (SVR) prediction
    model to predict soil moisture content from remotely sensed hyperspectral images.
    Song et al. [34] proposed a macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) model and combined
    its deep belief network (DBN) to predict soil moisture content over a cornfield
    in northwest china. The simulation results of DBN-MCA outperforms the multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP)-MCA in terms of RMSE. Acheing [35] explored the SVR model (i.e.
    RBF), ANN, DNN for simulating soil water retention curve (SWRC) curve of loamy
    sand. Dataset of loamy sand subjected to wetting and drying condition is collected
    using a reflectometer and tensiometer. RBF based SVR model best predicts SWRC
    under both wet and dry conditions. Feng et al. [36] estimate soil temperature
    at various soil depths of Loess Plateau of China. Four different ML algorithms
    ELM, generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks
    (BPNN), and RF were investigated for predicting the soil temperature. ML algorithms
    were trained with air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and vapour pressure
    and solar radiation as input parameters and the simulations show that ELM outperforms
    other ML algorithms in terms of RMSE, MAE, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and
    concordance correlation coefficient. Mohammadi et al. [37] explored ELM for predicting
    daily dew point temperature in different parts of Iran. This part of the world
    experience different climatic conditions throughout the year. The proposed model
    accurately predicts dew point temperature than SVM and ANN algorithms. Zhu et
    al. [38] accurately predict daily evapotranspiration in Northwest China using
    hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ELM model to optimize crop water requirement
    in agriculture. Alizamir et al. [39] accurately predicts soil temperature at different
    depths of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cm using ELM, ANN, classification and regression trees,
    group method of data handling using dataset obtained from Mersin station operated
    by Turkish Meteorological Service. The simulation results suggest that soil temperature
    can be estimated easily using air temperature upto depth of 50 cm while for depth
    of 100 cm additional information of solar radiation and wind speed is required.
    Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in the water resource management system,
    flood risk assessment, and the agriculture industry. Acknowledging the chaotic
    nature of rainfall, it is very difficult for statistical approaches to accurately
    predict the rainfall. Cramer et al. [40] evaluated the performance of seven ML
    algorithms for rainfall prediction. The statistical results show that the radial-basis
    function neural network (RBFNN) shows the best performance among other state of
    the art algorithms. Sierra and Jesus [41] predicted the rainfall in Tenerife,
    an island in Spain based on atmospheric synoptic patterns using different ML algorithms
    and found NN gave the best performance among other ML algorithms. Kamatchi and
    Parvathi [42] employed NN for weather prediction and proposed a hybrid recommender
    system for enhancing the success ratio of the system. Lazri et al. [43] build
    a multi-classifier model for estimating precipitation using MSG images (Meteosat
    second generation) and dataset obtained using radar. The proposed approach shows
    that the proposed multi-classifier improves the standard of classification. Shardoor
    and Rao [44] surveyed three different approaches i.e. ML techniques, data mining
    techniques, and satellite forecasting techniques for rainfall prediction. Table
    4 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for prediction of soil
    properties and weather prediction. TABLE 4 Different ML Algorithms for Prediction
    of Soil Properties and Weather Conditions B. Crop Yield Prediction A significant
    piece of information for any farmer is the prediction of crop yield and how the
    yield can be increased. pH value, soil type, and quality, weather pattern: temperature,
    rainfall, humidity, sunshine hours, fertilizers, and harvesting schedules are
    some of the parameters which play an important role in predicting the crop yield
    [45]. Scientifically manual farming can be considered as a feedback control system
    in which the corrective action is taken once a setback in a crop is observed.
    The crop yield will highly depend on the efficiency of the optimal utilization
    of the above-mentioned resources. If some kind of anomaly goes undetected in the
    initial stage may harm the crop yield in an unprecedented way. Singh et al. [46]
    assessed hailstorms on India’s wheat production and observes that in February
    and March 2015 alone the hailstorm events caused a decline of 8.4% in national
    wheat production. For financially weak farmers in a country such as India, where
    intermittent storage of harvested crops is a rare resource, accurate weather predictions
    may turn to be miraculous for farmers. ML models when systematically applied to
    a system act as feedforward control. With the help of accurate ML models, we can
    anticipate the factors which are going to affect the crop yield. Hence the corrective
    action can be taken before even an anomaly hits the crop production. Kamir et
    al. [47] used ML models to identify the yield gap hotspots in wheat production.
    Authors generated very high-resolution yield maps using data from various sources
    between 2009 and 2015. The data was collected from various sources:(a) NDVI time-series
    data across Australia using the MOD13Q1 data set [48], (b) rainfall and temperature
    data were collected from historic climate data at Australia bureau of metrology,
    (c) maps for observed grain yield were collected at source using intelligent harvesting
    machines. The dataset generated were tested with 9 ML algorithms: RF, XGBoost,
    Cubist, MLP, SVR, Gaussian Process, k-NN, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression
    Splines. The authors combined predictions from each of the algorithms into ensembles
    for prediction optimization [49]. Out of these algorithms, SVR with RBFNN outperformed
    other algorithms and investigators were able to achieve the yield estimate with
    an R 2  of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 0.55t ha −1 . The results were validated
    using 10-fold cross-validation techniques applied to the full data set. Aghighi
    et al. [50] used various advanced regression algorithms to predict the yield of
    silage maize crops. The authors selected maize fields located at Moghan Agro-Industrial
    and Animal Husbandry Company (MAIAHC), which is about 28,000 hectares’ area and
    located in Iran. The crop yield dataset was collected for around 40 silage maize
    fields were collected for a period from 2013-2015. In addition to it, the historic
    crop yield data the authors also gathered time-series NDVI data from Landsat 8
    OLI satellite. The data was fed to advanced regression algorithms: (a) Gaussian
    Process Regression, (b) SVR, (c) Boosted Regression tree (d) RF Regression models
    and the prediction form each of the regression models were compared and evaluated.
    Authors found out the boosted regression tree reported best evaluation parameters
    with an average R-value of higher than 0.87, and RMSE in a range of 8.5 to 11.10,
    with a mean value of 9.5 during the period 2013-14. Kuwata and Shibasaki [51]
    employed DL models to estimate the crop yield. Authors deployed SVR for predicting
    the yield of corn in Illinois. For input following dataset was employed by the
    authors: (a) 5 year moving average of corn crop yield, (b) The enhanced vegetation
    index is obtained using the MOD09A1 dataset MODIS satellite, and (c) Historic
    climatic data. The dataset was fed to support the vector regression model and
    the authors reported an RMSE of 8.204 and a correlation coefficient of 0.644 for
    the model. For result, validation authors conducted 10-fold cross-validation on
    the full data set. Kulkarni et al. [52] utilized DL models to predict rice crop
    yield. The authors utilized soil properties and nutrients measurements recorded
    over 31 years and historic rainfall data. The input data was fed to recurrent
    neural network models for crop yield prediction. For effective prediction the
    authors explored different activation functions viz. sigmoid, reLu, and linear
    in the neural network. Chu and Yu [53] builds an end to end summer and winter
    rice prediction model in 81 counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
    China. The proposed BBI model works in three stages, in the first stage the original
    area data and time series metrological data is pre-processed and its output works
    as input for the second stage where BPNN and RNN (recurrent neural network) learns
    deep spatial and temporal features from the input data. In the third stage, BPNN
    learns the relationship between deep features and rice yield to predict the summer
    and winter rice yields. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of
    error and rate of convergence, the model presents lowest error values with MAE
    and RMSE of 0.0044 and 0.0057 for summer rice prediction and 0.0074 and 0.0192
    for winter rice prediction while the algorithm converges within 100 iterations.
    Feng et al. [54] proposed a hybrid approach for wheat yield prediction in new-south
    Wales in southeastern Australia. Multiple growth specific indicators, viz. agricultural
    production system simulators (APSIM), NDVI, and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation
    and Evapotranspiration Index) are used before the prediction of wheat yield using
    regression models (multiple linear regression (MLR) and RF). APSIM+ RF hybrid
    model presents the best performance among other predictors in terms of prediction
    accuracy. Cai et al. [55] integrated two data sources, i.e. climate data and satellite
    data over fourteen years to predict the wheat yield in Australia using ML algorithms
    (SVM, RF, and NN). Simulation results show that climate data provides distinctive
    information in comparison to satellite data for yield prediction with R 2 of around
    0.75. Planting the crops on accurate date plays an important role in improving
    productivity and reducing financial loss. Gumuscu et al. [56] explored three supervised
    ML algorithms; kNN, SVM, and decision trees for predicting planting dates; early,
    normal, and late for wheat crops in Turkey. The authors utilized climate data
    of the last 300 days to train ML algorithms and explored GA for feature selection.
    kNN classification ML algorithm shows robust performance and best predicts the
    planting dates of wheat crops. Several African, American, and Asian countries
    are the major producer of coffee in the world. Nevavuori et al. [57] explored
    a deep learning approach, i.e. CNN for wheat and barley yield prediction in the
    agriculture field of Pori, Finland. NDVI and RGB dataset obtained from cameras
    installed in UAV is used to train the six-layer CNN. RGB dataset best predicts
    the crop yield in CNN with MAE of 484.3 kgha−1 and mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) of 8.8%. Koirala et al. [58] reviewed deep learning approaches for fruit
    detection and yield estimation. CNN in the context of computer vision is widely
    used for feature extraction from images that provide useful insight to object
    detection and yield estimation. Kouadio, et al. [59] predicted the Robusta coffee
    yield using ML techniques from soil fertility dataset of Vietnam. ELM model outperforms
    multiple linear regression and RF algorithm with RMSE of 496.35 kg ha−1 and MAE
    of 326.40 kg ha−1. Gamboa et al. [60] predict the cocoa yield in Santander, Columbia
    using a generalized linear model (GLM) and SVM. In recent decades researchers
    have explored statistical and probabilistic models for crop yield prediction.
    Gyamerah et al. [61] proposed a novel robust probabilistic forecasting model based
    on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) for crop yield
    prediction in Ghana. The proposed approach didn’t only predict discrete yield
    values but completely showcase probability descriptions for prediction interval
    for the two crops groundnut and millet. The simulation result shows the superior
    performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of prediction intervals coverage
    probability and prediction interval normalized average width under uncertain weather
    conditions. Peng et al. [62] explored remote sensed satellite-based Solar-Induced
    Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) dataset for training ML algorithms to predict maize
    and soybean yield in the mid-west region of the United States. Simulation results
    show that non-linear algorithms such as SVM, ANN, RF best predict the crop yield
    in comparison to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO)
    and ridge regression (RIDGE) algorithm. Khaki and Wang [63] predicted the hybrid
    maize yield with a dataset of 2,267 locations of the United States and Canada
    between the years 2008 to 2016 using deep neural networks (DNN). Genotype, weather,
    and soil properties were the three components used to train DNN. The proposed
    model accurately predicts the maize yield with RMSE of 12% of the average yield
    for predicted weather dataset and 11% of the average yield for perfect weather
    dataset and outperforms LASSO, shallow neural network (SNN) and regression tree
    (RT). Simulation results show that environmental factors have a large impact on
    the prediction accuracy of crop yield. In most areas of Africa, agriculture field
    data is scarcely available thus remotely sensed dataset is widely used for monitoring
    the field. Leroux et al. [64] explored the ML algorithm for predicting the maize
    yield in Burkina Faso with a remotely sensed dataset. A process-based crop model
    SARRO which is basically designed to simulate attainable agricultural yields under
    tropical conditions is used in this study. RF outperforms MLR in maize yield prediction
    with R 2 of 0.59 at the end of the season and 0.49 before two months of harvest.
    Li et al. [65] build a statistical model for predicting the rain-fed crop yield
    using climate, satellite, and country-specific datasets in the mid-west region
    of the USA. Maimaitijiang et al. [66] explored the potential of UAV with DNN for
    soybean yield prediction from the fields of Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multi-modal
    information such as canopy spectral, structural, and thermal features extracted
    from images obtained from the sensors installed on UAV is used as the input dataset
    for training DNN. The simulation result shows that DNN accurately predict the
    crop yield and outperforms partial least square regression (PLSR), RF, SVR algorithms
    with R 2 of 0.720 and RMSE of 15.9%. Zhang et al. [67] explored ANN for prediction
    of annual crop planting utilizing a historical cropland data layer (CDL) dataset
    of corn-belt of mid-west, USA. Kocian et al. [68] utilized both approaches to
    predict crop growth in greenhouses. IoT smart sensors are installed in the greenhouses
    to monitor different environmental parameters, soil properties and plant growth
    parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), accumulated dry weight (DW) and evapo-transpiration
    (ET). These parameters are in real-time send to the cloud through IoT devices
    and permit the implementation of an agriculture decision-support system. The probabilistic
    Bayesian network is explored in the proposed system to predict crop development
    parameters. Shahinfar and Kahn [69] explored ML algorithms for early prediction
    of adult wool growth in Merino sheep of Australia. Model Tree algorithms best
    predict the wool growth in comparison with NN with a correlation coefficient of
    0.93, 0.90, 0.94, 0.81 and 0.59, MAE of 0.48 kg, 0.41 kg, 0.92 μm , 6.91mm and
    6.82 N/ktex, for predicting Greasy Fleece Weight, adult Clean Fleece Weight, adult
    Fibre Diameter and adult Staple Length. Table 5 presents a comparative study of
    different ML algorithms for crop yield prediction. TABLE 5 Different ML Algorithms
    for Crop Yield Prediction C. Disease and Weed Detection Disease fungi, microorganisms,
    and bacteria take their energy from the plants they live on, which in turn affects
    the crop yield. If not detected at the right time may account for a huge economic
    loss to farmers. A lot of financial burden goes to a farmer in the form of pesticides,
    to get rid of diseases and restore the functioning of crops. Excessive use of
    pesticides also leads to environmental damage and the effects of the water and
    soil cycle of the agricultural land. Using an optimally designed AI system during
    crop growth period not only reduces the risk of crop disease and minimizes the
    economic impact, but it also results in minimizing the adverse impact of unsystematic
    farming on the environment. Sambasivan and Opiyo [70] used a CNN based DL model
    to detect disease in cassava crops for imbalanced datasets. The authors took a
    database of 10,000 labeled images that were pre-processed to improve the image
    contrast using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm. The
    model evaluation was done using the performance metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy
    measure, precision measure, sensitivity, and F1 score. The authors reported a
    best-case accuracy of 99.30% and the lowest accuracy was reported as 76.9%. Ramcharan
    et al. [71] used DL algorithms to detect diseases in cassava crops. Authors deployed
    deep CNN to identify three different diseases and two types of pests from a set
    of 11,670 images dataset. Author’s utilized GoogLeNet algorithm based Inception
    v3 in Tensor Flow. The authors achieved efficiency in a range of 80% to 93.0%,
    and the validation of the results was done with the help of the confusion matrix.
    Mohanty et al. [72] employed DL methods to detect crop disease from the image
    dataset of plant leaves. The authors used a public database consisting of smartphone
    generated 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plants leaves. These images were
    resized to 256×256 pixels and were assigned 38 different class labels of crop-disease
    pair, and transformed into 3 datasets color, grayscale and segmented. The dataset
    was then fed to two of the most common deep CNNs: AlexNet [73] and GoogLeNet [74].
    The authors achieved an accuracy of 99.34% for GoogLeNet, and an accuracy of 85.53%
    for AlexNet network. The results were validated using F1 score, authors achieved
    a mean F1 score of 0.9886 for GoogLeNet, and a mean F1 score of 0.9848 for AlexNet.
    Amara et al. [75] used LeNet based CNN architecture for disease detection in banana
    leaves. Authors utilized data from open source local and digital libraries which
    were pre-processed and resized to 60×60 pixels, and the model was implemented
    for RGB as well as grayscale images. Hughes and Salathe [76] utilized this developed
    model for the identification of diseases in the images dataset. The authors achieved
    the best F1 score of 0.9971 for detection in RGB images and a score of 0.976 for
    grayscale images. Ferreira et al. [77] deployed CNN for the identification of
    weeds in soybean crops. The image dataset for soy plantation located at São José
    farm, Campo Grande Brazil was acquired using phantom DJI3 drone. The images are
    segmented using the SLIC algorithm into square grids. For training, the segmented
    images were manually annotated to their class. The segmented images dataset was
    fed to AlexNet (a convolution neural network) for classification. The performance
    of the AlexNet was compared with SVM, AdaBoost, and RF. To evaluate the performance
    of the AlexNet the model was fed with a balanced dataset and the authors reported
    an overall accuracy of above 90% and 96.3% images were correctly classified. Waheed
    et al. [78] proposed a cost-effective optimized dense CNN (DenseNet) for disease
    detection in corn leaves with an accuracy of 98.0%. Simulation results show that
    the proposed model outperforms other CNN models such as EfficientNet, VGG19Net,
    NASNet, and XceptionNet in terms of fewer parameters, accuracy, computation complexity,
    and computation time. Pereira et al. [79] proposed an expert system for identifying
    three species of aquatic weeds from aquatic weed leaves dataset based on their
    shape and supervised pattern recognition techniques. The author explored five
    shape descriptors with different shape-based skills viz. Beam Angle Statistics
    (BAS), Fourier Descriptors (FD), Moment Invariants (MI), Multi-scale Fractal dimension
    (MS), and Tensor Scale Descriptor (TSD) along with five ML algorithms viz. Optimum-Path
    Forest (OPF), SVM, Naive Bayes, ANN, MLP. Simulation results show that OPF using
    the BAS-100 descriptor presents the best results with a recognition rate of 96.41%
    in comparison to other approaches. Jiang et al. [80] proposed a semi-supervised
    CNN feature-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying weeds utilizing
    6000 images of corn, lettuce, radish, and mixed weed dataset. The proposed approach
    works in two parts, i.e. in the first part CNN model is used for feature extraction
    thereafter in the second part GCN graph is explored utilizing CNN feature dataset
    for extracting feature of an unlabelled dataset using labelled dataset. The proposed
    approach shows the best results in comparison with AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet-101
    approaches with recognition accuracies of 97.80%, 99.37%, 98.93%, and 96.51% on
    four different weed datasets. Oppenheim and Shani [81] explored CNN for identifying
    four different types of diseases in potatoes. The simulation result shows that
    the model trained on 90% of the images and tested on 10% of images give the best
    results with 96% accuracy. Sugar beet contributes around 30% of world sugar production.
    Leaf spot diseases in sugar beet can create a loss of around 10 % to 50 % of yearly
    sugar yield. Rumpf et al. [82] proposed SVM with a radial basis function as a
    kernel based model for early detection and classification of three diseases Cercospora,
    leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew in sugar beet leaves. Diseased and non-diseased
    leaves were classified with an accuracy of 97% and three diseases were identified
    with accuracy higher than 86%. Ozguven and Adem [83] proposed updated faster R-CNN
    for leaf spot disease identification and classification in sugar beet. Leaf spot
    disease initially generates as small circular spots and later spread over the
    entire leaf surface. The proposed R-CNN architecture changes its parameters according
    to the images and the disease infected regions, which improves the overall classification
    rate to 95.48%. Bah et al. [84] explored CNN for weed detection in images obtained
    using UAV from bean and spinach fields. The proposed model first identifies the
    crop rows and then identifies the inter-crop row weeds which are used as a training
    dataset for CNN for crop and weed identification and classification. Kerkech et
    al. [85] identified the vine diseases from visible and infrared UAV images obtained
    in the Center Val de Loire region in France. A CNN model is trained with this
    dataset of images to classify each pixel according to different instances, namely,
    shadow, ground, healthy, and symptom. The model identifies with an accuracy of
    92% at grapevine-level and 87% at leaf level. Oslen et al. [86] explored robust
    deep learning models Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 for weed species identification
    and classification from a dataset of images collected in Australian rangeland.
    Simulation results show that the average classification performance of both the
    models is 95.1% and 95.7%. These results found fruitful for automatic real-time
    robotic weed control in the agricultural field. Sudars et al. [87] establish an
    experimental set up with RGB digital cameras in Latvia to collect images of the
    field having 6 food crops and 8 weed species grown in normal field conditions
    and controlled environment. This dataset can be utilized by deep learning algorithms
    for weed identification and classification. Sethy et al. [88] identified the rice
    leaf disease based on a hybrid CNN and SVM. In this model, CNN is explored for
    deep feature extraction from 5932 diseased rice leaf images and this data is used
    as input for SVM classifier. The resnet50 with SVM classification model best classify
    with respect to other models with F1 score of 0.9838. Garcia et al. [89] proposed
    an ML and DL learning hybrid approach for weed and crop identification in the
    agriculture fields of Greece. Image dataset of two crops tomato and cotton and
    two weeds black nightshade and velvetleaf was generated for training and testing
    of the model. Initially CNN (Xception, Inception-Resnet, Vignette’s, Mobilenet,
    and Densenet)) is used for feature extraction and this feature set is later used
    to train ML classifier (SVM, XGBoost and Logistic Regression) for classification.
    The simulation result shows that Densenet and Support Vector Machine outperforms
    other approaches with F1 score of 99.29%. Shah and Jain [90] identified the disease
    in cotton leaf through ANN with some image pre-processing techniques. Yu et al.
    [91] explored deep learning algorithms with a dataset of images for identifying
    dandelion, ground ivy, and spotted spurge in perennial ryegrass. Parraga-Alava
    et al. [92] generated a robusta coffee leaf image dataset (RoCoLe) for disease
    identification using ML algorithms. Glezakos et al. [93] proposed an innovative
    method to identify two viruses Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) and the Cucumber Green
    Mottle Mosaic Virus (CGMMV) in plants. In the proposed research Bio-Electric Recognition
    Assay (BERA) technique is utilized to obtain time-series information of the two
    viruses by measuring the waves through biosensors for 331s. This time-series data
    is preprocessed using GA to eliminate noise and for dimensionality reduction of
    a large dataset. Thereafter this meta-data is used to train MLP neural network
    classifier. The proposed model is tested against other ML classifiers via cross-validation.
    Ramesh and Vydeki [94] explored optimized deep NN with the Jaya algorithm for
    the identification of paddy leaf diseases. A dataset of rice plant leaves was
    taken from the agricultural field to identify and classify normal, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, sheath rot, and blast diseases. Simulation results show that the proposed
    model accurately classifies the diseased and normal images with an accuracy of
    98.9%, 95.78%, 92%, 94%, and 90.57% for blast affected, bacterial blight, sheath
    rot, brown spot, and normal rice leaf images. Chechlin’ ski et al. [95] explored
    CNN for weed identification in four plant species at different growth level and
    under varying light conditions. CNN architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet,
    and ResNet models for classification of weeds in crops. In [96]–[99] author has
    reviewed machine and deep learning techniques for weed, pests and disease identification,
    and classification in crops at different growth stages. Table 6 presents a comparative
    study of different ML algorithms for disease and weed identification. TABLE 6
    Different ML Algorithms for Disease and Weed Identification D. Drip Irrigation
    In the modern era, irrigation for crops has been improvised using the concept
    of drip irrigation [100], where the system consists of thin plastic tubes placed
    in or above the soil along the vertical rows of the plants for nurturing the water
    supply to the crops. Employing the proper operational management of drip irrigation,
    minimizes the utilization of water supply for crop production, and provides a
    better yield of crops. Socio-economic and environmental demands have widely appreciated
    in use of drip irrigation on farmlands for agriculture, especially for the high
    cost valued crops i.e., vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, drip irrigation is
    based on the low-pressure watering system in comparison to sprinkler systems;
    this makes the system more efficient in terms of energy consumption [101]. Various
    advantages have been observed using drip irrigation in agriculture over other
    irrigation systems which include sub-irrigation systems or sprinkler irrigation
    systems. These advantages are entitled to minimal usage of water supply, usage
    of soluble fertilizers through a drip irrigation system, automated system, minimization
    of soil erosion, uninterrupted activities, minimized weed problems, facilitation
    of double-cropping. Precision irrigation is another innovative approach in intelligent
    farming where it uses the water intelligently that further helps the farmers to
    achieve better yield in crops with minimal water usage. It can also be featured
    as providing the right amount of water, at the right time and the right place
    in the field. It focuses its implementation based on variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) methods employing drips or sprinklers. [102]–[104]. Advancements in the
    field of on-farm sensor technologies, weather forecasting, IoT based sensor detection
    system of vegetation and precision-based smart irrigation produces a huge size
    of data that ultimately benefits the farmers in optimizing the usage of water
    resources, improve the yield of crops and maximizes the profit of farmers [105].
    ML and DL and reinforcement learning are employed on the historical data and it
    provides various opportunities for real-time prediction and decision making purposes
    for smart irrigation which are solely based on the data collected by the sensors
    and IoT enabled systems [106]–[109]. Roberts et al. [110] have discussed that
    a sensor-based control system might create some bottleneck in terms of reducing
    the reliability of decision support tools on process-based crop models, which
    further may require costly calibration and affect in generating an uncertain representation
    of soil-plant-atmosphere processes. Further, ML techniques have been employed
    extremely well for protection analysis of hydrological processes i.e., soil moisture
    and groundwater levels [111], [112]. Li et al. [113] utilized ANN for estimating
    nitrate distribution in different types of soils under a drip irrigation system.
    Kavianand et al. [114] proposed a fully automated drip irrigation system based
    on the ARM9 processor along with different kinds of sensors equipped for monitoring
    the PH content and nitrogen content of the soil and controlling the irrigation
    of the field. Emmanuel et al. [115] establishes an experimental set-up in a greenhouse
    in Malaysia to monitor the growth of mustard leaf vegetable plants through IoT
    devices and alongside developed a data-driven model of drip irrigation system.
    Soil moisture, irrigation volume, evapotranspiration were measured through sensors
    and were given to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for storing it in the cloud. This
    data was utilized by different predictive models ARX, BJ, and state-space models
    to predict soil moisture content for an optimized drip irrigation system. ARX
    model outperforms other predictive models in terms of MSE and response time. Seyedzadeh
    et al. [116] explored ML algorithms to optimize the uniform emitter discharge
    rate of drip irrigation system under varying pressure and temperature conditions.
    In this model operating pressure, water temperature, discharge coefficient, pressure
    exponent, and nominal discharge were taken as input parameters while ration of
    emitter discharge to nominal discharge is taken as output temperature. Authors
    explored four different ML algorithms for optimizing emitter discharge rate and
    simulation results show that LS-SVM presents best results with the least error
    of mean absolute error. Peng et al. [117] utilize soil moisture, soil electrical
    conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity parameters to build an optimized
    irrigation prediction model using backpropagation NN in China. The proposed prediction
    model presents good results with MSE of 0.00857724. The authors also identified
    an optimized layout and network arrangement for pipe in a drip irrigation system
    using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation results present
    that the H-shaped network layout is more suitable for field crop irrigation than
    the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped layout. Drip irrigation system gives the
    best performance when the wetting front dimension, i.e. diameter, depth, and upward
    movement are optimized. Shiri et al. [118] explored soft-computing approaches
    viz., gene expressions programming (GEP), and RF techniques in modeling wetting
    front dimensions over different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation
    system. Proposed model, best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient
    and decreases MSE and MAE. Elnesr and Alazba [119] explored ANN for predicting
    the wetting front dimensions from the dataset of a well-tested HYDRUS 2D/3D model.
    The simulation results show that the proposed model has a good correlation of
    0.93-0.99. Chang et al. [120] developed a smart irrigation model based on ML with
    the LoRa P2P network to learn the irrigation experiences from the expert farmers
    working on greenhouse organic crops. Singh et al. [121] have discussed an ML and
    IoT based model for soil moisture prediction during irrigation. Torres-Sanchez
    et al. [122] proposed a decision support system for irrigation management of citric
    crops in southeast Spain. In the proposed model smart sensors are deployed in
    the field to monitor water supplied previous week, weather data, soil water status,
    and based on this data three regression models SVM, RF, and Linear regression
    was trained to build the irrigation decision support system. RF best predicts
    with comparatively less prediction error. Hellín et al. [123] explored the Partial
    Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    model for building a smart irrigation decision support system crops in southeast
    Spain. Goumopoulos et al. [124] proposed a real-time adaptable intelligent and
    autonomous closed-loop irrigation management system. The authors built an experimental
    set-up in a greenhouse and deployed wireless sensors for monitoring the plant
    growth and environmental conditions along with plant growth control actuators.
    Estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) plays a vital role in water resource management
    system. Chen et al. [125] estimate crop actual ETc from temporal convolution network
    (TCN) from the dataset of lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film
    mulch. Simulation results show that the proposed model best predicts ETc with
    an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Table 7 presents
    a comparative study of different ML algorithms for drip irrigation. TABLE 7 Different
    ML Algorithms for Drip Irrigation E. Livestock Production and Management Livestock
    production is basically related to the production and management of cattle i.e.,
    sheep, pigs, etc. for human consumption in terms of meat. Livestock production
    and their management are based on the farming parameters of these cattle i.e.,
    health, food, nutrition, and behaviour to optimize their production in such a
    way that the economic efficiency of this livestock can be maximized. In the present
    scenario, Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain technologies [126] are widely
    explored to improves livestock sustainability and for analysis of their chewing
    habits, eating patterns, their movement patterns i.e., standing, moving, drinking
    and feeding habits, indicate the amount of stress the animal is going through
    which in turn helps in predicting the vulnerability to disease, weight gain, and
    production of the livestock. Furthermore, an ML-based weight predicting system
    can help in the estimation of their body weight 90–180 days before the slaughtering
    day. According to these analyses and estimations, farmers can change their diet
    plans and living conditions for their better growth in terms of health, behaviour,
    and weight gain which in turn will improve the economic efficiency of these livestock
    [127], [128]. Villeneuve et al. [129] build a decision support system that encounters
    not only real-time data but also expert knowledge for precision sheep farming.
    Livestock production and management can be further classified into two sub-categories,
    i.e., animal welfare and livestock production. Animal welfare generally deals
    with the animal’s health and their well-being; for this ML techniques are applied
    to their health monitoring feature for prospective of early disease detection.
    Whereas, livestock production employs the ML on the estimation of the balanced
    production of livestock for the producers to achieve economic benefits. Dutta
    et al. [130] described a procedure for the classification of cattle behaviour
    employing the ML techniques for data collection using collar-based sensors i.e.,
    magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers. In this study, events such as oestrus
    and dietary changes on cattle have been analyzed for their well-nutrition. Pegorini
    et al. [131] presented an automatic identification and classification of chewing
    habits of claves employing ML-based techniques for analysing their health and
    behavioural patterns. Ebrahimie et al. [132] proposed ML predictive model for
    estimating Sub-Clinical Mastitis (SCM) from milking parameters in dairy herds.
    Mastitis is an inflammatory disease that is widely affecting the dairy industry.
    Author’s explored four classification models decision trees, stump decision trees,
    parallel decision trees, and random forest to discover SCC independent of Somatic
    Cell Count (SCC) which is widely used to measure SCM worldwide. RF with Gini Index
    criteria best predicts SCM with an accuracy of 90%. Ebrahimie et al. [133] explored
    the attribute weighting model (AWM) for identifying lactose concentration and
    electrical conductivity in milk, which are two of the major indicators of SCM
    in dairy cattle. Hyde et al. [134] also explored RF to predict the route of transmission
    of germs and classify them into contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV) with
    ENV further sub-classified into non-lactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating
    period (EL). The simulation results show that an accuracy of 98% was achieved
    for discovering CONT vs ENV and 78% for discovering EDP and EL. Esener et al.
    [135] utilized spectral profiles dataset to discriminates CONT and ENV strains
    using GA, NN, and quick classifier. Ebrahimi et al. [136] predicted sub-clinical
    bovine mastitis using a large milking dataset collected through an automated in-line
    monitoring system in commercial New Zealand dairy farm. The simulation results
    show that GBM outperforms other ML model and best predict sub-clinical bovine
    mastitis with an accuracy of 84.9%. Sharifi et al. [137] explored meta-analysis
    and decision trees data mining tools to discover genes that can help to find mastitis
    in dairy cattle. Machado et al. [138] explored the RF model to identify factors
    influencing the occurrence of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) viral disease
    in cattle in southern Brazil. The proposed approach identifies that insemination,
    the number of cattle in neighbouring farms, and routine rectal palpation are among
    the main factors of the occurrence of this disease. Matthews et al. [139] developed
    an ML-based automated monitoring system for tracking animal behaviour and movement
    i.e., standing, moving, feeding, and drinking by employing the depth video cameras
    and sensors. Qiao et al. [140] explored the DL technique Mask R-CNN for examining
    cattle health and welfare information in precision livestock management. The proposed
    model extract key features from image frames, enhance the image to remove non-uniform
    illumination shadow influences, segment image of cattle from the background image
    using the Mask R-CNN DL tool, and lastly extract cattle contour lines from the
    segmented image. The proposed approach outperforms SharpMask and DeepMask image
    segmentation models with mean pixel accuracy of 0.92 and an average distance error
    of 33.56 pixels. Liakos et al. [141] explored ML model for predicting healthy
    cattle and cattle suffering from lameness utilizing basic features of cattle which
    includes per day habits of cattle like steps taken, overall walking, lying, and
    eating habits. Morales et al. [142] employed a method based on SVM for early detection,
    warnings, and production issues of eggs in the poultry farms. The simulation results
    show that the proposed technique alerts a day before with an estimation accuracy
    of 0.9854. The identification of livestock is an important aspect of monitoring
    growth and animal welfare. Hansen et al. [143] explored deep learning techniques
    CNN for identifying pigs faces from the dataset of digital images of pigs obtained
    from commercial farm environment where the parameters such as dirt and lighting
    are highly unpredictable. The proposed approach accurately predicts the faces
    with an accuracy of 96.7%. Fenlon et al. [144] build a decision support system
    using predictive ML algorithms to provide calving assistance in the dairy industry.
    Four ML techniques multimodal regression, decision trees, RF, and NN were explored
    to predict three calving difficulties unassisted, slight assistance, and veterinary
    assistance. The simulation result shows that NN and multimodal regression models
    accurately classify 75% of calving difficulties with an average prediction error
    of 3.7% and 4.5%. Fenlon et al. [145] analyzed calving difficulties in dairy herds
    in Ireland using ML algorithms. A dataset of parity, log days in milk, inter-service
    interval, difficulties faced in the last calving, herd body conditions were built
    to predict conceptions using artificial insemination in the Iris dairy industry.
    Logistic regression outperforms RF, decision trees, and Naive Bayes in predicting
    conception using artificial insemination. Borchers et al. [146] explored RF, linear
    discriminant, and NN for calving prediction in dairy cattle by examining their
    behaviour which includes number the of steps, lying time, standing time, transition
    from one state to other and total motion 14 days before the predicted calving
    date. Although, the innovative algorithms play a crucial role in livestock management
    but combining livestock data with public data will improve precision livestock
    farming standards [147]. Table 8 presents a comparative study of different ML
    algorithms for livestock production and management. TABLE 8 Different ML Algorithms
    for Livestock Production and Management F. Intelligent Harvesting Techniques Smart
    harvesting systems helps the farmers to harvest agriculture goods by reducing
    human efforts. In this approach, technologies such as smart sensors, robotics,
    UAVs, and IoT devices [148], AI, and ML-based computer vision techniques are employed
    to intelligently harvest the crops. The research community has provided a comprehensive
    review of different intelligent techniques used to automate the agriculture industry
    [149]–[151] and have analyzed the potential and challenges of this decision support
    system [152]. In the last few years, different robots have been developed for
    harvesting fruits and vegetables [153]. Smart harvesting offers better insight
    into the crops and helps farmers to achieve the potential harvest of crops which
    leads to increased productivity. Smart harvesting system has numerous advantages
    in comparison to traditional harvesting approaches like it requires less labour,
    optimized crop yield, maximum probability, better insight into crops, reduced
    cost of harvesting, and cost-efficient production. A significant problem in the
    Japanese agriculture industry is a labour shortage. Sakai et al. [154] utilized
    machine vision for asparagus robot harvesting in Nagasaki prefecture. The speed
    of asparagus robot harvesting is three times faster than the human being. Since
    asparagus harvesting is modeled on their size and doesn’t require color properties
    thus laser sensor is used to collect 3D distance information in the proposed work.
    Monta et al. [155] also explored laser sensors along with color cameras for tomato
    harvesting through robots. Preter et al. [156] developed an autonomous system
    consisting of e-vehicle, cameras, robotic arm, localization system, gripper, quality
    monitoring, and logistic handling system, which can efficiently detect, plucks,
    and puts the strawberries in a box. The proposed robot prototype is fast enough
    to pluck the fruit in just 4 seconds. Hayashi et al. [157] practically evaluated
    the performance of strawberry harvesting robots in a greenhouse test field. The
    proposed autonomous system efficiently access the fruit position and its maturity
    level and pick the fruit with and without suction in a duration of two to three
    weeks without damaging the fruit. Horng et al. [158] proposed a smart harvesting
    system that employs IoT and smart image recognition systems for the detection
    of mature crops using object detection feature trained on MLP neural network.
    The mature crop can be harvested using a robotic arm whose movement is predicted
    using ML algorithms. Zhang et al. [159] explored Regions-CNN (RCNN) for multi-class
    canopy object detection in shake and catch the apple harvesting system. A dataset
    of RGB images was created in the commercial orchard using a Kinect v2 sensor and
    pre-trained RCNN is utilized for real-time detection of apple, branches, and trunks.
    The authors also developed an estimation algorithm to predict shaking location
    based on the results of RCNN. Spectral and thermal images have also been explored
    for the detection of fruits and vegetables [160], [161]. Zhang et al. [162] investigated
    eleven canopy parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified
    the removal status of apples into mechanically harvested and mechanically unharvested.
    Zhang et al. [163] reviewed technology progress in the mechanical harvesting of
    apples which includes shake and catch, robots, and harvest assist platforms. Pise
    and Upadhye [164] explored Naive Bayes and SVM ML techniques for grading of harvested
    mangoes based on their color, size, features, quality, and maturity. Grading of
    fruits increases the profit of the agriculture and food industries. A mango image
    dataset comprising of three different colors red, green, and yellow is created
    and is used for training and testing the ML algorithm. The proposed approach presents
    limited scope as it can detect defects in a particular surface area which can
    be overcome by creating a dataset of rotational view images. Wu et al. [165] explored
    NN for recognition, classification of fruits and vegetables, and obstacle avoidance
    in a harvesting robot. Table 9 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms
    for intelligent harvesting. TABLE 9 Different ML Algorithms for Intelligent Harvesting
    SECTION V. IoT Applications in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture refers
    to a system with minimizing direct involvement of the caretaker/farmer except
    when there is an urgent need or an emergency i.e. when there is a failure in the
    system. IoT helps in maintaining the defined standards of parameters needed for
    day to day work in agriculture. The parameters can be measured using the required
    sensors and can be uploaded to an IoT cloud for remote monitoring so that the
    direct involvement of farmers is minimized. The IoT cloud can be used for control
    purposes also, say for example in detecting and avoiding animal intrusion in the
    agriculture field. Sensors are an integral part of IoT for precision agriculture
    without which the monitoring and controlling becomes next to impossible task.
    Figure 6 shows the trend search of keywords “IoT in agriculture” and “sensor in
    agriculture” on google in the last 10 years. Apart from monitoring and controlling,
    IoT in agriculture is also used as data-storage technology. Parameters like properties
    of soil, crop yield, seasonal behaviour data, temperature changes, etc can be
    stored on the IoT cloud which will be helpful in analyses, prediction, and deciding
    on estimated crop production. FIGURE 6. Google trend response for keywords IoT
    in agriculture and sensor in agriculture for the last 10 years. Show All A. Sensors
    for IoT in Precision Agriculture IoT is defined as the interconnection of things,
    where one example of a thing is a sensor. A group of sensors can communicate with
    every other sensor and thereby with the control center. A WSN in IoT has the benefits
    of increasing the efficiency of production, enhancing the yield quality, detecting
    and avoiding plant-eating pets, detecting the fires in the farms [166]. IoT has
    helped in increasing the scope of farming, animal, and pet rearing along with
    smart irrigation [167]. Sensors form an integral part of IoT architecture in agriculture.
    A sensor is defined as a transducer that converts the sensed parameter (soil moisture,
    for example) into the equivalent electrical signal. Depending on the nature of
    the output signal they generate, sensors are classified as analog or digital sensors.
    An analog sensor’s output needs to be converted to digital before it is being
    fed, processed by any IoT system. On the other hand, sensors that generate signals
    in digital form can be directly connected to any IoT system. Table 10 compares
    the list of some important sensors applicable in precision agriculture. Addressing
    the complete list of sensors available for precision agriculture is beyond the
    scope of this article, although, table 10 provides the list of sensors and their
    parameters that are very widely used and covers almost every aspect of IoT in
    agriculture. A pair of sensors and actuators can be used to collect information
    about some of the vital parameters of precision agriculture and react to perform
    predefined action whenever required. IoT plays an important role in assuring that
    the action performed happens instantaneously with minimum delay. The factors that
    can affect the real-time decision making and causes a delay is the tolerance of
    the measuring parameter and the communication protocol used. The operating temperature
    where the sensors are placed have a proportional effect on tolerance. An increase
    temperature on either side will increase the tolerance of the measuring parameter
    and sensor reading will deviate the value of the measurand from the actual value.
    The communication protocol is used to send the readings of the sensor to the microcontroller
    from where the value will be uploaded to the IoT cloud. The data rate of communication
    protocol decides the time required for this data transfer. TABLE 10 Sensor Parameters
    Used in Precision Agriculture B. Wireless Sensor Networks in Precision Agriculture
    WSN is the collection of spatially displaced sensor deployed to monitor the physical
    parameters of the environment and coordinating the collected data at central location.
    IoT transfers the recorded data to cloud which is further processed and analyzed
    through intelligent algorithms. In precision agriculture integration of artificial
    intelligence with WSN allows real time monitoring and intelligent decision making
    in agriculture fields. IoT sensor network which includes soil moisture senor,
    electrochemical sensor, optical sensors, etc. continuously monitor the field data
    and works as a training data for ML and DL algorithms. Edge computing enabled
    AI systems assist in reducing the amount of data to be uploaded to IoT cloud by
    identification of meaningful data to be communicated and discarding the redundant
    data. Intelligent processing of data generated from nodes result in better management
    of sensor network In [185] author utilized AI driven sensor network to classify
    land as suitable, more suitable, moderately suitable and unsuitable after every
    cultivation. In [186] author developed a power efficient WSN using Arduino microcontroller
    and ZigBee module to monitor and control essential parameters that effect crop
    growth such as soil and weather conditions in Florida, USA. In [187] author integrating
    sensor nodes with AI systems to reduce the power consumption of nodes by optimizing
    the performance and data transmission of respective nodes. RNN based Long-Short
    term (LSTM) network was built which increases the runtime of a single sensor and
    guarantees 180 days autonomous operation using Li-ion battery. The proposed system
    continuously monitors the growth dynamics of plant leaves. In [188] author presents
    an autonomous system built with low power sensor nodes and IoT based cloud platform
    to estimate level of phosphorous in soil through ANN. Author incorporates dynamic
    power management system to maintain balance between energy consumption and estimation
    accuracy. In [189] author presents GA optimized WSN for precision agriculture
    applications. Thus, we conclude that integrating artificial intelligence with
    WSN, IoT plays a key role in assuring the best yield of crops. SECTION VI. Assessment
    and Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Agriculture System In this section ML algorithms
    used by different researchers in the precision agriculture system are analyzed.
    The agriculture industry is facing many challenges across the world, and a knowledge-based
    agriculture system allows sustainable use of resources by the farmers aiming to
    get maximum output from the agriculture land. There are two basic stages in precision
    agriculture, i.e. pre-processing stage and processing stage. In the pre-processing
    phase market trends are studied and based on geographical conditions and soil
    properties of the land seeds are selected and the land is prepared for precision
    agriculture system. In the post-processing stage machine vision techniques are
    explored for disease and weed identification while intelligent techniques are
    used for irrigation and harvesting. In this article, author reviewed and discussed
    70 articles where multiple ML algorithms are presented for performance optimization
    of the agricultural cycle. Figure 7 shows the classification of articles based
    on different applications of precision agriculture. FIGURE 7. Classification based
    on agriculture cycle. Show All Figure 8 depicts the cumulative distribution of
    the ML and DL models used by researchers in precision agriculture. The graph depicts
    the broad categorisation of the techniques with their applications to agricultural
    cycle. It has been observed that in majority of the literature the researchers
    have applied multiple algorithms for classification and parameter prediction.
    Regression models and ANN together make up around 65% of the AI techniques employed
    by researchers. Hence, it is important to investigate the techniques used and
    compared by the authors. The individual best performing algorithms have already
    been covered in appropriate sections, however the figure 8 depicts the distribution
    of the various regression algorithms and DL models throughout the literature.
    ELM algorithm is widely explored in prediction of soil properties such as soil
    moisture, soil temperature, surface humidity, ETc. ANN accurately predicts the
    rainfall and crop yield across different regions of globe. DL based CNN model
    finds wide applications for accurate disease and weed classification in agriculture
    crops. ANN model best predicts the nitrate content and water requirement in drip
    irrigation system. SVM regression model estimates the emitter outflow discharge
    under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Decision Tree algorithm accurately
    identify the chewing habits and predicts SCM in dairy herds. CNN have widely explored
    for livestock identification. Metaheuristic optimized ML algorithms are also explored
    by researchers in precision agriculture. FIGURE 8. ML techniques used in precision
    agriculture applications. Show All In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 22 different regression algorithms for prediction, however 5 most commonly
    used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 9. Remaining 17 algorithms
    which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms
    have been classified into others. FIGURE 9. Regression algorithm in precision
    agriculture. Show All DL models have contributed significantly and outperforms
    ML classification algorithms in classification of crop disease and weed as well
    as for livestock diseases identification. Figure 10 shows CNN, ANN and RNN algorithms
    explored in precision agriculture. In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 10 different DL/NN algorithms for prediction/classification, however 8
    most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 10. Remaining
    2 (LeNet, and Caffee) algorithms which are used either only for comparison or
    employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 10.
    Classification algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All A. Performance Comparison
    of ML Algorithms in Precision Agriculture The application of ML and DL algorithms
    highly depends on the agriculture cycle and the dataset involved. This section
    discusses the advantages and limitations of various ML and DL algorithms such
    as regression and classification algorithms based on the agriculture cycle involved.
    1) Soil Properties and Weather Prediction The application of AI techniques in
    prediction of soil parameters and weather is dependent on various factors. The
    researchers generally employ around 3 to 4 algorithms in for prediction and select
    the algorithms which has most accurate prediction and is robust to factors such
    as: noise, non-linearity, outliers etc. the most commonly employed algorithms
    are ELM, RF, SVR, and cubist algorithm. Advantages of using ML in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Non-linear dataset – these predictions often
    attributes a non-linear dataset which can be utilized for accurate prediction
    by regression algorithms such as: ELM, RF, SVR Large dataset – the dataset for
    is often obtained from satellite which can be well handled by the regression algorithms
    with less convergence time and accurate predictions. Insensitivity to outliers
    – Weather patterns often encounter outlier events which may affect the prediction
    accuracy, however algorithms such as ELM, NN are robust to outliers and provide
    accurate predictions. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML
    exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of
    accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Varying geographical conditions poses a challenge
    for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Soil parameters prediction
    is highly dependent on the sample selection philosophy. Dataset selection and
    filtering is a challenge for researchers with non-computing background. 2) Crop
    Yield Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of crop yield
    is a mammoth task and lack of availability of a universal model makes designing
    of the algorithm challenging. The most promising algorithms for crop yield prediction
    are regression algorithms, and neural networks. Advantages of using ML in crop
    yield prediction: Complex dataset – crop yield prediction involves enormous dataset
    composing of satellite data and/or historic data. Faster and accurate predictions
    can be made by utilizing the AI techniques such as regression algorithms (SVR,
    RF) Neural networks (CNN). Parameter variation – the crop yield depends on a lot
    of parameters, like climatic factors, soil quality, NDVI, altitude, air parameters.
    The AI based prediction systems handle the parameters dependency efficiently.
    Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices
    such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis.
    Challenges and limitations in prediction of crop yield: Varying parameters and
    complex datasets pose a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms.
    Dataset selection is critical due to the complexity; as an improper selection
    of data may result in underfit/overfit prediction pattern. 3) Disease and Weed
    Detection The applications of AI techniques in disease and weed detection primarily
    depends on the advances in image processing. CNN’s are the most prominent choice
    for building a disease identification system. Training dataset will govern the
    performance of the algorithm, although these are available in open-source format,
    users have to be cautious while using the dataset. Advantages of using ML in detection
    of weed and disease in a crop field: Prediction accuracy – AI offer accurate detection
    of disease and weeds with an accuracy of 99% which is better compared to manual/classical
    techniques. Robust prediction – the algorithms can predict the disease/weed even
    with smartphone images, which is commonly available with farmers. Easy configuration
    – with CNN being the most common and reliable technique, designing a disease/weed
    detection system is not a complex job unlike other systems discussed in text.
    Challenges and limitations in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: The
    accuracy of prediction depends on the quality of training dataset some of which
    is available as an open-source dataset, but is applicable to only a limited number
    of crops. Improperly labelled data may result in a disastrous prediction system,
    as the training of the system plays a major role in the performance of the system.
    Overtraining the model may result in a sensitive prediction system. 4) Drip Irrigation
    Smart irrigation systems are not only crop friendly but are environmental friendly
    too. The combination of IoT with the AI not only reduces the manual intervention
    but also utilizes the available in an optimum way to ensure no adverse effect
    to environment. Regression and Advantages of using ML in drip irrigation for an
    agricultural field: Optimum resource utilization – accurate estimation of irrigation
    requirements results in a system which optimizes the resource (water, electricity)
    utilization (NN algorithms). Crop protection – optimized irrigation practices
    minimizes water related damage to the crops and hence increases the crop yield.
    Robust to weather variations – an accurately designed AI based (Regression algorithms)
    irrigation system handles the random weather events in a better way when compared
    with the non-AI based irrigation methods. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation
    for an agricultural field: Accurate prediction sometimes depends on the number
    of sensors and hence increases the initial investment of the farmers. An incorrect
    sensor placement in the filed affects the accuracy of the system, hence sensor
    optimization becomes imperative in designing a smart irrigation system. The architecture
    of prediction system highly depends on the dataset; hence no universal guidelines
    can be laid out for system design. 5) Livestock Production and Management The
    livestock management primarily focuses on the well-being of the farm animals and
    uses advanced image recognition (CNN) algorithms, and regression techniques to
    detect and predict the disease/ disease spread. Advantages of using ML in livestock
    production and management: Decreased risk of diseases – AI systems assists in
    identifying the livestock diseases and also helps in combating the disease, by
    predicting the root of diseases and transmission (Regression algorithms). Minimization
    of disease spread – timely diagnosis and treatment reduces the risk of spreading
    the disease. Psychological analysis – advanced image recognition and behavioural
    analysis (CNN techniques) help is detecting the stress in animals ensuring heath
    of the livestock. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural
    field: With varying geographic and climatic conditions the attributes of the cattle
    and diseases changes hence, no universal system can be designed to cater to the
    diversities. Some viruses are difficult to predict even using the state-of-art
    prediction algorithms. 6) Intelligent Harvesting The applications of AI techniques
    in harvesting is primarily an assistive technology for automatic harvesting systems.
    Harvesting prediction system largely relies on the advances in image processing
    and CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building these systems. Advantages
    of using ML in intelligent harvesting: Assistive technology – AI in conjunction
    with existing harvesting robots exhibit high accuracy in harvesting. Image processing
    – the identification of harvesting relies on the state-of-art image processing
    algorithm (CNNs) and hence the developments in the image processing algorithms
    result in direct accuracy enhancement of intelligent harvesting techniques. Universal
    algorithms – the AI harvesting techniques largely depend on image recognition
    methods, hence CNNs can easily be deployed for implementing intelligent harvesting
    techniques. Challenges and limitations in intelligent harvesting: The accuracy
    of the prediction systems largely depends on the training dataset, hence accurately
    labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing an intelligent harvesting
    system. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers,
    as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might
    lead to rejection of the product. SECTION VII. Challenges and Limitations of Artifical
    Intelligence in Precision Agriculture Artificial intelligence has the potential
    of playing an important role in meeting the food requirement of entire world.
    However, there are certain challenges which are hampering its adoption in agriculture
    industries which are outlined as follows: A recent government survey in India
    estimated that literacy rate of Indian farmers is very low therefore bridging
    the gap between farmers and technology is a challenging task. Farmers are less
    motivated to come out from their comfort zone and learn digital skills to improve
    their farming standards. Agriculture lands are mostly situated in rural areas.
    Implementation of IoT architecture and WSN which requires cloud services for data
    storage and analysis is a big issue in rural areas where reliable internet connectivity
    is not available. Accurate prediction and classification through cognitive ability
    of machines is difficult in varying geographical conditions. Initial set up of
    digital farming which includes hardware and software requires huge investment.
    Deployment of smart sensors and other electronic gadgets requires heavy energy
    consumption. SECTION VIII. Future Trends of Artifical Intelligence and IoT in
    Precision Agriculture Agriculture industry is globally US$5 trillion industry
    and now it has been revolutionized with artificial intelligence and IoT technologies.
    These innovative tools are assisting famers to improve crop yield, monitor soil
    parameters, livestock health and temperature conditions, control pests and improve
    other agriculture related tasks. Conventional ML and DL models such as SVM, RF,
    ANN finds difficult to accurately estimate soil parameters and weather conditions
    in varying ecosystem. Therefore, swarm intelligence optimized robust and adaptive
    ML and DL algorithms such as SVM-PSO, ANN-GWO algorithms can be explored to effectively
    forecast different parameters in precision agriculture. In large agriculture fields
    swarm intelligence inspired autonomous system can be built for crop health and
    growth monitoring. UAV swarm can be utilized for near real time field and livestock
    monitoring through computer vision and DL algorithms and accordingly swarm of
    UAV can be used for spraying of pesticides and fertilizers in the infected crops.
    Greenness of crops can be identified through UAVs installed cameras and an automated
    irrigation system can be built in large agriculture fields. Swarm of mobile robots
    can be used in the agriculture fields to efficiently automate task such as harvesting,
    weed identification and elimination, etc. Metaheuristic algorithms can be explored
    for nodes localization in agriculture fields in order to optimize the sensor deployment
    in the field and keep the minimize cost to farmers. Offline service chatbots can
    be built to assist farmers in developing countries where farmers don’t have good
    internet connectivity. These chatbots can assist farmers by providing timely advice
    based on expert recommendations and will help to resolve their specific farming
    problems. Artificial intelligence assisted renewable energy plants can be installed
    in agriculture lands to maximize the power output of clean energy in unpredictable
    weather conditions. This will allow for sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial
    intelligence can also be explored in vertical and soilless agriculture. In near
    future artificial intelligence systems, robotics and smart sensor technology will
    automate the whole farming process starting from seed sowing to intelligent fruits
    and vegetables harvesting and packaging. SECTION IX. Conclusion Precision agriculture
    is empowering the farmers with technology intending to get optimum outputs with
    precise inputs. IoT enabled smart sensors, actuators, satellite images, robots,
    drones are some of the key technological revolutions that boosted the agriculture
    industry. These components play a vital role in collecting real-time data and
    accordingly making decisions without human support. Artificial intelligence which
    is the automation of intelligent behaviour is continuously benefiting our planet
    and helping humans in various aspects of life. In this paper, authors have reviewed
    ML applications for precision agriculture. The impact of AI and IoT in smart farm
    management is discussed with a brief introduction to ML algorithms which are most
    commonly used in precision agriculture. Regression algorithms are the backbone
    for soil properties, weather, and crop yield prediction. DL algorithms such as
    CNN and ML classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision trees, and RF were
    explored for the identification of disease and weeds in the plants. Smart irrigation
    systems and harvesting techniques play an important component in precision agriculture
    as these techniques quickly complete the work and reduces human labour. Drones
    and robots enabled with a digital camera are employed for this work. Livestock
    management is an important concern for farmers across the world. Knowledge-based
    agriculture system which includes smart IoT devices and AI tools efficiently handle
    livestock management. As a scope of future work, NLP based chatbots can be built
    for famers and more ML, DL and hybrid algorithms can be explored in the agriculture
    industry for sustainable use of available resources. Authors Figures References

    \ the challenge of feeding a growing population with limited or depleting\nfresh\
    \ water resources. Advances in irrigation systems and technologies allow site-speciﬁc\
    \ application\nof irrigation water within the ﬁeld to improve water use efﬁciency\
    \ or reduce water usage for\nsustainable crop production, especially in arid and\
    \ semi-arid regions. This paper discusses recent\ndevelopment of variable-rate\
    \ irrigation (VRI) technologies, data and information for VRI application,\nand\
    \ impacts of VRI, including proﬁtability using this technology, with a focus on\
    \ agronomic factors\nin precision water management. The development in sprinkler\
    \ systems enabled irrigation application\nwith greater precision at the scale\
    \ of individual nozzle control. Further research is required to evaluate\nVRI\
    \ prescription maps integrating different soil and crop characteristics in different\
    \ environments.\nOn-farm trials and whole-ﬁeld studies are needed to provide support\
    \ information for practical\nVRI applications. Future research also needs to address\
    \ the adjustment of the spatial distribution of\nprescription zones in response\
    \ to temporal variability in soil water status and crop growing conditions,\n\
    which can be evaluated by incorporating remote and proximal sensing data. Comprehensive\

    \ scheduling\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture is the largest consumer of the world′s\
    \ available fresh water, as plant growth largely\ndepends on the availability\
    \ of water. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),\ncurrent\
    \ world irrigated area is approximately 300 million ha, and projection to 2050\
    \ suggests growing\nscarcities of water resources for agriculture, although water\
    \ is a renewable resource. This situation has\nampliﬁed the intensity of global\
    \ food insecurity, climate change, and poverty. The greatest challenge\nto agriculture\
    \ is to provide food and ﬁber for almost 8 billion people around the world in\
    \ the advent of\ndepleting freshwater resources [1].\nThe challenge is more prominent\
    \ in the arid and semi-arid regions, where underground water\nsources, especially\
    \ aquifers are used for irrigation, as rainfall provides only a portion of the\
    \ total\nrequirement for crop evapotranspiration (ET) demand [2]. Heavy irrigation\
    \ has caused rapid depletion\nof many aquifers. For instance, comparing the water\
    \ level of the Ogallala aquifer in the 1950s to that\nof 2013, in some wells,\
    \ up to 78 m of water was depleted in the Texas High Plains area [3]. This is\n\
    almost 12 times the average decline of 4.5 m for the whole area of the aquifer.\
    \ Given this depletion rate,\nscientists have predicted that 35% of the Southern\
    \ High Plains will not be able to support irrigation in\n30 years. Many other\
    \ water resources in the world are depleting rapidly in recent years with negligible\n\
    recharge, indicating the need for water conservation solutions in agriculture\
    \ [4,5]. More effective and\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87; doi:10.3390/agronomy9020087\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n2 of 21\nefﬁcient management\
    \ of water is required to better conserve water and improve water use efﬁciency\n\
    for sustainable crop production.\nConventional farming practices manage an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld uniformly without incorporating\nthe intrinsic variability in topography,\
    \ soil, crop growth conditions, and other agronomic factors.\nThis can result\
    \ in nutrient leaching, environmental contamination, and reduced proﬁtability\
    \ especially\nwhen applying high inputs in low yielding areas and vice versa [6,7].\
    \ Precision agriculture can be\nadopted to divide the ﬁeld into small management\
    \ units for optimized production [8]. There are\nseveral deﬁnitions for precision\
    \ agriculture, and it keeps evolving with emerging technologies and\nunderstanding\
    \ of what is achievable [9]. The idea of precision agriculture or site-speciﬁc\
    \ management\nstarted around the early 1980s with the development of various technologies\
    \ to assess ﬁeld variabilities\nsuch as soil survey, soil testing and mapping,\
    \ and crop yield monitoring [10–13]. Precision agriculture\ndepends on detailed\
    \ spatial information, information technology, greater information processing\n\
    capability, and better decision aids [14]. Precision agriculture is a management\
    \ system that measures\nand responds to the spatial and temporal variability of\
    \ soil and crop growth at the sub-ﬁeld level\nwith the aim to enhance proﬁtability\
    \ and reduce environmental impact [15,16]. Major technologies\ninvolved in precision\
    \ agriculture include geographic information systems (GIS), remote and proximal\n\
    sensing, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), yield monitoring and the variable\
    \ rate technology.\nGeoreferenced information about soil and plant characteristics\
    \ can be obtained efﬁciently using GIS,\nproximal sensors and remote sensors [17].\
    \ Application of yield monitors provides the capability to\nprecisely characterize\
    \ yield variability at large scales in the ﬁeld. Moreover, the variable rate technology\n\
    provides the ability to site-speciﬁcally apply irrigation water in the ﬁeld to\
    \ achieve potential water\nsavings [18]. This enables the timely and accurate\
    \ water application incorporating the spatial and\ntemporal soil properties and\
    \ plant demand at different growth stages [15]. In other words, the variable\n\
    rate irrigation (VRI) technology can help to apply the right amount of water in\
    \ the right area of the\nﬁeld at the right time resulting in water savings.\n\
    Recent research suggests site-speciﬁc management of water or VRI could be a solution\
    \ to conserve\nwater and improve water use efﬁciency (WUE), which is the ratio\
    \ between effective water use and\nactual water withdrawal in the ﬁeld [19]. VRI\
    \ can support water and energy conservation with a\npositive inﬂuence on crop\
    \ water productivity and the environment [20]. This is possible by applying\n\
    irrigation at rates that vary to appropriately match ﬁeld variability based on\
    \ speciﬁc water needs\nof individual management zones rather than applying a uniform\
    \ rate throughout the ﬁeld [21].\nThe magnitude of soil water content (SWC) varies\
    \ with time and location, but the pattern of spatial\nvariability usually remains\
    \ similar. This temporal stability of SWC is associated with properties of the\n\
    ﬁeld such as topography, soil texture, apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa)\
    \ and drainage patterns\nthat insigniﬁcantly change over time [22,23]. The feasibility\
    \ and effectiveness of VRI depend on the\nsize of the ﬁeld, crop species under\
    \ consideration, weather, and the underlying ﬁeld properties such as\nelevation,\
    \ slope, soil texture, and ECa that inﬂuence soil moisture content and irrigation\
    \ requirements\nfor the crop [24,25]. Hence, understanding the inﬂuence of agronomic\
    \ factors such as topography and\nsoil properties on soil water and ultimately\
    \ yield can provide a basis for application of VRI in the ﬁeld\nto achieve potential\
    \ water savings together with yield optimization.\nToday, site-speciﬁc water management\
    \ has been made easier with several precision agriculture\ntools, such as GNSS,\
    \ GIS, yield mapping, soil survey and remote sensing [26]. Several decision support\n\
    tools and strategies to reduce groundwater withdrawal without reductions in irrigated\
    \ land area or\ncrop productivity have been developed [4]. The measures to optimize\
    \ the use of irrigation water in\nthe ﬁelds include increasing weather-based irrigation\
    \ scheduling, converting gravity-based irrigation\nto center pivot irrigation,\
    \ subsurface drip irrigation, replacing high water to low water demand\ncrops,\
    \ and deﬁcit irrigation based on evapotranspiration replacement using various\
    \ water-balance\nmodels [27]. Several studies have been done to understand the\
    \ possible water savings with VRI.\nA review on VRI across different crop and\
    \ weather regimes of the world concluded that VRI could save\n10%–15% of water\
    \ [28]. Although the use of VRI seems to be a reasonable measure to improve water\n\
    Agronomy 2019, 9, 87\n3 of 21\nmanagement, many producers are reluctant to adopt\
    \ it because limited research is done at the ﬁeld scale\nto understand its reliability\
    \ and economic potential [25]. A better understanding of ﬁeld variability and\n\
    how it affects crop yield is needed for effective implementation of the new technologies.\
    \ A review for\nsite-speciﬁc sprinkler irrigation [29] focused on the technology\
    \ and challenges for adoption. Another\nreview of 20 years’ research on increasing\
    \ crop productivity with sprinkler and micro-irrigation\ndiscussed the importance\
    \ of understanding the crop response to VRI [30]. The study emphasized the\nneed\
    \ for continuous effort towards management zone delineation based on ﬁeld properties\
    \ integrated\nwith dynamic information from real-time monitoring of climatological\
    \ and crop data. However,\nthis study focused more on the technological aspect\
    \ of irrigation management than the agronomic\naspect of water conservation with\
    \ VRI. The agricultural science behind VRI is equally crucial for\nthe successful\
    \ implementation of this technology. Hence, the objective of this paper is to\
    \ review the\nscientiﬁc background and technologies in precision water management,\
    \ with the focus on agronomic\nfactors and strategies for site-speciﬁc water management.\n\
    2. Variable-Rate Irrigation Technologies\nThe irrigation system changed from gravity-based\
    \ furrow irrigation in the 1950s to sprinkler\nirrigation in late 1990s. Initially,\
    \ the high-pressure sprinkler irrigation system was available in the\n1980s which\
    \ later developed to low-pressure sprinklers and low-energy precision application\
    \ (LEPA)\nin 1990s [31–33]. About 49% of total irrigated land in the United States\
    \ is irrigated with center pivot\nsystems, out of which 44% is irrigated at low\
    \ pressure under 30 psi [34]. The basic requirements for the\nVRI technology are\
    \ sensors and spatial information, prescription maps and a system to incorporate\
    \ VRI\nprescription (e.g., LEPA, lateral irrigation, etc.) to apply in the ﬁeld\
    \ [35]. At present, there are several\nirrigation technologies for conservation\
    \ irrigation, such as sprinkler, drip, and other micro-irrigation\nsystems but\
    \ limited site-speciﬁc studies have been done [30,36–38]. For example, a study\
    \ of the\nvariable-rate drip irrigation system on vineyard found up to 17% increase\
    \ in yield and a 20% decrease\nin water consumption compared to uniform irrigation\
    \ [39]. Researchers in the UK assessed the potential\nof hose-reel boom irrigators\
    \ for precision irrigation in vegetables [40]. Automatic gravity-fed irrigation\n\
    systems in Europe decreased manual labor and supported adoption by innovative\
    \ farmers [41].\nVariable-rate irrigation using center pivot in rice showed better\
    \ performance compared to uniform\nﬂooding irrigation [42]. In this review, we\
    \ will focus more on those irrigation technologies that have\nbeen used for site-speciﬁc\
    \ water management more frequently around the world, such as variable-rate\nlateral\
    \ irrigation systems and center pivot irrigation systems.\nThe components of a\
    \ variable-rate lateral irrigation system commonly consist of a GPS or GNSS\n\
    receiver, custom software-controlled relays and valves, which can apply variable\
    \ water utilizing the\nnozzle-pulsing technique and a variable speed control system.\
    \ This system can control the irrigation\nrate and forward speed with high accuracy\
    \ [43]. Similarly, the components of a center pivot VRI system\ninclude a pivot\
    \ control panel, a VRI control panel, solenoid valves, control nodes, a GNSS system,\n\
    a variable frequency drive and a remote-control system [21]. The pivot control\
    \ regulates the operation\nand speed of the pivot, while the VRI control panel\
    \ regulates the irrigation application rate in response\nto the prescription map\
    \ and the pivot location. Solenoid valves regulate the ﬂow of sprinkler heads.\n\
    The GNSS system at the end of the center pivot provides the pivot position. The\
    \ control nodes along\nthe length of the pivot determine when the valves are open\
    \ or close. The variable frequency drive\n(VFD) helps to regulate the pressure\
    \ while instantaneously changing the rate of irrigation at different\npositions\
    \ of the ﬁeld. The VFD controls the rotation speed of the pump impeller by receiving\
    \ the input\nfrom a pressure switch installed on the pump outlet pipe. This keeps\
    \ water pressure stable within\npreset maximum and minimum thresholds and thus\
    \ saving water and energy. The remote control\nsystem allows to view and control\
    \ the center pivot and the pump from a distance via a smartphone or\na computer\
    \ using the internet [21]. Further, research and development are striving to control\
    \ irrigation\namount with VRI controllers using real-time information from plant\
    \ and soil sensors in the ﬁeld [44].\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n4 of 21\nCurrently,\
    \ several companies work on the manufacture and application of this technology.\n\
    The commercially available VRI control resolution varies with the manufacturers.\
    \ VRI systems\ncan apply zero water to speciﬁc nozzles and as much as 200% of\
    \ the standard application rate\nto other nozzles by opening or closing individual\
    \ nozzles and by changing the speed of the\npivot [45]. Some companies provide\
    \ the ability to control zones of sprinklers, while others can\ncontrol each sprinkler\
    \ independently [46]. For example, Valley (Valley, Valmont Irrigation, Valley,\
    \ NE,\nUSA) provides variable speed control and variable zone control technologies\
    \ for site-speciﬁc water\napplication. The variable speed control system uses\
    \ an advanced control panel that can slow down or\nspeed up the pivot to vary\
    \ water input in different areas (sectors) of the ﬁeld, but the overall pivot\

    topographic properties combined can explain 28% to 85% of yield variability [51].\
    \ Hence, it is critical\nto quantify the variability of terrain attributes and\
    \ soil properties for VRI applications.\n3.1. Topography\nTopographic variation\
    \ is a common characteristic of large agricultural ﬁelds that result in spatial\n\
    variability of soil water and ultimately crop yield [52]. Topography or terrain\
    \ has two types of attributes,\nprimary and secondary attributes [53]. Primary\
    \ attributes include elevation, slope, aspect, curvature,\nﬂow length, and upslope\
    \ contributing area. Secondary attributes are derived empirically from several\n\
    primary attributes to characterize speciﬁc processes manifesting in the landscape,\
    \ mainly including\nsediment transport index (STI), stream power index (SPI),\
    \ ﬂow direction, ﬂow accumulation, distance\nto ﬂow accumulation lines (DFL),\
    \ and wetness index [53,54]. Topographic properties affect soil physical\nand\
    \ chemical properties such as texture (sand, silt, and clay content), pH, CaCO3,\
    \ extractable Ca and\nMg, available K, base saturation, organic matter, and cation\
    \ exchange capacity (CEC). Topography also\ninﬂuences hydrologic properties and\
    \ processes and can account for up to 50% of water availability\ndifferences in\
    \ the same ﬁeld [52]. Elevation, slope and surface curvatures directly affect\
    \ inﬁltration and\nrunoff as they inﬂuence the surface and subsurface ﬂow of water\
    \ in the ﬁeld [55,56]. This can have a\nsigniﬁcant effect on crop growth and yield,\
    \ resulting in differences in crop production of up to 69% at\ndifferent positions\
    \ in the ﬁeld [57–59].\nA study conducted in central Illinois and eastern Indiana\
    \ showed that topography alone could\nexplain about 20% of yield variability [60].\
    \ Corn yield variability was consistently correlated with\nelevation and slope\
    \ in a three-year study in Southern Portugal [53]. This study showed that topographic\n\
    indices, such as distance to ﬂow accumulation lines (DFL), were negatively correlated\
    \ with yield,\nhence could be used to evaluate spatial yield variability. A research\
    \ conducted on a 7.4-ha ﬁeld in the\nSouthern High Plains of Texas showed cotton\
    \ lint yield was negatively correlated with site elevation.\nThe lint yield and\
    \ nitrogen (N) uptake was higher in bottom slope positions than in upslope, possibly\n\
    due to the accumulation of run-off water and NO3-N eroded from the upper slope\
    \ areas. However,\nthis trend depended on weather conditions. For a wet year when\
    \ there was over accumulation of water\nin bottom slopes, lower yield in bottom\
    \ slopes and higher yield in upper slopes were observed [61].\nRelative elevation\
    \ explained up to 49% of water content variation in the soil and 32% of lint yield\n\
    variation in the ﬁeld. The negative correlation between crop yield and elevation\
    \ could be in part due\nto the effect of erosion and topographical attributes\
    \ on soil properties that inﬂuence inﬁltration and\nstorage of water. Slope length\
    \ also affects crop yield by inﬂuencing N denitriﬁcation, soil N, P, K,\nCa and\
    \ Mg distributions, soil carbon storage, and nitrate distribution, as well as\
    \ the inﬁltration rate of\nwater in the ﬁeld [62].\nThe curvature of the ﬁeld\
    \ surface determines the concentration or dispersion of surface water\nin the\
    \ ﬁeld [55]. Concave surface with negative curvatures concentrates water ﬂow,\
    \ while convex\nsurface with positive curvature disperses water ﬂow [63]. For\
    \ example, SWC was found strongly\ncorrelated with soil surface curvature (r =\
    \ 0.9) [64]. Soil surface curvature can explain up to 15% of\nvariations in the\
    \ crop yield [65]. Corn yield was negatively correlated with surface curvature\
    \ in another\nresearch [53]. In this study, corn yield was 14% higher in concave\
    \ curvatures than convex areas. In a\nsix-year study [55], corn yields were negatively\
    \ correlated with elevation, slope, planar curvature and\nproﬁle curvature for\
    \ the wet years. The impact of surface curvature on crop yield also depends on\n\
    weather conditions and the location to some extent. Weather factors have the largest\
    \ effect on grain\nyield at locations with large curvature values. In some cases,\
    \ surface curvature is positively related to\ncrop yield at locations or years\
    \ with higher precipitation [60]. The magnitude of curvature also has\nan impact\
    \ on crop yield. The effect of curvature on crop yield between wet and dry years\
    \ are highly\ndifferent at locations with small curvature [66]. Hence, understanding\
    \ and incorporating topographic\nattributes of the ﬁeld, such as elevation, slope\
    \ length and aspect, surface curvature and their inﬂuence\non water dynamics can\
    \ be an important input for site-speciﬁc water management to achieve potential\n\
    water savings and optimized production.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n6 of 21\n3.2. Soil\
    \ Properties\nSoil functions as a medium for plant growth, a regulator of water\
    \ ﬂow and nutrient cycling.\nIt is a dynamic entity where complex interactions\
    \ occur among its physical, chemical and biological\nproperties to enable these\
    \ functions [67]. Soil forming factors such as parent material, biota, topography,\n\
    climate, and time are variable in time and space and explain most of the soil\
    \ variability besides the\nmanagement induced variability [11]. Spatial variability\
    \ of chemical properties including nutrients,\norganic matter, and pH can result\
    \ in within-ﬁeld variation in available water content and crop\nproductivity [68].\
    \ Complex spatial patterns of soil physical properties also affect soil water\
    \ availability\nand rooting of a plant, resulting in variability in crop growth\
    \ and yield [69]. Soil texture, organic matter\ncontent, apparent electrical conductivity,\
    \ and biological properties are relatively stable properties of\nthe ﬁeld that\
    \ are usually considered for site-speciﬁc management of the ﬁeld.\n3.2.1. Soil\
    \ Texture\nSoil texture, the relative content of sand, silt, and clay particles,\
    \ is an important soil physical\nproperty that affects crop growth and yield.\
    \ Soil texture determines the rate at which water drains\nthrough saturated soil\
    \ and inﬂuences available water-holding capacity. Therefore, it affects the\n\
    distribution of available water for plant growth and irrigation requirements in\
    \ the ﬁeld. Fine sandy\nloams and silts tend to have the highest water-holding\
    \ capacity, while an increase in either clay\nor sand content in the soil proﬁle\
    \ decreases the water-holding capacity [70]. The matric potential\nof soil, which\
    \ depends on soil particle size, inﬂuences the availability of soil water. For\
    \ example,\nclay particles have higher matric potential and lower soil available\
    \ water compared to sand and silt\nparticles [71]. Soil texture also affects the\
    \ spatial variability of residual NO3-N and the leaching of N.\nMore residual\
    \ was found in sandy loam soils compared to loamy sand, and leaching was higher\
    \ in\nloamy sand compared to sandy loam [72]. Soil texture also affects the pore\
    \ sizes and porosity of the soil,\nwhich ultimately affects crop root growth and\
    \ yield by limiting the water available to the plant and the\ngrowth space for\
    \ the roots [73]. In general, soils with high clay content are more difﬁcult to\
    \ manage\ndue to lack of porosity and water available for plant growth. On the\
    \ other hand, well-drained soils\nhave good soil aeration for healthy root and\
    \ crop growth [74]. The clay content can also inﬂuence soil\nwater and nutrient\
    \ content and result in crop yield variability across the ﬁeld [61,75]. A study\
    \ showed\nthat clay content in the soil could explain up to 17% variability in\
    \ winter wheat yield by affecting\nthe water available in the soil for crop growth\
    \ [76]. A study conducted in the Southern High Plains\nshowed that a very sandy\
    \ soil (the Brownﬁeld soil series) with high slope consistently had low yield\n\
    when given the same amount of irrigation water, fertilizer, seed population, and\
    \ other management\npractices [56]. A cross-correlation study conducted between\
    \ cotton lint yield, soil water, clay, sand and\nelevation in a 45-ha ﬁeld in\
    \ Texas High Plains also showed that correlation among these factors varied\n\
    between 0.72 and 0.63 and cotton crop and soil physical properties could be correlated\
    \ within 60 to\n80 m across the ﬁeld [77]. In summary, soil texture inﬂuences\
    \ variability in water availability and crop\nyield, and hence should be considered\
    \ in VRI planning and implementation [78].\n3.2.2. Soil Organic Matter (SOM)\n\
    The role of SOM in VRI lies in its inﬂuence on water-holding capacity because\
    \ the afﬁnity SOM has\nfor water [74]. SOM has a positive inﬂuence on yield, and\
    \ the inﬂuence is more prominent in soils with\nlow organic matter content [60].\
    \ SOM distribution in the ﬁeld is variable depending upon topography\nand other\
    \ soil properties. Accumulation of SOM often occurs at the bottom of slopes, possibly\
    \ due to\nthe run-off of organic matter from higher areas and increased plant\
    \ growth at low-lying wet areas of the\nﬁeld [60,61]. SOM generally increases\
    \ with increasing clay content. The organic matter in ﬁne-textured\nsoils such\
    \ as clay can be two to four times that of coarse-textured sandy soils under similar\
    \ climatic\nconditions, which in turn, can inﬂuence soil water holding capacity\
    \ [79]. Therefore, understanding the\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n7 of 21\norganic matter\
    \ distribution in the ﬁeld can help in estimation of irrigation requirements for\
    \ the ﬁeld\nand hence should be incorporated in developing site-speciﬁc water\
    \ management.\n3.2.3. Soil Biological Properties\nMost site-speciﬁc studies did\
    \ not consider spatial variability of soil organisms, but recent studies\nhave\
    \ shown that the spatial distribution of soil organisms inﬂuence plant growth\
    \ and possibly yield [80].\nSpatial and temporal distribution of microorganisms\
    \ at the landscape scale is complicated by the\ninteractions among topography,\
    \ soil type and distribution of water in the ﬁeld [81]. The management\nactivity\
    \ in the ﬁeld can inﬂuence the distribution of soil biological components and\
    \ this, in turn,\naffects the efﬁciency of agricultural management [82]. The soil\
    \ has the greatest microbial diversity\namong all ecosystems that support soil\
    \ conditioning and plant growth [83]. A study conducted in\nFrance [84] showed\
    \ that microbial indicators expressed a high spatial heterogeneity at the ﬁeld\
    \ level,\nwhich masked the effects of several soil and crop management treatments.\
    \ The results also showed\nthat the spatial variability due to biological variables\
    \ was similar in magnitude as compared to that\nexhibited by physicochemical parameters,\
    \ which indicated the feasibility of site-speciﬁc management\nof biological variability\
    \ in the ﬁeld using management zones. Such site-speciﬁc management can be\neffective\
    \ since organisms such as earthworms, protozoa, nematodes, bacteria, fungi, and\
    \ different\narthropods play a vital role in soil fertility and productivity [71].\n\
    3.2.4. Apparent Soil Electrical Conductivity (ECa)\nObtaining accurate information\
    \ about the spatial and temporal variability of SWC and irrigation\nrequirements\
    \ is one of the important challenges in site-speciﬁc water management.\nECa is\
    \ a\nmeasurement of ﬁeld variability that can be applied to precise water management\
    \ because it is\neasy to measure and facilitates the spatial understanding of\
    \ the soil-water-plant relationship [85].\nECa is a function of several soil properties,\
    \ such as soil salinity, texture, bulk density, ion concentration,\ntype and amount\
    \ of clay, topsoil thickness, and water content [86]. The effect of ECa on crop\
    \ yield is\nthrough its relation to soil properties, which depends on climate,\
    \ crop type and other speciﬁc ﬁeld\nconditions [87]. In general, high ECa is associated\
    \ with high clay content in the soil [88]. For example,\na study conducted near\
    \ Lamesa, Texas, showed that in four of the six sites, shallow ECa measured\n\
    with a Veris mapping system was positively correlated with clay content. Clay\
    \ content was negatively\nrelated to shallow ECa at one site due to the low bulk\
    \ density of the calcic horizon [89]. Most of the\nresearch conducted did not\
    \ consider the spatial correlation of soil characteristics when evaluating\ntheir\
    \ distributions. However, spatial autocorrelation of soil properties can be more\
    \ important than\nsoil properties themselves in explaining ECa. Therefore, future\
    \ studies need to incorporate the\nspatial correlation of soil characteristics\
    \ in evaluating the impact of ECa on crop yield [90]. ECa has\nthe potential to\
    \ differentiate between soils when the soils have enough water content and can\n\
    be used as an indicator of SWC. In general, areas with high ECa are associated\
    \ with high water\ncontent [91]. Several studies have shown a higher correlation\
    \ of crop growth characteristics and yield\nwith ECa [92,93]. A study showed that\
    \ ECa in combination with topographic attributes and bare soil\nbrightness could\
    \ explain up to 70.1% of the variability in cotton yield [56]. Hence, understanding\
    \ the\nspatial and temporal variability of ECa provides information for site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation management\nfor optimized yield.\nThe association between crop yield\
    \ and soil physical and chemical properties and landscape\nprocesses provide opportunities\
    \ to improve water management at the landscape scale [61].\nSoil properties and\
    \ topography inﬂuence crop yield from microscales to watershed scales and the\n\
    magnitude of complexity increases with the scale due to an increase in soil and\
    \ topographical variability,\nas well as variability in rainfall, temperature\
    \ and other climatic factors [60]. A study showed lower\ncorn grain and stover\
    \ yield in depositional and ﬂat areas which retained water for longer periods,\n\
    and high yield at well-drained summit positions [94]. In the same research for\
    \ alfalfa and poplar,\nthe results showed higher productivity at a site with a\
    \ relatively steep slope and potentially erosive\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n8 of 21\n\
    soils. This relationship was attributed to the above-normal rainfall in both years\
    \ of study. In a six-year\nstudy to understand corn yield in relation to terrain\
    \ attributes, two years with more than normal\nprecipitation showed a positive\
    \ correlation between yield and slope. For the other four years, yield was\nnegatively\
    \ correlated with slope [55]. Crop yield in relation to soil properties and topography\
    \ depends\non different soil management and climate conditions. The correlation\
    \ was found to be stronger for\ndry years in degraded soils and attributed to\
    \ differences in water availability. This suggests that\nvariable-rate irrigation\
    \ strategies might require adjustments in different crop seasons with different\n\
    climatic and management conditions and hence more researches on VRI are needed\
    \ [95].\n4. Crop and Soil Monitoring for Precision Water Management\nWater requirement\
    \ varies with the crop and crop growth and development status, soil water status,\n\
    as well as environmental conditions. Closely monitoring soil water status, crop\
    \ growth conditions and\ntheir spatial and temporal patterns can aid in irrigation\
    \ scheduling and precise water management.\nAmong many tools, remote sensing can\
    \ serve an effective basis by providing images with spatial\nand temporal variability\
    \ of crop growth parameters and soil moisture status for input in precision\n\
    water management.\n4.1. Crop Coefﬁcient and ET\nVRI aims at increasing WUE and\
    \ stabilizing yield, which can be improved by scheduling\nthe irrigation of crops\
    \ using physical and agronomic principles in irrigation management strategy.\n\
    WUE (kg/m3) can be expressed as the ratio of the amount of target product of the\
    \ crop to the amount\nof water applied to produce that output. The amount of water\
    \ used for crop production is the amount\nrequired to overcome the water lost\
    \ by ET from plant and soil surface, and it varies spatiotemporally\naccording\
    \ to weather and vegetation cover conditions [96,97]. Climatological parameters\
    \ such as\nsolar radiation, air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, and crop\
    \ and soil water characteristics,\nincluding management and environmental aspects,\
    \ are important parameters inﬂuencing ET in\nagricultural ﬁelds. Since ET is difﬁcult\
    \ to measure, reference ET from a hypothetical grass reference\nsurface is commonly\
    \ calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith equation based on meteorological\n\
    parameters [98]. The equation is expressed as follows,\nET0 = [0.408 ∆ (Rn − G)\
    \ + γ {900/(T + 273)} u2 (es − ea)]/[∆ + γ (1 + 0.34 u2)]\nwhere, ET0—Reference\
    \ evapotranspiration [mm day−1], Rn—Net radiation at the crop surface [MJ\nm−2\
    \ day−1], G—Soil heat ﬂux density [MJ m−2 day−1], T—Air temperature at 2 m height\
    \ [◦C],\nu2—Wind speed at 2 m height [m s−1], es—Saturation vapor pressure [kPa],\
    \ ea—Actual vapor pressure\n[kPa], es—ea saturation vapor pressure deﬁcit [kPa],\
    \ D—Slope vapor pressure curve [kPa ◦C−1],\nγ—Psychrometric constant [kPa ◦C−1].\n\
    Crop-speciﬁc evapotranspiration needs are calculated based on crop coefﬁcients\
    \ (Kc). By using\nthe FAO Penman-Monteith deﬁnition for ET0, crop coefﬁcients\
    \ at research sites could be calculated by\nrelating the measured crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) with the calculated ET0, i.e., Kc = ET/ET0. The crop\ncoefﬁcient differs\
    \ widely between crops and among growth stages for the same crop. This Kc factor\n\
    serves as an aggregation of the physical and physiological differences among crops\
    \ and averaged\neffects of evaporation from the soil [98]. Several spatial models\
    \ have been developed for ET estimation,\nwhich showed that accurate spatial ET\
    \ and water-balance models could be of great importance in VRI\napplication [61,99,100].\n\
    4.2. Remote and Proximal Sensing\nBesides crop coefﬁcient and ET, mapping soil\
    \ properties in a ﬁeld, such as ﬁeld capacity and\nroot zone water availability,\
    \ is also important for site-speciﬁc water management [101]. Information\nregarding\
    \ variability of plant conditions such as water stress, growth parameters, ground\
    \ cover can also\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n9 of 21\nprovide a basis for VRI. Remote\
    \ sensing using various sensors and platforms is often used to estimate\nseveral\
    \ soil and crop characteristics during the growing season that can provide important\
    \ information\nin decision support. The near-real-time information from several\
    \ sensors, such as spectral reﬂectance\nsensors and infrared thermometers have\
    \ been used to develop ﬁeld maps for water, vegetation,\nand nutrient status [50,102].\
    \ Remotely sensed images can be useful in determining leaf area index and\nground\
    \ cover for a ﬁeld and thus help in yield forecasting [103]. Remote sensing can\
    \ also help estimate\nET more reliably from individual ﬁelds [104]. A study in\
    \ Nebraska evaluated remote-sensing-based\nET and a water-balance model for irrigation\
    \ management [105]. In this study, four irrigation treatment\ncombinations were\
    \ tested: VRI based on water-balance model using remote sensing, VRI based on\n\
    water-balance model using neutron probe, uniform irrigation based on neutron-probe\
    \ measurement\nand rainfed. Landsat 7 and 8 imageries were used for model input\
    \ in a remote sensing-based\nmodel, which included reﬂectance-based crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for ET estimation. The result showed\nthat remote sensing-based treatment had\
    \ the greatest mean prescribed irrigation, which was attributed\nto water-balance\
    \ drift. The study concluded that the remote-sensing-based model might perform\n\
    better when coupled with SWC measurement. This can be helpful in site-speciﬁc\
    \ management of\nirrigation water, as well as weedicide, pesticide and other chemicals\
    \ [106–108]. Various indices\nderived from thermal and multispectral images, such\
    \ as crop water stress index (CWSI), perpendicular\nvegetation index (PVI), normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NDVI) and photochemical reﬂectance\nindex (PRI),\
    \ can predict soil or plant water status and drought stress as a basis for site-speciﬁc\
    \ water\nmanagement [109,110]. Use of digital infrared thermography to measure\
    \ canopy temperature can\nhelp producers to detect early crop water stress and\
    \ avoid yield declines as well as saving water\nwith site-speciﬁc irrigation management\
    \ and irrigation scheduling [111,112]. Recent improvements in\nremote and proximal\
    \ sensing technologies such as wireless soil moisture sensors and unmanned aerial\n\
    systems (UAS) have increased the efﬁciency for farmers to exercise site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation management.\nIndices derived from high-resolution UAS imagery have\
    \ shown the potential to predict crop water\nstress indicators such as water potential\
    \ and stomatal conductance [113]. Such information can aid in\nimproving irrigation\
    \ efﬁciency, reducing pumping costs, and retaining groundwater. Although soil\n\
    moisture sensors are found to be more proﬁtable in the present context, with the\
    \ increasing number\nof manufacturers and clear regulations, UAS-based sensor\
    \ technology for soil moisture estimation\nis gaining momentum [114]. This explains\
    \ the importance of remote sensing as a low-cost tool to\nimprove water management\
    \ in crops.\n5. Precision Water Management Strategies\nSeveral precision irrigation\
    \ technologies have been developed to improve crop productivity under\nwater-limited\
    \ conditions. However, appropriate precision irrigation strategies are equally\
    \ important for\nincreased efﬁciency and proﬁtability for site-speciﬁc technologies.\
    \ The development and application\nof management zones using spatial and temporal\
    \ information of various agronomic factors have\nbeen practiced for site-speciﬁc\
    \ management for several decades. In recent years, the use of artiﬁcial\nintelligence\
    \ in prescription map development for site-speciﬁc water management is also increasing.\n\
    5.1. Management Zones\nVRI is often implemented in the ﬁeld by dividing it into\
    \ a number of sections, or management\nzones with the aim to save water and other\
    \ inputs together with yield optimization [25]. A management\nzone is a subﬁeld\
    \ area that is relatively homogeneous in soil and topographic attributes. The\
    \ use of\nmanagement zones can be a convenient means to capture the spatial distribution\
    \ of yield-inﬂuencing\nfactors within the season. The information on spatial and\
    \ temporal development of abiotic and\nbiotic stresses can be linked with site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation systems via dynamic prescription maps\nto help producers improve\
    \ irrigation WUE, agricultural sustainability and the environment [102].\nVarious\
    \ factors such as soil properties, landscape attributes, crop properties, sensor-based\
    \ information,\nmanagement practice, weed, and pest management as well as crop\
    \ modeling have been considered\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n10 of 21\nin delineating\
    \ management zones for VRI application since several years [115]. Soil properties\
    \ such\nas soil organic matter, texture, nutrient content, pH, color, soil moisture\
    \ content and water-holding\ncapacities, ECa, etc. have been used effectively\
    \ in management zone delineation [116–119]. Landscape\nattributes such as elevation,\
    \ slope, aspect, curvature, and others have also been an important part\nof management\
    \ zone delineation in several studies [118,120–122]. Numerous studies have used\
    \ crop\nproperties such as yield maps and ground-based leaf area index to delineate\
    \ management zones\nfor VRI application [116,117,123,124]. The management zones\
    \ delineated based on yield data from\nmultiple years can effectively capture\
    \ nutrient variability in the ﬁeld [125]. However, the application of\nyield maps\
    \ for site-speciﬁc management can be challenging because spatial and temporal\
    \ variation in\nyield is affected by the interactions among several biotic and\
    \ abiotic factors [126,127]. Information from\nproximal and remote sensing such\
    \ as satellite and airborne imagery, normalized difference vegetation\nindex,\
    \ digital photography, etc. can be a powerful approach for delineation of relative\
    \ productive\nareas [128–131]. The zone information together with early season\
    \ environmental indicators and\ncrop response models can also be used to determine\
    \ the action decisions throughout the season [132].\nSimilarly, the selection\
    \ of factors for management zone delineation is equally important in management\n\
    zone delineation. A study was conducted to compare the site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ with conventional\nuniform irrigation management for potatoes in Idaho [25].\
    \ The available water-holding capacity of soil\nwas used to delineate a 2.9-ha\
    \ ﬁeld into nine management zones. The results showed that six out of\nnine management\
    \ zones produced a higher yield with site-speciﬁc management. However, the study\n\
    suggested that management zones were only based on available SWC and in some management\
    \ cases,\nother non-measured factors unrelated to soil texture or available water\
    \ content could have an impact\non the yield of crops. The study pointed out the\
    \ importance to take into consideration all the known\nfactors affecting yield\
    \ and include them in delineating irrigation management zones for site-speciﬁc\n\
    irrigation management. The optimum number of zones for a ﬁeld depends on the scale\
    \ of the ﬁeld,\neconomical and logistical practicality, and agronomic response\
    \ to irrigation amounts. For example,\nthe quantity and placement of soil moisture\
    \ sensors for determining irrigation amounts may vary\nwith ﬁeld size, cost of\
    \ the sensors and manageability, which, in turn, can inﬂuence the number of\n\
    management zones in the ﬁeld [133].\nThere are several methods to delineate management\
    \ zones, including unsupervised clustering,\nsupervised clustering, user-deﬁned\
    \ thresholds, etc. The clustering technique groups similar data\npoints into different\
    \ classes using algorithms such as k-means, fuzzy k-means, fuzzy c-means [127,134],\n\
    Ward′s method, and Jenk’s optimization procedure [125]. The appropriate factors\
    \ to be considered for\nmanagement zone delineation could be prioritized using\
    \ several methods such as principal component\nanalysis (PCA) [118]. It is equally\
    \ important to determine the number of optimum management\nzones for the ﬁeld\
    \ and their production and economic justiﬁcation [20]. A software program (MZA\n\
    software [135]) was developed for creating management zones using the fuzzy k-means\
    \ method.\nThis program determines the appropriate number of zones for a ﬁeld\
    \ by evaluating the clustering\nresults. Many studies have used management zones\
    \ for VRI and other site-speciﬁc crop management.\nFor example, a study conducted\
    \ in a 4.8-ha ﬁeld in Colorado assessed the effectiveness of ECa in\ncharacterizing\
    \ the spatial distribution of soil water [136]. This study found that SWC was\
    \ signiﬁcantly\ndifferent among different ECa derived management zones using MZA\
    \ software. This justiﬁes the\nimportance of characterizing management zones for\
    \ site-speciﬁc water management.\n5.2. Development of Site-Speciﬁc Water Management\
    \ Strategies\nTo enable the VRI technology in practice, the irrigation management\
    \ strategy is equally important.\nThe use of technology in the ﬁeld may not always\
    \ be effective in terms of ﬁnal yield or proﬁtability.\nFor example, research\
    \ has shown that the use of VRI technology may not be cost effective where\nthere\
    \ is high rainfall throughout the growing season [29]. Several strategies could\
    \ be applied to\nsave water and energy in the ﬁeld to gain yield beneﬁts in the\
    \ ﬁeld. Some of the strategies include\nskipping irritation in non-cropped areas,\
    \ planting different crops in the same ﬁeld, rainfall harvesting\nAgronomy 2019,\
    \ 9, 87\n11 of 21\nin areas with high water-holding capacity, and lowering irrigation\
    \ to areas with low water use (ET) [46].\nNew irrigation strategies such as modifying\
    \ the current irrigation system for site-speciﬁc water and\nchemical applications\
    \ are required to sustain modern irrigated agricultural cropping systems [102].\n\
    Management strategies including placement and timing are crucial in optimizing\
    \ irrigation\nthroughout the growing season. About 9%−19% of irrigation water\
    \ savings were achieved with VRI\ncompared to the uniform application in a research\
    \ conducted in variable soil, which was possible\nwith several strategies such\
    \ as withholding irrigation during speciﬁc growth stages and in particular,\n\
    non-cropped areas of the ﬁeld [137]. Further, the study suggests that areas where\
    \ the optimized or\nincreased irrigation does not produce an increase in yield,\
    \ less water can be applied while the areas\nwith high yield potential can be\
    \ applied optimum irrigation and gain higher returns. A study showed\nthat restricting\
    \ irrigation during the peak water-demand time of cotton (80−100 days after planting)\n\
    from 100% to 60% of potential ET conserves 2.6 inches of water [138]. The VRI\
    \ trial was conducted\nin three farms in New Zealand to compare the VRI to uniform\
    \ rate irrigation (URI) [139]. The URI\ntreatments were provided with the same\
    \ level of irrigation at the same time as the most drought-prone\nsoil zone, but\
    \ VRI treatment was achieved by either delaying the irrigation or reducing the\
    \ amount\nand intensity of irrigation comparing to that with a drought-prone area.\
    \ The results showed that there\nwas a two to three-fold difference in total available\
    \ water-holding capacity at each site, which justiﬁed\nthe decision to use VRI\
    \ systems. Although the study found no signiﬁcant impact of VRI on crop yield,\n\
    water savings of 8 to 36% were achieved in three sites with less drainage. Hence,\
    \ critical management\nstrategies adopted in a decision support system that uses\
    \ real-time monitoring and feedback to\nirrigation control make water conversation\
    \ possible [28]. Deﬁcit irrigation (DI) is a complementary\nmethod that uses irrigation\
    \ scheduling at strategic times of less critical growth for irrigation water\n\
    conservation. In this method, irrigation is applied during the drought-sensitive\
    \ growth stages of a\ncrop. During less drought-sensitive stages, irrigation is\
    \ applied based on rainfall and availability of\nwater for maintenance [140].\n\
    The use of technology and strategies can also affect the level of proﬁt achieved\
    \ from the VRI\ntechnology itself. A study was conducted in a 20-ha wheat ﬁeld\
    \ in Southern Alberta, Canada on\nmodeling economic returns at different levels\
    \ of control [141]. A total of 62 management scenarios\nwere studied, including\
    \ (1) no irrigation, (2) uniform irrigation management, (3) speed control with\n\
    two angular increments of 2 and 10 degrees, and (4) zone control with a combination\
    \ of two angular\nincrements and a different number of independent irrigation\
    \ zones, ranging from 2 to 30. The study\nconcluded that the highest proﬁt was\
    \ obtained with 30 control zones. However, considering the cost\nof the technology,\
    \ the case of ten control zones along the central pivot system was found to be\
    \ the\nmost proﬁtable. Hence, it is essential to set forth effective site-speciﬁc\
    \ water management strategies for\nincreased agricultural sustainability and proﬁtability.\n\
    5.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Deep Learning\nExisting site-speciﬁc management\
    \ utilizes several control strategies such mathematical modeling\nof crop yield\
    \ or the plant-soil-atmosphere environment, optimizing irrigation application\
    \ timing,\nlearning sensor feedback to control the site-speciﬁc ﬂow of water as\
    \ well as using predictive model\ncontrol that executes a model repeatedly to\
    \ determine optimum input. The use of artiﬁcial intelligence\nor neuro-dynamic\
    \ programming that integrates machine learning to determine the water application\n\
    parameter for optimized irrigation is also increasing [50,142–145]. Hyperspectral\
    \ remote sensing\nimaging along with machine learning has been in use in agricultural\
    \ industry, and it is estimated that\nmachine learning/deep learning-based classiﬁcation\
    \ has a signiﬁcant potential for high-dimensional\nbig data produced in agriculture\
    \ [146].\n6. Impact of Variable-Rate Irrigation\nVRI can be highly effective in\
    \ reducing water use and increasing water use efﬁciency (WUE) of\ncrops [147].\
    \ A review on VRI across different crop and weather regimes of the world concluded\
    \ that\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n12 of 21\nVRI could save 10%−15% of water [28].\
    \ A study in a 7-ha sugar beet ﬁeld in Germany reported that\n13% of water was\
    \ saved compared to the uniform application [15]. This was achieved by utilizing\n\
    stored soil moisture and in-season precipitation. In a study in New Zealand comparing\
    \ VRI with\nconventional irrigation system, 9%−19% irrigation water was saved\
    \ with VRI in pasture and corn\nﬁelds, which in turn reduced nitrogen leaching\
    \ [137]. Similarly, the application of VRI by manipulating\nits several components\
    \ can reduce water runoff by avoiding excess water application in the ﬁeld [28].\n\
    At a large scale, water pumpage and use can be reduced by adopting VRI. A geospatial\
    \ method has\nbeen provided for potential VRI technology adopters to achieve potential\
    \ water savings in the ﬁeld\nusing freely available datasets such as soil survey\
    \ data from the Natural Resources Conservation\nService (NRCS) [48]. In this study,\
    \ the difference in application depth between conventional irrigation\nand VRI\
    \ was estimated based on root zone available water capacity. The undepleted soil\
    \ water from\neach management zone was mined using prescription maps allowing\
    \ 50% depletion. VRI in this\nstudy resulted in a reduction in irrigation depth\
    \ of up to 18 mm, pumping reductions, and improved\nwater distribution throughout\
    \ the ﬁeld. In addition, higher VRI control resolution increased energy\nsavings.\
    \ VRI was found to reduce pumpage in more than 13% of center pivot irrigated ﬁelds\
    \ by 25 mm\nper year compared to the conventional irrigation system in Nebraska\
    \ [99]. Another study for VRI\nmanagement based on soil water spatial variation\
    \ was conducted in a 1.64-ha ﬁeld with center pivot to\nunderstand the yield and\
    \ water-saving effects of VRI [148]. In this study, the ﬁeld was divided into\
    \ four\nmanagement zones based on available water-holding capacity and each management\
    \ zone was further\ndivided into two sections for VRI and URI management. The\
    \ results from this study indicated that the\nimpact of VRI on water savings within\
    \ zones depended on weather conditions. Water savings with\nVRI management was\
    \ higher for summer maize when the rainfall was high compared to winter wheat\n\
    grown in no-rainfall weather. The study suggests that although VRI management\
    \ had no signiﬁcant\ninﬂuence on crop growth parameters and yield within a management\
    \ zone, managing the zones with\ndifferent available water-holding capacity might\
    \ improve the uniformity of crop growth, maximize\ncrop yield and gain potential\
    \ water savings.\nCompared to the uniform application, VRI increases crop productivity.\
    \ The results comparing\nthe water productivity of sorghum and corn showed that\
    \ there was more than 20% increase in water\nproductivity for both crops using\
    \ VRI [35]. Another study conducted in a 4-ha ﬁeld, VRI resulted in\na signiﬁcant\
    \ difference in corn yield in a dry year. However, the results were not signiﬁcant\
    \ for the\nyear when the rain was sufﬁcient [100]. Another study was conducted\
    \ in New Zealand to understand\nthe impact of variable-rate irrigation based on\
    \ soil moisture status [139]. This study showed that\nalthough the yield was not\
    \ signiﬁcantly different among different irrigation treatments, water savings\n\
    of 27–55 mm was achieved by limiting irrigation in soil with adequate plant available\
    \ water and\nnon-irrigating poorly drained, wet soil zones. VRI has been found\
    \ effective to reduce water and\nenergy use even in humid areas of the world with\
    \ uncertain and unpredictable rainfall [40]. This study\nshowed that potential\
    \ water savings of 20mm/year could be achieved using VRI in these regions.\nHowever,\
    \ the feasibility and effectiveness of VRI depend on the magnitude of the ﬁeld,\
    \ crop under\nconsideration, weather and the underlying ﬁeld properties [24,25,40].\
    \ The accurate determination of\nwater requirement and its management is crucial\
    \ for crop yield stabilization and improved average\nyield [53]. Several VRI research\
    \ projects attempt to enhance the control scenarios as well as model and\nproduction\
    \ function to improve water savings and reduce pumpage [40,99,141,149,150]. Further,\
    \ it is\nnecessary to understand the impact of soil water availability on crop\
    \ growth to manage irrigation in\nspatial and temporal scales using variable-rate\
    \ irrigation technologies and appropriate strategies.\n7. Challenges and Research\
    \ Requirements\nData collection and management tools, such as yield monitors,\
    \ sensors and sensing systems,\nGIS, GNSS, and decision support systems are available\
    \ today to enable site-speciﬁc management of\nirrigation water for optimized crop\
    \ production. Steady development in irrigation control systems\nprovides the user\
    \ with various options to implement VRI. Many studies have investigated and\n\
    Agronomy 2019, 9, 87\n13 of 21\ndeveloped irrigation strategies, prescription\
    \ methodologies, and proﬁtability optimization involved in\nVRI. However, there\
    \ are some challenges in the implementation and application of this technology.\n\
    Further research and development are required to improve the understanding, implementation,\n\
    and adoption of precision water management strategies and technologies.\n(1)\n\
    Research is required on the integration of technology, agronomy, and proﬁtability\
    \ with VRI\nAlthough several studies have reported the potential of adopting VRI\
    \ system to optimize crop\nproduction and proﬁtability [29,70], some studies conducted\
    \ in experimental ﬁelds have concluded\nthat the VRI technology may not be economically\
    \ viable for all crops under all growing conditions\nand environments [24]. This\
    \ is not because of the yield-related beneﬁt, but due to the cost of the\ntechnology\
    \ itself. For example, research conducted in a 12.6-ha ﬁeld in southwest Georgia\
    \ showed that\nVRI generated $16/ha more return than URI. Although this return\
    \ is not signiﬁcant for this small ﬁeld,\nthe study suggested that proﬁts could\
    \ be ampliﬁed for large ﬁelds and beneﬁt farmers [151]. From the\nagronomic perspective,\
    \ a better understanding of the extremities of ﬁeld variability and how it affects\n\
    crop yield is needed for the effective implementation of new technologies [152].\
    \ In an experiment\nconducted in Tennessee, the same level of irrigation did not\
    \ result in the same cotton lint yield in all\nparts of the ﬁeld due to differences\
    \ in texture and available water-holding capacity [153]. In some cases,\nthe incorporation\
    \ of other crops in a rotation in VRI can make this technology economically viable\
    \ [25].\nAdditionally, most of the VRI studies are concentrated on the control\
    \ scenarios of VRI [149,150].\nAlthough a few studies [40,99,141] determined water\
    \ and energy savings using VRI due to managerial\nlimitations, they were either\
    \ based on some model and production functions or arbitrary in irrigation\nrate\
    \ determination. Hence, there is a need for a comprehensive study on VRI integrating\
    \ the agronomic,\ntechnical and managerial aspects of VRI to determine its proﬁtability,\
    \ sustainability, and adoptability\nfor various conditions.\n(2)\nOn-farm and\
    \ whole-ﬁeld research\nProducers are more likely to adopt VRI if the beneﬁts are\
    \ shown on a “real farm.” Most of the\nprevious studies on VRI were conducted\
    \ in experimental ﬁelds or in small ﬁelds that cannot represent\nthe commercial\
    \ farming practice [28]. Experimental design and implementation in large ﬁelds\
    \ are\nchallenging. This type of research requires close communication and collaborative\
    \ management\nbetween the researcher and the farm owner to ensure the alignment\
    \ of management practices and study\ngoals. Acquiring data and information from\
    \ large ﬁelds is costly and time-consuming. In addition,\nthe statistical analysis\
    \ of on-farm data is challenging due to the lack of adequate tools that integrates\n\
    classical statistical methods and spatial analysis. This creates challenges in\
    \ the understanding of the\nrelationship between crop growth and its environment\
    \ in site-speciﬁc irrigation. More on-farm studies\nare needed to provide information\
    \ for practical VRI applications. In addition, insufﬁcient recognition\nof temporal\
    \ variation and environmental impact are several other factors that hinder the\
    \ adoption of\nprecision agriculture technology [9].\n(3)\nPrescription map development\n\
    The majority of previous studies for prescription maps (management zone delineation)\
    \ are for\nvariable-rate application of fertilizers and seeds and are static [20,133].\
    \ Limited research has addressed\nthe need for dynamic prescription map development\
    \ that could incorporate seasonal changes in\ncrop growth and conditions [133].\
    \ More research is required to evaluate VRI prescription maps or\nmanagement zone\
    \ development integrating different soil and crop characteristics under different\n\
    environments. Use of remote and proximal sensing such as infrared sensors, near-infrared\
    \ and thermal\nimages, along with weather data can provide information on crop,\
    \ soil, and environmental conditions\nin irrigation scheduling and developing\
    \ dynamic prescription maps [97]. Further research needs to\ninvestigate how to\
    \ integrate such data and information to evaluate the effectiveness of such prescription\n\
    maps during the growing season.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n14 of 21\n(4)\nOptimal\
    \ spatial and temporal scale\nFew studies have evaluated the appropriate spatial\
    \ and temporal scales for VRI application.\nMany studies have explored the use\
    \ of sensors in acquiring information for modeling crop\nevapotranspiration, SWC,\
    \ irrigation needs including the nutrient requirements [97,105,152,154,155].\n\
    Most of these studies indicated the high potential of remote and proximal sensing\
    \ technologies in\nunderstanding spatial and temporal variations in crop growth\
    \ conditions in the ﬁeld. Temporal\nvariability in soil water status and crop\
    \ growing conditions require dynamic adjustment of irrigation\namount and spatial\
    \ distribution. Therefore, simulation models or on-farm studies might be considered\n\
    to assess the effectiveness of VRI at different spatial and temporal scales.\n\
    (5)\nComprehensive decision support tools\nPrecision irrigation management requires\
    \ data and information from crop growth conditions,\nsoil physical and chemical\
    \ properties, weather factors, and the interaction among these factors.\nEffective\
    \ implementation of precision irrigation requires a comprehensive decision support\
    \ system to\nprocess and integrate different layers of data and information [48].\
    \ The challenge for the application\nof VRI still exists in the lack of user-friendly\
    \ decision support tools such as for developing dynamic\nprescription maps [105].\
    \ Several decision support systems such as AgriDSS are available [16,156],\nbut\
    \ producers are reluctant to use them to their full potential due to their complexity.\
    \ Also, these tools\nare based on what scientists and developers consider as necessary\
    \ knowledge that should be\nimplemented in the decision support system. However,\
    \ in a real-world situation, they fail to utilize\nthe implicit knowledge of farmers\
    \ and address their needs. The complexity, lack of observability and\nconﬁdence,\
    \ poor user interface design, lack of incentive to learn are some of the other\
    \ reasons behind\nthe hindrance of adoption of different decision support tools\
    \ [16]. The system or tool should help the\nuser decide where to apply how much\
    \ irrigation water at various crop growth stages to achieve the\nhighest proﬁt\
    \ based on the regional climate conditions and cropping systems.\n(6)\nIntegrating\
    \ VRI with other inputs\nFew studies have integrated variable-rate application\
    \ of nutrients with water. Crop yield response\nto water and N are not the same\
    \ at different parts of the ﬁeld [157], indicating the need for studying\nthe\
    \ interaction of water and fertilizer in variable-rate irrigation. Site-speciﬁc\
    \ application of N together\nwith irrigation using remote sensing can help reduce\
    \ N inputs by 50% and leaching by 85% without\nreducing yields [155]. Further\
    \ studies are needed to investigate the interaction between VRI fertilizers\n\
    and other inputs to improve the efﬁciencies of water and fertilizers while reducing\
    \ the environmental\nimpact of fertilizer application and enhancing production\
    \ sustainability.\nAuthor Contributions: The authors contributed equally to the\

    • Up to 40% of soil available water content variance was explained by pie shape
    zoning. • Dynamic zoning strategy may be needed if soil spatial arrangement varies
    by depth. • Soil ECa and satellite images were useful attributes for irrigation
    zone delineation. Abstract This study aimed at investigating the performance of
    multiple irrigation zoning scenarios on a 73 ha irrigated field located in west
    Tennessee along the Mississippi river. Different clustering methods, including
    k-means, ISODATA and Gaussian Mixture, were selected. In addition, a new zoning
    method, based on integer linear programming, was designed and evaluated for center
    pivot irrigation systems with limited speed control capability. The soil available
    water content was used as the main attribute for zoning while soil apparent electrical
    conductivity (ECa), space-borne satellite images and yield data were required
    as ancillary data. A good agreement was observed among delineated zones by different
    clustering methods. The new zoning method explained up to 40% of available water
    content variance underneath center pivot irrigation systems. The ECa achieved
    the highest Kappa coefficient (=0.79) among ancillary attributes, hence exhibited
    a considerable potential for irrigation zoning. Previous article in issue Next

    farming and management zone delineation In conventional agriculture each field
    is considered as a uniform unit, by purposely ignoring the heterogeneity across
    the field, thereby decision-making is based on an estimation of average conditions.
    The motivation for site-specific farming was first addressed by researchers during
    the late 80s and early 90s (Arslan and Colvin, 2002). As such, precision agriculture
    (PA) methodology is a way to look at field management by taking the within field
    variation into account and incorporating that variability into management decisions.
    Within-field heterogeneity is caused by both temporal and spatial variation of
    a variety of factors such as climate, topography and biologic activity (Córdoba
    et al., 2013). A management zone (MZ) is a sub-region of a field that is relatively
    homogeneous with respect to soil-landscape attributes. It is expected that variable
    rate application across MZs will help by saving the resources and optimizing yield
    (Schepers et al., 2004). Protecting the environment and keeping agriculture sustainable
    may also be achievable through precision farming. Sensor-based and map-based approaches
    are two major methods to practice variable-rate application. In the sensor-based
    method, a real time decision on application rate is made using data collected
    via sensors and a pre-developed application algorithms. In the map-based method,
    application maps are prepared using site-specific information such as yield data
    and soil data prior to implementation. It is critical to select appropriate attribute(s)
    and method to delineate robust zones (Thöle et al., 2013). A field can be zoned
    based on a single soil-crop variable or multiple attributes which are expected
    to affect yield (Khosla et al., 2010). Yield maps, topography, satellite photographs,
    canopy images and soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) are among suggested
    attributes to delineate MZs. Application of remote sensing is especially attractive
    because it is noninvasive and relatively inexpensive (Schepers et al., 2004).
    Yield maps are useful sources of information reflecting within-field variation.
    However, some difficulties have been reported to delineate zones solely by yield
    maps (Khosla et al., 2010). Temporal inconsistency among yield maps from year
    to year is probably the main reason causing this problem. Schepers et al. (2004)
    reported that temporal climate variability in an irrigated cornfield significantly
    affects yield spatial variability from year to year. Combining yield data with
    other ancillary information or averaging yield data over years can help explain
    spatial variation better and in turn can provide more trustable zones. Promising
    results have been reported by the studies that have utilized several years of
    yield data to create MZs. However, stability of such zones has to be tested for
    each individual field (Khosla et al., 2010). Calculating temporal variance can
    be helpful to verify zone stability (Basso et al., 2012). There are some methods
    to screen potential attributes regarding their importance. Hornung et al. (2006)
    suggested assigning different weights to individual layers based on their importance
    to the variation in crop yield. Principal component analysis (PCA) can be utilized
    to linearly transfer original variables to new independent ones. Researchers apply
    this technique to understand the characteristics of a data set along with relative
    importance of each individual variable (Fraisse et al., 2001). Finally, the most
    important principal components will be used to delineate MZs. There are several
    methods to delineate MZs. Applying unsupervised clustering techniques and zoning
    via user-defined thresholds are the main procedures. Clustering techniques group
    similar data points (cells), based on their inherent structure, into distinct
    classes. Methods such as k-means and fuzzy k-means have been widely used to identify
    MZs (Córdoba et al., 2013). These methods usually produce separated oval shape
    zones across a field. The software MZA was developed by Fridgen et al. (2004)
    for delineating MZs. The MZA uses fuzzy k-means for zoning and tests the result
    to evaluate how many zones to create in a given field. More recently, Zhang et
    al. (2010) developed a web-based decision support system for zoning using satellite
    imagery and field data. Moral et al. (2010) used regression kriging, PCA and fuzzy
    cluster classification to delineate MZs using soil texture information and electrical
    conductivity as ancillary data. Recently Cid-Garcia et al. (2013) proposed an
    integer linear programming MZ delineation method to make rectangular shaped zones
    which facilitates the work and operation of machinery. 1.2. Irrigation management
    zones delineation Water has become the most valuable input for agriculture across
    the world. There has been a significant conversion from rainfed to irrigated production
    in humid regions as a safe guard against unpredictable severe drought periods
    within a cropping season which can cause yield reduction in such regions. At the
    same time, agriculture is under a great pressure to enhance its water use efficiency
    as other sectors such as industry and urban areas are demanding more water (Evans
    et al., 2013, Daccache et al., 2015). When within field soil spatial variation
    is significant, variable rate irrigation (VRI) comes into play as an engineering
    solution to manage spatial allocation of applied water through irrigation. Evidence
    exists in literature showing VRI could enhance water use efficiency and/or yield.
    Hedley and Yule (2009) mentioned up to 26% annual water saving by VRI comparing
    to conventional uniform irrigation. King et al. (2006) reported 4% higher potato
    tuber yield (statistically not significant) under VRI in comparison to uniform
    irrigation. Precision irrigation center pivots have been commercially available
    for a while yet their adoption by farmers has been slow to develop. The prime
    drawbacks of VRI systems are high capital costs of implementation and management
    which is hard to rationalize considering energy and water saving at current price
    (Evans et al., 2013). Most of the available center pivots, however, have control
    panels with speed control module, meaning farmers can vary the irrigation across
    their fields to some extent at no extra cost, if it is needed. Changing the pivot
    travel speed enables putting some pie shape zones where speeding the system up
    provides less time to irrigation and slowing the system down increases the quantity
    of applied irrigation at the selected pies. There is a critical need to dynamically
    develop irrigation MZs in an accurate and inexpensive manner (Evans et al., 2013).
    Delineating zones for irrigation management is challenging. Soil physical and
    hydraulic properties govern plant available water and thereby directly affect
    irrigation scheduling. Unfortunately hydraulic properties of soil are not readily
    available at a field-scale to be used for delineating irrigation MZs. There is
    evidence in the literature that easily collected ancillary data may be spatially
    correlated to soil physical and hydraulic properties, thus be useful for irrigation
    zone delineation. In irrigation scheduling, plant available water is calculated
    within the effective root zone which expands to deeper soil layers as the cropping
    season progresses. If in depth soil variation is significant at the field-scale,
    theoretically, the spatial arrangement of irrigation MZs may change during the
    growing season. This is not, however, in agreement with the usual practice of
    static MZs sometimes for years. Given the limitation in number, size and location
    of speed control pie shape zones, an optimization procedure is needed to find
    the best combination of pies across a field. The objectives of this study were:
    (i) to evaluate the performance of some zoning algorithms on an irrigated field
    with significant spatial soil variation located in west Tennessee (ii), to investigate
    the usefulness of proximal data, including ECa and space-born satellite images,
    to delineate irrigation MZs, (iii) to analyze stability of irrigation MZs within
    growing season in respect to soil available water content, and (iv) to develop
    and evaluate an irrigation zoning method for center pivot systems with speed control
    capability using integer linear programing technique. 2. Material and methods
    2.1. Field of study An irrigated agriculture field, approximately 73 ha located
    in west Tennessee along the Mississippi river, was selected (Fig. 1). The field
    was located in a short season, semi-humid region with high rainfall potential
    during a cropping season but some dry periods when supplemental irrigation is
    used to fulfill the crop water requirement. There were two center pivot systems
    for irrigation covering majority of the field with some overlap in their coverage.
    Cotton was planted in 2012, 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons in that field. The
    spatial variation in soil physical and hydraulic properties was significant (Table
    1 and Fig. 2) which made this field a perfect case for the purpose of our study.

    full-size image Fig. 2. Soil texture distribution for the samples (n = 400) collected
    from the field of study. Soil sampling was done on March 21 and 22, 2014. A total
    of 400 undisturbed samples were collected from 100 sampling locations at 4 different
    depths, 0–25 cm, 25–50 cm, 50–75 cm and 75–100 cm. The soil texture components
    as well as soil bulk density and volumetric water content were measured in lab.
    The soil water retention curve for samples and high resolution soil available
    water content (AWC) maps were predicted using pseudo continuous pedotransfer function
    (Haghverdi et al., 2012, Haghverdi et al., 2014) and co-kriging. There was a decline
    in soil water holding capacity (i.e. water content at matric potential −33 kPa,
    θ33) by depth (Table 1) which is in agreement with the expansion of the sandy
    regions across the field moving from surface to deeper layers. 2.2. Proximal data
    It is appealing to delineate MZs by proximal data because they are low in cost,
    easy to collect and usually noninvasive. In this study soil ECa and space-borne
    satellite photos were considered as proximal information for zone delineation.
    The soil ECa measurements from shallow (i.e. ECS, 0–30 cm) and deep (i.e. ECD,
    0–90 cm) layers were collected (about 4700 data points covering the entire field)
    using a Veris 3100 (Veris Technologies, Salina, KS) instrument on March 20, 2014.
    The Veris machine measures ECa using the principles of electrical resistivity.
    A small electrical current is introduced into the soil and the drop in voltage
    in two depths is measured. The ECS data showed a normal distribution but ECD information
    were log transferred to have a roughly Gaussian distribution. Then, the ECS and
    ECD data were interpolated using kriging to cover the entire field (with 2 m spatial
    resolution) with the exception of a drainage pathway starting from west of the
    field and ending to the southeastern corner of the field. The satellite images
    were obtained from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor during 2013
    and 2014 (through http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). A total of 19 cloud-free images
    were selected for statistical analysis. The selected images contain the reflectance
    at multiple bands (i.e. quantized and calibrated scaled Digital Numbers (DN)).
    The reflectance of a canopy and bare soil will change during a cropping season
    as a plant goes through different growth stages and soil water status is changed.
    The band 8, panchromatic band, with wavelengths ranged from 0.50 to 0.68 μm for
    Landsat 8 has the highest spatial resolution (i.e. 15 m × 15 m spatial resolution)
    within available bands, thus was selected for this study. The field of study contained
    a total of 2320 cells. The cotton yield data were available from 2010 to 2012
    cropping seasons. First, the raw yield data were cleaned. Yield data that were
    greater or smaller than the mean ± 3 standard deviation were assumed to be outliers
    and removed from the analysis. Then, kriging was applied to interpolate yield
    data (with 2 m spatial resolution) across the field with the exception of the
    drainage path. Finally, the yield data were standardized for each year and averaged
    across years to make a single yield map. 2.3. Management zone delineation Multiple
    zoning strategies were applied and evaluated through two phases (Table 2). In
    phase one, the entire field was zoned. The ECa and reflectance data (i.e. DN)
    were tuned to have a range between 0 and 1 by dividing each cell value by the
    overall maximum values across the field from all data points/cells. The ECa data
    were chosen as the prime attribute for zoning because they showed a good correlation
    with soil physical and hydraulic properties of the soil within the field of study
    (Haghverdi, 2015). Three unsupervised clustering techniques, i.e. k-means, ISODATA-maximum
    likelihood and Gaussian mixtures, with different combination of ECa data were
    examined. Unsupervised clustering techniques group the data based on their inherent
    structure as opposed to supervised clustering methods which require a priori knowledge
    on data for training. More information on each clustering technique is provided
    later in this paper. Given the performance of the zoning strategies and distribution
    of the digital reflectance data, only k-means was applied for zoning using satellite
    images. Table 2. Summary of zoning algorithms and attributes. Empty Cell Clustering

    Available Water Content; ECS: shallow ECa; ECD: deep ECa. The within-season temporal
    stability of MZs was also investigated in phase one through a user-defined zoning
    strategy considering AWC as input. The effective root zone (0–100 cm) was defined
    as a depth in which crop absorbs most of its water requirement. To mimic the dynamic
    of effective root growth, four crop available water maps were created for 0–25,
    0–50, 0–75 and 0–100 cm. Each map, then, was divided into user-defined MZs and
    the spatial arrangement of zones were compared against each other. In phase two,
    we focused on the area underneath the center pivot irrigation systems for which
    we developed and evaluated a new zoning approach using integer linear programming
    (ILP). The yield data were also included to test how efficient this variable was
    in the zone delineation process. Most center pivot irrigators prefer to have less
    than 10 MZs in a field (Evans et al., 2013). Moreover, a majority of available
    center pivots in west Tennessee cannot put more than 10 pies. Therefore, clustering
    procedures were repeated to delineate from 2 to up to 10 MZs. Two software products
    were used for clustering: Matlab R2015a (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Mass.) and ArcGIS
    10.2.2 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, California). 2.3.1. K-means The k-means is one of
    the most widely used methods for clustering due to its simplicity and efficiency.
    The k-means, in an iterative process, tries to partition data into k groups so
    that the differences among the features in a group, over all groups, is minimized.
    It moves the observations between clusters and monitors the sum of distances from
    each observation to the center of its cluster until group membership stabilizes.
    The k-means++ algorithm was used to assign initial centers to the clusters. This
    algorithm chooses the cluster centers in a random manner yet favors spreading
    them out by a distance-based weighting process (Jain, 2010, Jain et al., 1999,
    ESRI, 2014). The Euclidean metric was used to obtain distances. No spatial constraint
    was considered. 2.3.2. ISODATA – Maximum likelihood A well-known extension of
    k-means is called Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA).
    The ISODATA starts with randomly assigning data into different classes. Then,
    over the course of an iterative process, the algorithm changes the membership
    of data points and tries to find the optimum clusters where the Euclidian distance
    between data points to cluster center is minimized. ISODATA applies some heuristics
    to adjust the number of clusters; clusters could be removed, divided or merged
    at the end of each iteration based on similarities between neighboring clusters
    and specified minimum class size (Jain, 2010, Jain et al., 1999, ESRI, 2014).
    In this study, functionality of ISODATA was combined with Maximum Likelihood which
    assigns cells to classes using Bayes’ theorem. This method assumes that the distribution
    of a class sample is normal, hence uses mean vector and the covariance matrix
    to assign each cell to a class based on statistical probability. 2.3.3. Gaussian
    mixture model A Gaussian Mixture (GM) model is a parametric probability density
    function which is often used for soft data clustering. If clusters have different
    sizes and correlation within them, GM may be more appropriate option for clustering
    than k-means. This method assumes data belong to a mixture of normal density components
    with unknown parameters. The GM parameters are estimated using an expectation
    maximization algorithm by assigning posterior probabilities to each component
    density. Each cluster corresponds to one of the Gaussian components, hence data
    are assigned to clusters such that posterior probability is maximized (Reynolds,
    2009, Mathworks, 2014). 2.3.4. Integer linear programing A linear programming
    (LP) problem is an optimization (maximization or minimization) problem of a linear
    objective function, subject to linear equality and/or inequality constraints.
    If some or all of the variables are limited to be integers, it is called an integer
    linear programming (ILP) problem. The LP has been a very popular technique to
    irrigation management and water resources system analysis and planning (Singh,
    2012). Recently, the ILP has been successfully used for rectangular shape MZ delineation
    and crop planning optimization problems by Cid-Garcia et al., 2013, Cid-Garcia
    et al., 2014. The area underneath each center pivot irrigation system was divided
    into 360 pies each 1 degree wide. Then, a spatial join process was implemented
    to identify data points (cells) within each pie for each attribute. A total of
    129,241 zones was created by combining 1 degree pies (Table 3). The standard deviation
    was calculated for data points within each zone with respect to the target attribute.
    Table 3. All of the pie shape zones underneath a center pivot irrigation system.

    ⋅ ⋯ ⋅ 359 359–0 359–1 ⋯ 359–359 a X–Y: start angle-end angle. An integer linear
    programming model was designed to find the optimum spatial arrangement of pie-shape
    zones underneath each pivot. The general mathematical model was as follows: (1)
    subject to (2) (3) (4) where xi is the decision variable for zone i, σ is the
    standard deviation for attribute k within zone i, ak is a user-defined weighting
    factor based on the relative importance of an attribute in zoning process, m is
    the total number of attributes, n is the total number of the zones, l is the length
    of each zone in degrees, cij is a coefficient equal to 1 if angle j is covered
    by zone i otherwise equal to 0, Pmax is the maximum number of desired zones. Objective
    function (1) minimizes a weighted average of standard deviations across the zones.
    In this study we did not use more than one variable at each optimization attempt,
    thus k and ak were set to one. Restriction (2) ensures that each degree is covered
    by only one zone and selected zones cover the entire area underneath the irrigation
    system. Constraint (3) ensures that total number of the pies is less than the
    maximum desired number which was set to 10 in this study. Constraint (4) ensures
    that the length of the pies is greater than the minimum desired value which was
    chosen to be 5 degree. For a pie, the decision variable of the model, xi, was
    1 if the pie was selected and 0 otherwise. 2.4. Performance evaluation The overall
    within-zone variance of AWC was calculated to assess zoning strategies and find
    the optimum number of zones. The AWC variances for each zone were weighted considering
    the zone-area (Fraisse et al., 2001): (5) where is weighted variance for zone
    z, AWC is the soil available water content for cell i, m is mean of soil available
    water values in zone z, nZ and nT are number of cells in zone z and total number
    of cells across field, respectively. Total within-zone AWC variance across field
    ( ) was obtained as the sum of weighted within-zone AWC variances: (6) The better
    zoning scenario was selected as the one with minimum total AWC standard deviation.
    For the ILP method, the kappa coefficient (Cohen, 1960) was also calculated to
    measure inter-classification agreement of different zoning strategies by ancillary
    data against optimum zones using AWC data. The kappa coefficient equals 0 and
    1 when the agreement is due to chance alone or when there is perfect agreement,
    respectively. A positive coefficient indicates agreement exceeds chance and the
    magnitude of coefficient reflects the strength of agreement. 3. Results 3.1. Zoning
    using ECa and satellite images Fig. 3 depicts the variance of AWC as well as average
    yield within zones for a different number of MZs and multiple clustering methods.
    The AWC variance across the field, not divided into zones, was chosen as a reference
    (i.e. one MZ with 100% variance). For k-means, up to 11%, 19% and 16% of variance
    was explained considering ECS, ECD and ECS plus ECD as input, respectively. Considering
    more than 4 zones only reduced the variance by an additional 1% (ECS input), 1%
    (ECD input) and 2% (ECS + ECD inputs). For ISODATA-ML, variance was reduced by
    11%, 19% and 17% considering ECS, ECD and ECS plus ECD as input, respectively.
    Given more than 4 zones, the variance decreased by an additional 1% (ECS input),
    1% (ECD input) and 4% (ECS + ECD inputs). For GM method, 10% (ECS input), 17%
    (ECD input) and 16% (ECS + ECD inputs) of the variance reduction occurred by dividing
    the field into 4 zones while further division to up to 10 zones only decreased
    the total variance by an additional 1% (ECS input), 2% (ECD input) and 5% (ECS
    + ECD inputs). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Performance of clustering
    methods based on percent reduction in AWC variance and within-zone average yield.
    kM: k-means; GM: Gaussian mixture; ISO: ISODATA-maximum likelihood; 1, 2, and
    3: ECS, ECD and ECS plus ECD were used for clustering. Adding more than 4–5 zones
    only slightly improved the clustering results. In fact, most of the AWC variance
    was explained by dividing the field into two MZs. This is in line with changes
    observed in within-zone yield average; when the number of zones increased to more
    than 4–5, one starts to see more zones with similar productivity. The clustering
    methods performed similar. The highest reduction in variance was observed for
    GM with 10 zones and ECS plus ECD as inputs. However, considering 4 as the optimum
    number of zones, k-mean and ISODAT-ML performed slightly better than GM. Noting
    this similarity among results of clustering methods and given the simplicity and
    ease of use of k-means method, it was decided to only use it for the rest of the
    unsupervised clustering tasks during this study. Aggregating ECS and ECD did not
    decrease the within-zone variance of AWC for k-means and ISODATA-ML procedures.
    For an optimum number of zones (n = 4), the lowest variance was observed when
    ECD was used as an input. Therefore, the ECD was considered an attribute of high
    importance for explaining the variability found in AWC for the field of study.
    Fig. 4 illustrates the gray-scale panchromatic images taken by Landsat 8 during
    2013 and 2014. Initial assessment of satellite images revealed the reflectance
    value of cells adjacent to the boundaries of the field were affected by the roads
    (located at north and west parts of the field) and trees (located at south and
    east parts of the field) and in turn influenced the spatial distribution of the
    entire field. Therefore, the border cells were filtered out from satellite images
    prior to running clustering analysis. The cells within drainage pathways were
    also removed from satellite images since they were missing from other attributes
    too. Moreover, they caused the same problem as border cells. The field was planted
    (harvested) in cotton on May 30, 2013 (December 2–3, 2013) and on May 5, 2014
    (October 18–20, 2014), meaning some of the satellite images had been taken from
    bare soil but some from the cotton canopy in different growth stages. There were
    moderate temporal changes in spatial patterns of satellite photos. However, it
    was possible to visually associate brightness level to AWC spatial variation in
    a good number of images (i.e. photos taken on April 13, 2013; April 29, 2013;
    October 22, 2013; August 6, 2014; August 22, 2014; and September 23, 2014). Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Gray-scale maps of panchromatic spectral band
    during 2013–2014 from the field of study. The coarse-textured soils with low AWC
    were mostly located over three spots across the field: close to the southern border
    of the field mostly outside of the outer pivot circles, (ii) underneath the eastern
    pivot approximately from the pivot point up to the right edge of the field, and
    (iii) a region in the northwestern part of the field above the drainage path adjacent
    to the northern border. In general, very bright cells (i.e. cells with high reflectance
    value/digital number) were mostly associated with coarse-textured soils with low
    AWC values while darker-colored cells (i.e. cells with low reflectance value/digital
    number) were associated with higher AWC soils. The photo acquired in August 6,
    2014 revealed considerable spatial agreement with our understanding of AWC patterns.
    Factors such as ponding water due to rainfall (i.e. photos taken on May 15, 2013;
    December 25, 2013; February 7, 2014; March 31, 2014; April 16, 2014, May 2, 2014;
    May 18, 2014; October 25, 2014 and December 12, 2014) and wet soil due to an irrigation
    event (i.e. photo taken on July 21, 2014) affected the spatial arrangement of
    satellite photos. To understand temporal changes, the distribution of standardized
    brightness values for the satellite photos are illustrated in Fig. 5 where similar
    distributions were roughly grouped by visual assessment. Coarse textured soils
    appeared as a long right tail in satellite photos grouped in panel A and D, while
    spots with ponding water formed a long left tail for images in panel C and caused
    negative skewness. The satellite images with less clear spatial pattern formed
    panel B. Images with no vivid spatial pattern showed high positive Kurtosis (panel
    E). The image taken April 16, 2014 did not follow the distributions observed with
    the other images; with negative kurtosis it depicted both ponding water and coarse
    soils but did not well represent the entire spatial arrangement of AWC across
    the field. The better satellite images seemed to follow a log normal distribution
    (panel D) which was the distribution of raw ECD data as well. Download : Download

    spectral band during 2013–2014. Fig. 6 shows the clustering results in terms of
    average within-zone AWC variance using satellite images as input. In 2014, images
    taken August 6 and September 23 showed the highest performance with 21% and 14%
    reduction in AWC variance, respectively. In 2013, images taken November 7 and
    April 29 exhibited the better result by explaining 12% and 10% of AWC variance,
    respectively. Identical to what we observed for ECa data, adding more than 4–5
    zones only slightly improved explaining AWC variance. On average, for the abovementioned
    satellite images with acceptable performance, considering more than 4 zones only
    helped to explain an additional 2% of AWC variance. The zones delineated from
    rest of the images explained less than 10% of the AWC variance. The lowest performance
    belonged to images taken 19 July and 12 December 2014 which explained only 1%
    of the AWC variance. In 2013, images taken on 22 October and 25 December exhibited
    the lowest efficiency by explaining 4% and 3% of AWC variance, respectively. With
    a few exceptions, our visual assessment of reflectance distribution (Fig. 4) turned
    out to match the efficiency of images in zone delineation (Fig. 5). Overall, the
    highest performance was observed for images in groups D and A with an average
    11% and 10% reduction in variance, respectively. In contrast, images in groups
    E and C showed the lowest potential for clustering by only explaining 3 and 4
    percent of AWC variance, respectively. The higher number of cloud free images
    available contributed in better zoning results in 2014 compare with 2013. We also
    attribute this to difference in field conditions; in 2013 planting was delayed
    due to cold weather and wet soil which affected cotton growth and maturity and
    also diminished the yield contrast across the field which is usually expected
    to occur between soils with high and low water holding capacities. Download :

    methods. Fig. 8 depicts the average standardized yield for optimum number of zones
    (n = 4) for k-means approach. There was a good similarity among MZs delineated
    by different algorithms which also matched the spatial arrangement of soil physical
    and hydraulic properties. The delineated zones by k-means and ISODATA-ML were
    similar which was expected due to similarity between these clustering methods.
    The dark blue (zone 4) and yellow (zone 1) colors represent soils with high and
    low AWC, respectively and the other two zones illustrates the transient between
    these extremes. The trend in average yield data across MZs matched the spatial
    arrangement of soil physical and hydraulic properties. For instance, higher yield
    belonged to soils with higher AWC and somewhat to the strip surrounded the drainage
    path which had good drainage condition hence did not suffer from excessive water
    content after heavy rainfall events which is likely to happen in west Tennessee.
    The yield on coarse-textured soil was 20% below average while soils with higher
    AWC produced 10% above average yield. In practice, small spots within clusters
    could easily be removed (for example by using a moving average window) to have
    more homogenous zones for variable rate applications. Download : Download full-size

    changes in soil available water content Temporal changes in spatial arrangement
    of user-defined irrigation MZs is shown in Fig. 9. The selection of breaking levels
    between zones was arbitrary. We chose 2 cm water within effective root zone as
    the target range. The highest spatial change took place from first thematic map
    (0–25 cm) to second one (0–50 cm). After that, there was a good agreement among
    thematic maps up to 100 cm. This trend suggests the possibility of having different
    irrigation zones early in the cropping season when the crop is only using the
    available water from surface soil. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9.

    the performance of ILP and k-means methods to delineate MZs underneath center
    pivots using different input attributes. The AWC variance for each pivot was considered
    as reference (100% level) which was equal to one MZ or uniform irrigation. Given
    AWC as input and k-means as clustering method, for both pivots within zone uniformity
    increased by adding more zones yet changes were minor as the number of zones became
    more than 4–5. The same trend was observed when ancillary data (i.e. ECa, reflectance
    value, and yield) were used for clustering but was less pronounced. This is in
    line with the observed trend when the entire field was clustered to MZs (i.e.
    phase one). Most of the reduction in AWC variance was obtained by dividing the
    pivot into two MZs. Given ECD and reflectance values as input, up to 30% and 15%
    of AWC variance was explained underneath the east and west pivots, respectively.
    Considering average yield as an input for clustering only helped to explain less
    than 10% of AWC variance. Given AWC as input and ILP as the zoning method, up
    to 30% and 40% of AWC variance was explained at the east and west pivots, respectively.
    In reality, this is the improvement expected to occur from uniform irrigation
    to VRI with limited speed control. Considering ILP as zoning method, both ECD
    and reflectance values were able to efficiently zone both pivots. The average
    yield, however, performed weaker than other inputs for clustering at the east
    pivot but was as effective for the west pivot. The difference between ILP and
    k-means for optimum number of zones (n = 4) was about 35% for both pivots in respect
    to reduction in AWC variance. This represents difference expected between VRI
    with limited speed control and a hypothetical VRI with ability to irrigate each
    4 m2 cell individually. The ability of a real precision irrigation system in reducing
    AWC variance is expected to be somewhere in between. Download : Download full-size

    considered as the reference to evaluate the performance of other zoning strategies
    using k-means. The same was true for zoning by ILP model when zones delineated
    using AWC were considered to show the optimum arrangement of pies and other zoning
    configurations were compared against it. For ILP with AWC as input, (i) zones
    1 and 4 and zones 3 and 4 covered mostly coarse soils with low AWC underneath
    east and west pivots, respectively; (ii) zones 3 and 2 underneath east and west
    pivots, respectively, mostly consisted of fine-textured soils with high AWC; (iii)
    other zones (zone 2 and 1 underneath east and west pivots, respectively) contained
    a mixture of soils with high and low AWC. Download : Download full-size image

    of optimum zones provided by ILP technique was not identical among models with
    different ancillary data as input (Fig. 11). By visual assessment, for the both
    pivots there is a good and moderate agreement between pie zones using ECD and
    Band 8, respectively and that of AWC but using yield for zoning resulted somewhat
    different zones. The Kappa coefficient (Fig. 12) confirmed our visual assessment.
    In the case of the east pivot ECD and yield data showed the highest and lowest
    kappa coefficient, respectively. The same trend was observed in the case of the
    west pivot, but there was a consistent reduction in Kappa coefficient for all
    attributes in comparison with that of the east pivot. It is clear that ECD and
    satellite images were good candidates for irrigation zone delineation as opposed
    to yield which exhibited less potential. This difference could be related to the
    spatial resolution of different soil attributes. The ECa data were the most exhaustive
    data, so carried information on soil spatial variation at a very fine scale. The
    satellite images were not point measurements but an integration of reflectance
    over 15 by 15 m cells. The AWC data were interpolated from soil cores. Download

    research in precision agriculture has greatly focused on variable rate application
    and MZ as a method to enhance the efficiency of crop inputs usage. However, the
    phrase “management zones” remains uncertain unless additional information is included
    to clarify the goal in sub-dividing the field (Kitchen et al., 2005) which affects
    our choice of clustering technique and information used for zoning. The MZ delineation
    for variable rate application of fertilizer and seeding has extensively been studied
    in recent years. In contrast, there are only a handful of studies on zoning for
    variable rate irrigation. Given the ever increasing demand for fresh water, moving
    toward precise application of water for irrigation is unavoidable. The resulting
    zones should be simple, stable, accurate and inexpensive to identify, and enable
    within-field spatial variation to be managed (Khosla et al., 2010). 4.1. MZ delineation
    methods Guastaferro et al. (2010) compared different algorithms for the delineation
    of management zones and mentioned different pros and cons for each method. We
    observed a good agreement among delineated zones using k-means, Gaussian mixture
    and ISODATA-ML methods. It seems for a field with high spatial structure, all
    well-known clustering methods are able to recognize an accurate pattern for irrigation
    MZs in a substantial way. The ILP zoning strategy, introduced in this study, also
    showed promising results. This method was designed to delineate pie shape zones
    for center pivots with limited speed control ability. There are several benefits
    associated with this zoning method. First, most of the available center pivots
    located in west Tennessee and other irrigated areas across US have suitable control
    panels to create pie shape zones, so there is no need to upgrade available pivots
    in order to make use of this method. Second, applying ILP showed a significant
    decline in within-zone AWC variance, meaning it will help make better site-specific
    irrigation decisions, and improve the choice of timing and amount of irrigation,
    which in turn enhances water use efficiency. In addition, it could promote VRI
    and act as a bridge to adopt more advanced precision irrigation systems if needed.
    4.2. Optimum number of zones It is extremely important to find the optimum number
    of irrigation MZs. We found 4–5 MZs to be sufficient to explain within field variability
    of AWC. By changing the number of zones from 1 to 10, the total within-zone variance
    drastically decreased but approached an asymptotic value slowly as the number
    of zones continued to increase. A similar trend for variance reduction was found
    by Zhang et al. (2010). Fraisse et al. (2001) delineated 2–6 MZs for two fields
    located near Centralia, Missouri, and monitored the within zone variance of yield
    to identify the optimum number of zones. They observed a minimum variance for
    5 zones when up to 32% of the yield variance was explained. Delineating irrigation
    zones is the first step toward site-specific irrigation management. Then, an irrigation
    prescription map needs to be developed before each irrigation event throughout
    the cropping season. One may only use zones as a guide to adjust the timing of
    supplemental irrigation in west Tennessee, i.e. to delay starting irrigation or
    terminate irrigation earlier in a specific zone(s). A more sophisticated scenario
    is to calculate the irrigation for each zone independently by sensing soil/crop
    water status/usage. Therefore, over estimating the optimum number of MZs makes
    irrigation scheduling more complicated, time-consuming and costly. On the other
    hand, under estimation of management zones diminishes the irrigating efficiency
    and may cause yield reduction. There is less freedom to explain variability with
    pie shape zones. It is most likely to have some zones consisting a mixture of
    soils with low and high AWCs. This is an unavoidable problem which is due to the
    inherent limitation of center pivots with limited speed control ability. The critical
    question is how to manage this variation or which soil to follow during irrigation.
    Answering this question needs quantitative information on crop-soil-water interaction
    which was outside of the scope of this study but is suggested for further investigation.
    4.3. Application of proximal data The AWC is a logical basis to delineate irrigation
    MZs since it directly affects both plant growth and yield, and irrigation scheduling.
    According to Fraisse et al. (2001) crop production potential is strongly related
    to plant available water so its productivity can be approximately determined on
    the basis of soil physical properties and topographic characteristics, when topography
    changes significantly in a given field. In the field of study more than 50% of
    cotton and soybean yield variability was explained by soil physical and hydraulic
    properties (Haghverdi, 2015). In practice, however, more easily obtained data
    should act as a surrogate for AWC information that is more difficult, time-consuming
    or expensive to obtain. The ECa data exhibited a considerable potential for irrigation
    zoning. Moral et al. (2010) also found ECa to be a good proximal attribute for
    high resolution zone delineation. They reported ECD and percent of clay to be
    dominant factors explaining soil spatial variability based on PCA. Kitchen et
    al. (2005) found ECa a reliable attribute for allocating productivity zones on
    claypan soil fields. Though less pronounced than ECa, the satellite images exhibited
    a good potential to be used for characterizing spatial variation in field-scale
    AWC. Our findings support the result reported by Guo et al. (2012) who observed
    a strong relationship between bare soil brightness and ECa with soil texture where
    low ECa and high brightness were associated with lower clay content. In another
    study, Song et al. (2009) used Quickbird commercial satellite data with 2.4 m
    resolution for MZ delineation and found it to be a reliable procedure. The main
    drawback of proximal sensor measurements is that they are complex and affected
    by multiple soil-crop properties (Corwin and Lesch, 2010). Therefore, they should
    show similar spatial distributions to those of soil physical and hydraulic characteristics,
    governing soil available water for crop, in order to be considered as an effective
    input to delineate irrigation zones. In addition, timing of capturing photos by
    satellite turned out to affect the practical application of satellite images for
    field-scale zone delineation. In fact, our results demonstrated that temporal
    variability alters the spatial pattern expressed by Landsat 8 panchromatic band
    and in turn its usefulness as an input to delineate MZs. There were some similarities
    between zones delineated by ECa, satellite images and yield data, but yield data
    indicated less potential for zoning and exhibited some inconsistency. The reason
    is that different factors affect yield in a complex manner. In fact, it is not
    possible to distinguish between the variety of factors affecting crop growth and
    yield, such as physical and chemical properties of soil, irrigation regimes, pests
    and diseases and climate, using yield maps alone (Corwin and Lesch, 2010). We
    realized that even when visual assessment of yield maps indicates similar spatial
    arrangement as soil related maps the clustering result may be different. Moreover,
    for fields with no available yield map, using ECa and/or space-borne satellite
    images represents a great time saving. Averaging yield maps across years, as we
    did in our study, could be a safe guard against temporal changes and an attempt
    to find more stable scheme of yield distribution. On the other hand, if high temporal
    variance in yield spatial distribution exists, averaging yield data across years
    may mask information and cause misleading interpretation. We averaged cotton yield
    data from 2012 to 2014. In 2012, the field was uniformly irrigated by the farmer
    but an irrigation study was performed in 2013 and 2014. Visual assessment of maps
    against each other suggested that spatial soil differences strongly affected yield
    patterns during those years, yet this impact was less pronounced for 2013 cropping
    season where delayed planting and temperature distribution over the growing season
    depressed yield and influenced its spatial distribution to some extent. 4.4. Temporal
    variability and role of crop We examined the necessity of having multiple zoning
    schemes within a cropping season in our study site. The result revealed if in
    depth soil variation is significant, the spatial arrangement of optimum irrigation
    MZs may vary within a cropping season. There is evidence in literature showing
    the effect of season to season climate variability in spatial arrangement of MZs,
    hence supporting the idea of dynamic zoning. For instance, Schepers et al. (2004)
    showed that temporal climate variability even under irrigation may change the
    yield spatial variation. Temporal changes may affect the spatial patterns of yield
    such that no consistent high/low yield zones were observed (Guastaferro et al.,
    2010). Rainfall patterns and available heat unit are the prime factors affecting
    cotton growth and yield in west Tennessee with a short season humid environment.
    For instance, if dry periods at sensitive growth stages occur, soil with higher
    water holding capacity provides better conditions for crop to avoid undergoing
    water stress, hence higher yield is expected for such soil. In contrast, a wet
    year with unexpected early heavy rainfall may delay planting hence reducing the
    chance for the crop to accumulate enough heat units. In such scenario, soils with
    high AWC may suffer from excessive vegetative growth and unopened bolls by the
    time of harvesting. Fraisse et al. (2001) found that number of MZs for precision
    farming declined when either enough water was provided throughout the growing
    season or a drought tolerant variety was planned. The optimum number of MZs is
    also influenced by the crop planted (Fraisse et al., 2001). Further study is required
    to investigate the crop response to water level across different soil types as
    a means to provide crop-specific irrigation MZs. 5. Conclusion Precision agriculture
    is a farming system which uses information technology to do site-specific crop
    management in which decisions on resource application are modified with regard
    to within field variation of components such as soil, water and crop (Whelan and
    Taylor, 2013). Field-scale spatiotemporal variation is significant in west Tennessee,
    thus variable rate irrigation may enhance water use efficiency and crop yield.
    Conventional irrigation management tries to answer when and how much to irrigate.
    Given within field soil variation, variable rate irrigation management ought to
    address where to irrigate as well. Delineating management areas within fields
    is an important part of a precision farming system where it is expected that applying
    identical treatment will cause significant yield differences. Methods for delineating
    MZs vary widely in the information used as well as the techniques for creating
    the zone boundaries. Use of on-the-go sensors and remote sensing technologies
    is appealing because it is easy to collect these data on a field-scale. We evaluated
    the performance of several clustering methods for zone delineation. We also designed
    a new zoning strategy based on integer linear programming for center pivots with
    limited speed control ability. We used high resolution soil available water maps
    as standard input to zone the field. We also assessed the effectiveness of ECa,
    space-borne satellite images and yield data for zone delineation. The clustering
    methods performed similar in efficiently dividing the field into relatively homogeneous
    zones in respect to soil hydraulic properties. The introduced integer linear programming
    method offers the optimum zoning strategy for center pivots with limited speed
    control ability to match water input to soil spatial patterns. However, further
    research is essential to investigate the optimum irrigation strategy over pies
    with a mixture of soils. The results of this study suggested that ECa and satellite
    images may be used to determine site-specific irrigation MZs in west Tennessee
    if a high spatial similarity is observed between these ancillary data with soil
    hydraulic properties. The spatial and temporal resolution and precision varies
    among different types of ancillary data and affect their efficiency for zone delineation.
    Temporal variability in soil moisture altered expression of spatial variability
    in space-born satellite images. Yield data did not show a high potential for zone
    delineation. We attribute this to various factors that affect yield in a complex
    manner and also temporal differences in yield data. In practice, farmer knowledge
    on field conditions could be extremely useful to choose the most appropriate data
    set for zone delineation. References Arslan and Colvin, 2002 S. Arslan, T.S. Colvin

    Abstract The challenge of improving water quality is a growing global concern,
    typified by the European Commission Water Framework Directive and the United States
    Clean Water Act. The main drivers of poor water quality are economics, poor water
    management, agricultural practices and urban development. This paper reviews the
    extensive role of non-point sources, in particular the outdated agricultural practices,
    with respect to nutrient and contaminant contributions. Water quality monitoring
    (WQM) is currently undertaken through a number of data acquisition methods from
    grab sampling to satellite based remote sensing of water bodies. Based on the
    surveyed sampling methods and their numerous limitations, it is proposed that
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs), despite their own limitations, are still very
    attractive and effective for real-time spatio-temporal data collection for WQM
    applications. WSNs have been employed for WQM of surface and ground water and
    catchments, and have been fundamental in advancing the knowledge of contaminants
    trends through their high resolution observations. However, these applications
    have yet to explore the implementation and impact of this technology for management
    and control decisions, to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder’s contributions,
    in an autonomous and dynamic manner. Here, the potential of WSN-controlled agricultural
    activities and different environmental compartments for integrated water quality
    management is presented and limitations of WSN in agriculture and WQM are identified.
    Finally, a case for collaborative networks at catchment scale is proposed for
    enabling cooperation among individually networked activities/stakeholders (farming
    activities, water bodies) for integrated water quality monitoring, control and
    management. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Wireless

    1. Introduction Water is a key natural resource which is vital for the survival
    of all ecosystems on the planet. However, less than 1% of the earth’s water resources
    are accessible to humans as fresh water, in the form of either surface or ground
    water (Krchnak et al., 2002, UNESCO, 2006). Although there is currently sufficient
    water for essential activities (Blanco et al., 2009) including drinking, irrigation,
    and domestic and industrial use on a global scale, the spatial distribution of
    water suggests that, in many cases, it is not available where it is required.
    Because of the unequal distribution of fresh water resources, billions of people
    around the globe live in water-stressed and water-limited environments. Therefore
    it is crucial to preserve water resources although in practice it is continually
    degraded and depleted owing to inappropriately targeted funding initiatives leading
    to poor water management, redundant and outdated agricultural practices and urban
    development (Rosegrant et al., 2002, Verhoeven et al., 2006). The key issues relating
    to global freshwater quality problems in the environment and public health are
    summarised as (FAO, 1996): (1) Non-economic cost of drinking water treatment.
    (2) Millions of annual deaths resulting from water-borne diseases. (3) Ecosystem
    dysfunction and loss of biodiversity. (4) Contamination of marine ecosystems.
    (5) Contamination of groundwater resources. (6) Depletion of usable water resources.
    (7) Deterioration of recreational activities. Problems associated with water quality
    are commonly attributed to nutrient, chemical and pathogen loadings into an aquatic
    system as a result of point source and non-point source activities (EPA, 2009).
    Discharges from point sources are identifiable and come from a single source.
    Examples include contaminants from sewage plant pipes or industries. On the other
    hand non-point source fluxes may come from diffused sources/activities with no
    direct source of entry (FAO, 1996). Examples mainly include agricultural and animal
    farming or peri-urban activities. A diagrammatic representation of major activities
    responsible for the degradation of water on a catchment scale owing to point and
    non-point sources is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    1. Water contamination activities in a catchment. While some regulations have
    been put in place by water quality control organizations in various countries
    to control toxic and chemical loadings from point source as well as non-point
    source (Borja et al., 2004, Pollard and Huxham, 1998), they have not been as effective
    for diffuse non-point sources as for point sources (Heimlich, 2003). In order
    to prevent and reduce water pollution in the US, the use of best management practices
    (BMPs) has been proposed by the EPA (Environment Protection Agency) for controlling
    and managing agricultural practices (UNEP, 1998). However, their effectiveness
    needs to be assessed using sufficient quantities of long term data. Therefore,
    it is established that monitoring nutrient and contaminant contributions by the
    various responsible factors, at key points in a catchment, is vital in assessing
    and preventing degradation of water quality, as well as informing future regulations
    (Coles et al., 2009, Hunter and Walton, 2008). In this paper, we review the impacts
    that different stakeholders have on water resources, and explore how a single
    stakeholder can have unintended impacts on others in a catchment. Various data
    acquisition methods from grab samples to satellite images, have been used to estimate
    and model relationships of land use and water quality degradation in a catchment
    (Glasgow et al., 2004, Shrestha et al., 2008, Bolstad and Swank, 1997, Tong and
    Chen, 2002, Lemos et al., 2007). These sampling methods are further reviewed and
    evaluated in this paper. WSNs have been employed for water quality monitoring
    of surface water (rivers, lakes, and dams), ground water, soil–water and catchments.
    Water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, salinity
    and nitrates have been measured. Preliminary results have been fundamental in
    advancing the knowledge of contaminants trends, although they were based on spatially
    constrained observations. Most of these were small scale prototype deployments
    and were mainly aimed at developing and testing the technology for remote, continuous
    and real-time data availability. However, these applications have yet to explore
    the implementation and impact of this technology for management and control decisions,
    in order to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder’s contributions, in an
    autonomous and dynamic manner. This requires an integration of responsible activities
    into an autonomous water quality monitoring and management mechanism. Therefore,
    the potential for including existing WSN-controlled agricultural activities and
    water bodies, for integrated water quality management, is presented in this review.
    Later, research challenges in the existing applications of WSNs in this area are
    identified which, if addressed, would enable possible extension of the existing
    techniques to an integrated monitoring program. It is argued in this paper that
    it is not feasible to have a single monitoring system covering the entire catchment
    as individual stakeholder’s monitoring requirements vary as they undertake different
    activities. However, this enables a case for collaborative networks in a catchment
    to be proposed for enabling cooperation among individually networked activities/stakeholders
    (farming activities, water bodies) for managing water quality. The structure of
    this paper is as follows. In Section 2, the role of agricultural activities on
    water quality degradation in a catchment is discussed. Section 3 discusses existing
    data acquisition methods for WQM, and discuss their limitations, and Section 4
    investigates the ability of WSNs for water quality monitoring and management in
    a catchment. Section 5 discusses the unresolved research challenges that prevent
    wide adoption of WSNs for monitoring agricultural and water quality parameters
    and achieving water quality management in a catchment. Finally, Section 6 presents
    a case for integrated water quality management using collaboration among individually
    networked activities in a catchment, while Section 7 draws conclusions. 2. Role
    of agricultural activities on water quality degradation and ecosystem dysfunction
    in a catchment Surface and ground water contamination in a catchment is mainly
    attributed to outdated farm management practices. These include excessive use
    of fertilizers for high product yields, traditional irrigation practices, use
    of pesticides and herbicides and poorly managed animal farming operations (Moss,
    2008, EPA, 2009). Other sources include fracking, deforestation, atmospheric deposits
    by rainfall and untreated sewage waste. However, this paper focuses on the impact
    of farm management practices on water quality degradation. These practices may
    result in nutrient, chemical, pathogen and sediment fluxes with main nutrient
    issues being due to excess phosphorous and nitrogen losses (Carpenter et al.,
    1998, Hunter and Walton, 2008). 1 lists the impacts of catchment scale activities
    on the quality of surface and ground water resources. For a related representation

    fertilizer application Fertilizers rich in phosphorous, potassium and nitrogen
    are added to soil to increase crop yields. However, agronomic nutrient recommendations
    are often far in excess of environmental levels (Mueller et al., 1996). Therefore,
    application of nutrients contained in manures and artificial fertilizers often
    remain in the soil or are leached into the drainage water (Vanlauwe et al., 2001,
    McKergow et al., 2003). Enrichment of water because of nutrients, termed as eutrophication
    (Nixon, 1995), can give rise to toxic algal blooms which contaminates drinking
    water and harms aquatic life (Smith and Schindler, 2009, Min and Jiao, 2002).
    This acknowledges the need for a mechanism to monitor and assess nutrient inputs
    to crops, its uptake by crops and losses through runoffs and leaching from farms.
    2.2. Poor water management Irrigation techniques such as surface flooding, localised
    drip and subsurface irrigation might be efficient in some ways but they can lead
    to various problems. Under-irrigation, in the case of drip irrigation, can lead
    to salt buildup on the soil surface and can damage crops. Over-irrigation, in
    the case of surface irrigation, may not only trigger nutrient/chemical runoff,
    but can also cause perched water tables resulting in soil salinity problems (McKergow
    et al., 2003). Furthermore due to scarce water resources, low quality water is
    being increasingly used for irrigation, which is rich in nutrients and salts (Pereira
    et al., 2002). This increases the risk of salt accumulation in the root zone and
    consequent long term damage to crop production and soil fertility (Pitman and
    Läuchli, 2004, Tedeschi and Dell’Aquila, 2005). This acknowledges the need for
    an intelligent water management methodology to avoid wastage of water and allow
    its reutilisation. 2.3. Inadequately managed animal farming operations Manure
    run-off due to rainfall or poorly managed animal farming operations may carry
    pathogens like bacteria and viruses to water bodies, affecting water quality for
    both aquatic life and humans (Lipp et al., 2001, Ferguson et al., 2003). Pathogenic
    micro-organisms are responsible for causing infectious diseases in humans and,
    are a major cause of decline and destruction of coral reefs worldwide (Bellwood
    et al., 2004, EPA, 2012). In order to maintain and improve animal health within
    animal feeding operations (AFOs) facilities and to prevent any pathogen and chemical
    fluxes through fecal discharges from them, it is very important to continuously
    monitor and control the local environment. 2.4. Use of pesticides and herbicides
    Pesticide and herbicide applications on crops contribute to chemical deposits
    in soil, which are carried through runoff and leaching into rivers, lakes and
    groundwater (Cerejeira et al., 2003, Guzzella et al., 2006). Antibiotics are fed
    to livestock as growth enhancers, and manure containing these pharmaceuticals
    is spread on land, from where it leaches into ground water and reservoirs (Daughton,
    2004, Reynolds, 2003). This validates a need for: (i) monitoring microclimate
    of crops to prevent onset of moulds and other diseases, and (ii) a mechanism to
    control chemical laden water into or out of a farm preventing contamination of
    its own or other’s farm or water bodies. 3. Existing water quality data acquisition
    methods This chapter focuses on the major sampling methods which have been used
    to acquire water quality data to assess surface (rivers, lakes, dams) and ground
    water (reservoirs, aquifers) bodies. Also, this information has been used to model
    the relationship between land use and water quality degradation in a catchment
    (Glasgow et al., 2004, Lemos et al., 2007, Shrestha et al., 2008). This chapter
    briefly discusses grab sampling, in situ sampling using data loggers, and remote
    sensing using satellite imaging, while it focuses mainly on the use of WSNs. This
    chapter discusses the suitability of WSNs for water quality monitoring and argues
    how it overcomes the limitations of the other methods. For decades, field measurements
    for water quality evaluation have depended upon costly time- and labour-intensive
    on-site sampling and data collection. Water samples are collected from the field
    and are then analysed in laboratories. This not only give limited point measurements
    but also become an expensive method for remote sites (Glasgow et al., 2004). Additionally,
    transportation of samples may disturb their chemical properties (EPA, PacifiCorp,
    2002). As data utility is affected in grab sampling by extended holding times
    before analysis, monitoring programs have shifted towards continuous measurements
    using in situ sensors (Lemos et al., 2007) Initially data loggers were used for
    in situ monitoring; however they were limited by not providing data in real time
    as sites had to be visited to retrieve data. The expense of data loggers, infield
    reliability, calibration requirements and the need to extract data from them individually,
    prevent them from being used for a dense and long term deployment of sensors.
    Alternatively, remote sensing using optical and thermal sensors on aircrafts and
    satellites can be used to monitor water quality parameters like turbidity, chlorophyll,
    chemicals, nutrients and temperature (Glasgow et al., 2004, Webster and Grossman,
    2003). High resolution remotely sensed data is correlated by empirical or analytical
    models to a water quality parameter (Ritchie et al., 2003). Examples include a
    modelling approach to estimate phytoplankton in a shallow lake using satellite
    imagery with sparsely collected ground reference data, which demonstrates temporal
    stability (Tyler et al., 2006, Matthews et al., 2010). However, this is an expensive
    solution and its application is limited to regions covered by the satellites.
    Also, data sampling frequency may be insufficient and data may not be available
    in real time (Basha and Rus, 2007). It is reasoned that sudden fluctuations in
    water quality and quantity can be monitored using high frequency continuous measurements,
    and considerable differences in measurements are observed in daily/hourly readings
    in comparison to sparse readings (O’Flynn et al., 2010, Kirchner et al., 2004).
    Advancements in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMSs), low-power and low-cost
    microcontrollers and radio modules enabled WSNs for environmental monitoring (Estrin
    et al., 2001), which overcame the limitations of previous expensive, and bulky
    monitoring equipment with low spatio-temporal resolution to a certain extent.
    WSNs are networks of small embedded computers referred to as sensor nodes or ‘motes’,
    spatially distributed to cooperatively monitor environment and transmit data wirelessly.
    The relatively low cost of a WSN allows in principle, the deployment of a dense
    population of nodes that can adequately represent the variability present in the
    environment. WSNs have been used for monitoring and managing farming activities
    (Wang et al., 2006, Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009) and eco-hydrologic processes (Regan
    et al., 2009, Rundel et al., 2009). Water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved
    oxygen (DO), turbidity, salinity and nitrates have been measured in the reviewed
    applications using WSNs. A basic sensor node (Fig. 2) contains units for sensing
    and actuating, data processing, RF communications and power supply management
    (Jafer et al., 2010). A node can have many different types of sensors, for example
    measuring humidity, temperature, turbidity and nitrate but it should be noted
    that the quality of the data is dependent on the quality of the sensor. The acquired
    analogue samples are converted into digital signals using an on-board analogue-to-digital
    converter. The microprocessor may collect samples over time and aggregate them
    before transmitting them through the local radio transceiver to another node or
    a data sink (also termed as a gateway). Information collected from all the nodes
    is aggregated at the data sink and transmitted to and analysed at an off-field
    control node where a decisions might be taken. This could involve sending some
    actuation signal back to the network, for instance turning on sprinklers to irrigate
    the field. Furthermore, alternative networking approaches exist where information
    is processed and used entirely within the network, without the need for a central
    control node. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Sensor node architecture.

    WSNs deployed in a catchment. 4. WSNs for water quality monitoring and management
    WSNs have been employed for water quality monitoring of surface water (rivers,
    lakes, and dams), ground water, soil–water and catchments. These water bodies
    receive contaminants as a result of agricultural activities up in the catchment
    (as discussed in chapter 2). Preliminary results have been fundamental in advancing
    the knowledge of contaminant trends, through spatially constrained observations.
    Most of the applications were small scale prototype deployments and were mainly
    aimed at developing and testing the technology for remote, continuous and real-time
    data availability. These applications have yet to explore the implementation and
    impact of this technology for management and control decisions, in order to minimise
    and prevent individual stakeholder’s contaminant contributions, in an autonomous
    and dynamic manner. When this happens, the loop would be closed and better management
    policies by farmers would come into place. This would require monitoring of nutrients,
    pathogens and chemical contributions of different farming activities responsible
    for water quality degradation. WSNs have been used in agricultural activities
    but not specifically for WQM. For example a number of applications have been developed
    for precision irrigation for automatic and controlled irrigation, reducing the
    chances of water wastage (runoffs which are carrier of nutrients and contaminants)
    (McCulloch et al., 2008). However, runoff coming from elsewhere (e.g. another
    farm) cannot be avoided. This runoff can be carrying nutrients. In that case,
    current precision irrigation system can be extended to use information about runoff
    to modify the irrigation and fertilizer application of its field to save water
    and fertilizer usage. Other applications of WSNs for agriculture include pest
    control and animal farming. Pest control applications which are used to monitor
    microclimate (temperature, humidity, soil moisture) of a field to prevent conditions
    such as moulds etc. have been very important for viticulture (Morais et al., 2008,
    Beckwith et al., 2004). Furthermore, precision livestock using WSNs has been used
    to: (a) maintain animal health by monitoring environment of barns (Cugnasca et
    al., 2008, Darr and Zhao, 2008) and (b) manage cow herds in a virtual moving fence
    to control pasture area (Butler et al., 2004, Nadimi et al., 2008). The following
    sections review the applications of WSNs for WQM of different environmental compartments.
    Furthermore, the potential of including WSN-controlled existing agricultural activities,
    for integrated water quality management, is presented. 4.1. Application of WSNs
    for monitoring water fluxes and quality in different environmental compartments
    These projects are discussed below with respect to the area they monitor in a
    catchment. 4.1.1. Groundwater monitoring Groundwater contamination from human
    impacts is less obvious than surface water and cleaning it is more costly and
    technically demanding (Zektser and Lorne, 2004). Once polluted it may transport
    nutrients and chemicals to coastal waters (Gallagher et al., 1996, Valiela et
    al., 1999). WSNs have been used to measure rate, quantity and direction of water
    contamination flow in two different scenarios, one being to understand prevalence
    of arsenic in Bangladesh ground water, and the other to monitor nitrate propagation
    through soils and groundwater in parts of the USA. Although sensor nodes have
    become inexpensive, the high cost of some sensors (e.g. ammonium) is a major barrier
    for dense deployment of WSNs (Ramanathan et al., 2006). In order to monitor saltwater
    intrusion into coastal aquifers, WSN have been deployed for monitoring water quality
    in a coastal area in Australia. Preliminary data showed potential for helping
    in decision support related to placement of extraction bores for irrigation to
    avoid groundwater degradation. However, it was not possible to set up a well-connected
    radio link in this particular humid environment (Le Dinh et al., 2007). 4.1.2.
    Surface water monitoring A test deployment project, ‘Lakenet’, was undertaken
    for water quality monitoring in a eutrophic lake by University of Notre Dame (Seders
    et al., 2007). The sensor pod system, consisting of MICA2 and MDA300 sensor board
    measuring temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH was deployed for a short term
    (10 days). The primary objective of this deployment was to test the design of
    both the pods and the network under field conditions and to examine its ability
    to collect data continuously and reliably. This project was termed successful
    on the basis of collected data which showed diurnal fluctuations. To demonstrate
    the need for availability of high temporal rate data, as a requirement of water
    framework development (WFD), a WSN project (DEPLOY) was deployed at various locations
    on a river basin in Ireland. It achieved continuous sampling of parameters including
    conductivity, pH, chlorophyll, DO and temperature. The system consists of the
    Tyndall programmable system-on-chip sensor interface and data telemetry system
    using IDS data pod, and an optimised RF section to provide up to 4 km transmission).
    Results showed fluctuations in measurements due to activities such as runoff,
    rainfall or release of water from dams in the river. This demonstrated the potential
    for catchment behavioural analysis using statistical processing and interpretation.
    However, sensor fouling and maintenance issues were raised (Regan et al., 2009,
    O’Flynn et al., 2010). Similarly, another deployment involved performance evaluation
    of a prototype network of wireless nodes (Sunspot) on a dam in Malawi, Africa
    to counter severe health threats caused by degrading water quality. Water parameters
    such as acidity (pH), DO and turbidity were measured by integrating a sensor board
    with a sensor node. These measurements were then compared with numeric standards
    to decide on the suitability of water for drinking (Zennaro et al., 2009). Another
    application intended for WQM on dams utilises a combination of satellite remote
    sensing and WSN to enable real time analysis of satellite and surface data for
    overall coverage and the continuous monitoring of water quality. A floating sensor
    platform (buoy) is developed and deployed on a dam in Cyprus which transfers water
    quality data via wireless network to a remote central database (Papoutsa et al.,
    2010). Considerable research on developing technology to enable contaminant transport
    assessment and characterising urban stream quality and algal dynamics has been
    undertaken by CENS (Centre for Embedded Sensors), UC Los Angeles (Harmon et al.,
    2009, Gilbert, 2010). This started in 2007, by developing a test-bed for salinity,
    nitrate and soil moisture control in a 30acre land by using automatic irrigation
    control (Park and Harmon, 2007). Later progress on developing nitrate sensors
    for groundwater, soils and aquatic systems was made in 2009 (Ratâko et al., 2009).
    In 2010–2011, the project continued to focus on high resolution river observations
    using integrated sensing and model-driven analysis. Sensing is focused on temperature,
    dissolved oxygen and nitrate changes in the river (Harmon et al., 2009). For monitoring
    impact of poor water quality on aquatic life, parameters such as pH, dissolved
    oxygen, turbidity, salinity and electrical conductivity have been measured in
    various applications (He et al., 2011, Zhu et al., 2010). Real time information
    about these aquaculture environmental parameters can provide the means to give
    early warning signals. In one of the applications, based on historical data, the
    system was used to forecast water quality with artificial neural networks and
    control water quality in time to reduce the threat to fish farms. The model for
    forecasting dissolved oxygen half an hour ahead was validated with experimental
    data (Zhu et al., 2010). 4.1.3. Soil–water monitoring Monitoring drainage water
    of farms enables assessment of its quality. In this application (Kim et al., 2011),
    wireless lysimeter sensing stations were used 90 cm below the soil surface to
    monitor water flux leached below root zone under an irrigated cropping system.
    Continually monitored soil–water and weather data, sensed by a distributed network
    of sensors, was wirelessly transmitted to a base station using Bluetooth, which
    was connected to a web server for broadcasting the data via the internet. This
    provided remote online access to drainage water flux and field conditions for
    the whole growing season. This was targeted at measuring volume of drainage water
    based on irrigation frequency and rainfall events for different crops. However,
    this work could be easily extended to also monitor nutrient or salt parameters
    leached out from the soil. Another important project demonstrated the potential
    of WSNs for measuring soil water content, which was shown to be helpful in controlling
    hydrologic fluxes (Bogena et al., 2010). 4.1.4. Catchment monitoring Some work
    has been reported at catchment scale for water quality monitoring. Such catchments
    include mountains, forests, lakes, rivers, and agricultural lands. These are prototype
    deployments aimed at developing the technology and algorithms for large-scale
    remote monitoring and data processing for large volumes of heterogonous data for
    water quality. These are fundamental research efforts in this domain but improvements
    can be made. To find causes and interactions of physical/chemical variability
    on rivers and estuaries, work was started by US Geological Survey on creating
    a wireless catchment in Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve in Southern California.
    It was intended for high density monitoring of the catchment encompassing mountains,
    canyons and river channels. The system was primarily focused on developing and
    testing a network of radios and routers for wireless data transmission and its
    availability on the internet. Various issues were faced due to rugged topography
    and the difficulty of obtaining line-of sight communication. Despite these challenges,
    this provided an effective way of remote monitoring and was used further for monitoring
    meteorological properties related to pollutant loadings (Cayan et al., 2003).
    Similarly, for evaluating variation of regional weather, at mountain-to-sea scale,
    on water quality/quantity, and flooding in a catchment in Hawaii, a prototype
    system to provide 3D geospatial data visualisation utilising WSN was proposed.
    The system consisted of an array of nodes consisting of water quality sensors
    (temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity), weather stations,
    sensor data loggers (InteleCell), and video monitors. Preliminary results showed
    improvement over traditional sampling methods (Kido et al., 2008). The ‘SoilWeather’
    network was used in Finland for providing high temporal resolution on weather
    conditions, soil moisture and water quality (Kotamäki et al., 2009). The work
    was reported to have been used in developing a leaching model at sub catchment
    scale, including an improved hydrological model of the river, for monitoring water
    quality and nutrient retention in rivers and wetland. The network was deployed
    on a catchment covered by forests, river, lakes, and agricultural lands owned
    by private owners, who were the main users of the data. This is an important work
    highlighting data quality and processing issues with high volumes of heterogeneous
    data, received from catchment-scale observation using a single network, varying
    in content, accuracy, and spatial–temporal resolution. Additionally, maintenance
    of sensors due to such issues as bio-fouling, freezing, and rain gauge problems,
    which resulted in erroneous and missing data were viewed as major challenges in
    obtaining high data quality. 4.2. Leveraging current agricultural processes for
    water quality monitoring and management Some of the key research areas in precision
    agriculture which have received considerable attention include precision irrigation,
    pest control, viticulture and animal health monitoring (Wang et al., 2006, Ruiz-Garcia
    et al., 2009). Instead of taking decisions based on hypothetical average conditions,
    the real time information from these systems provides a solid basis for farmers
    to adjust strategies at any time (Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009). There is a potential
    of leveraging existing networked agricultural activities for their extension into
    an integrated water quality management mechanism. In this regard, current agricultural
    processes such as pest control, precision irrigation and animal farming which
    are monitored and controlled using WSN are discussed below. 4.2.1. Pest control
    To determine and prevent the onset of a fungal disease, phytophtora, in a potato
    field, a network of sensor nodes was deployed to sense humidity and temperature.
    Sensed data was sent periodically to a gateway at the edge of the field from where
    it was forwarded to a server using Wi–Fi. The accumulated field data for a day
    was then fed into a decision support system server where it was combined with
    weather forecast to determine the treatment policy each morning, rather than spraying
    pesticides based on hypothetical assumptions. This experiment, though based on
    specialised hardware, still presented many challenges for radio coverage owing
    to crop canopy effect, routing protocol, software bugs and in-field deployment
    (Langendoen et al., 2006). It has had tremendous impact on improving deployment
    and practicality issues in WSN applications (Le Dinh et al., 2007, Liang and Terzis,
    2008). Furthermore, to prevent frost, pest and mould damage in vineyards, which
    are prone to quick damage if overstressed, WSNs have been used to monitor ambient
    temperature, soil moisture and soil temperature (Morais et al., 2008, Beckwith
    et al., 2004). This information enables vineyard owners to monitor the plants
    remotely and manage priorities accordingly (Burrell et al., 2004). These pest
    control applications could be extended, to include chemical sensing, in order
    to assess chemical levels in the crops and soil after pesticides and herbicides
    applications. Information obtained through such a mechanism could then be used
    to inform on and thus potentially control chemical fluxes into water bodies. 4.2.2.
    Animal farming In order to maintain and improve animal health within animal feeding
    operations (AFOs) and to prevent its negative impact on the ecosystem, information
    related to the local environment is very important. Moreover, by having a mechanism
    to monitor and control animal herds in pasture lands, pathogen and organic additions
    to the environment may be controlled and assessed. The deployment of WSNs in many
    AFOs has enabled monitoring of parameters such as temperature, humidity, noise
    and ammonia content in the air which has allowed the management and maintenance
    of healthy environments in these facilities (Cugnasca et al., 2008, Darr and Zhao,
    2008). For managing cattle herds in pasture land, an algorithm called ‘moving
    virtual fence’ was developed. Each animal in the herd was given a smart collar
    consisting of a GPS (for determining animal’s location), a PDA, a WLAN card and
    a sound amplifier. As the animal approached a perimeter, it is presented with
    an acoustic stimulus to drive it away from crossing over a designated virtual
    boundary. By dynamically shifting fence lines, the usage of feedlots is improved.
    In addition, it reduced the overhead of installing and moving physical fences
    (Butler et al., 2004). Other work has investigated online monitoring of cattle
    presence and pasture time using WSNs to register the time animals spend in specific
    areas of the field (Nadimi et al., 2008). This information can be used to indicate
    grass quality and quantity and can also determine the right time to provide access
    to a new grass strip. These applications can be clearly extended to monitor pathogen
    levels animal waste in a barn and their fluxes to water bodies and therefore manage
    it by raising alerts. Also, by managing animal herds with a virtual fence, the
    possible situation of them contaminating water bodies or others fields can be
    avoided or reduced. 4.2.3. Precision irrigation As established in the introduction,
    potable water resources are under pressure. Therefore an efficient way of utilising
    water resources by people in general and agriculture sector in particular is crucial
    to avoiding a global water crisis (Chartres and Varma, 2011). By monitoring soil
    and environmental parameters (like soil moisture, soil temperature, ambient temperature
    and humidity), an informed decision can be made by farmers to control the timing
    and quantity of irrigation. Unlike expensive, sophisticated, high maintenance
    and high energy sensor-based technologies like Adcon Telemetry and Automata, and
    labour intensive data collection from logging stations, WSNs provide real-time
    and less expensive sensing mechanisms for improving irrigation automation (Vellidis
    et al., 2008). It is estimated that 70% of the annual water usage of the agricultural
    industry, in the Australian state of Tasmania, is used to irrigate dairy pastures.
    In order to improve water use efficiency for pasture production, data is collected
    using 70 sensor pods which were developed using off-the-shelf components for this
    experiment. Accurate irrigation at targeted dry areas can be provided by studying
    soil dynamics, using soil and environmental parameters collected from the pasture
    field. Received data showed variation in soil moisture levels with events such
    as rains etc. (McCulloch et al., 2008). Another example made a comparison between
    traditional and sensor scheduling systems in a cotton field (2.3 ha) for the whole
    growing season (Vellidis et al., 2008). The East of the field, divided into four
    different irrigation zones based on soil type and historic yield map, was equipped
    with 9 sensor nodes and centre pivot variable rate irrigation (VRI) system. On
    the western side, 3 sensor nodes were deployed to monitor soil tension, and here
    irrigation was triggered based on traditional assessment of crops. Each sensor
    node was equipped with three moisture and temperature sensors buried at 0.2, 0.4
    and 0.6 m depth under the soil. Results showed water tension at more than double
    the trigger points at 0.4 and 0.6 m depth in western zone despite irrigation,
    whereas the eastern side never surpassed the trigger points. However, it is stated
    that further work needs to be done on the VRI controller for varying quantity
    of irrigation relative to the needs of individual areas, or for different crops
    in a single field. To address such a need, site specific VRI was employed in a
    3.6 ha plot by using six in-field sensor stations. These stations were based on
    off-the-shelf components, with a plug-and-play Bluetooth radio module, and would
    periodically sample data and transmit back to the base station. Each sensing station
    was equipped with water content reflectometers, a soil temperature probe, and
    a humidity probe. The irrigation machine was controlled by a programmable logic
    controller that would update the geo-referenced location of sprinklers from a
    differential GPS, and wirelessly communicate with a computer at the base station.
    This enabled variable rate irrigation according to the needs of individual crops
    in a large field. (Kim et al., 2008). As discussed above, a significant amount
    of successful work has been published using automatic and variable rate irrigation
    with some limitations regarding reliability. However, what is lacking is the inclusion
    of real time information about events elsewhere in the farm to alter irrigation
    decisions. For example, information about possible weather changes, like rain,
    from other networks in a catchment could be used to change time and quantity of
    irrigation by allowing forward planning and prediction. Also, information regarding
    irrigation in one farm can be used elsewhere in the catchment to prohibit entry
    of nutrient flux from that runoff. 5. Research gap in water quality monitoring
    and management using WSNs The literature review for the application of WSN for
    water quality monitoring and agricultural activities presents many possibilities
    and potential, yet identifies numerous limitations. Following are the major limitations
    commonly observed in the reviewed literature. 5.1. Absence of catchment scale
    integrated monitoring and management As identified in chapter 2, a number of catchment-scale
    activities are responsible for water quality degradation. Therefore, to identify
    the individual and major impacts of the diffused pollutant sources, it is vital
    to base the monitoring system on the entire catchment. It has been acknowledged
    in the literature that the varied monitoring needs for individual areas of a catchment
    could be combined to allow an understanding of contaminant flow trends and quantification
    of the contributing factors. WSNs have been successful in understanding the trends
    of nutrients and contaminants fluxes owing to non-point source activities in a
    catchment. However, this understanding is limited as it can currently only use
    small-scale, localised and specific measurements at rivers, lakes, dams and groundwater
    reservoirs (Ramanathan et al., 2006, Le Dinh et al., 2007, Zennaro et al., 2009,
    Papoutsa et al., 2010, Seders et al., 2007, Harmon et al., 2007, O’Flynn et al.,
    2010, Regan et al., 2009). These water resources receive contaminants as a result
    of activities up in the catchment, thus providing insufficient information for
    quantifying explicit responsible activities. Fewer applications are intended for
    large-scale observations (Kido et al., 2008, Kotamäki et al., 2009, Cayan et al.,
    2003), but these are prototype deployments based on limited monitoring points
    across the catchment. A major step in this direction is the new network of terrestrial
    environmental observatories in Germany that provides real-time access to instruments
    in a multi-scale and multi-temporal mode for the monitoring of relevant fluxes
    of trace-gases, water and matter in all important environmental compartments at
    the catchment-scale, e.g. hydrological sensor networks, micrometeorological flux
    stations and clusters of lysimeters (Zacharias et al., 2011). Existing work does
    not implement multi-scale monitoring mechanisms that include all stakeholders
    in a catchment, to assess their individual contributions, which is fundamental
    for the understanding of cumulative impacts on water quality degradation. Current
    projects are focused on the development and deployment of the required infrastructure
    for enabling high-temporal, real-time water-quality observations to be made available
    through GSM or internet on a central data repository (Kotamäki et al., 2009, Kido
    et al., 2008). These do not include addressing management and control decisions,
    to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder’s nutrient/contaminant contributions,
    in an autonomous and dynamic manner. Thus a need can be identified for an autonomous
    and integrated catchment-scale monitoring mechanism, based on targeted wireless
    sensor technologies. 5.2. Absence of suitable sensors Water quality analysis requires
    monitoring of various parameters as represented in the tabulated contaminant constituents
    (Table 1). It is apparent that the advances in sensor development have not kept
    pace with the advances in potential sensor materials (Zhuiykov, 2012). The development
    of sensors from new materials to enable solid-state and film-based sensors requires
    significant development effort before they can be used in real applications, although
    they do offer significant potential. An example of an improved sensor is the development
    of a solid-state water quality sensor with metal oxide sensing electrodes under
    research efforts by Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).
    This has provided the capability to measure pH, DO and dissolved metal ions in
    a way more appropriate for WSN applications (Zhuiykov, 2007, Zhuiykov, 2012).
    It is evident through the surveyed literature that existing work does not include
    all of the contaminants and parameters required for water quality monitoring,
    for example phosphorous, nitrates, and ammonia. This is because suitable in situ
    phosphate and nitrate sensors for terrestrial deployment are not available. The
    available sensors for nitrate monitoring are based on ultraviolet absorption and
    flow cell analysers which are very expensive for dense deployment (Robertson et
    al., 2009). Both electromechanical (Bobacka et al., 2008) and optical sensing
    modes (McDonagh et al., 2008) relevant to nitrogen and phosphorous species are
    still an active research area (Rundel et al., 2009). Furthermore, research on
    the development of miniature, reliable and inexpensive water quality solid-state
    sensors using metal oxide sensing electrodes is underway by CSIRO, CMSE and SSN
    TCP laboratories (Zhuiykov, 2012). In the absence of affordable and reliable in
    situ sensors for all of the necessary water quality parameters, estimation of
    constituent fluxes in streams and rivers relies on surrogate sensors which give
    proxy measurements. Examples include use of turbidity (clarity of water) and fluorescence
    intensities as a surrogate for suspended sediments and biochemical oxygen demand
    (Minella et al., 2008, Hudson et al., 2008). Another study demonstrated successful
    surrogate relationship, for road and roof surfaces, of dissolved total nitrates
    and total phosphates with total dissolved solids (TDSs). For measuring TDS, electrical
    conductivity was used as a surrogate (Miguntanna, 2009). These surrogates have
    been fundamental in advancing our knowledge about the trends in the actual parameters.
    However it is also noted that measurement error and uncertainty in the derived
    surrogate relationships can have a substantial effect on the uncertainty of flux
    estimates made using surrogates (Horsburgh et al., 2010) and require significant
    calibration of the environments in which they are deployed. Although sensor development
    is on-going (Zhuiykov, 2012), there are still few useable sensors for many of
    the parameters, thus it can be concluded that there is a requirement for accurate,
    inexpensive, low-power, long-lived, robust and miniature sensors for effective
    water quality analysis. 5.3. Issues related to the use of off-the-shelf components
    Current applications of WSNs for WQM are based on the use of off-the-shelf components
    which often fail to address the diverse range of environmental and degradation
    problems that can coalesce at catchment scales. Existing devices are not made
    to address the specific requirements of a particular application. Various limitations,
    as discussed above, have been faced in the existing literature by the use of off
    the shelf components (Le Dinh et al., 2007) such as the coverage problem (Regan
    et al., 2009), signal attenuation (Vellidis et al., 2008), configuration and operational
    difficulties (Trubilowicz et al., 2009), and absence of a network model for catchment
    areas with hilly terrains which has the potential to affect the radio links. Standards
    for WSNs were developed primarily for urban monitoring situations such as buildings
    and industries. However, they are less suited to remote and large scale applications
    such as agriculture with coverage and crop canopy problems due to the propagation
    environment and typical range requirements. For example, high frequency systems
    (typically 2.4 GHz) commonly rely on line-of-sight systems and physical obstructions
    such as plants, or conditions such as rain, can significantly reduce the communication
    range to as little as a few metres. Furthermore, these frequencies are unsuitable
    for underground WSNs, which are ideal for non-invasive soil monitoring, as they
    suffer data losses due to soil water content (Akyildiz and Stuntebeck, 2006, Li
    et al., 2007). In an experiment, sensor and link failures were handled by: (1)
    identifying patterns in data to indicate sensor failure and (2) using decision
    trees based on data flow models to identify link failure (Ramanathan et al., 2006).
    Top level concepts and protocols are applicable without any changes but care is
    needed for practical deployment and it may be that certain applications require
    a significant rethink of the communication requirements, which may not be addressed
    by current off-the-shelf solutions. This is an on-going research for the application
    of underground wireless sensor networks. (Bogena et al., 2009) evaluated signal
    attenuation by factors like soil depth, soil water content and soil electrical
    conductivity. They concluded that in a hybrid underground approach, which combines
    below ground and above ground data transmission, sufficient power will remain
    to ensure long distant data communication. As long term and spatiotemporal monitoring
    is required for effective analysis of water degradation trends in a catchment,
    a low cost, low power and reliable system is required. Existing literature has
    shown that many nodes lasted from only a few days to months, therefore effective
    design changes like wake up and power control need to be considered to prolong
    their lifetime to years. Furthermore, although separate sensor boards (Zennaro
    et al., 2009, O’Flynn et al., 2007) can be integrated with nodes to enable a multi
    sensing system with various sensor types, improvements can be made to take this
    further. The plug and play system constrains sensors to be compatible with that
    system, whereas a more reconfigurable interface may well extend the choice of
    sensors at the expense of some complexity in specifying to the host node what
    the sensor requires in terms of resources. Therefore, there is a requirement for
    a reconfigurable sensor interface for a sensor node, e.g. SDI-12, as this would
    allow a more rapid deployment for a specific application and thereby reducing
    the costs of the WSNs. In addition, various deployment and maintenance issues
    were faced due to the placement of sensors in soil and water. Bio-fouling of sensors
    deployed in water required regular cleaning and maintenance (Regan et al., 2009).
    6. A case for collaborative WSNs for integrated catchment-scale water quality
    management Through the review of related work and its limitations, it is established
    that for effective water quality management at a catchment scale, a system of
    individually networked activities needs to be included into an integrated monitoring
    system. Information sharing of critical parameters between networked environmental
    compartments and WSN-controlled agricultural activities can enable identification
    and quantification of the contributing factors in water degradation. This would
    further address management and control decisions, to minimise and prevent individual
    stakeholder’s nutrient/contaminant contributions, on waterways as well as on other
    stakeholders, in an autonomous and dynamic manner (Zia et al., 2013). Fig. 4 illustrates
    information sharing among individual networks in a catchment. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Collaborative catchment-scale management using integrated
    WSNs. It is proposed that monitoring should be based on three levels covering
    the micro-to macro- scales. Micro-scale monitoring is aimed at improved understanding
    of small scale processes such as leaching of nutrients in soil and groundwater
    and retention of fertilizers by soil. Then a medium scale monitoring which is
    focused on assessing agricultural practices such as improved irrigation strategies,
    and use of alternative fertilizers or reduced application rates while maintaining
    same crop yields. Finally, macro-scale monitoring considers catchment level, sub-catchment
    level and regional land use assessments. Monitoring environmental compartments
    continuously and spatially can identify specific local sources for nutrient/contaminant
    fluxes (e.g. a barn or a farm). If this information is fed back to the identified
    stakeholder in real time, there is the potential to control or minimise the fluxes
    emanating from the location. If there are other networks monitoring nutrient/contaminant
    levels and fluxes near the source location, then the information provided by these
    networks can be correlated with data from the original monitoring point. If it
    correlates well then this has identified a route from the source to the appropriate
    nearby network as well as characterising that route in terms of quantity and time
    constant, thus allowing a model of cause and effect to be built up for the locality.
    Based on this information, the responsible stakeholder can then assess its adopted
    practices and alter strategies to reduce its contribution to water quality degradation.
    A collaborative control and management strategy requires that individually targeted
    monitoring units or local networks, representing different stakeholders in a catchment
    e.g. a farm, should be able to share information with each other about runoffs,
    contaminants or nutrient fluxes. These events may be intense but are short-lived
    and so information sharing becomes important as they may be very fast compared
    with the usual sampling rate, and so may normally be missed. Allowing event information
    to be transmitted across multiple networks as they are detected will allow prediction
    of when the repercussions of that event might be seen downstream, allowing other
    stakeholder networks in the vicinity to adjust their monitoring strategy to improve
    the value of information e.g. by increasing their sample rate to catch transient
    events. This would than support the development of advanced models that are able
    to simulate catchment processes in a more detailed way. Implementing such a mechanism
    allows every stakeholder the option to contribute and use any data flowing through
    the catchment from other networks. 7. Conclusion This paper has reviewed the potential
    impact of agricultural activities on water quality degradation in a catchment.
    It has proposed that the varied monitoring needs for individual areas of a catchment
    could be combined to allow an understanding of contaminant flow trends, their
    quantification and management of the contributing factors. This identifies a need
    for an autonomous and collaborative mechanism, based on targeted wireless sensor
    technologies. Furthermore, it is concluded that for effective and integrated water
    quality monitoring and management at a catchment scale, a system of individually
    networked activities is needed. This is likely to take the form of a combination
    of networks that have been installed for local monitoring purposes (e.g. at farm
    scale, primarily to provide local information for that farm), and some specific
    networks aimed at filling in information gaps in the catchment. This system of
    networks should be able to share information about critical parameters for events,
    such as rain, or floods, that could trigger consequences, such as contaminants
    runoff and so requires a higher level application to make use of this information,
    and also requires the individual networks to be aware that similar networks nearby
    are capable of passing information to them. This will inevitably lead to some
    form of standardisation of communication protocol and data representation between
    enabled environmental networks. Applications of WSNs for water quality monitoring
    and management for a catchment hold huge potential. However, certain limitations
    have been identified in this review such as small scale, single application deployments,
    limitations of off-the-shelf components, the lack of suitable sensors and the
    cost of deployment and data collection. Furthermore, it is determined that important
    application specific requirements are not well catered for by using off-the-shelf
    components such as variable sampling rates, well-defined and flexible sensor interfaces,
    lifetime, ease of deployment and configuration for hydrologists, and a network
    model for the broader environment. Hence, it is emphasized that although there
    is continual and improving design of sensor nodes for individual applications
    there is still a requirement for more flexibility in node design with a view to
    allowing networks to successfully interact with each other. In the absence of
    affordable and reliable in situ sensors for WQM, measurements rely on surrogate
    sensors which give proxy measurements. Therefore, it is concluded that there is
    still a need for accurate, inexpensive and miniature sensors with a long field
    life for WQM. Nevertheless, developments on all these areas are on-going, and
    as such deficiencies are addressed, the ability to monitor at catchment scales
    will improve. We argue that by implementing a collaborative mechanism that allows
    every stakeholder the option to contribute and use any data flowing through the
    networks, the overall value of that information will be increased. References

    Variable rate irrigation (VRI) is the capacity to spatially vary the depth of
    water application in a field to handle different types of soils, crops, and other
    conditions. Precise management zones must be developed to efficiently apply variable
    rate technologies. However, there is no universal method to determine management
    zones. Using speed control maps for the central pivot is one option. Thus, this
    study aims to develop an intelligent fuzzy inference system based on precision
    irrigation knowledge, i.e., a system that can create prescriptive maps to control
    the rotation speed of the central pivot. Satellite images are used in this study
    because remote sensing offers quick measurements and easy access to information
    on crops for large irrigation areas. Based on the VRI-prescribed map created using
    the intelligent decision-making system, the pivot can increase or decrease its
    speed, reaching the desired depth of application in a certain irrigation zone.
    Therefore, considering the spatial variability in the crop has made the strategy
    of speed control more realistic than traditional methods for crop management.
    The intelligent irrigation system pointed out areas with lower leaf development,
    indicating that the pivot must reduce its speed, thus increasing the water layer
    applied to that area. The existence of well-divided zones could be observed; each
    zone provides a specific value for the speed that the pivot must develop for decreasing
    or increasing the application of the water layer to the crop area. Three quarters
    of the total crop area had spatial variations during water application. The set
    point built by the developed system pointed out zones with a decreased speed in
    the order of 50%. From the viewpoint of a traditional control, the relay from
    pivot percent timer should have been adjusted from 70% to 35% whenever the central
    pivot passed over that specific area. The proposed system obtained values of 37%
    and 47% to adjust the pivot percent timer. Therefore, it is possible to affirm
    that traditional control models used for central-pivot irrigators do not support
    the necessary precision to meet the demands of speed control determined by the
    developed VRI systems. Results indicate that data from the edaphoclimatic variables
    when well-fitted to the fuzzy logic can solve uncertainties and non-linearities
    of an irrigation system and establish a control model for high-precision irrigation.

    The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations estimates that
    to meet food demands in 2050 agriculture production must at least double or triple
    in the next 40 years, and 80% of this increase must come from increasing the production.
    Considering the limited resources of our planet, reaching this goal will be challenging
    (FAO, 2016). The adoption of irrigated agriculture enables increased productivity
    and the production of several crops (Borghetti, Silva, Nocko, Loyola, & Chianca,
    2017). However, with the growing limitation of water resources, the use of water
    in agriculture must be more efficient to maintain the current levels of productivity
    in conjunction with the expansion of irrigated areas. Decisions for irrigation
    management require taking into consideration inter-related economic, physical,
    and biological variables, which are frequently difficult to foresee and over which
    there is little or no control (Herrera, Ibeas, & de la Sen, 2013). The decade-long
    search for automated solutions to improve agricultural application for more efficient
    use (Evans and King, 2012, Gilley et al., 1983, Omary et al., 1997, Sadler et
    al., 1996) has resulted in the introduction of several solutions for agricultural
    inputs to conduct water application with spatial correction. Irrigation systems
    that operate using variable rate water application are required for a spatial
    water management to increase crop efficiency (Armindo, Botrel, & Garzella, 2011).
    Decision support systems for irrigation and water conservation are used intensely
    for minimizing water application and maximizing yield. However, the numerical
    optimization of irrigation systems is computer-intensive and often requires simplification
    and discretization of the model (Dogan et al., 2010, Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016).
    Furthermore, sensorial system and model integration do not reflect the natural
    flow of the environment (Voinov & Shugart, 2013), creating significant limitations
    in performance. Control systems also do not reflect or satisfy the requirements
    of the final users due to the lack of domain knowledge capture (McIntosh et al.,
    2011). The use of advanced control techniques is a promising possibility. Literature
    shows that these tools can significantly improve irrigation systems and efficient
    use of water resources (McCarthy et al., 2013, Romero et al., 2012). The final
    challenge of an environmental and agricultural support system is to overcome the
    uncertainty related to data quality and difficulties in remote sensing of large
    areas (Dutta et al., 2014, McCarthy et al., 2013). Moreover, the inter-related
    economic, physical, and biological variables are multi-attributed vaguely and
    in subjective terms. A neat approach to deal with such uncertain situations is
    found in the fuzzy set theory, which has now reached a mature state for expansion
    and application. Zadeh''s paper “Fuzzy Sets” was published in 1965; since then,
    the theory of fuzzy sets has been used for writing more realistic decision support
    models. Fuzzy logic can analyze the imprecise information and is efficient in
    decision-making for vague and uncertain phenomena (Kweon, 2012). Specialized systems
    that used fuzzy logic in its inception have been successfully applied to problems
    concerning decision, control, diagnose, and classification (Castillo & Melin,
    2008) because they are capable of managing intrinsic complex reasoning in an application
    area. In agriculture, the interface of these systems allows a natural and straightforward
    use, as a planning tool for the manager and farmer. In irrigation systems, the
    interaction between components is not always accurately defined. Fuzzy logic can
    be used in such systems for extracting inferences from an inaccurate input and
    for solving problems in this area (Thangavadivelu & Colvin, 1997). An irrigation
    system based on the fuzzy logic with simple rules is more attractive to most farmers
    (Bahat, Inbar, Yaniv, & Schneider, 2000) since these systems do not require a
    precise measurement or a precise model, which may be very complicated and require
    considerable funds, resources and development time. This study is based on the
    premise that irrigation problems do not require precise measures. The support
    system to the fuzzy decision is considered useful due to its interactive nature
    and flexible approach (Kumar and Rajkumar, 2014, Raju and Kumar, 2005); therefore,
    the integration of fuzzy logic and irrigation planning issues in the field is
    very effective. Herein, several control techniques for VRI have been presented,
    of which some use fuzzy inference and neural networks for setting the amount of
    water required for irrigation (Bing et al., 2015, Giusti and Marsili-Libelli,
    2015, Papadopoulos et al., 2011, Papageorgiou et al., 2016). Other techniques
    focus on determining when to irrigate and instruments that show spatial differences
    among sectors in the same crop area (Montalvo et al., 2013, Omid et al., 2010,
    Rafea et al., 2003). However, all the techniques mentioned do not present control
    maps for the central pivot, as proposed herein. The problem examined herein is
    part of the crop production domain, approaching the issue of necessary decision-making
    for precision irrigation. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to develop
    a fuzzy inference system that decides when to increase or decrease the speed of
    the central pivot by considering the spatial variability of the field and using
    little or imprecise information of the phenophase of the crop provided by satellite
    images. 2. Variable rate irrigation system (VRIS) An intelligent irrigation system
    was developed by following the structure shown in Fig. 1. The structure of the
    proposed system allows the elaboration of the management map in a systematic,
    autonomous, and automatized way to control the irrigation system. The commercial
    systems used more frequently by farmers still cannot draw such a control map using
    the proposed technique. Download : Download high-res image (291KB) Download :

    irrigation system. Source: Author''s archives. 2.1. Data 2.1.1. Normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) and canopy temperature Vegetation indexes generated from
    the data gathered by remote sensing constitute an important tool for monitoring
    natural or anthropogenic changes in the use and coverage of the land. These indexes
    have been used to estimate several vegetation patterns, such as leaf area index
    and green biomass quantity, as well as in the evaluation of soil use and the maintenance
    and recovery of degraded areas (Okin, 2007). Information from satellite images
    and values from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) reading, which
    is an essential parameter for irrigation maintenance, were used and adjusted according
    to local conditions. Irrigation management through the plant shows the complexity
    inherent to the visualization of the symptoms of water deficit, which are difficult
    to detect. In certain occasions, problems are discovered when it is too late,
    i.e., when their effects have already compromised the production and quality of
    the product. Usually, these symptoms are related to the color tone of leaves,
    leaf curling, and leaf angle. However, a correlation between NDVI values and the
    basal crop coefficient (Kc) (Hunsaker, Barnes, Clarke, Fitzgerald, & Pinter, 2005;
    and Kamble, Kilic, & Hubbard, 2013) can be established since a strong correlation
    exists between estimated Kc (KcNDVI) and observed Kc (Allen, Pereira, Raes, &
    Smith, 1998/FAO-56) in corn and soy crops for guiding irrigation times in the
    season. The use of canopy temperature and infrared thermometry is another way
    to relate to the development of the crop through remote sensing. A plant under
    water stress has decreased transpiration and would typically show a higher temperature
    than a plant that is not under stress (Bellvert, Zarco-Tejada, Girona, & Fereres,
    2014), a trait that could be used as a powerful tool to monitor and quantify water
    stress. Canopy temperature increases when solar radiation is absorbed (Idso &
    Baker, 1967), but it cools down when the latent energy or transpiration is used
    for evaporating water instead of cooling plant surfaces. Further, algorithms based
    on canopy temperature are strongly correlated with quantifiable results from crops
    (Colaizzi, O''Shaughnessy, Evett, & Howell, 2012), such as yield, water efficiency
    use, seasonal evapotranspiration, leaf water potential at noon, irrigation rates,
    and damage caused by herbicides. 2.2. Satellite imagery The Intelligent Environmental
    Knowledgeable system (i-ekbase)1 is an autonomous big data analytics engine running
    a CLOUD system. i-ekbase is an easy-to-use fully automated geographic information
    system (GIS). It primarily focuses on precision agricultural and biodiversity
    monitoring applications, automatically integrating data from various satellites
    with local weather data, farmers’ knowledge, and applying Machine Learning techniques
    to create a data-driven future for global agriculture (Dutta et al., 2014). Fig.

    all-purpose precision agricultural monitoring on a mobile device, for greater
    benefit to global agriculture community, and for increasing agriculture business
    profitability. The system services provide weekly or daily large area-wise resource
    management map products, including normalized vegetation index (NDVI), soil moisture,
    biomass, surface temperature, vegetation landscape maps for supporting remote
    digital scouting, large area-wise farm monitoring and decision support system,
    and rapid intervention of a management issue. Herein, we used the i-ekbase system
    for capturing timely remote sensing imagery on the study site using Landsat (with
    a spatial resolution of 15 m) and Sentinel (with a spatial resolution of 10 m)
    satellites. Data were captured for 12 months for developing the experimental system.
    Data that compose this image have over 14 thousand geo-referential points, which
    indicate a raster type structure, containing in each point or pixel that attributes
    for agricultural analysis. Given the size of the data, only a few lines are shown
    in Table 1. Different types of software are available on the market, which can

    the web tool i-ekbase (Table 1), the information is pre-processed to filter the
    data that are not required by the decision-making system. Thus, only canopy temperature,
    upper layer soil moisture, NDVI, and coordinates are considered (Table 2). Table

    29.58 Source: adapted from the i-ekbase system (2017). For applying this approach
    on a commercial scale, remote sensing data required to describe the soil–plant–atmosphere
    relation can be acquired from satellite images (Moran, Inoue, & Barnes, 1997)
    and airplanes (Fitzgerald et al., 2006, Wood et al., 2003). However, high costs,
    spatial resolution, data frequency and data availability (Pinter et al., 2003,
    Trout et al., 2008), as well as satellite cloudless images (Barker, Heeren, Neale,
    & Rudnick, 2018) are challenges for the correct execution of models based on remote
    sensing; these factors can limit the efficiency of VRI management in real time.
    Remote sensing data that accurately describe the soil–plant–atmosphere relationship
    was selected for the intelligent irrigation system at the crop location. In this
    stage, accurately choosing the best data is fundamental to ensure that the results
    are calculated correctly. A simple but promising approach uses culture coefficients
    from normalized differentiated variation indexes, combined with local climate
    data, to assume the amount of ETc (evapotranspiration) of variable crops almost
    at real time (Er-Raki et al., 2007, González-Dugo and Mateos, 2008, Hunsaker et
    al., 2005). With some consideration of the daily meteorological conditions, models
    based on remote sensing can be used in studies of water relations (Barker et al.,
    2018) in the soil–plant–atmosphere system and could become an easy-to-use and
    fast response tool. Canopy temperature is also an important parameter to manage
    irrigation and must be adjusted according to local crop conditions. From the location
    selected for cultivation and the type of crop to be irrigated, in relation to
    the data linked to the type of plant, a crop coefficient will be used together
    with information from satellite images. In this case, NDVI reading, upper layer
    soil moisture, and canopy temperature values will be used. 2.3. Crop area The
    crop area is a farm at Primavera do Leste, Mato Grosso state, Brazil, latitude
    15°14′24.73′′S and longitude 54°0′53.29′′W. This area contains several crops,
    such as soy, cotton, and “safrinha” corn, irrigated by a central pivot. The delimited
    area is 140 ha, with a radius of 667 m (see Fig. 3). The area delimited by the
    red circle is irrigated with a central pivot, and the information used in this
    study is for a cultivation cycle of “safrinha” corn in 2015/2016. To irrigate
    “safrinha” corn means to provide minimum water conditions for the development
    of the crop. Corn is highly sensitive to drought. Therefore, the occurrence of
    a period of lower water intake by plants in critical moments for the development
    of the crop, from flowering to physiological maturation, can lead to the lower
    yield. For maximum yield, corn plantation needs approximately 650 mm of water
    (Bergamaschi et al., 2001) during its cycle, which varies from 110 to 140 days
    in hybrids with an average cycle. Download : Download high-res image (295KB) Download

    archives. Plant development is made evident by the images captured by remote sensing
    during growth. After analyzing the NDVI values contained in Fig. 4, the similarity
    among values attributed to crop coefficient (Kc) can be verified (Hunsaker et
    al., 2005; and Kamble et al., 2013). As the crop develops, the leaf area increases,
    which makes it possible to establish a NDVI relationship. Download : Download

    in a crop cycle. Source: Author''s archives. This process is also described by
    Hunsaker et al. (2005), with relations for calculating the basal crop coefficient
    (Kcb) for cotton as a function of NDVI. When each of the development phases of
    the crop is analyzed, two distinct areas are evident: one with little growth and
    another with average growth. From this differentiation, it is possible to build
    a water demand map as well as speed control maps. For the preliminary analysis,
    the daily average precipitation data made available by National Institute of Meteorology2
    (INMET) were used. Data were collected from April to September 2016 in the municipality
    of Primavera do Leste, Mato Grosso state, Brazil. Fig. 5 illustrates the obtained
    data. Finally, precipitation readings recorded during the development of the crop
    under study corroborate with the premise of water stress due to the lack of rain,
    which would indicate the possibility of complementing the water demand with irrigation.

    Monitoring System. 2.4. Fuzzy systems Over the last 20 years, fuzzy systems have
    attracted considerable attention and have met great applicability in the agricultural
    domain, helping farmers to make the right decisions for their crops (Papageorgiou
    et al., 2016). For example, Bahat et al. (2000) proposed a solution for an irrigation
    controller based on the fuzzy logic methodology with simple rules, making the
    system more attractive for farmers. Raj and Kumar (2005) observed that the integration
    of fuzzy logic and real-world irrigation planning problems are very useful, particularly
    with multiple specialists in a subjective data environment. Upon using fuzzy systems
    for decision-making concerning irrigation, Zhang, Fei, Wei, Congcong, and Yuewei
    (2011) reported that fuzzy logic does not require all the relevant information
    for solving the problem of water in irrigation. Bing, Huifeng, and Xia (2015)
    developed a fuzzy system of decision-making for solving uncertainties and non-linearity
    of the irrigation system, and the model showed high precision. The system of fuzzy
    inference proposed by Almeida, Vieira, Marques, Kiperstok, and Cardoso (2013),
    in turn, provided a conceptual approach based on the multi-criteria decision-making
    process. This approach relates water use to environmental factors, such as drought,
    water exploration index, water use, population density, and wastewater treatment
    index, resulting in warnings about future water supply. Irrigation based on the
    fuzzy inference system presents better results than traditional methods. The fuzzy
    system will be used to infer the variations in the linear movement speed of the
    pivot according to satellite images. An intelligent system was developed, manipulating
    various data-driven approaches to create a control map. Due to the nature of the
    management of the study area, fuzzy systems are used herein to aid irrigation
    decision-making. Because a farmer''s decisions are purely intuitive and knowledge-based
    gained over years of work, we chose not to describe the way the farm works explicitly.
    Another critical piece in the farmer''s routine was that the pivot utilized extensive
    amount of time to perform a full turn. However, the central pivot irrigation system
    should operate 21 h a day, with 3 h for maintenance because high electricity prices
    are charged by the utility. Three input variables were used (NDVI, upper layer
    soil moisture, and canopy temperature) to infer the speed, which the central pivot
    has to reach to improve the irrigation level within the crop area, and to find
    an adequate speed for the pivot movement in relation to the amount of water coming
    out of the sprinklers. Futhermore, a decision unit or inference machine is implemented
    using the Mamdani method to conduct the rule-based inference operations with crisp
    input and crisp output. Mamdani fuzzy systems use fuzzy sets as a consequent rule;
    therefore, the inference method for a set of conjunctive rules for the rth rule
    will be given by the following condition: (1) Within the objective proposed for
    the developed system, once linguistic variables are applied to the output of fuzzy
    inference systems, it becomes fitter for modeling the human reflection process.
    By doing so, the interface of the system becomes more straightforward and natural.
    In the first stage of development, the water layer provided by the irrigation
    system is considered constant. The database that defines the association functions
    of sets used in the fuzzy rules is implemented according to Table 3 and Fig. 6.

    the universe of discourse for each input variable and therefore change the database
    into linguistic variables, as shown in Table 3. Each input was previously limited
    to the discourse universe in question and associated to the grade of membership
    in each fuzzy set through specialized knowledge. Therefore, to obtain the grade
    of membership of a certain crisp input, one must search for this value in the
    fuzzy system knowledge. The fuzzification of the decision-making system in Fig.
    6 helps to visualize the corresponding membership functions, considering these
    intervals as the discourse universe of the variables. Triangular membership functions
    were chosen because they simplify the calculation of the fuzzy inference mechanism
    and couple to the fuzzy rules IF-THEN (Wang, 1997). Well distributed triangular
    membership functions change input data into fuzzy values (low, average, and high),
    as shown in Fig. 6a, as well as values for soil moist and NDVI (Fig. 6b and c,
    respectively). Fuzzy outputs, which represent the rotation speed of the central
    pivot, were built from five linguistic variables: very low (MB), low (B), normal
    (N), high (A), and very high (MA). All the sets were interpreted based on their
    membership functions, as shown in Fig. 7. Several defuzzification methods have
    been proposed (Dubois & Prade, 2000), of which CENTROID (area center or center
    of gravity) is more widely used. For this method, a clear value of the output
    variable is calculated by finding the variable for the center of gravity of the
    association function for the fuzzy value (Jang, Sun, & Mizutani, 1997) as follows:

    Finally, the fuzzy rule relating to rotation speed contains 27 rules, as summarized
    in Table 3. Therefore, the reading of the first line, for example, is IF NDVI
    = Low AND Canopy Temperature = Low AND Soil Moisture = Low THEN Rotation Speed = Low.
    This set of rules is based on basic knowledge of irrigation, according to the
    methodology adopted in Bernardo, Soares, and Mantovani (2006) and Silva and Azevedo
    (1998). The rules were elaborated with the connective “AND” and are based on the
    premise that little leaf growth is due to water deficit in the soil (Boyer, 1968,
    Hsiao, 1973, Wright, 1977) along with high canopy temperature, which indicates
    low evapotranspiration, in other words, plants under water stress. Values of moisture
    close to the soil given by the web tool are local readings of spots with fewer
    leaves, making it possible to estimate its value. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.
    Control maps for pivot rotation speed For mapping the speed control system herein,
    eight crop areas were stipulated with a level of ambiguity regarding the impact
    of the variable application rate (Feinerman & Voet, 2000), given that an increase
    in the flexibility of input application through field subdivision in a higher
    number of management unities did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the total
    (optimal) water use. The images showing different growth stages of the plantation
    were analyzed. The development stage [Kc-Development] was the one that presented
    the highest water stress in different planted areas, as shown in Table 5. Furthermore,
    performing the analysis of critical point was essential to demonstrate the applicability
    of fuzzy systems to create the control maps. Table 5. Analysis of the best dates

    The information extracted after pre-processing remote sensing data was NDVI, canopy
    temperature, and upper layer soil moisture. These values are the input data set
    for the fuzzy system, which is capable of inferring percentages for the central
    pivot rotation speed motion. The case study corresponds to the sampling of two
    readings obtained from different dates of the crop cycle: the first on June 15,
    2016 and the second on June 28, 2016. 3.2. Case study on June 15th, 2016 The input
    set for the intelligent fuzzy system is the analyzed and processed data on canopy
    temperature, moisture close to the soil, and NDVI (see Table 2) illustrated in
    Fig. 8a–c. The input, as shown in Fig. 8, was organized according to the linguistic
    variables of the fuzzy system and separated by tones for better visualization.
    Due to the nature of the central pivot speed control equipment, the output given
    by the fuzzy system was in percentage values. The per centimeter, which was responsible
    for rotational speed control, used only the reference percentage of rotation in
    relation to the time of 60 s. Thus, for the values of 50% (represented in orange
    in Fig. 9), the control made the pivot stay in operation for 30 s and off for
    30 s. The intelligent system obtained the result shown in Fig. 9, which illustrates
    different regions within the area, with different values for the pivot rotation
    speed. Download : Download high-res image (934KB) Download : Download full-size

    Fig. 9. Output data for the fuzzy inference system: rotation speed of the central
    pivot. Source: Author''s archives. Analysis of the input data identified the existence
    of two broad areas with lower leaf development, which could indicate a lack of
    water for development. After processing input data, the intelligent irrigation
    system showed these areas of lower leaf development in a more intense red tone.
    This indicates that the pivot must reduce its speed, thus increasing the water
    layer in that specific location, because the rotation speed of the pivot determines
    the level of the water layer applied. A thinner water layer is applied with higher
    speed and a higher application of water in the soil occurs with lower rotation
    speed (Valín, Cameira, Teodoro, & Pereira, 2012). The expected result was the
    creation of control maps; in this case, it was possible to determine the reference
    speed values for eight initially programmed zones, as shown in Fig. 10. Moreover,
    areas that present different colors in Fig. 9 are shown in the control map result,
    which illustrates the existence of well-divided zones. In each one, a specific
    value is observed for the speed that the pivot must reach to increase or decrease
    the water layer in the crop area. Download : Download high-res image (181KB) Download

    3.3. Case study on June 28th, 2016 Data analyzed and processed by the SIG can
    be used as inputs for the fuzzy intelligent system. Fig. 11 shows the NDVI images,
    temperature images, and soil moisture images. Download : Download high-res image

    of input variables for the fuzzy system with linguistic definitions necessary
    for interpretation. The intelligent system of irrigation obtained the result shown
    in Fig. 12, which illustrates different regions within the crop area with different
    values of pivot rotation. A higher rotation speed implies the application of a
    thinner water layer, and a lower rotation speed leads to more water application
    in the soil, given that the application flow is kept constant in the sprinklers.

    Source: Author''s archives. Once the satellite images are compared again, NDVI
    and canopy temperature are essential for the decision-making process of the intelligent
    irrigation system. The large areas with a lower leaf development could indicate
    a lack of water for development. In the case of the output of the intelligent
    irrigation system, more intense red areas indicate that the pivot must reduce
    its speed. In this study, the reference values of the rotation speed of the pivot
    for the eight initially programmed zones of irrigation were determined, as shown
    in Fig. 13. In this result, the areas with different colors in Fig. 12 are the
    result of the control map constructed and are shown in Fig. 13. Irrigation zones
    were well divided, which makes it is possible to see an absolute value for the
    rotation speed of each pivot, increasing and decreasing the water layer applied
    to the cultivation area. The result shown in Fig. 13b corresponds to reference
    values to be sent to the pivot controller. Download : Download high-res image

    fuzzy system for irrigation control is original and innovative. No similar discussion
    in the scientific literature about speed control maps of the central pivot was
    found. Furthermore, there is no information available on commercial systems that
    can autonomously build this type of map. Experiments demonstrated the potential
    effectiveness of the pivot operation based on the differences between velocities
    by management zones. The system follows the definition of VRI; once the speed
    changes, there are changes in the amount of supplied water. In this context, fuzzy
    logic can be applied widely in agricultural areas; therefore, a decision support
    system can be build that has the knowledge of precision irrigation. The implementation
    of fuzzy logic decision support system was successful to develop prescription
    maps for VRI with central pivots. However, a broader and commercial application
    will depend on the integration of data collection systems, management strategies,
    and hardware control. In other words, the fuzzy logic model performed as expected,
    providing excellent results. However, the reliability of data sources (NDVI, surface
    soil water, and canopy temperature) to develop a reliable prescription map is
    the scope of future study. The future study will focus on the field implementations
    and determine whether any additional data (different types of data, high-quality
    data, and/or more frequent data) will be required for developing the map. In this
    analysis, the rotation speed control extracted through inference does not consider
    the volume of the water layer to be applied. The interpretation given by the fuzzy
    system is as follows: where there is variation in the plant growth, there will
    be variation in water demand. To solve this, more data should be collected to
    validate the system for various scenarios in near future. The results were favorable
    to the continuity of studies on precision irrigation and application of the fuzzy
    logic for creating central pivots irrigation systems maps. Future research should
    implement this decision support system into field trials to evaluate its ability
    to reduce irrigation pumping and/or improve crop yield. Contributorship statement

    To solve the complexities, the use of fuzzy theories and fuzzy intelligent systems
    is proper (Kokkonis, Kontogiannis, & Tomtsis, 2017; Mendes, Araújo, Dutta, & Heeren,

    such as the position of the pivot, water pressure or the irrigation rate. In the
    variable rate irrigation (VRI) (Mendes et al., 2019), the amount of irrigation
    in each section is controlled using the GPS and varying the speed of the pivot''s
    movement. However, these types of solutions are, in general, very expensive for

    \ Introduction\nPrecision agriculture (PA) consists of managing crops by observing,\
    \ measuring, and acting against\nthe many variable factors that aﬀect them. Systems\
    \ for PA can be based on satellite navigation\nsystems or terrestrial systems\
    \ for geographic information and sensors located in the plot. These\nsystems collect\
    \ information to be used to make decisions with greater precision and to optimize\
    \ crop\nyields. PA contributes to producing a more eﬃcient and ecological agriculture.\
    \ It allows saving\non phytosanitary products, fertilizers, and reducing the amount\
    \ of nitrogen used. PA reduces costs\nand optimizes agriculture. It also reduces\
    \ the environmental impact by optimizing the use of water,\npesticides, and machinery\
    \ fuel; thus, greater production is obtained with fewer resources.\nIn order to\
    \ develop eﬃcient PA systems, there is an increasing trend towards using smart\
    \ decision\nsystems (SDS). The acceptance of SDS solutions in many industrial\
    \ sectors that specialize in agriculture\nis limited by the fact that building\
    \ an SDS requires a signiﬁcant investment of time and knowledge. If it\nis to\
    \ beneﬁt from technological advances, agricultural activity has therefore to absorb\
    \ not only technical\nexpertise, but also skilled knowledge of engineering. The\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) [1] can be used\nfor that purpose, despite several\
    \ immense challenges linked to big data analytics, cloud computing,\nand new business\
    \ models in SDS.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 216; doi:10.3390/agronomy9050216\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\n\

    \ reported rapid developments in the IoT and cloud computing, applied in this\
    \ \npaper to a field known as smart farming. Algorithmic training processes for\
    \ decision-making \nsupport are highly complex tasks, with many problematic issues\
    \ found in models that are \nautomatically induced from data through big data\
    \ applications [3]. Perhaps the most problematic is \nthe value chain that refers\
    \ to the sequence of activities from data capture to decision making, \ninvolving\
    \ data marketing, decision trees, and rule injection procedures. The advantage\
    \ of these \nmodels is that they consist of individual units of knowledge (rules)\
    \ that can be separately viewed, \nevaluated, processed, deleted, and even edited.\
    \ In a business process [4], for example, work laid out \nin a set of logically\
    \ related tasks can be performed to achieve a defined business outcome. \nBig\
    \ data represents the information assets that are characterized by high volumes,\
    \ high-speed \nprocessing and a variety of inputs. Processing such information\
    \ requires specific technology and \nanalytical methods [5] for their transformation\
    \ into a value chain. \nThis paper presents a complete implementation of a smart\
    \ decision support system prototype, \nwhich automatically learns decision rules\
    \ from data, thereby permitting the domain expert to edit \nthe resulting rule\
    \ base, which can apply the rules to achieve incoming objects. As agriculture\
    \ \nconsumes about 70% of all fresh water resources, one important aspect of green\
    \ farming is \neconomical and efficient use of water [6]. Water consumption percentages\
    \ can be decreased through \nefficient water management, where irrigation needs\
    \ are adjusted to supply. Decision trees generate \nrules to enhance the use of\
    \ irrigation water, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. A web platform can convert \n\
    the results of data-based decision making into user-friendly public information\
    \ that is only posted \nfollowing a decision maker review process. The major advantage\
    \ is integration into a unique \nplatform to control farming decisions such as\
    \ irrigation system control, fertilization, pesticides, and \nan open data network,\
    \ all in one. In addition, our system includes rules based on variable-rate \n\

    \ [6]. Water consumption percentages can be decreased through eﬃcient water\n\

    \ A web platform can convert the results of\ndata-based decision making into user-friendly\

    \ The major advantage is integration into a unique platform to control\nfarming\
    \ decisions such as irrigation system control, fertilization, pesticides, and\
    \ an open data network,\nall in one. In addition, our system includes rules based\
    \ on variable-rate irrigation (VRI) [7]. VRI is a\nnew technique that allows optimization\
    \ of irrigation application, considering the status of ﬁeld and\nweather. In most\
    \ cases, these systems are implemented by using a center pivot irrigation system\
    \ that\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 216\n3 of 19\ncan reduce the total irrigation water\
    \ volume required to grow ﬁeld crops. According to Reference [8],\nthis kind of\
    \ system is able to reduce irrigation water use by 8% compared to uniform irrigation\n\
    application. Considering this idea, we designed [9], developed, and tested an\
    \ intelligent system for\nirrigation control of urban lawns. The system is based\
    \ on the use of a multisensor node composed by\nhumidity and temperature for soil\
    \ and air, as well as a rain sensor. The multisensor node is controlled\nby an\
    \ intelligent algorithm that takes into account the real time values provided\
    \ by the sensors and the\nstored data of previous measurements. The intelligent\
    \ algorithm is responsible for analyzing the data\nand deciding on the amount\
    \ of water to be used in a given area. Using actual annual meteorological\nvalues\
    \ of a city with diﬀerent water requirements, the system’s operation was simulated.\
    \ The results\nshowed that for a landscaped area of about 140 ha, we could save\
    \ around 6% of the irrigation water,\nwhich would be equivalent to about 22 million\
    \ liters of water. Finally, the complete system behaves\nas a collaborative platform,\
    \ taking into account the experience of other users and previous events\nintroduced\
    \ into the system. A system with these features can help farmers to enhance the\
    \ activity\nsustainability, at the same time, that a more controlled use of chemical\
    \ products and natural resources\nwill protect our environment and groundwater\
    \ resources.\nThis study is organized as follows. Section 2 will present the reasoning\
    \ behind the study and\nrelated works. Section 3 will describe the individual\
    \ steps of the preparation process of a classiﬁcation\nrule set. Section 4 will\
    \ then detail the software components of the engine and, in Section 5, the web\n\
    platform and the processing of open data will be outlined. Finally, in Section\
    \ 6, the conclusions will\npresent the advantages of the demonstrated model and\
    \ future avenues of work will be suggested.\n2. Related Works\nThe generation\
    \ of “business rules” from data-mining results is an emerging research area. To\
    \ the\nbest of our knowledge, the only publicly available software solution to\
    \ business rule learning is\nRule Learner, which forms part of the Open-Rules\
    \ Decision Management System. According to\nthe SOA paradigm, software should\
    \ function as cooperating services, as described in a previous\nwork [1]. However,\
    \ there have been several experimental systems developed in the machine learning\n\
    community with related functionality. The Drools system [3], used in our solution,\
    \ is a business rules\nmanagement system that combines user needs and constraints\
    \ in the search space with interactive\nmining. The interactive nature of both\
    \ systems, MIME and Drools, can help to address the excessive\nnumber of rules\
    \ that typically form the output of rule learning. Additionally, in Reference\
    \ [4],\nwe showed that the database-pruning algorithm can signiﬁcantly reduce\
    \ the number of rules that\nDrools outputs, without adversely impacting on the\
    \ quality of the classiﬁer. The smart farming decision\nsystem proposed in this\
    \ paper is called PLATEM. Drools is the core of this system, which is integrated\n\
    in a single web application. The user can launch multiple farm functionalities,\
    \ export the results that\nare selected, and apply the rules on test data in auto\
    \ mode. The rule-learning algorithm used in Drools\nfor building the classiﬁer\
    \ from association rules is evaluated and described in detail in the following\n\
    sections. The software solution is presented and implemented in demo form. Its\
    \ main contribution,\nwith respect to the previous results in References [5,6],\
    \ is in the integration of the periodically sampled\nindoor and outdoor irrigation\
    \ system linked to a wireless sensor network, the SDS, and the web,\nwhich together\
    \ form the complete PLATEM system.\nThis pervasive paradigm [10] of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) is to increase the value of the\ninformation generated by the\
    \ number of interconnections between people and gadgets, denoted by\nthings, and\
    \ to transform of the processed information into knowledge for the beneﬁt of mankind\n\
    and society.\nThe architecture of the IoT unit [11] is built from a man-like neural\
    \ network (MLN) model and\nits modiﬁed model. Ubiquitous IoT refers to the global\
    \ IoT and its integration in multiple-unit IoTs.\nIts architecture employs a social\
    \ organization framework (SOF) model. The models for future IoTs are\nnot only\
    \ helpful to interpret the relationship between IoT and the real world, but are\
    \ also beneﬁcial for\nthe implementation of IoT in its current form.\nAgronomy\
    \ 2019, 9, 216\n4 of 19\nVazquez et al. explored [12] the diﬀerent criteria for\
    \ designing IoT architectural solutions, together\nwith illustrative examples\
    \ of prototypes that have implemented these approaches. Likewise, Misra [13]\n\
    proposed a community detection scheme in an integrated Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ and social network\n(SN) architecture. The paper follows a graph mining approach\
    \ to solve the problem in a complex\nnetwork of IoT and SN. There are a few studies\
    \ in the literature on community detection in SNs;\nhowever, to the best of our\
    \ knowledge, there are no speciﬁc studies that address the integration of IoT\n\
    and SN architecture.\nAtzori [14] analyzed the major opportunities arising from\
    \ the integration of social networking\nconcepts in the Internet of Things, presenting\
    \ the mainstream research activities and pointing to the\nmost critical technical\
    \ challenges.\nSmart farming technology is continuously reinventing new business\
    \ models using real-time data\nwith automated data-acquisition devices. The sector\
    \ needs open infrastructure between technologies,\nbecause of a concern that key\
    \ data processing techniques may become the exclusive domain of\nmultinational\
    \ AgTech corporations.\nIn the current market, applications developed by AgTech\n\
    corporations and AgBusiness companies, with patented speciﬁcations, are commonly\
    \ found for\nmachine manufacturing processes. There are also applications that\
    \ function exclusively with irrigation.\nThese underlying reasons prompt us to\
    \ work towards integrated components in technology, both for\ndevice interaction,\
    \ such as fertirrigation controllers, and for data processing, to produce information\n\
    for greater agricultural eﬃciency. Basing our work on agricultural knowledge,\
    \ and in consultation\nwith individual farmers and agronomists, the focus of this\
    \ work is on the development of a platform\nthat integrates the core control operations\
    \ and that monitors data on crop yields, in order to build\non synergetic results\
    \ from multidisciplinary expertise. PLATEM PA is a combination of a smart\nfertirrigation\
    \ manager application that displays historical data, and social networking forums\
    \ that\nshare productive data.\nThe main complexity of such applications is that\
    \ they require collaboration between many diﬀerent\nelements with diﬀerent contributions\
    \ to the data values and related decisions over the consequential\nactions. An\
    \ overview of current European applications in PA is presented below, identifying\
    \ the major\nfunctions of each one in comparison with PLATEM PA.\nTable 1 shows\
    \ the aspects that PLATEM introduces in relation to the diﬀerent elements of other\n\
    smart farming platforms. The integration of several tools in the main user proﬁle\
    \ is central to PLATEM,\nenabling the development of a social network between\
    \ professionals in diﬀerent areas where they can\ndiscuss data acquisitions, notiﬁcations,\
    \ and crops risks. The ultimate goal is an open communication\nprotocol and open\
    \ data platform between large precision agriculture technologies, oriented towards\n\
    indoor and outdoor VRF and VRI.\nSmart-Akis [15] represents the application of\
    \ modern information and communication technologies\n(ICT) in agriculture, leading\
    \ to what can be called a third Green Revolution.\nAgrivi [16] is a crop management\
    \ software for crop planning, monitoring, and analysis. Advice\nand relevant data\
    \ on tillage, sowing, fumigation, fertilization, irrigation, and harvesting, and\
    \ almost\nall other activities, can be accessed with a few clicks. In addition,\
    \ volumetric calculations, and costs\nand hours of work are suggested for each\
    \ activity. The processes, based on best practices gathered in\nrelation to over\
    \ 100 crops, are designed to improve productivity.\nThe main objective of the\
    \ sigAGROasesor [17] project is the development of decision support tools\nfor\
    \ the agricultural sector, through a web platform for online services to farmers,\
    \ assisting eﬃcient,\neﬀective, and competitive farming activities, based on environmental\
    \ and social sustainability.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 216\n5 of 19\nTable 1. Smart farming\

    Agronomy 2019, 9, 216\n6 of 19\nIn relation to a smart water-saving irrigation\
    \ system [18], X, Kehui et al. published a scientiﬁc\npaper based on an intelligent\
    \ irrigation programmer with sensory connectivity and 433 MHz ISM\ncommunication.\
    \ The research focused on applications in precision agriculture, using a wireless\n\
    humidity sensor. A network of wireless sensors was conﬁgured to monitor the moisture\
    \ content and\nthe amount of water in the ﬁeld soil samples. The architectures\
    \ of both the wireless sensor network and\nthe intelligent system were based on\
    \ the network of sampled irrigation controllers. The irrigation test\nwas performed\
    \ with real-time humidity data and expert inputs. A feasible system was demonstrated\
    \ in\nthe rice cultivation process, and a good exploration in the ﬁeld of precision\
    \ agriculture and sustainable\nwater resources.\nThe APOLLO project [19] shares\
    \ similarities with the PLATEM PA project proposal design.\nThe technology was\
    \ analyzed in depth for the consolidation of the PLATEM PA system, improving\n\
    its potential for use with other innovative ultra-low power communications and\
    \ dynamic routing\nprotocols, and in the latest business rule engine models applied\
    \ to the multimedia platform.\nAPOLLO aims to bring the beneﬁts of precision agriculture\
    \ to farmers through aﬀordable\ninformation services, making extensive use of\
    \ free and open Earth observation data, such as those\nprovided by the EU Copernicus\
    \ program. These services are intended to assist agricultural decision\nmaking,\
    \ while observing crop growth and conditions, providing advice on irrigation and\
    \ tilling,\nand providing crop estimations. Ultimately, these interventions are\
    \ designed to reduce agricultural\ninputs and increase competitive production\
    \ levels and beneﬁts.\nAs Table 1 shows, the novelty of our platform is that PLATEM\
    \ PA can be considered as a\ncollaborative tool where farmers can post their experiences.\n\
    It is able to monitor the diﬀerent\nparameters of soil and environment to better\
    \ growth of crops. In addition, PLATEM PA is able to\nimprove their decision,\
    \ regarding to actions to be performed over the ﬁeld, taking into account previous\n\
    stored information and farmers posts. Finally, its operation is based on the use\
    \ of an intelligent Virtual\nRouting and Forwarding (VRF) and Virtual Router Instances\
    \ (VRI). PLATEM PA therefore represents a\ncompetitive sample of European supplier\
    \ networks focused on Precision Agriculture management and\na multimedia platform\
    \ with basic group tools to control and monitor data and relations between all\n\
    participants for sharing results.\nThe PLATEM system presented in this paper can\
    \ be used to accomplish the task through a\nchain of web-based graphical tools,\
    \ running on standard BRMS software with open-source formats.\nOur technological\
    \ solution is capable of adapting “high-tech tools” to be used by farmers, many\
    \ of whom\nmay have little or no technical hi-tech expertise. One problem is the\
    \ necessary automatization of several\nsystems (irrigation controller, fertirrigation\
    \ pump, pH sensor node, . . . ) from diﬀerent manufacturers\nthat need to be adapted\
    \ to speciﬁc communication protocol. PLATEM PA combines several data\nintegration\
    \ processes in a single easy-to-use platform with a standard communication protocol.\n\
    Although the ﬁnal system will be composed by both hardware part (in charge of\
    \ collecting\ndata from the ﬁeld) and software part (in charge of processing data),\
    \ this paper is focused on\ndata computation and not in the agronomic side and\
    \ to perform the tests we will take a data base\nwith the needs of fertilization,\
    \ weekly irrigation liters and diﬀerent Kc for corn varieties of alfalfa,\nbarley\
    \ and wheat.\n3. Rule-Based Preparation Work\nThe ﬁrst step to develop our management\
    \ platform was to know the variable inputs the system\nhas and how they have to\
    \ be processed by using the rules. Taking into account that the ﬁnal goal is\n\
    to enhance the sustainability and competitiveness of the activity, the system\
    \ also includes business\nprocess management (BPM) and business rules. It is also\
    \ important to deﬁne the platform architecture.\nThis section therefore presents\
    \ the server-based decision-making structure for decision making on\nirrigation\
    \ device settings, which processes data inputs on edaphic and environmental conditions,\n\
    images of crop growth, and crop status.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 216\n7 of 19\nThe objective\
    \ of this server-based decision-making structure is the integration of a BPMS\
    \ and a\nbusiness rules management system. A middleware data-exchange system serves\
    \ as a link between\nboth. The middleware that serves to relay data from Bonita\
    \ BPM and Drools includes the following\ndevelopments:\n•\nPerformance of an integrated\
    \ architecture for a business rules management system and a business\nrule management\
    \ system (BRMS).\n•\nDialogue through the intermediate middleware component that\
    \ is responsible for the data\nmanagement model and the rule-based activities.\n\
    Bonita Soft provides connectors to interact with the Drools manager that connect\
    \ with the Drools\nAPI Engine to run the execution of a certain rule, in order\
    \ to obtain results that conclude with the\npreviously triggered decision-making\
    \ process.\nThe process of preparing a rule base in Drools can be divided into\
    \ several consecutive steps\nthat are presented in Figure 2, wherein several layers\
    \ are created: data preparation, association rule\nlearning, rule selection, classiﬁcation\
    \ model testing, rule set editing, and deployment of rules.\nAgronomy 2019, 9,\

    \ the rules association had been defined, it was required to \ndevelop the software\
    \ part that would implement our web platform. To perform that, this section \n\
    presents the implementation of server rules in the Drools engine. The server has\
    \ three main \ncomponents. The first one is an application that is able to register\
    \ the external sensor data in the \nsystem. A device or application simply registers\
    \ as a data source by sending information via socket \ncommunication to the middleware,\
    \ which then prepares the data in a specified format, depending \non the type\
    \ of sensor. \nThe system architecture is divided into the following layers: \n\
    1. \nUser interface: enables farmers, providers, and technics to interact with\
    \ the system and execute \ncomputerized workflow activities. To do so, it invokes\
    \ operations of the interfaces published by \nthe business layer. It is a set\
    \ of HTML and Php pages hosted on an Apache web server that are \ndisplayed in\
    \ a web browser. \n2. \nBusiness layer: responsible for making calculations, queries,\
    \ and invoking the execution of \nbusiness rules. To do this, it accesses the\
    \ data layer and the rules services layer. It is a set of PHP \npages hosted on\
    \ an Apache web server. \n3. \nData layer: in charge of managing the system’s\
    \ database, which contains information about all \nthe data of the process and\
    \ its stages for each field. It provides interfaces so that the business \nlayer\
    \ can access it. To implement this layer, the MySQL database management system\
    \ was \nused. \n4. \nService layer of business rules: exposes interfaces through\
    \ web services to business rules. It is \ninvoked from the business layer and\
    \ executes the rules contained in the rules layer. It is made \nup of web services,\
    \ programmed in Java, which run on a Tomcat web server. \nFigure 4. Diagram of\
    \ business process management (BMP) process.\n4. Software Components\nOnce the\
    \ platform architecture and the rules association had been deﬁned, it was required\
    \ to\ndevelop the software part that would implement our web platform. To perform\
    \ that, this section\npresents the implementation of server rules in the Drools\

    \ interfaces to the\nrules services layer. To implement this layer, a free, open\
    \ source, java-developed BRMS was used.\nThe BRMS is deployed on a Tomcat web\
    \ server.\nFigure 5 shows the architecture of BRMS used by our platform. As we\
    \ can see, the main component\nof our BRMS is an Apache web server, which uses\
    \ the data stored in our database (DB). In order to\nenhance our server, we used\
    \ a Tomcat web server. Tomcat is an extension of Apache that works as a\ncontainer\
    \ of servlets, and can help us to include new functionalities to our server. Using\
    \ the servlets,\nwe can extend applications held in web servers to be seen as\
    \ JAVA Applets. To generate and manage\nthe diﬀerent rules we need to enhance\
    \ the system performance, we used Drools, a common tool used\nfor managing business\
    \ rules that we have adapted to our application. These rules are sent to the\n\
    Tomcat web server through the API. These rules are sent to the Apache web server,\
    \ which combines\nthem with the data stored in the DB. Finally, the users can\
    \ see the results of these decisions by using a\nweb browser and surﬁng the diﬀerent\

    The last step to make the web platform usable was to develop a graphic user interface\
    \ (GUI) to\nfacilitate its use by farmers. Additionally, PLATEM should be tested\
    \ in terms of data collected and\noperation. In this section, the web view development\
    \ is presented, with the aim of oﬀering a high\nusability level for non-IT-experts.\
    \ PLATEM incorporates a web-based data-mining system [21,22].\nThe web provides\
    \ an important interaction model for the smart farming IoT by letting users obtain\n\
    device-related information and, in some cases, control their devices through the\
    \ ubiquitous web\nbrowser. The conventional web is a convenience we enjoy as we\
    \ search for information, irrigation Tele\nManagement control, and post historical\
    \ data in social networking. Users can refer to devices that are\npart of the\
    \ IoT and that are directly accessed, monitored, and controlled by web technologies\
    \ as the\nPhysical Web: web technology + IoT. The web interface supports pre-processing\
    \ deﬁnitions such as\nuploading data to DB, and post processing ones such as the\
    \ data results viewer [23]. The backend is\nwritten in PHP; the frontend is based\
    \ on PHP/HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript libraries.\nThe PLATEM platform is a web\
    \ view application written in PHP. The user module can share\nrestricted postings\
    \ and control security. Communication is performed through a MySQL extension.\n\
    MySQL is great at performance database technology, but we see databases becoming\
    \ more popular\nwhen they simply provide more and more features that are easily\
    \ connectable and manageable with\nexisting systems. The more features a database\
    \ has, the easier it will be for users to develop their\nsystems, thus making\
    \ them better and raising the general level of the applications that are made\n\
    through MySQL. Since MySQL is very popular, any major improvements or added features\
    \ aﬀect many\npeople. The web view uses direct communication with Drools only\
    \ in parts, with speciﬁc functionality\nwhere it is accessible through REST web\
    \ services in JSON. The remaining ﬁelds interact, such as: make\na post, likes,\
    \ upload images, write commentaries to status or in images, search and list friends,\
    \ friend\nrequest (send and accept), send messages to friends. They are all accessible\
    \ through the web interface\nwithout setters to the rule engine.\nIn addition,\
    \ there is a settings view to update user proﬁles that is accessible to friends,\
    \ which can\nbe edited (clicking on Edit Information). The next important point\
    \ is a notiﬁcations menu located\non the top-right of the screen in main view,\
    \ where the notiﬁcation icons ﬂash for alerts/notiﬁcations,\nfriends, and messages.\n\
    The user can search for other users in the database by writing the name in edit\
    \ text “Search\nPeople,” and can view an open proﬁle, send a message, and add\
    \ a name to a list of friends. Figure 7\nshows the My Friends list with a “View\
    \ proﬁle” button and “Send message” button.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 216\n12 of 19\n\

    6. Conclusions and Future Work\nIn this work, we have presented the results of\
    \ new decision rules to create variable rate irrigation\nparameters and variable\
    \ rate fertirrigation rules for parametric optimization of agricultural inputs.\n\
    In addition, we tested a new multimedia platform for user manager (farmer) proﬁles\
    \ to notify events,\nto share postings and data with the community, and to interact\
    \ with the irrigation–fertirrigation system\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 216\n18 of 19\n\
    controller. Comparing our study with other applications, we can highlight the\
    \ potential of PLATEM:\nthat integrates all the tools that a farmer may need on\
    \ a day-to-day basis, so that many fertirrigation\noperations can bring in results\
    \ with a rule engine and a list of rules or models based on historical\ndata acquisition\
    \ and user-inserted values. Another important function is information sharing\
    \ through\nforums with input from agronomists, agricultural technicians, and other\
    \ farmers on doses, plagues,\nwater restrictions, etc. Work continues on expansions\
    \ of the rules for the integration of the business\nengine system. The goal of\
    \ this integration is to present the basic user-demanded rules deﬁned in\nthe\
    \ system, enabling a simple and unique functional platform for smart farming in\
    \ irrigation areas,\nboth under cover and in the ﬁeld, for fertilization and pest\
    \ control.\nIn future work, further development of smart system applications will\
    \ be necessary, and is likely\nto produce two opposing supply chain scenarios:\
    \ one with further integration of the supply chain, in\nwhich farmers have private\
    \ data, and another in which farmers are empowered by big data and open\ncollaboration\
    \ and can easily switch between suppliers, sharing data with agricultural organizations\n\
    and the Ministry of Agriculture, and participating in short supply chains rather\
    \ than integrated long\nsupply chains.\nCurrently, PLATEM is working well for\
    \ relatively small data sets. A further action required\nto process bigger amount\
    \ of data is to apply diﬀerent decision-making tools, since the rule engine\n\
    and decision tree become ineﬃcient because of the swapping of training tuples\
    \ in and out of the\nmain memory.\nThe situation is likely to navigate a steady\
    \ course between these two extremes diﬀerentiated by\ncropping methods, commodity,\
    \ market structure, etc. In this work, the use of open data is fostered with\n\
    the aim of promoting communication channels between farmer, researcher, commercial\
    \ intermediary,\nand technological expert.\nAnother focus is on the extension\
    \ of the system that would allow mixing rules from multiple\ndatasets in a single\
    \ knowledge base and a common communication protocol through various sources,\n\
    e.g., manufacturers of irrigation controllers, real-time information from satellites,\
    \ and weather\nforecasting servers. Finally, we have to consider supporting alternative\
    \ backend rule learning adjusted\nto each user proﬁle (horticulture, cereal, and\
    \ fruit farmers, etc.) to classify the rules on use in the\nrule container. The\
    \ promise of big data in agriculture is alluring, but the above challenges have\
    \ to\nbe addressed for increased uptake of big data applications. Although there\
    \ are certainly technical\nissues to be resolved, we recommend focusing on the\
    \ most signiﬁcant obstacles above all, the initially\nidentiﬁed governance issues,\
    \ and the design of suitable business models.\nAuthor Contributions: C.C.B. designed\

    Nleya. SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract A growing world population and increases
    in food and energy consumption have placed production agriculture in a difficult
    situation. The rapid growth in food production through specialized operations
    such as monoculture cropping systems has aligned to satisfy increases in demand
    for food and fiber. However, its adverse impacts on natural resources pose huge
    challenges for the sustainability of food production. The situation is direr for
    developing countries or rural regions of the world due to the limited resources
    available to farming communities in these regions. To avoid production agriculture
    being at the proverbial crossroads we suggest an alternate approach. One that
    involves the sustainable use of natural resources without adverse environmental
    impacts by relying less on production inputs whether it be agrochemicals or machineries.
    We examined the extent to which regenerative agriculture, permaculture, and smart
    technology have evolved in response to sustainable agricultural production, agricultural
    decision support system, and overall global food security. Collectively, regenerative
    agriculture and permaculture are semi-closed holistic systems approach designed
    to reduce or eliminate dependence on external inputs (e.g., chemicals) which restores
    and maintains natural systems (e.g., soil quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem
    services). We suggest that fully embracing modern regenerative agriculture as
    well as integrated permaculture will improve soil health, ecosystem biodiversity,
    land and resource conservation, agricultural sustainability, and food security.
    Identifying and implementing practices towards regenerative agriculture, integrated
    permaculture, digital agriculture, and sustainable agricultural management utilizing
    modern agricultural technologies infused with data science (artificial intelligence
    [AI] or machine learning [ML]) is critical. Abbreviations AI artificial intelligence

    of the last couple of decades, two simultaneous trends with potentials to compromise
    social, economic, and environmental sustainability have been receiving widespread
    attention, that is, global population and agriculture production. The world''s
    population continues to grow adding an estimated 83 million people per year with
    projections to reach an estimated 9.7 billion in 2050 with a vast contribution
    from developing countries (United Nations, 2019). Agricultural production increased
    concomitantly to meet increased global demand for food, fiber, and energy from
    surging world population along with rising incomes and abilities to purchase more.
    Even though the objectives of agricultural production systems have broadened,
    and have diversified, an ultimate goal of sustainable food security remains. The
    critical question that keeps arising is whether agricultural production systems
    especially in developing countries can continue to meet their goals sustainably
    or not. Alexandratos (1999), for example, argues that for any agricultural practices
    to be sustainable, meeting the food and fiber needs of the present population,
    should in no way compromise either the food security or the economic, social,
    and environmental elements used in the process for future generations. The need
    for greater food productivity has been satisfied in parts, while it became more
    than double over the last number of years through monoculture. This monoculture
    can be explained as a cropping system model emphasizing specialization and productive
    efficiency, that has largely guided modern agriculture (Asbjornsen et al., 2014;
    Tilman et al., 2002). Tied in with such intensive industrial food production was
    another agricultural farming practice, which in itself was revolutionary. Known
    as the Green Revolution, food production from these agricultural systems resulted
    in remarkable growth (Pingali, 2012). In consolidation with new technologies,
    high-yielding genetically modified crop varieties, agrochemicals (inorganic fertilizers,
    pesticides) and controlled water supply contributed to large increases in crop
    productivity. Undoubtedly, both the green revolution and monoculture cropping
    systems presented clear benefits. Economies of scale has contributed considerably
    to farms’ economic performance through improved production efficiencies and lower
    production costs. This in turn has led to numerous opportunities for agricultural
    producers to not only feed an increasing world population, but simultaneously
    improve human health and nutrition through the delivery of specialized nutrient-rich
    crops and animal products (Bouis & Saltzman, 2017). At the field level, the many
    benefits of specialized mono-cropping systems to meet the vast new demand opportunities
    supplying large quantities of food and energy have been extensively reported (Dai
    & Dong, 2014; Meng et al., 2013; Tilman et al., 2002). Currently, these benefits
    and gains in many instances have either been lost or diminished because of the
    inability to balance the advantages and disadvantages. These specialized cropping
    systems due to their strong reliance on external inputs have raised present and
    future challenges to the sustainable use of our natural resources. Modern agriculture
    therefore does have serious implications for sustainability and requires judicious
    management strategy moving forward. Modern agriculture practices have resulted
    in adverse unintended consequences detrimental to environmental quality and sustainability
    (Power, 2010). Further, the pursuit of monoculture benefits has been disproportional
    as the negative consequences are particularly more serious in developing countries.
    Environmental and ecological problems such as land degradation (Diacono & Montemurro,
    2010), loss of biodiversity (Isbell et al., 2017; Nicholls & Altieri, 2013) and
    water pollution (Sebilo et al., 2013) have disproportionally affected and simultaneously
    revealed the vulnerabilities of poorer communities or farmers with limited resources
    in developing countries (Pretty & Bharucha, 2014) (Figure 1). Core Ideas  Intensive
    agriculture can cause a loss in biodiversity and concerns for global food security.  Regenerative
    agriculture and integrative permaculture are keys to address food security.  Digital
    agricultural tools can aid in attaining agricultural and environmental sustainability.  Precision
    agriculture should be implemented as an agricultural decision support system.  Artificial
    intelligence and machine learning can guide integrated agricultural input management.
    FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer Flow chart showing the targets to achieve agricultural
    sustainability through integrative permaculture and regenerative agriculture using
    modern agricultural tools to attain global food security Opposite to monoculture,
    permaculture is regarded as a farming system that uses conventional practices
    coupled with new approaches that combine natural, ecological, and economic factors
    into the monoculture production system (Figure 1). Permaculture is considered
    an umbrella term that describes a broad range of practices and systems to optimize
    the interactions between the soil–plant systems. It efficiently utilizes various
    ecological functionalities to maximize both ecosystem health and providing a broad
    suite of ecosystem services (Gambiza, 2019). The ethos of permaculture is not
    only the efficient functioning of natural systems but for activities that work
    in tandem and embodies human health and well-being. It embraces a few principles
    and ethics to promote sustainable agricultural production which in turn promotes
    diverse and resilient agroecosystems (Ferguson & Lovell, 2014; Fiebrig et al.,
    2020). Permaculture can also be broken down into individual aspects composed of
    different elements or measures addressing each aspect of agricultural production
    but collectively it can remediate the problems of present-day agriculture. For
    instance, the first strategy tackles biodiversity, the second focuses on interactions,
    the third combines creativity and innovations, and the fourth embraces adaptive
    management (Ferguson & Lovell,  2014). The underlying principles of permaculture
    as a major driver in sustaining rural economies and cultures have long existed
    and are similar to multifunctional agriculture (Marsden & Sonnino, 2008). Permaculture
    has always been about the whole system''s design, a fundamental principle that
    all components of a system are interrelated (Ferguson & Lovell, 2014). Recently,
    modifications and a shift in notions took place to leverage advancements in agronomic
    and animal husbandry operationalization that also consider societal and ethical
    aspects (Akhtar et al., 2016; Ingram, 2018; Thrall et al., 2010). To some extent,
    modern agriculture has ignored the associations on the whole-farm level focusing
    solely on inputs or factors of production (e.g., pesticides, fertilizers). Permaculture
    views many of the various farming activities as being co-independent. For example,
    permaculture advocates for farmers to consider pests or weeds when making fertilizer
    decisions (Fiebrig et al., 2020). Similarly, permaculture encourages crop rotation
    that involves more than two crops where such numbers provide the best solutions
    for maintaining soil fertility and improving soil moisture, control pests, or
    provide pollination services (Asbjornsen et al., 2014; Jensen et al., 2010). A
    few recent studies have reported the role of permaculture in creating resilient
    and productive landscapes and communities (Aznar-Sánchez et al., 2019; Ferguson
    & Lovell, 2014) (Figure 1). Evidence from these studies suggests that permaculture
    is not entirely a new concept but one which has grown over time (Ferguson & Lovell,
    2014). We conceptualized and evaluated scenarios of problems and disadvantages
    associated with monoculture, summarized the benefits of permaculture to overall
    ecosystem services, evaluated implications of regenerative modern agriculture,
    and integrated permaculture to achieve global food security. This perspective
    suggests that the incorporation of modern agricultural technologies and integration
    of data science artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with agricultural
    resource management will help address global food security challenges. Future
    research works should be tailored to adopt a more holistic input efficient, resilient,
    regenerative-based production system, and output-based system to optimize agricultural
    production while reducing the environmental footprint. 2 MONOCULTURE CROPPING
    SYSTEMS: BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES Monoculture plays a key role in land degradation
    (Pacheco et al., 2018) which over time develops into a myriad of other environmental
    (e.g., reduction in land productivity, soil erosion, water quality deterioration,
    loss of biodiversity, and dysfunctionality of ecosystem etc.) problems (Figure
    1). As monoculture activities continue to intensify, soil and water erosion and
    fertility loss are directly affecting the quality and productivity of soil health
    (Crews et al., 2018). Approximately 17% of otherwise fertile vegetative land has
    been degraded and rendered unproductive due to anthropogenic activities (Tilman
    et al., 2002). It has also been reported recently that such loss represents a
    minimum of 3% of global agricultural gross domestic product (Baskan et al., 2017).
    Due to intensive cultivation, deforestation, climate change, and farming marginal
    lands, developing countries are most likely to suffer high erosion rates which
    are generally accompanied by reductions in the provisioning of ecosystem services
    (Labrière et al., 2015). As per recent FAO interpretation, the situation will
    more likely become worse in the absence of meaningful interventions (FAO, 2015).
    Thus, soil preservation and quality are considered as critical factors in supporting
    agroecosystem services to address current and future food security concerns. Top
    soil constitutes the majority of organic matter and more than half of the essential
    primary available nutrients of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)
    needed for plant growth and productivity (Brady & Weill, 2010). Soils affected
    by high erosion rates and the associated removal of their top soils are therefore
    subjected to large nutrient loss and decreased soil fertility. Long-term expansion
    of natural ecosystems to row crop agriculture and intense use of agrochemicals
    (fertilizer and pesticides) is therefore not only a major threat to soil fertility
    but have caused contamination of ground and surface water. There have been numerous
    examples of agricultural contributions to water pollution (Dodds et al., 2009;
    Foy & Kirk, 1995). Mitigation efforts are therefore badly needed to abate the
    present situation. Controlling nutrient transfer from farmland depends on both
    a reduction in inputs use, as well as how they are managed to reduce mobilization
    (Goulding et al., 2008). Land degradation and climate change are inextricably
    linked as intensive farming practices such as conventional tillage, forest clearing,
    biomass burning, excessive use of inorganic fertilizer, etc., have been a major
    contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions (Grace et al., 2011; Lacanne &
    Lundgren, 2018). Agricultural activities contribute approximately 30% of total
    greenhouse gas emissions due to the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and
    animal wastes, a rate which is expected to increase due to growing global population
    and elevated food production demand (IAEA, 2019). Alternative forms of input-efficient
    agriculture such as regenerative agriculture and permaculture are generally focused
    on soil carbon (C) sequestration have been suggested as possible solutions to
    produce positive outcomes on greenhouse gas budgets (Smith et al., 2019). Monoculture''s
    nexus of concerns is more of a threat to developing countries since agriculture
    continues to be the principal source of revenue and means of support for many
    rural families (Pretty & Bharucha, 2014). It has been investigated that developing
    countries with little adaptation capacities are the territories most likely to
    face severe food insecurity (UNCTAD & Ulrich, 2011). To that end, the scourge
    to food security is closely linked to vulnerabilities in the cropping system promoting
    a production culture relying heavily on mechanization and agrochemicals which
    poses deleterious impacts on the ecosystems (Crews et al., 2018). The situation
    is further exacerbated because poorer countries have little safeguards against
    externalities in the first place. Further, they are normally located in mostly
    arid and semi-arid regions with marginal soils and are more prone to the negative
    effects of climate change limiting their abilities to compete with industrialized
    economies. Recent meta-analysis have listed that land degradation, depletion,
    and pollution of physical, chemical, and biological resources of the environment,
    and their associated disproportionate costs as the primary negative results from
    row crop agriculture and its narrow focus (de Graaff et al., 2019; Pothula et
    al., 2019). While a variety of measures to mitigate the environmental externalities
    have been explored, challenges remain (Foley et al., 2011). For instance, agriculture
    remains the single largest nonpoint source of water pollutants (Dowd et al., 2008;
    EPA, 2000). Additionally, there is still the threat to human health from occupational
    workers and consumer exposure to pesticides (Lam et al., 2017). Sustainability
    in food security is not an insurmountable problem. Some notable solutions that
    have been suggested to solve the problems of achieving sustainable agricultural
    production and food security have been agroecology, ecological intensification,
    sustainable intensification (SI) and regenerative agriculture (Bommarco et al.,
    2013; Cassman, 1999; Pretty & Bharucha, 2014; Tomich et al., 2011). 3 REGENERATIVE
    AGRICULTURE: THE SUSTAINABLE TRANSITION OF AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES Regenerative
    agriculture is a set of approaches that emphasizes and make the most of naturally
    occurring beneficial soil–plant interactions, relying less on external inputs
    and taking advantage of ecological agricultural practices (Perry, 1995). The empirical
    impacts of regenerative agricultural practices are still in their incipient state
    and not widely followed by farmers. The literal meaning of “regeneration” when
    applied to agriculture means reconditioning a land to a higher state after it
    has been utilized for crop production using a variety of technical management
    practices (Figure 1). The process is a series of transformational adaptation in
    agriculture that emerges and catalyzed due to crisis and alternative techniques
    introduced to address the farming challenges (Gosnell et al., 2019). Soil is considered
    as the base for regenerative agriculture (Lal, 2020). Although regenerative agriculture
    is related to crop canopy and site-specific crop management, it is also centric
    to soil (Schreefel et al., 2020). Therefore, maintaining soil fertility by optimizing
    nutrient concentrations or strengthening crop protection strategies in agricultural
    fields by enhancing disease resistance ability of soil are key objectives to adopt
    regenerative agriculture (Lal, 2020). The literal meaning of “regeneration” is
    aligned with the concept of soil resilience under changing climate scenario. Therefore,
    the overarching objective is to create, support, and maintain the natural biogeochemical
    cycle and interdependence aimed at improving agricultural and food systems sustainability
    (Lacanne & Lundgren, 2018). Indigenous agricultural practices have traditionally
    focused on enhancing productivity while maintaining soil health. Three sister
    cropping in the indigenous communities like Navajo, Cahokian, Mvskoke, Mississipian
    tribes of the United States focuses on growing corn (Zea mays L.), squash (Cucurbita
    spp.), and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in the same field (Hill, 2020; Mt. Pleasant,
    2006). Employing symbiotic and companion plant relationships, corn, the staple
    food of most tribes provides support for the climbing bean, which in turn provide
    N to the soil for all three plants through N2 fixation. The third plant squash,
    acts as a cover crop and mulch, suppresses weeds and pests, protects soil from
    erosion as well as conserving soil moisture for the benefit of all three plants.
    On the other hand, legumes growing in the same field fixes N in the soil to support
    the growth of three crops. In this integrative approach of sustainability, livestock
    forms the essential part of regenerative agriculture. The grazing pattern of sheep
    and cattle significantly impacts increased grass production and increased C sequestration
    in rangelands. Regenerative rotational grazing of sheep can increase topsoil organic
    C up to 3.6% with 30% higher springtime grass production (Díaz de Otálora et al.,
    2021). Biometric sensors and AI techniques in digital livestock farming are emerging
    tools in modern agriculture (Neethirajan & Kemp, 2021). The applications of these
    tools not only facilitate administering the health of livestock but can also allow
    for precision monitoring of the intensity of grazing in rangelands. These sensor
    nodes are intended to function as a wireless sensor network by attaching to the
    body of the livestock to compare the real-time activity of the grazing intensity
    data and inform the growers for immediate attention if readings are over or under
    the reference standards of the database (Hwang & Yoe, 2011). The advancements
    in precision livestock farming using proximal and biometric sensors allows for
    the monitoring of the physiological and behavioral health of the livestock over
    time and space (Neethirajan, 2017). The integration of biometric sensors with
    bioinformatics and AI algorithms can also help in identifying desirable traits
    of cattle for breeding programs (Ellen et al., 2019). The degradation of topsoil
    can be avoided by increasing the soil organic C in the rhizosphere. Recent studies
    on the inclusion of cover crops in agricultural rotations have shown significant
    increases in soil organic C (Jian et al., 2020). Including legume cover crops
    in the soil also enhances the soil biological activity and increased plant-available
    N (Sullivan & Andrews, 2012). In integrated crop–livestock farming, cover crops
    facilitate reconditioning of soils due to their crop diversity and mitigate ecological
    constraints. Using annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) as a cover crop has
    shown an increase in the average daily weight of livestock while also maintaining
    crop diversity (Planisich et al., 2021). Similarly, the application of green manure
    [crops grown and turned into the soil to enhance and improve their nutritive qualities,
    for example, Sesbania rostrata (Brem.)] with organic amendments has been shown
    to improve soil physical, chemical, and microbial activities (Maitra et al., 2018).
    Green manure with organic amendments under reduced tillage have shown to improve
    aggregate stability, higher content of N, P, exchangeable cations, and microbial
    respiration in orchard crops (Luján Soto et al., 2021). The incorporation of regenerative
    agricultural practices into cropping systems can increase nutrient cycling and
    subsequent soil health through a number of mechanisms. For example, the addition
    of N to the soil through symbiotic N2 fixation of legumes (Peyraud et al., 2014).
    Fornara and Tilman (2009) described the improvements in soil structure and health
    from increased soil organic matter, soil microorganisms and biological activities
    from increased plant diversity during decomposition. Then there is the decreased
    nutrient loss and increased soil water retention from increased plant diversity
    which increases crop productivity (Florence & McGuire, 2020) while simultaneously
    decreasing environmental contamination. Both diverse agronomic managements and
    cropping systems are key components of an integrated pest management system. Flood
    (2010) reported that agricultural pests including pathogens and weeds resulted
    up to a third of crop loss. There is very good evidence that regenerative agriculture
    and permaculture which affords both diversity in time, space, crops, and agronomic
    practices allows for both the alteration of host and nonhost crop species and
    simultaneously eliminating or reducing host and nonhost crop pests (Chauvel et
    al., 2001; Petit et al., 2018). This in turn reduces the use of synthetic pesticides
    and resulting negative environmental consequences such as aquatic pollution and
    reduction of beneficial pollinator populations. The practice of regenerative agriculture
    is especially beneficial for the small farming system since it lacks the necessary
    financial resources for more intensive agricultural production systems. Whereas
    environment, climate, and financial resources have had diverse effects on agriculture
    infrastructure in developing countries they still have the same supports and infrastructure
    for regenerative agriculture. This is because regenerative agriculture is an approach
    that emphasizes practices that are location specific. Any approach that tailored
    agriculture practices to local circumstances are more likely to be successful
    in alleviating problems in agricultural food supplies because initiatives are
    focused on local production systems and local economies (Clover, 2003). Thus far,
    limited research has been documented to describe and evaluate the comparisons
    of various regenerative agriculture practices. A greater ecosystem services and
    profitability for farmers have been generated by regenerative agriculture than
    a highly intensive monoculture corn cropping system in a study throughout the
    northern plains of the United States (Lacanne & Lundgren, 2018). The significance
    of regenerative agriculture is that it adopts goals such as sustainability through
    water and nutrient recycling and preservation. Studies showed a reduction in the
    depletion of natural resources from regenerative agriculture which has increased
    the provisioning of ecosystems services and local economies (Czekaj et al., 2020;
    Duncan, 2016; Luján Soto et al., 2021). Regenerative agriculture also calls attention
    to the wide range of opportunities that exist for farmers to use local organic
    waste in their agronomic management practices (Larney & Angers, 2012). Another
    important requirement for regenerative agriculture is the integration of agricultural
    processes for environmental stewardship that is critical for a sustainable food
    future with a positive outcome in long-term food security. 4 SUSTAINABLE FOOD
    FUTURE UNDER CHANGING CLIMATE The burgeoning population along with the high demand
    for global food production under changing climate has necessitated conditions
    to conserve available natural resources for sustainable agriculture production.
    It is predicted that climate change will bring about extreme weather conditions
    such as drought, flood, fire, hurricane, frost, and infrequent and uneven precipitation
    which will impact crop yields and reduce available land under traditional cropping
    systems (Olesen & Bindi, 2002). Under these changing climates saving water, increasing
    water use efficiency, soil nutrient management, and protecting crops from adverse
    environmental conditions are important considerations to develop future agricultural
    strategies. Modern agriculture has adapted to new strategies, which involve new
    innovative/transformative technologies and sustainable intensification of agriculture
    (Figure 2). Urban agricultural productions systems including micro- (e.g., green
    roofs, green walls, courtyards, backyards, street verges etc.), meso-(e.g., community
    gardens, community allotments, urban parks etc.), and macro-scales have also been
    proven to be sustainable models (Nandwani, 2016). Improved crop genotypes tolerant
    to drought are being used in developing countries, for example, drought-tolerant
    maize developed by International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and
    The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) have increased maize
    yields by 20–30% under drought conditions in Africa. Gene editing for seed improvements
    can produce more crops and improve nutrition outcomes. Further, the micro-dosing
    technique of fertilizer placement has helped many smallholder agricultural farmers
    to increase their sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] and millet (Panicum miliaceum
    L.) yields by 44–120% in Africa (Fan, 2020). Additionally, biofortification of
    foods using plant breeding as a cutting-edge approach has enabled increased vitamin
    and mineral density in crops using plant breeding and transgenic techniques (Bouis
    & Saltzman, 2017). Solar-powered irrigation pumps are one of Africa''s most promising
    solutions to climate change adaption and mitigation, and have contributed to reductions
    in hunger and malnutrition (Mohammed Wazed et al., 2018). FIGURE 2 Open in figure
    viewer Various ways of adopting modern agricultural technologies as part of regenerative
    and precision agricultural systems to attain agricultural and environmental sustainability
    The SI targets environmental sustainability while tackling climate change and
    producing more food with less natural resources. Climate-smart agriculture is
    the new SI which is an integrative approach to increase agricultural productivity
    to support equitable increases in farm incomes, food security, and development.
    It helps to adapt and build the resilience of agricultural and food security systems
    to climate change at multiple levels, and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
    from agriculture (Chandra et al., 2018; Khatri-Chhetri et al., 2017; Taylor, 2018).
    China implemented another strategy for sustainable development known as Agricultural
    Green Development, which coordinates “green” with “development”. It aims to transform
    current agriculture with high resource consumption and high environmental costs
    into green agriculture in rural areas with high productivity, high resource use
    efficiency, and low environmental impact (Shen et al., 2020). 5 RESOURCE USE EFFICIENCY
    FOR SUSTAINABLE AND REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE Despite progress in agricultural
    production and productivity, environmental and ecological challenges such as soil
    erosion, nutrient leaching, and soil and water pollution persist that ultimately
    limits many ecosystems functions. Agricultural diversification that operates outside
    the established goals of just “productive efficiency” and greater profits would
    be critical in achieving food security (Brunori et al., 2013; Gomiero et al.,
    2011; Lasley et al., 1993; Marsden, 2004). Agroecosystems based on integrated
    systems of low input farming can help address the shortcomings of monoculture
    and contribute to more sustainable food security and food sovereignty. The regenerative
    agriculture approach involves farming systems that are more responsive to biological
    and ecosystem interactions rather than only yields and output. More holistic focused
    agriculture can contribute to bolstered food security, especially for rural farming
    communities in developing countries. The critical aspect of modern sustainable
    and regenerative agriculture is to adopt multiple modern agricultural technologies
    along with managing agricultural inputs precisely. Few such traditional practices
    are being used from the last two decades in different parts of the worlds as follows:  Irrigation
    scheduling based on daily historical crop evapotranspiration is potentially a
    prospective method for increasing water use efficiency by reducing soil water
    evaporation and preventing groundwater depletion especially in low rainfall regions
    (Bonachela et al., 2006).  Screen house in a large field set-up (e.g., banana
    [Musa X paradisiaca L.] farm) enabled a 30% increase in water use efficiency in
    developing countries (Tanny et al., 2015).  Closed-loop systems which are soilless
    irrigation systems in hydroponic arrangement that helps reduce the amount of water
    needed for irrigation while optimizing the nutrient management in an urban agriculture
    farm setting have promoted sustainable environmental practices by reducing irrigated
    water use by 40% as well as fertilizer use by 35–54% per day (Rufí-Salís et al.,
    2020).  Soilless culture using crop coefficient for irrigation has been another
    way to improve water use efficiency in recirculating systems that recapture drain
    water for reuse especially in a limited resource and low-cost farming systems
    in developing countries (Gruda, 2009).  Slow release biofertilizers, produced
    by encapsulation technology, can breakdown nutrients and make them available to
    plants for longer durations, thus enhancing plant growth and productivity while
    mitigating environmental pollution and nutrient leaching (Chen et al., 2014; Ju
    et al., 2009).  Phi-based farming system, as an emerging novel strategy in modern
    agriculture can potentially minimize the algal blooms in lakes and reservoirs
    generated from P fertilizers application in agricultural fields (Chaudhary et
    al., 2020).  Conservation agriculture (CA) is based on reduced tillage, maintaining
    crop residues as soil cover, and crop rotation and is highly promoted for sustainable
    soil management practiced in North and South America (Hobbs et al., 2008; Kassam
    et al., 2009).  Fertilizer deep placement (FDP) was developed for Asian rice (Oryza
    sativa L.) systems in the 1980s. This method involves placing the compressed briquettes
    of fertilizer deeper in the soil (>10 cm), close to the roots of transplanted
    rice which drastically increased rice grain yields while reducing the amount of
    required fertilizer (Roger et al., 1980). Many modern agricultural technologies
    are being used and suggested as a part of precision and regenerative agriculture
    as well as integrative permaculture (Figure 2) as follows:  Variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) and variable rate nutrient (VRN) technology: VRI is variable rate irrigation
    system that applies irrigation according to detailed mapping and monitoring of
    soil variability thereby reducing drainage losses (Trout et al., 2008).  In a
    VRI system, sensors can unlock the full potential of variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) systems enabling optimal water applications in an irrigated cropping system.
    Evans and King (2010) reported water savings of up to 26% for a wide range of
    crop such as corn, pasture, potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), soybean [Glycine max
    (L.) Merr.], sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum
    Mill.).  The VRN is variable rate nutrient technology where nutrients are applied
    to match up the soil and crop requirement to prevent nutrient loss and increase
    efficiency. These technologies utilize a range of approaches covering sensor-based
    approaches, real-time sensors, and feedback controls to measure soil properties
    or crop characteristics and immediately use this signal to control the variable-rate
    applicator. They are helpful to deal with soil spatial heterogeneity varying rates
    of irrigation and nutrient. Variable-rate irrigation decreased about 80–85% annual
    load of N and P downstream as compared to uniform rate irrigation (URI) in a long-term
    study conducted under an intensively grazed dairy system (McDowell, 2017). It
    was found to be potentially a useful approach for irrigation management for improving
    crop yield in an onion (Allium cepa L.) field in the humid environment of England
    (González Perea et al., 2018). In another study with an irrigated corn crop, Bausch
    and Diker (2001) reported that VRI technology reduced N fertilizer application
    by 39 kg N ha–1 with no reduction in corn grain yield.  Water smart agriculture
    project in Central America helped small farmers develop long-term digital soil
    mapping system which enables wise use of natural resources in the present context
    of growing global challenges for food security under changing climate (Owens et
    al., 2020).  DSSAT for Conservation, Optimization and Precision Agriculture: A
    real-time control and optimization in irrigation management system has been presented
    as a potential option for water savings by Koech and Langat (2018). Decision Support
    System in Agricultural Technologies (DSSAT) can provide fundamental support to
    the growers to decide and optimize their practices for precise nutrient, water,
    energy, and pest management. These integrated solutions by combining soil or canopy-based
    sensors or spectral/thermal imagery with cloud-based telemetric services allows
    for easy management of the crop field throughout the growing season without going
    to the field to take in-situ intensive measurements (Bazzani, 2005; Rinaldi &
    He, 2014).  The trend of using multiple sensors and spectral imagery available
    for a wide range of cropping and agricultural systems would address the issue
    of global food security by minimizing the environmental footprint. Figure 3 represents
    the Irrigation Decision Support System (IDSS) using spectral imagery for determining
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of three agricultural fields in
    the Central Valley of California. The dark brown bands in Figure 3a shows low
    emergence and vigor due to low NDVI. On the contrary, the green bands in Figure
    3b and c show uniform emergence. Identifying the dark brown to orange bands in
    Figure 3a and b is useful for the grower to precisely manage the areas that required
    attention in terms of nutrient or moisture management.  Remote sensing and aerial
    image-based technology: Utilization and applying remote sensing with proximal
    image processing to manage agricultural inputs such as nutrients, soil, or water
    is a recent trend. A recent review concluded that crop water use efficiency can
    be increased by characterizing water bodies using satellite-based technologies
    such as proximal and remote sensing (Cancela et al., 2019). Future agricultural
    production would rely more on remote sensing techniques to better utilize agricultural
    inputs. The recent development and utilization of drone-based technology in agricultural
    field to implement best management practices as well as integrated pest management
    for crop production have drawn much attention. A good review of examples and application
    is presented in Bastiaanssen et al. (2000).  Drone-based technology: Drones, which
    are not currently in full use for most agriculture operations but have become
    increasingly affordable is another promising option. Drone use will enable farmers
    to improve yields by monitoring crops more frequently and accurately, allowing
    for more controlled and precise pesticide and fertilizer applications, intervening
    remotely when necessary (Puri et al., 2017).  Wireless sensor networks (WSNs):
    The WSNs can be used as a sophisticated and useful tool of precision agriculture
    management to aid in agricultural decision-making systems (e.g., irrigation water
    or fertilizer application monitoring systems. Lately, researcher have shown WSNs
    as an efficient way of managing agricultural field through these WSNs technologies
    (Adão et al., 2017; Jawad et al., 2017). These various wireless communication
    systems are more flexible options to manage soil, water, nutrients, and would
    bring revolution in sustainable agricultural production systems.  Regenerative
    irrigation practices: We can potentially follow the relatively new concept of
    “regenerative irrigation” as a part of regenerative agriculture to increase resource
    efficiency such as using fewer chemical fertilizers, more residue-based materials,
    reusing wastewater to increase the irrigation water use efficiency and decrease
    farm energy input. One such study has demonstrated the positive impact of bio-based
    input into the agricultural production system to boost the farm economy (Rodias
    et al., 2020).  Digital Soil Mapping (DSM): A component of water smart agriculture
    is to generate relevant informative maps of soil types, properties, and functions
    for sustainable soil and water management. This approach can be multi-level and
    its functionality can help farmers in their decision-making process (Barron, 2012;
    Falkenmark et al., 2009; Falkenmark, 2013) especially in drought-prone areas during
    challenging times of climate change (Eitzinger et al., 2012). FIGURE 3 Open in
    figure viewer Multispectral aerial imagery representing normalized difference
    vegetation index of three agricultural fields in Central Valley of California.

    Inc. 6 ADAPTING INTEGRATED APPROACH: REGENERATIVE AND MODERN AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY
    A narrow single approach that focuses only on conventional principles of agriculture
    production will not be sufficient to address the issue of global food security
    in the future. The key to maintaining a long-term and self-sustaining food security
    system relies upon adapting a broad encompassing approach, one for example that
    combines the fundamentals and the inter-relatedness of many different disciplines
    such as statistics and computer science. The proper combination of specific technology
    that can not only provide indicators but tangible spatial measurements should
    be a priority. Considerable scope exists for a diverse range of such technologies
    and sensors with diverse capabilities. For example, biodegradable soil moisture
    sensors that not only monitor but provides soil moisture measurements could be
    available for farmers within the next 3 yr (McCauley, 2020). Also available are
    yield and weed mapping sensors, which can sense differences in production environment
    allowing farmers to quickly monitor these variables. The utilization of other
    available sensors such as climate and ground sensors that monitor a plant''s response
    to climate is another promising option and should be a priority. Data from sensors
    can measure and provide advanced analytics for early scouting of potential problems
    such as pest or weed infestation. The remote monitoring of pest activity using
    passive infra-red (PIR) sensing in pest traps has allowed the identification of
    target pests by having a low risk to secondary poisoning when baits are used and
    restricts the accidental deaths to non-target species (Parsons et al., 2020).
    The implementation of remote sensing techniques using wireless telemetric services
    aim to provide decision support to the growers for effective management of crops.
    The advances in drone imagery for multispectral, thermal, and hyperspectral mapping
    can avoid physical deployment of baits on large farms for commercial production.
    Recent advances in wireless sensor assembly using nanomaterials in combination
    with novel mutant enzymes with progressive integrative with solar cells has enriched
    the possibilities for development of biosensors for detecting the photosynthetic
    inhibiting herbicides (Bucur et al., 2018). The advancements in biosensor development
    using nanomaterials requires extensive research to monitor residual effects in
    the soil and biota of the environment. Remote sensing which includes the above-mentioned
    technologies along with satellite imagery (Figure 3a–c) and global information
    system once more fully adopted will go a long way towards achieving food security.
    Farming in controlled agricultural environments is another viable and promising
    option. Controlled in-house farming uses the benefits and efficiencies of precision
    agriculture to provide the optimal conditions to grow crops in an environmentally
    friendly way. This innovation offers farmers greater predictability as crops can
    be produced year-round since production is not affected by extreme weather or
    climatic conditions (Ramin Shamshiri et al., 2018). Nanotechnology is another
    promising technology that increases production while allowing for control and
    management of inputs. The technology is a set of nanotools capable of detecting
    minute differences or deficiencies in parameters such as soil nutrients, soil
    temperatures, plant health, or the presence of pathogens. This then allows for
    specific corrective responses to deliver with high levels of precision (Prasad
    et al., 2017) to maintain the health of both soils and plants. Despite the potential
    benefits of modern digital (e.g., DSSAT model) and climate-smart agricultural
    practices, its adoption can be challenging especially under small-to-medium-scale
    farming systems with limited farm resources. Two critical factors we should focus
    on providing the ultimate benefits of smart agriculture technologies involve:
    (a) farm size and (b) input–output cost benefit of the farm production. For example,
    site-specific and optimized irrigation management can be achieved through real-time
    soil moisture or crop canopy temperature data. On a bigger scale, spectral imagery
    acquired by aerial flights or satellite data can precisely estimate water stress.
    Therefore, the selection of decision support for moisture management depends on
    farm size or farm resource availability. In general, for small-scale and subsistence
    farms, sensors for measuring soil moisture, temperature, and other parameters
    (e.g., Watermark sensors, Irrometer tensiometer etc.) can be performed easily
    with grower''s mobile services. These direct and affordable web applications can
    provide easy, inexpensive, and accessible knowledge of the moisture status in
    field and help in irrigation scheduling. However, application of spectral imagery
    (e.g., Ceres Imaging Inc.) might not be accommodating for small-scale farming
    given economic constraints. Often, the knowledge and solutions for small-scale
    and limited resource farms depend on the understanding of factors that influence
    social-behavioral change, and the indicators they select to monitor those processes.
    Today''s digital agriculture is being supported by either web-based decision support
    tools or smartphone applications for pest or disease recognition. It would be
    interesting to see how these tools are being used effectively by the farming community
    to improve their existing farming practices. Therefore, the end-user adoption
    of this information can only be useful if the interpretation is user-friendly
    to the growers. For example, reporting NDVI in agricultural fields with a color
    range from green (∼uniformity and good vigor) to orange to red (∼stressed plants)
    could effectively be implemented as part of precision crop management (Figure
    3). The recent pandemic has influenced the farmers'' decisions about farm management
    practices. Thus, the strategies to develop and continue sustainable agricultural
    practices using digital and precision technologies and tools under this situation
    were and would be critical. Therefore, growers across the world including small
    and limited resources farmers have to create new strategies for virtual and successful
    development of farming practices. For example, on-farm trials, virtual field days,
    virtually engaging farmers groups, development of digital decision support tools
    were newly initiated or continued as a part of previous farm management practices
    that engaged and empowered farmers under this pandemic condition. 7 INTEGRATIVE
    PERMACULTURE: FUSION OF DATA SCIENCES (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING)
    WITH MODERN AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY The advancement in agricultural technology
    has revolutionized the recent trends in precision agriculture. The groundbreaking
    development in acquiring big data from crop fields aims to minimize the environmental
    footprint. The developments in WSNs and drone technology have not only helped
    the agricultural sector in acquiring big and precise data for crop and soil management
    (Zhou et al., 2012), but has also allowed to achieve 4-R stewardship by avoiding
    the blanket approach of crop production. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is
    collaborating with technological giants like Microsoft to help farmers cut costs
    of production and increase the yield by sustainably considering the global climate
    change. Integrating proximal sensing devices (e.g., portable X-ray fluorescence
    spectrometer, Vis-NIR spectrometry, NixPro) with predictive modeling techniques
    allows for rapid and in-situ elemental analysis by developing site-specific or
    region-specific models (Jha, Ulery, et al., 2021; Jha, Mukhopadhyay, et al., 2021;
    Mukhopadhyay et al., 2020; Weindorf et al., 2016). Additionally, inclusion of
    spatiotemparal imagery using multi and hyper-spectral mapping allows precise,
    optimized, and regenerative management of agricultural crops using properties
    like electrical conductivity, evapotranspiration, canopy cover, water stress,
    and vegetation index (Table 1), Nocco et al. (2019) investigated the implication
    of High-Resolution Mapping of Evapotranspiration (HRMET) model and aerial imagery
    to identify the potential benefits of water management in precision cultivation
    of sweet corn and potato crop rotations. Crop models similar to HRMET can widely
    be applied in comparing rotational practices using ground management vs. the model
    parameters. For example, the HRMET model has shown promising results for sweet
    corn and potato rotations when modeled evapotranspiration maps were compared to
    field observations in potato, sweet corn, and pea (Pisum sativum L.) agroecosystems
    (Nocco et al., 2019). This optimization towards irrigation management and application
    efficiency are effective in buffering against the climate variability. TABLE 1.

    have widely allowed monitoring the physiological crop stress, nutrient deficiency,
    crop pest, and diseases/weed management (Chlingaryan et al., 2018; Lamb & Brown,
    2001; Mehra et al., 2016) and digital soil mapping (McBratney et al., 2019) (Table
    1). Machine learning algorithms allows for the development of risk assessment
    models that can help in making disease management decisions prior to the planting
    of crop like wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (Chlingaryan et al., 2018). For examples,
    techniques like Artificial Neural Networks and regression trees as mentioned in
    Table 1 can be used to help solve problems of Stagonospora nodorum blotch in winter
    wheat (Mehra et al., 2016). Similarly, Bayesian framework can also be used in
    automated identification and algorithmic identification of weeds in corn crops
    (Chlingaryan et al., 2018; Tellaeche et al., 2008). Therefore, the algorithmic
    approach of AI and ML facilitate a reduction in residual toxicity and therefore
    achieve the sustainable goals of regenerative agriculture and integrative permaculture.
    Further, researchers have combined the knowledge of high-performance computing,
    sensor/drone technology, and ML algorithms for grain production. For example,
    comparison of red–green–blue, multispectral and thermal data of agricultural plots
    used to assess the genotypic differences in crop vigor and yield by ground and
    unmanned aerial vehicle measurements in wheat, reported similar platform proximity
    in yield assessment (Jha, Sihi, et al., 2021; Patrício & Rieder, 2018). Similarly,
    the aerial measurements due to their large spatial coverage provide improved reliability
    of management zone delineation by evaluating the variability across cropping areas
    (Khosla et al., 2010). The combination of big data modeling and clustering methods
    has enabled crop yield predictions according to management zone delineation (Pantazi
    et al., 2015). The clustering methods in crop yield predictions can be used in
    understanding the response of plant growth as a result of soil properties and
    their spatiotemporal variability. Groenendyk et al. (2014) investigated the relationship
    between plant growth and soil texture. For their study, the authors simulated
    wheat growth using HYDRUS 1D hydrological model and a k-means clustering algorithm
    approach. Results showed significant relationship between estimating crop yield
    and soil texture. Techniques involving artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive
    neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have been used in paddy production to estimate
    the in-farm emission of greenhouse gases throughout the growing season (Nabavi-Pelesaraei
    et al., 2018). This is useful in modeling the food-energy nexus in paddy production
    and creating an efficient system of minimizing the environmental impacts in a
    computationally inexpensive manner. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS)
    approach has also proved to be an important methodology to identify and correlate
    yield and variables impacting crop production (Emamgolizadeh et al., 2015; Zabihi
    et al., 2019). Turpin et al. (2005) has identified dominant factors affecting
    corn establishment and grain yields using MARS automated regression data mining
    method. Their study concluded that soil water content and cone penetration resistance
    are key parameters than elevation and mineralizable soil N in predicting crop
    establishment and grain yield. Padarian et al. (2020) used a probabilistic model
    to report the key research areas in soil science that utilizes ML techniques.
    Main topics included soil salinity (Khadim et al., 2019), soil organic C dynamics,
    soil moisture content (Greifeneder et al., 2019), pedometrics timeline (McBratney
    et al., 2019), spatial disaggregation (Flynn et al., 2019), soil mapping and modeling
    regional soil covariates (Caubet et al., 2019; Padarian et al., 2020), and soil
    physicochemical properties (Khadim et al., 2019; Lamb & Brown, 2001; Viscarra
    Rossel & McBratney, 1998). Regenerative agriculture, permaculture, and precision
    farming are overarching tools to attain sustainable goals of food production.
    These tools combined with AI and ML techniques can allow growers and scientists
    to maximize food production with minimum utilization of available resources (Table
    1). Permaculture is associated with a paradigm shift, seeking to offer partial
    solutions for the many problems of contemporary agriculture like soil degradation
    and loss of habitat, which undermines their future capacities to produce food.
    There is no one size that fits all scenario when adapting permaculture practices
    but expected benefits are still homogenous such as a reduction in chemical use
    and increased input of organic C and N to soils (Dı́az-Zorita et al., 2002). However,
    despite many successes permaculture adoption appears to have fallen short. This
    is primarily due to variations in permaculture practices as dictated by local
    conditions and its predominant goal of focusing on local community-oriented interactions.
    The lack of supporting contemporary scientific research and experimental applications
    further reduces its adoption. There have been debates on whether permaculture
    can truly feed a growing population and questions remain as to what extent it
    outperforms intensive farming system sustainably (Fiebrig et al., 2020). Its scientific
    foundation, applicability, and scalability to large land area have also been criticized
    (Fiebrig et al., 2020). Ingram (2018) describes the confusion as a mere lack of
    good evidence and intellectual rigor. The key question to answer here is whether
    permaculture can contribute broadly to agronomic yields and food security and
    performs in such ways as to benefit the wider agricultural communities. The key
    to answering this question is in the relative distributions of the population
    between rural and urban areas. These agricultural methods may not be suited for
    the input resource-intensive modern agriculture of temperate regions of North
    America, Europe, and Asia. However, for many rural communities, for example in
    Africa and South Asia where farming is an economic livelihood, permaculture is
    an important food supply function enabling local residents to meet their dietary
    needs with local culture and culinary traditions (Ferreira et al., 2018). 8 CONCLUSION
    The challenge of sustainably meeting increased food and energy demands is omnipresent.
    Specialized crop production and agricultural intensification have satisfied those
    demands for several years; however, the future of sustainable agricultural production,
    environmental footprint, and global food security is questionable. In confronting
    the challenges of achieving sustainable food security, the agricultural sector
    must focus on not only one, but a variety of strategies to be successful and agriculture
    can become a part of the solution. A multidimensional approach is necessary. Monocropping
    production systems with innovative technologies are not going away. These systems
    will continue to benefit the wider global society through massive increases in
    crop yields and food productivity. However, such successes are not sustainable
    and will continue to come at great expense to the environment. Adoption and progress
    towards regenerative agriculture, permaculture, and modern agricultural technologies
    (Figure 2) have been successful because these systems are flexible, diverse, and
    tailored to both large-scale production systems as well as local farmers and communities.
    In addition, permaculture and regenerative agriculture promote natural ecosystems
    (e.g., land) as multi-functional and emphasizes self-sufficient and self-regulating.
    Beyond embracing varied agronomic production systems, it will be important to
    have a focus on the root causes such as land degradation and climate change. We
    have demonstrated that practices such as permaculture and regenerative agriculture
    should be infused with an integrated approach of modern agricultural technology
    as well as utilization of data sciences such as AI and ML to provide a wide range
    of beneficial input services. These will, in turn aid in achieving sustainable
    food security because in many ways their ethos is on lowering production inputs
    as well as reduce environmental footprint. The unifying premises of permaculture
    and regenerative AI, agroecosystems are taking a holistic approach rather than
    focusing on just individual parts. It helps to explore how the various systems
    and their interactions can fetch overall system benefits. These approaches should
    be seen as parts of a wide range of measures, matrices, and efforts to intuitively
    approach sustainable food security goals. For permaculture practices, scientific
    data quantifying its effect and role in a future agriculture is needed and will
    be critical to promote its adoption. Further, a more robust and holistic research
    direction is necessary to integrate all these aspects of food production for overall
    socio-economic upliftment and farm productivity while managing our mother nature
    under the events of extreme weather events and climate change. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

    modeling, Plant characteristics, Soil water status. Highlights The progress made
    in agricultural irrigation scheduling in the past ten years and the current challenges
    are discussed. The main scientific scheduling strategies are based on soil water
    status, plant characteristics, and crop modeling. Challenges include large time
    and data requirements and availability of decision support systems. Opportunities
    include integration of scheduling strategies and demonstrating their effectiveness
    through local studies. Abstract. Irrigation scheduling is the process of determining
    the appropriate amount and timing of water application to achieve desired crop
    yield and quality, maximize water conservation, and minimize possible negative
    effects on the environment, such as nutrient leaching below the crop root zone.
    Effective irrigation scheduling has been shown to save water, save energy, and
    help agricultural producers achieve improved yields and quality. However, scientific
    irrigation scheduling methods generally have remained limited to mostly research
    applications with relatively low adoption by irrigators. There are several main
    approaches to irrigation scheduling, including those based on soil water status,
    plant characteristics, and/or crop modeling. Each of these approaches has advantages
    as well as limitations and sources of uncertainty and variability, depending on
    application conditions. This article summarizes progress made in the U.S. in each
    of the main scheduling approaches in the past ten years (since the 2010 Decennial
    Irrigation Symposium) and existing challenges and opportunities that should be
    considered moving forward. This article is intended to guide future research and
    extension projects in improving adoption of scientific irrigation scheduling approaches.

    \ of water resources is one of the major methods of water conservation.\nThere\
    \ are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the irrigation needs of diﬀerent agricultural ﬁelds\
    \ because of their\nspatial variability. Therefore, a decision support system\
    \ for variable rate irrigation (DSS-VRI) by\ncenter pivot was developed. This\
    \ system can process multi-spectral images taken by unmanned\naerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) and obtain the vegetation index (VI). The crop evapotranspiration model\n\
    (ETc) and crop water stress index (CWSI) were obtained from their established\
    \ relationships with the\nVIs. The inputs to the fuzzy inference system were constituted\
    \ with ETc, CWSI and precipitation.\nTo provide guidance for users, the duty-cycle\
    \ control map was outputted using ambiguity resolution.\nThe control command contained\
    \ in the map adjusted the duty cycle of the solenoid valve, and then\nchanged\
    \ the irrigation amount. A water stress experiment was designed to verify the\
    \ rationality of\nthe DSS-VRI. The results showed that the more severe water stress\
    \ is, the more irrigation is obtained,\nconsistent with the expected results.\
    \ Meanwhile, a user-friendly software interface was developed to\nimplement the\
    \ DSS-VRI function.\nKeywords: decision support system (DSS); variable rate irrigation\
    \ (VRI); fuzzy logic system; UAV\nmulti-spectral image; duty-cycle control map\n\
    1. Introduction\nChina is a country with a water shortage, especially in its northwest\
    \ regions. The shortage of\nwater resources restricts agricultural development\
    \ in many provinces, while the need for food has\ndramatically increased with\
    \ the growth of the population. Agriculture is facing more serious challenges\n\
    and requires eﬀective ways for water-saving irrigation. Variable rate irrigation\
    \ (VRI) is distinguished\nfrom traditional precision irrigation and provides such\
    \ a solution. Previous VRI research has focused\non quantitative decision-making\
    \ models, partition management, decision support systems (DSS) and\nvariable outputs\
    \ [1]. There among, the quantitative decision-making model and partition management\n\
    are key parts of VRI, variable output plays the role of executor, and DSS connected\
    \ all parts of VRI.\nThe DSS has been discussed as a popular topic in the VRI\
    \ system. Navarro [2] developed\na DSS for estimating weekly irrigation needs\
    \ on the basis of soil measurements and climatic variables\nwhich were gathered\
    \ by several autonomous nodes deployed in farmland. Nain [3] used a DSS to\ngenerate\
    \ suitable decision outputs for irrigation and fertilization in hilly regions.\
    \ Miller [4] developed\na DSS, which uses the Natural Resources Conservation Service\
    \ Gridded Soil Survey Geographic\nDatabase to estimate water capacity available\
    \ for root zone, and determines irrigation amount based\nSensors 2019, 19, 2880;\
    \ doi:10.3390/s19132880\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 2880\n\
    2 of 15\non the estimates.\nBesides, AgroClimate is a DSS tool for improving the\
    \ eﬃciency of irrigation\nwater usage (http://mz.agroclimate.org/) with its irrigation\
    \ decision made on the basis of daily crop\nevapotranspiration calculated by the\
    \ Hargreaves equation and crop coeﬃcients [5]. Most DSSs are\ngenerally designed\
    \ for speciﬁc crops or farmlands; it is diﬃcult to apply them in other crops or\
    \ the\nsame crop planted in diﬀerent districts. In view of this, Yang [6] developed\
    \ a decision support system\nfor ﬂexible irrigation scheduling (DSS-FIS), in which\
    \ users can modify its input parameters through\na software interface to adapt\
    \ it to various environments.\nThe use of DSSs for irrigation ties in implementing\
    \ a reliable decision method and using decision\ndata sources. Weather forecast\
    \ information can be a way to estimate the water requirements of the\ncrops [7].\
    \ However, this method is unilateral, since it ignores the impact of crop characteristics\
    \ and\nspatial variability. Some studies have used sensors and the global positioning\
    \ system (GPS) to collect\ninformation about speciﬁc soil and plant conditions\
    \ for irrigation scheduling. Sui [8] built a wireless\nsensor network to monitor\
    \ soil water content and collect weather data. O’Shaughnessy [9] used\ninfrared\
    \ temperature (IRT) sensor nodes mounted on masts at the edge of each concentric\
    \ treatment\narea to measure crop canopy temperature. Morari [10] used time domain\
    \ transmissometry (TDT)\nsensors to measure soil moisture content. Since these\
    \ sensors are immobile, the irrigation decision\naccuracy depends on the number\
    \ of sensors in the large-scale planting area or on the truss of the\nsprinkle\
    \ irrigation machine, and large-scale deployment of these sensors is not economical\
    \ for a moving\nsprinkler irrigation system. Also, the sensors mounted in the\
    \ ﬁeld are harmful to the farmland\nsoil ecosystem.\nIn recent years, irrigation\
    \ scheduling could be obtained from some schemes based on various\nremote sensing\
    \ imagery platforms. Remote sensing technology has the advantages of good real-time\n\
    performance and wide coverage on cropland, and makes up for the defects of immobile\
    \ sensors.\nThe development of aerospace technology makes it possible for irrigation\
    \ scheduling to use remote\nsensing imagery platforms, with unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) and satellites as common tools.\nHowever, satellites can be inhibited\
    \ by clouds and/or may not be in orbital position during crop\ndevelopment stages\
    \ [11]. Zhang [12] suggested that canopy temperature from UAV thermal infrared\n\
    images could be a way to evaluate the crop water stress state. The thermal infrared\
    \ sensors currently\nmounted are mostly lightweight and uncooled thermal infrared\
    \ cameras. Compared to multispectral\nremote-sensing systems, thermal imagery\
    \ has the advantage of higher reliability, but the multispectral\nremote-sensing\
    \ system has better performance in terms of information acquisition stability\
    \ and mosaic\ntechnology maturity. Meanwhile, canopy temperature measured by thermal\
    \ infrared camera is easily\naﬀected by air temperature and human activity [13].\
    \ Recently, many studies use UAV spectral images\nto mark crop water status through\
    \ the optimization of the vegetation index (VI) and crop water stress\nindex (CWSI)\
    \ model [14]. The VI-CWSI model, as the main index of the DSS, is usually used\
    \ as\nevidence for irrigation dispatching. Zhang [15] used high-resolution UAV\
    \ multispectral imagery to\nmap maize water stress status. The crop evapotranspiration\
    \ model (ETc) is also used as evidence for\nirrigation dispatching. Calera [16]\
    \ reviewed the crop evapotranspiration model (ETc) on optical remote\nsensing\
    \ for the assessment of crop water requirements, and demonstrated that ET can\
    \ be a reliable\nindicator for irrigation assessment. This approach is based on\
    \ the Food and Agriculture Organization’s\n(FAO) method for estimating crop evapotranspiration,\
    \ in which reference evapotranspiration values\nare multiplied by crop coeﬃcients\
    \ (Kc).\nThe coeﬃcient may be derived from multispectral VI.\nSome approaches\
    \ have employed signals in the thermal band obtained from remote sensors as inputs\n\
    for energy balance equations that are solved to estimate ETc [17]. The multispectral\
    \ VI approach for\nestimating crop evapotranspiration requires fewer inputs and\
    \ theoretical background knowledge,\nand is thus simpler than the energy balance\
    \ equations approach. In this paper, multispectral VIs were\nused to calculate\
    \ crop coeﬃcients.\nWater stressed crops manifest symptoms such as leaf wilting,\
    \ stunted growth, and leaf area\nreduction [18]. VI can be used to monitor surface\
    \ vegetation conditions. The structure indices\nbased on visible, near infrared\
    \ and red-edge bands are more widely used, such as the normalized\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 2880\n3 of 15\ndiﬀerence vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation\
    \ index (SAVI), enhanced vegetation index\n(EVI), simple ratio (SR) and green\
    \ normalized diﬀerence vegetation index (GNDVI), and visible\natmospherically\
    \ resistant index (VARI). The NDVI is the most often used, partly due to its “ratio”\n\
    properties, which enable the NDVI to cancel out a large proportion of the noise\
    \ caused by changing\nsun angles, topography, clouds or shadow, and atmospheric\
    \ conditions [19]. The SAVI was established\nto improve the sensitivity of the\
    \ NDVI to soil backgrounds [14]. The EVI has thus been considered\na modiﬁed NDVI\
    \ with improved sensitivity to high biomass regions and improved vegetation\n\
    monitoring capability through a de-coupling of the canopy background signal and\
    \ a reduction in\natmospheric inﬂuences [19]. The SR can monitor changes in vegetation\
    \ cover and works best when\nvegetation is densely covered [20]. The GNDVI is\
    \ sensitive to crop pigment changes [21]. The VARI can\nreduce the eﬀects of illumination\
    \ and atmospheric conditions [22]. This paper measured reﬂectance\nindices within\
    \ multispectral ranges (NDVI, SAVI, EVI, SR, GNDVI, VARI) to indicate canopy changes\n\
    due to water stress.\nThe DSS has been used in many cases. The constraints of\
    \ some kinds of DSSs widely used\nin agricultural applications have not been eliminated.\
    \ Firstly, the output of the DSS is the input\ninformation of the control system.\
    \ The actual amount of irrigation is based on the crop’s water\nrequirement, which\
    \ is not the only factor in practical irrigation scheduling. The DSS should be\n\
    combined with a VRI control system. Common methods of control systems include\
    \ zone control and\nspeed control [23]. Speed control varies the moving speed\
    \ of the center pivot to accomplish the desired\nirrigation depth, while the duty-cycle\
    \ control changes the on-oﬀ time of individual sprinklers or groups\nof sprinklers\
    \ to achieve the desired irrigation depth. Generally, the VRI control system provides\n\
    opportunities to apply water to management zones by diﬀerent moving rates or diﬀerent\
    \ solenoid\nvalve duty-cycles. Secondly, the CWSI/Kc inversion model (VI-Kc/VI-CWSI)\
    \ is built for speciﬁc districts\nand crops. Diﬀerent crops have diﬀerent optimization\
    \ VI-Kc/VI-CWSI model [24,25]. Diﬀerent districts\nwith the same crop also have\
    \ diﬀerent VI-Kc/VI-CWSI [26]. The DSS based on the ﬁxed model is\nunsuitable\
    \ for other applications. Third, the irrigation amount is the result of a multifactorial\
    \ decision.\nActually, precise measurement of the irrigation requirement is complicated,\
    \ whose implementation\nneeds a lot of funds and time.\nThe concept of a fuzzy\
    \ system has been used for a realistic decision support model. For the\nirrigation\
    \ mission, the interaction between the crop water requirement and irrigation amount\
    \ is not\nalways accurately deﬁned. Therefore, the fuzzy model can be a viable\
    \ alternative [27]. The fuzzy\nsystem has the characteristics of simple rules\
    \ and wide applicability [28], and can analyze the inaccurate\ninformation and\
    \ receive irrigation guidance from complex farming sites [29]. So it is easier\
    \ for users to\naccept DSSs based on fuzzy logic.\nThis study developed a DSS\
    \ for variable rate irrigation (DSS-VRI) that serviced a center-pivot\nirrigation\
    \ system. The function of the DSS integrated image processing and data analysis\
    \ for UAV\nremote sensing. By using the DSS, users can easily process the image\
    \ and obtain a duty-cycle control\nmap of variable irrigation. The speciﬁc objectives\
    \ of this research were:\n(i) To develop a widely applicable DSS-VRI, which mainly\
    \ embodies the user to change some\nconditional parameters and to construct a\
    \ partial decision model to work in diﬀerent cases.\n(ii) To achieve expected\
    \ irrigation amounts in diﬀerent management areas, by using the duty-cycle\ncontrol\
    \ map generated from the DSS-VRI, which combines the UAV multispectral remote\
    \ sensing\nsystem and fuzzy inference system.\n2. System Description and Operation\n\
    In this study, a DSS-VRI was designed to make an irrigation scheduling map. The\

    Note: “Low” is interpreted as less rainfall or evapotranspiration in the coming\
    \ week, “average” and “Normal” as\nnormal rainfall and evapotranspiration in the\
    \ next week, “High” as rainy or high evapotranspiration in the coming\nweek, F\
    \ as crop water stress in the current state. S as mild water stress, and ES as\
    \ most severe stress.\nThese rules were represented with logical operator ‘&’.\
    \ For example, the ﬁrst rule is expressed as\n‘(ETc==Low) & (Precipitation==Low)\
    \ & (CWSI==F)=>(Duty-cycle=ML)’, and is interpreted as less\nrainfall and less\
    \ evapotranspiration in the coming week, low crop water stress in the current\
    \ state,\nso implies lower duty cycle. The duty cycle is the ratio of the ‘on’\
    \ time to the ‘on-oﬀ’ period. Lower\nduty cycles represent lower amounts of water\
    \ application.\n2.3. DSS-VRI Software Design and Operation\nA software was designed\
    \ to implement the proposed methodology. The application system was\nprogrammed\
    \ in Python (python 3.6.2). The DSS-VRI software generally needs about ﬁve minutes\n\
    to get duty-cycle control map, depending on the input data scale. The user interface\
    \ was designed\nand organized into several frames. Figure 4a gives the data input\
    \ interface, which allow the users\nto input multispectral image and to set some\
    \ basic parameters, including geographic coordinates\nand Moving rate of sprinkler\
    \ irrigation machine, parameters of zone management, application depth\nunder\
    \ the 100% moving rate, saving path of duty-cycle control command. Among all parameters,\n\
    geographic coordinates can be used to ﬁnd the center position of the machine in\
    \ remote sensing image.\nZone management parameters are used to set the number\
    \ of electromagnetic valve groups and the\ndistance between the sprinkler center\
    \ and each management group boundary. Moving speed is related\nto the maximum\
    \ crop water requirement. The relationship can be expressed as ‘the more crop\
    \ water\nis required, the slower the speed is’. After all parameter values are\
    \ entered, the user can click the\n“Update” button to get band information and\
    \ header ﬁle of the image. The interface for calculation of\nCWSI, ETc and precipitation\
    \ is shown in Figure 4b. Users can select the VI-Kc model and VI-CWSI\nmodel,\
    \ and enter weather forecast data of the next week to calculate ET0 and rainfall.\
    \ Figure 4c shows\nthe irrigation duty-cycle control map and NDVI map interface.\
    \ Users click the “Irrigation map” and\n“Spectral map” button to get a variable\
    \ irrigation duty-cycle control map and a NDVI map, respectively.\nThe NDVI map\
    \ has the information interaction function, which can display VIs and ETc of the\
    \ mouse\nlocation. Figure 4d shows the local data analysis interface, which can\
    \ assist users to observe local\nvariation of VI by using 3D-bar plot. Figure\
    \ 4d presents NDVI examples, including the coordinates,\nNDVI value and spatial\
    \ distribution. Users click the “User manual” button to get help page and\n“Control\
    \ system” to open control system software. In addition, the help page of the DSS-VRI\
    \ can guide\nusers to learn about the system’s structure and function descriptions.\n\

    for agriculture is the biggest consumer of freshwater in the world, which makes
    a case for the intensive use of technology to optimize the use of water, reduce
    the consumption of energy and improve the quality of crops. While the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and other associated technologies are the natural choice for smart
    water management applications, their appropriateness is still to be proven in
    real settings with the deployment of on-site pilots. Also, IoT-based application
    development platforms should be generic enough to be adapted to different crops,
    climates, and countries. The SWAMP project develops IoT based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in precision irrigation domain and pilots them in Italy,
    Spain, and Brazil. In this paper, we present the SWAMP view, architecture, pilots
    and the scenario-based development process adopted in the project. Published in:

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Bilbao, Spain SECTION I. Introduction Water
    is vital for ensuring food security to the world’s population, and agriculture
    is by far the biggest consumer amounting to 70% of freshwater [7]. The leading
    causes of water wastage are leakages in distribution and irrigation systems, as
    well as, the field application methods, which result in wastage and the cultivation
    of crops. The most common irrigation technique, surface irrigation, is also the
    least precise one, which wastes a high percentage of the water by wetting areas
    where no plants can benefit from it. On the other hand, localized irrigation can
    use water more efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under-irrigation and
    over-irrigation. However, in an attempt to avoid loss of productivity by underirrigation,
    farmers feed more water than is needed and as a result not only productivity is
    challenged but also water is wasted. Therefore, technology should be developed
    and deployed for sensing the level of water needed by the plantation and for flowing
    the water in the proper amount to places where and when it is needed. The Internet
    of Things (IoT) [1] and other related technologies can be used for that purpose,
    but it faces several challenges. Firstly, Software Development for IoT-based smart
    applications is today not automatized and demands much effort. Secondly, advanced
    platforms are needed, that can automate part of the process and integrate different
    technologies and components for dealing with a multitude of requirements. Thirdly,
    the integration of heterogeneous and advanced sensors, particularly flying sensors
    (i.e., drones), may provide precision in the water supply for irrigation in agriculture.
    Fourthly, the use of a Software Platform together with different technologies
    such as IoT, big data analytics, cloud computing, fog computing [3] and drones,
    for the deployment of pilot applications for smart water management. Fifthly,
    new business models for using IoT in smart water management settings are necessary.
    Moreover, finally, components must be interoperable, flexible and adaptable to
    be replicable to different locations, crops, and contexts. The primary objective
    of the SWAMP1 project is to develop IoT based methods and approaches for smart
    water management in precision irrigation domain and to pilot the approaches in
    four places, two pilots in Europe (Italy and Spain) and two pilots in Brazil.
    Also, we aim at improving precision irrigation by increasing the awareness of
    the condition of the crop, by monitoring the field based on crop status (size,
    growing phase) and environment (e.g., weather forecast) and to adjust the irrigation
    prescription map accordingly. The smart water management pilots aim at guaranteeing
    that technological components are flexible enough to adapt to different contexts
    and to be replicable in different locations and settings. The same underlying
    SWAMP platform can be customized to different pilots considering different countries,
    climate, soil, and crops. The SWAMP layered architecture considers three types
    of services to ensure its replication and adaptability to different crops and
    locations. Entirely replicable services deal with IoT services, virtual entities
    and storage services, and data analytics and machine learning, respectively. Fully
    customizable services deal with water data management issues that specialize generic
    analytic services into particular techniques for different types of irrigation
    and water distribution. Those services may require being customized whenever a
    new pilot is designed, developed and deployed. Finally, application specific services
    require higher development effort since they serve particular farms. The architecture
    may be implemented in a range of deployment configurations involving the use of
    smart algorithms and analytics in the cloud, fog-based smart decisions located
    on the farm premises and possibly mobile fog nodes acting in the field (e.g.,
    drones or in the central pivot irrigation mechanisms). In this paper, we present
    the SWAMP view of water management, the SWAMP architecture, the four SWAMP pilots
    and a scenario-oriented development process that consider both the crop needs
    and technological solutions. In the remainder of this paper, section II introduces
    concepts and related work. Section III introduces SWAMP concepts and methodology,
    while section IV presents the four pilots. Section V presents scenarios for deploying
    the pilots, and finally, section VI draws conclusions and future work. SECTION
    II. Iot In Precision Irrigation For Agriculture The Internet of Things is expected
    to have a decisive influence in the automation of smart water management applications.
    However, the development of IoT-enabled applications still takes tremendous efforts
    due to the lack of proper tools [8]. This scenario opens new opportunities and
    challenges in the specification, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of
    software development platforms for smart water management. The SWAMP project is
    being built upon existing efforts, generic platforms, architectures and research
    results [13]. The IoT-A project developed the IoT Reference Architecture for the
    generation of compliant IoT concrete architectures, focusing on using the current
    state of the art, rather than applying a clean slate approach [2]. FIWARE evolved
    from an EU-funded initiative for cloud services and now includes a platform with
    a set of Generic Enablers for developing smart applications [12], such as in the
    precision irrigation domain for agriculture [10]. When it comes to providing advanced
    features to the management of natural resources, such as water, there are some
    isolated initiatives not necessarily connected to the existing platforms and architectures.
    For example, the FIGARO project aims at increasing water productivity and improving
    irrigation practices through the development of a precision irrigation management
    platform, but not directly involving IoT [6]. Also, Popović et al. [11] present
    a case study of the specially designed and currently limited IoTenabled platform
    for collecting data in precision agriculture and ecological monitoring domains.
    Agri-IoT [9] is a theoretical IoT-based framework for data analytics and realtime
    processing for smart farming that shares some similarities with SWAMP. However,
    so far no real deployments have been reported, making it difficult to compare
    with SWAMP. In the last years, much has been said about the prospective uses for
    IoT combined with cloud-based services and big data analytics. Now, the time has
    come to conduct experiments in real settings. In Europe, there is a current concern
    to understand the challenges and compelling impacts of IoT in large-scale pilots
    for smart agriculture. Brewster et al. discuss the deployment of those large-scale
    pilots for IoT in agriculture and describe technologies and solutions that might
    be present in some agrifood domains, such as dairy, fruit, arable crops and meat
    & vegetable supply chain [5]. Also, the European project IoF2020 aims at fostering
    the adoption of IoT in large-scale pilots in the farming and food domain2. Current
    existing solutions are mostly theoretical with limited proof of concept experiences.
    They are either too generic or too specific and do not explicitly address easy
    system development and deployment for facilitating replicability of scenarios
    and streamlining the deployment of new pilots. This is where SWAMP comes to play.
    SECTION III. Concept and Methodology The SWAMP project is developing a high-precision
    smart irrigation system concept for agriculture depicted in Fig. 1. The fundamental
    idea is to enable optimizations of irrigation, water distribution, and consumption
    based on a holistic analysis that collects information from all aspects of the
    system including even the natural water cycle and the cumulated knowledge related
    to growing particular plants. It results in savings to all parties as it guarantees
    the availability of water in situations where water supply is limited and also
    prevents over-and under-irrigation. Fig. 1. Precision irrigation based on smart
    water management Show All As depicted in Fig. 1 we identify three broad phases
    in a water management system for agriculture: W1: Water reserve: water reserves
    coming from different sources such as rivers, lakes, dams, and aquifers, which
    follow the natural water cycle. W2: Water distribution: water is transported from
    W1 to the final usage place (W3) through a network of canals, pipes, pumps, valves,
    and gates. Water distribution may assume different configurations depending on
    the region or country. In some places, water resources are carefully used and
    controlled by a central authority. W3: Water consumption: in agriculture, one
    of the critical uses of water is irrigation, which can be performed by different
    techniques. Irrigation (W3) is the principal objective of the SWAMP project. The
    SWAMP platform provides mechanisms for data acquisition from sensors, making decisions
    using a variety of different techniques and changing system behavior by sending
    commands to both automatic and human actuators. For Water Consumption (W3) SWAMP
    will provide real-time responses for adapting irrigation as crop conditions change.
    On the other hand, as changes in water distribution are performed in a different
    timescale, the management loop for W2 will be longer. W2 and W3 management systems
    are integrated, as water usage triggers water distribution. The SWAMP Architecture
    is divided into five layers, as depicted in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. SWAMP Architecture
    Show All Layer 1: IoT Services: A variety of sensor and actuator technologies
    to acquire soil (e.g., moisture and temperature), plant (e.g., vegetation index,
    canopy temperature) and weather (e.g., air temperature and relative humidity,
    precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, and direction) will be tested during
    the project. Layer 2: Virtual Entity and Data Storage: IoT Service descriptions
    are annotated with contextual metadata about the physical environment to create
    Virtual Entity (VE) representations of physical entities. Distributed databases
    composed of cloud and fog nodes work together for dealing with a massive amount
    of data coming from sensors and make them available to the upper layers. Layer
    3: Data Analytics: provides different components for context-aware management
    supported by cloud-based big data analytics techniques. SWAMP will utilize existing
    models and algorithms to realize the Layer 3, which may vary for different crops
    and pilots. Layer 4: Water Data Management: builds application related middleware
    management services on top of the generic data processing services provided by
    Layer 3. This layer decouples the irrigation-related business rules from applications
    providing an API for Layer 5 with a variety of algorithms, models, and mechanisms
    for facilitating and streamlining the development and deployment of new pilots.
    Layer 5: Water Application Services: A multitude of data that is sensed, acquired,
    stored, and processed is transformed into services that make sense to farmers.
    SWAMP initially will consider two types of water application services, water distribution
    services, and water usage services (i.e., irrigation). A fundamental idea in SWAMP
    is to facilitate the replication of water management systems built on top of its
    platform with minimum redesign and redevelopment. Different layers of the architecture
    have components that are more generic and thus less difficult to be ported to
    other pilots, whereas others are more application-specific and thus require new
    development efforts whenever a new pilot is conceived. When it comes to the generality/specificity
    scale, the SWAMP architecture provides three categories of components: a) Fully
    Replicable Services: Layers 1, 2 and 3 of the architecture are generic enough
    to allow them to be replicable in different settings. Sensors, actuators and associated
    IoT Services vary according to the specific application domain; b) Fully Customizable
    Services: Layer 4 provides services that are closer to the final application and
    therefore must be aware of a level of detail that may vary for different techniques
    and models of water distribution and irrigation. Those services may require being
    customized for every new pilot; c) Application Specific Services: Services in
    Layer 5 address particularities of pilots. Given that parameters vary considerably
    for different countries, regulations, climate conditions, crops and soils, those
    services usually require more effort to be customized. SECTION IV. Swamp Pilots
    A. Pilot: Smart Water Distribution (Italy - CBEC) The Consorzio di Bonifica Emilia
    Centrale (CBEC) is a reclamation consortium of the Emilia-Romagna Region in Northern
    Italy, responsible for the irrigation and water drainage of an area of nearly
    3,130 km2 where most water required for irrigation is withdrawn from the Po river
    (Fig. 3). The water is distributed to the farms by an intricate irrigation infrastructure
    composed of more than 3580 km of canals, more than 200 small streams, six draining
    plants, and 72 pump stations with the capacity of 416 cubic meters per second.
    Fig. 3. Water distribution management pilot: open earth canal (left), manual operation
    (center) and water intake (right) Show All The supply and irrigation network consists
    of open channels on earth. Relevant widths characterize the main canals and their
    filling for the irrigation season involves the use of substantial water volumes
    that are not always recoverable for irrigation purposes. Water losses are due
    to evaporation and infiltration through canal banks and bottom, as well as to
    the management of the irrigation network that requires the filing of long canals
    stretches and several minor streams to accommodate farmer needs. The irrigation
    network also acts as drainage network for the cultivated areas. The SWAMP project
    aims at enhancing the overall system efficiency by acting at farmers and irrigation
    consortium levels. At the farmer level, SWAMP provides a better estimation of
    water needs regarding both amounts of water and time of delivery. This precise
    estimation can be achieved by the implementation of the IoT infrastructure that
    enables the integration of groundbased information with the weather forecast.
    At the consortium level, the management of the irrigation network can benefit
    from the optimization of multiple water requests ensured by the technological
    platform. The platform collects water needs adjusting the operational management
    of canals by merging detailed information of water needs, weather forecasts, and
    multiple requirements from farmers served by the same irrigation infrastructure.
    In particular, the SWAMP project enables the monitoring, automation, and remote
    control of the major hydraulic infrastructures, through which CBEC manages the
    water distribution within the irrigation district. The renovation of the hydraulic
    infrastructures together with the implementation of the IoT platform and data
    analytics scheme is expected to enable a consistent enhancement of the water distribution
    management that will persist after the project life. B. Pilot: Smart precision
    irrigation (Spain - Intercrop) This pilot is located in Cartagena, Spain, in the
    premises of Intercrop Iberica and addresses several challenges of smart irrigation
    and water management of geographically distributed fields, aiming at demonstrating
    the use of IoT sensor platforms and drones to achieve increased crop yield with
    optimal water usage with minimum labor effort. Even though Cartagena is located
    on the coast, that is a dry area with a short rain season with intense rains in
    just a few days. A considerable amount of water comes from a desalination plant,
    what contributes to make it a scarce and expensive good. Farms are distributed
    over areas of roughly 30 km radius in intensive cropping area. Pilot site is shown
    in Fig. 4. The immediate closeness of the control fields gives ideal circumstances
    to verify the effectiveness of the deployed methods. There are three growth periods
    during the project giving an opportunity to do iterative piloting and compare
    the results of different iterations. Fig. 4. Intercrop irrigation pilot site.
    In the right, the arrow shows the precise location of the pilot site Show All
    Growing period starts in early September and finishes by late April. Crops are
    from different ranges such as lettuce, endive, spinach, herbs, and bay leaf. These
    farms are irrigated separately through their proper reservoirs and irrigation
    systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods, we selected the pilot
    site from the same area with control field that is using traditional irrigation
    and monitoring methods. Irrigation system on the pilot field is managed using
    solenoid valves, and total water consumption can be monitored via water meters.
    Facilities used in piloting are a local weather station, online weather services,
    long life smart soil sensors, drone gateway, and real-time cloud data analysis.
    C. Pilot: Variable Rate Irrigation (Brazil) The MATOPIBA region encompasses the
    Brazilian states of Maranhão (MA), Tocantins (TO), Piauí (PI) and Bahia (BA),
    and is one of the most critical irrigated agricultural frontier in the country,
    located in the cerrado, a savannah climate subtype. Irrigation is mostly performed
    by thousands of center pivots, each one with an average size of 100 ha. The municipality
    of Luís Eduardo Magalhães (Fig. 5), the location for the center pivot pilot, is
    considered the capital of Brazilian agribusiness. Fig. 5. Center-pivot irrigation
    pilot: location of the pilot site (left) and center pivot irrigation for soybean
    crop (right) Show All The soybean production reached about 5.5 million tons in
    2016. Despite such production, the farmers estimated 40% crop losses due to the
    2015/16 season drought. The production from many properties was only 30 sacks
    per hectare, while an average of 58 sacks was expected. With irrigation and investments
    in soil fertility, some producers expect that this number can reach 80 sacks.
    Although irrigation is an alternative, its expansion depends on technologies that
    improve operating costs. For example, in 2015/16 the government imposed double
    charges to the energy used in irrigation, which costs seven sacks per hectare
    against three and a half sacks with a typical energy charging. The main MATOPIBA
    pilot goal is to implement and evaluate a smart irrigation system based on Variable
    Rate Irrigation (VRI) for center pivots in soybean production. However, alternate
    crops like corn and cotton are also usual, including during the same season. Conventional
    center pivot irrigation systems help to provide a reliable supply of water, increase
    yields, and provide double cropping potential. The proposed smart irrigation will
    help the crop in the same way while making rational use of water and energy. D.
    Pilot: Precision Drop Irrigation (Brazil - Guaspari) One of the significant innovations
    of winemaking in State of São Paulo, Brazil, is occurring in the municipality
    of Espírito Santo do Pinhal in the Guaspari Winery. It is the transfer of wine
    grape harvesting to the winter season (June-August), when the thermal amplitude,
    insolation, and absence of rainfall are better for harvesting, similar to the
    great wine regions of the world. The different terroirs that compose the vineyard
    are divided into plots, which are harvested separately. In that growing area,
    altitude ranges between 1,000 m and 1,300 m; nights are cold and optimal sunshine
    during the day provides an air temperature range between 10°C and 12°C at harvesting
    time, similar to that of large European regions. The soil is developed from granite
    rock, with good drainage, which is suitable for grapes destined to produce high-quality
    wines. The application of water by an irrigation system depends on the crop, weather,
    and soil conditions. Even with the availability of several criteria and procedures
    for the performance of irrigation management, the technique has a low adoption
    rate by the farmers. Occasionally irrigation is based on only the experience of
    the grower, on the visualization of the wet soil surface or even on the perception
    of visual symptoms of plant water deficit, which, when identified late, can affect
    yield and product quality. The lack of knowledge about irrigation management procedures
    can lead to the failure of this water application practice, even if there is a
    system designed for a specific cropping area. Guaspari Winery uses drip irrigation
    in its vineyards, with a single hose and emitters spaced at 0.5 m, and measured
    the flow of 1.9 L h-1. The experimental area has 1.1 ha and is shown in Fig. 6.
    The objectives of the Guaspari Winery Pilot are: a) to perform automatic measuring
    of soil water content at different soil depths and in several vineyards inside
    the winery s growing area; b) to store data in the cloud about soil water content
    be jointly processed with weather and crop information; c) To provide quick and
    accurate irrigation management information. Fig. 6. Guaspari Winery: Vineyard
    and pilot location (right) Show All SECTION V. Swamp Scenarios The SWAMP Platform
    is being built on existing and new concepts and technologies, implementing the
    SWAMP vision (Fig. 1) through the SWAMP Architecture (Fig. 2), which may be flexible
    enough to deal with the needs of four different IoT pilots for smart water management
    in precision irrigation located in three countries. For making this vision to
    come true, a scenario-based architecture design and requirement gathering are
    being conducted to match the needs of crops and farmers’ expertise with existing
    technological solutions. Fig. 7 depicts the scenario representing the center-pivot
    with variable-rate irrigation pilot to be deployed in the MATOPIBA region in Brazil.
    The scenario captures both the farm and SWAMP Platform viewpoints and represents
    a future vision and not the current situation. A center pivot irrigates a circular
    agricultural plot of 100 hectares that alternates soybeans and cotton. The plot
    is further divided into different management zones, identified before the crop
    season and based on differences in the soil properties. Even though the crop is
    the same throughout the plot, each management zone receives a different irrigation
    prescription, to make available the same amount of water for plants regardless
    the way water is percolated and infiltrated in different soil types. Two general
    types of sensors collect data for the SWAMP system: a) stationary sensors within
    the soil at the root system depth that continually measure metrics such as temperature
    and moisture, and; b) drones acting as flying sensors equipped with thermal/multispectral
    cameras or working as data mules by collecting sensor data and transmitting to
    the farm’s office. The center pivot is electrified to make it able to control
    the variable rate irrigation sprinklers (actuators) and thus it can also be equipped
    with processing and communication capabilities. No special energy harvesting is
    predicted for the sensing devices. We will develop multiparametric probes for
    soil sensing, which include moisture, temperature and electrical conductivity
    sensors at three depths from the soil surface. In intensive agriculture areas
    the plan is also to experiment ultra low power wireless sensor solutions based
    on wake up radios combined with LoRaWAN [3]. Sensors will stay on standby and
    wake up for a few milliseconds. Sampling and transmission rates will be adjusted
    from a few minutes up to hours, according to the time of the day and the application
    requirements. This way, the probe sensing electronics combined with ZigBee or
    low power LoRaWAN will be powered by extended lifespan batteries. We consider
    using both ZigBee and LoRaWAN, for short and long distances, respectively. Other
    sensing devices deployed in low quantity or devices requiring heavier duty cycles,
    like a water source level sensor and weather station, will be solar powered. Both
    the center pivot and drones are considered Field Fog Nodes (FFN) in the SWAMP
    Architecture. Notably, the FFN at the center pivot acts as a sensor aggregation
    point and as a distributor of actuator commands received from the SWAMP system.
    FFNs communicate with the nearest fixed attachment point of the SWAMP Platform,
    which usually is an onpremises Fog Hub Node (or just fog hub) located in the farm’s
    office. Please notice that this choice aims at providing autonomous processing
    capacity to the farm at our pilot since it is in a region where Internet connections
    may suffer periods of instability. SWAMP allows FFNs to communicate directly with
    the Platform running in the cloud, whenever this is the preferred deployment choice.
    The FFNs send data directly to the SWAMP Platform located in the CFN at the farm’s
    offices via different wireless technologies. In Fig. 7 it is represented by a
    Base Station, such as a WiFi access point, a LoRaWAN gateway, a ZigBee router
    or a Cell Base Station. For this scenario, the functions performed by the SWAMP
    Architecture are divided up into local Fog and remote Cloud components. Heavy
    processing, such as irrigation models and analytics using smart algorithms (i.e.,
    machine learning), is performed in the cloud. In our pilot, we will first experiment
    with existing irrigation models for precision agriculture where analytics plays
    the role of automatic parameter tuning. After enough data is obtained, analytical
    models will be tested for generating the irrigation prescription maps. External
    information is fed to the platform, such as crop yield models, meteorological
    data and historical data. Fig. 7. Scenario representing the center-pivot irrigation
    pilot Show All Fig. 8 depicts the CBEC SWAMP pilot, focused on water distribution
    management. Water is conveyed from the Po River in Italy through a network of
    open canals automated by a set of pumps, valves, gauges and gates operated by
    CBEC. The SWAMP platform estimates the water needs of individual farms by analyzing
    sensor data and other relevant information, generates the irrigation prescription
    maps and sends them to the farmers, who perform the irrigation using the method
    they see fit. The water need estimate for each farm is in turn fed into a component
    devoted to optimizing the management of water distribution, by sending commands
    to actuators installed in devices that control the water flow through the canals,
    up to the point farmers can use them. The purpose is to make more efficient use
    of the water deviated from the river. Fig. 8 does not explicitly show how the
    data is sent from sensors to the SWAMP platform because different technologies
    are used by farmers to transmit the data through the Internet. The SWAMP Platform
    is represented as a single component, whereas in practice a distributed cloud/fog
    architecture can be used, such as the one shown in Fig. 7. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    IoT is the natural choice for smart water management applications, but its appropriateness
    is still to be proven in real settings with the deployment of on-site pilots.
    In this paper, we presented the SWAMP project, which develops IoT based methods
    for smart water management in precision irrigation, and pilots them in Italy,
    Spain, and Brazil. We introduced the SWAMP view, architecture, pilots and the
    scenario-based development process adopted in the project. SWAMP is still in its
    beginning but has already attracted the attention of farmers, agribusiness companies,
    and government agencies around the world. In its current stage, we visited and
    surveyed the pilots and explored the implications on the platform of different
    pilot sites, crops and requirements. The key insights so far refer to the commonalities
    and variability of features of pilots that can positively contribute to the design
    of a genuinely replicable SWAMP platform. Fig. 8. Scenario representing the water

    content Highlights • Novel site-specific water production functions (WPFs) were
    developed and tested. • New zoning procedures for variable rate irrigation were
    established. • The k-NN WPF accurately predicted cotton yield under supplemental
    irrigation. • Sector zoning was predicted to enhance cotton yield under supplemental
    irrigation. Abstract Irrigation management has evolved into a top priority issue
    since available fresh water resources are limited. Water production functions
    (WPFs), mathematical relationships between applied water and crop yield, are useful
    tools for irrigation management and economic analysis of yield reduction due to
    deficit irrigation. This study aimed at (i) designing and evaluating site-specific
    WPFs (using k nearest neighbors (k-NN), multiple linear regression, and neural
    networks), (ii) simulating yield maps for uniform, sector control VRI, and zone
    control VRI center pivot systems using the site-specific WPFs, (iii) using the
    best WPF to investigate different cotton irrigation and zoning strategies using
    integer linear programming, and (iv) comparing soil-based and WPF-based zones
    for sector control VRI systems. A two-year cotton irrigation experiment (2013–2014)
    was implemented to study irrigation-cotton lint yield relationship across different
    soil types. The site-specific k-NN WPFs showed the highest performance with root
    mean square error equal to 0.131 Mg ha−1 and 0.194 Mg ha−1 in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
    The result indicated that variable rate irrigation with limited sector control
    capability could enhance cotton lint yield under supplemental irrigation when
    field-level spatial soil heterogeneity is significant. The temporal changes in
    climate and rainfall patterns, however, had a great impact on cotton response
    to irrigation in west Tennessee, a moderately humid region with short season environment.
    We believe site-specific WPFs are useful empirical tools for on-farm irrigation
    research. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords CottonPrecision

    1.1. Variable rate irrigation The demand for food and fiber is increasing as the
    world’s population grows. Irrigation management has evolved into a top priority
    issue since available fresh water resources are limited. Row crop supplemental
    irrigation is rapidly expanding in the moderately humid region of west Tennessee
    because of a trend of stabilizing yields by irrigation and high commodity prices.
    However, the soils of west Tennessee exhibit high spatial and temporal variability
    of soil characteristics that relate to moisture availability for crop production
    at the field-level. It has been shown in a variety of studies that soil characteristics
    such as soil water holding capacity and depth of soil significantly affects crop
    yield, hence irrigation strategies should be adjusted in regard to the soil type
    (Duncan, 2012). Consequently, variable rate irrigation (VRI) is recommended as
    the appropriate irrigation scenario to address field-level spatiotemporal heterogeneity
    and thus how, when, and where to irrigate (Duncan, 2012). VRI is expected to improve
    water-use efficiency, increase productivity, save fuel and decrease nutrient leaching
    (Pan et al., 2013). Several authors have stressed the potential water conservation
    that has been observed using VRI systems (Evans et al., 1996, Duke et al., 1997,
    Sadler et al., 2005, Hedley and Yule, 2009). For instance, Hedley and Yule (2009)
    compared VRI and conventional uniform irrigation methods and found that 9–19%
    of irrigation water was saved, which in turn reduced nitrogen leaching. The state-of-the-art
    zone control VRI systems, allow farmers to adjust irrigation applications across
    fields, by pulsing individual sprinklers or banks of sprinklers on and off. The
    sector control VRI systems cut pie shape zones simply by adjusting the revolution
    speed of the center pivot between given pairs of angles. Pan et al. (2013) analyzed
    soil water status through spatial and temporal data and suggested this method
    as a means to assess the potential of VRI and to schedule irrigation. Recently,
    Haghverdi et al. (2015b) used integer linear programing (ILP) to find the optimum
    number and spatial arrangement of irrigation management zones for center pivot
    systems with limited sector control capability. They used soil properties to delineate
    management zones, yet suggested to investigate crop response to water amount across
    different soil types as a means to provide crop-specific irrigation management
    zones. In practice, the level of irrigation management being followed by the majority
    of producers is relatively low, while experience with successful zone control
    VRI management is rare among producers and service providers. Initially, the larger
    price tag, accompanied with the fear of complexity that is associated with using
    zone control VRI, are the two main stumbling blocks experienced by farmers. The
    sector control VRI systems require less capital investment and the operation/maintenance
    is also easier than that of zone control VRI. Most of the center pivots that farmers
    use today are equipped to allow a limited number of pie shape sectors to be made,
    without any additional control panel upgrades. The knowledge and full use of this
    capability is the perfect and most appropriate step in bridging the gap between
    current practice and cutting-edge zone control technology (Haghverdi et al., 2015b).
    Currently, it is not easy to quantify the potential production benefits of zone
    control and sector control VRI systems over conventional uniform irrigation systems
    in a given field, further contributing to producers’ present hesitancy and reluctance,
    with regards to investing in VRI systems. However, before the benefits of VRI
    can be achieved, it is necessary to identify the spatial heterogeneity of soil
    within a given field and delineate homogenous management zones wherein identical
    inputs of water can be applied. In practice, the number of zones depends on the
    target input, available equipment and the crop(s) planted. However, a corollary
    expectation is that varying the inputs within the management zones will facilitate
    optimal yields. This desire leads to the development of water production functions
    (WPF) where crop yield is mathematically related to the amount of irrigation water.
    1.2. Water production functions The term production function (PF) may be assigned
    to any mathematical relationship between crop yield and input components such
    as water, fertilizers and energy (De Juan et al., 1996). In practice, almost all
    the derived PFs require crop water use as an independent variable. PFs predict
    total dry matter (or marketable product of each crop) as a dependent variable,
    while the independent variables are transpiration, evapotranspiration (ET) or
    the amount of applied water during irrigation (IW). The PFs are categorized into
    crop water production functions (CWPFs) and water production functions (WPF) that
    use ET and IW as independent variables, respectively. IW may consist of different
    components such as the crop water requirement, pre-planting irrigation, leaching
    requirement, and rainfall (Igbadun et al., 2007). Recently, some studies have
    aimed to revisit and rebuild the concept of PF including the development of a
    WPF for water logging stress on corn (Kuang et al., 2012) and a rice water – fertilizer
    PF (Ai-hua et al., 2012). Tong and Guo (2013) included an estimation of uncertainty
    in CWPF along with the optimal allocation of water resources in an irrigation
    area. Saseendran et al. (2014) established location-specific CWPFs using long-term
    averaged data for corn in Colorado. They used the RZWQM2 model (Ahuja et al.,
    2000) and historical weather data to develop average corn CWPFs across years and
    locations. Sadler et al. (2002) applied WPFs at field level and observed significant
    differences in corn response to irrigation within and across soil map units. Holan
    et al. (2008) formulated spatially dependent WPFs that later were used by Stone
    and Sadler (2015) who reported high accuracies for the spatial modeling of corn
    yield. Wang et al. (2007) derived cotton and wheat water-salinity PFs. Dinar et
    al. (1986) derived cotton CWPF under saline conditions in California to improve
    irrigation management. Classical PFs are useful tools for irrigation management
    and economic analysis of yield reduction due to deficit irrigation, but there
    are some shortcomings associated with them. The behavior of complex ecological
    systems is non-linear, but most PFs are based on easily built linear regression-based
    equations and are thus not particularly powerful representations of these systems
    (Dai et al., 2011, Haghverdi et al., 2014b). However, recent studies have investigated
    the use of more robust and non-linear techniques to predict yield and model complex
    systems, particularly powerful empirical algorithms derived from machine learning
    data mining tools (e.g. Fortin et al., 2010, Haghverdi et al., 2014b). Data mining
    could be defined as the process of capturing important and useful information
    from large data sets (Mucherino et al., 2009). An extensive review on data mining
    methods and their application in agricultural related studies was gathered by
    Huang et al. (2010). Machine learning algorithms were employed to some extent
    for predicting yield of different crops. Fortin et al. (2010) used artificial
    neural networks (ANNs) for predicting potato tuber growth as well as its in-field
    variations in Canada. They reported that if enough data is input to an ANN model,
    one can precisely model site-specific tuber growth. Dai et al. (2011) adopted
    ANN and multi-linear regression models to simulate the response of sunflower yield
    to soil moisture and salinity. This resulted in ANN models having higher precision
    than regression for modeling relationships between crop yield and soil moisture
    and salinity at different crop growth periods (Dai et al., 2011). Haghverdi et
    al. (2014b) derived some novel WPFs and compared data mining-based methods with
    traditional regression procedures. They utilized ANN and decision tree modeling
    algorithms to derive water salinity PFs for spring wheat and found the results
    promising. 1.3. Site-specific water production functions & variable rate irrigation
    Traditional irrigation/agronomic work tries to address the irrigation related
    questions by means of small plot trials over multiple sites and across several
    years. This is probably the best way to collect the necessary data in controlled
    environments following the statistical principles behind design of experiments.
    However, there are some shortcomings. Given the time consuming and labor intensive
    nature of field experiments, this approach becomes unrealistic for the near future
    (Drummond et al., 2003). In addition, this method relies on scaling and transforming
    small plot research findings to operational management of farmers’ fields. In
    reality, each field has its own spatial and temporal heterogeneity of main attributes
    and this complexity requires site-specific irrigation management solutions. An
    alternative option is to simulate the behavior of the fields using mechanistic
    crop growth models. However, the drawback of these models is that they are time-consuming
    and expensive to develop because of the numerous inputs that need to be collected
    to run them (Drummond et al., 2003). Precision agriculture (PA) enables farmers
    to collect numerous site-specific data. Empirical analysis of these data may be
    the key to aid farmers in their occupational practice. PA is successful if accurate
    and detailed information about crop response to specific conditions is provided
    (Drummond et al., 2003). Quantifying crop response to water is the first step
    toward optimizing irrigation, and is therefore a critical issue for farmers, governmental
    agencies and consulting companies. Given the time consuming and expensive nature
    of irrigation studies, developing computer tools and models are very helpful in
    providing a comprehensive understanding of irrigation-yield relationship for different
    crops across different soil types. Robust algorithms are needed for identifying
    site-specific crop yield responses to environmental and management parameters
    and helping to find either optimum practices or alternative scenarios. The increased
    cost and complexity of variable rate irrigation (VRI) systems compared to conventional
    systems are the main obstacles barring widespread adaptation by farmers. VRI related
    research projects have mainly focused on (i) designing sprinklers to spatially
    vary irrigation rates and (ii) developing software/hardware for guiding the VRI
    system (Pan et al., 2013). There thus remains by necessity, novel models and techniques
    that simplify irrigation zone delineation, and provide an estimation of attainable
    production benefits of VRI systems, the main goal of this study. The objectives
    of this study are to: (i) Use multiple data mining techniques to design customized
    site-specific WPFs for cotton. (ii) Determine the best site-specific WPF for cotton.
    (iii) Simulate yield maps for uniform, sector control VRI, and zone control VRI
    center pivot systems using the site-specific WPFs. (iv) Formulate an optimization
    problem for sector control VRI systems using integer linear programing and water
    production functions to maximize yield. (v) Compare the spatial arrangement of
    the optimum soil-based and WPF-based irrigation management zones for sector control
    VRI center pivot systems. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Field of study A 73-ha
    cotton field that contained two center pivots for irrigation within which the
    resident farmer practiced uniform nitrogen (N) application and variable rate potassium
    and phosphorus application was selected as the study area (Fig. 1). The field
    is located in southwestern Dyer County in west Tennessee within a moderately humid
    region along the Mississippi river. The fields are Mississippi river terrace alluvial
    deposits that have produced Robinsonville loam and fine sandy loam, Commerce silty
    clay loam, and Crevasse sandy loam soils (Fig. 1). The mean monthly growing season
    precipitation and temperature is 97 mm month−1 and 21 °C from May to November,
    respectively. Soil sampling and modeling of the fields different soil constituents,
    particularly soil available water content, showed substantial spatial heterogeneity
    and as much as a four-fold increase in the variability of available soil water
    content within the effective root zone across the field (Haghverdi et al., 2015c).
    Given the spatial variability of these soil properties, this field was an ideal
    site for a study of the spatial optimization of a VRI system. Download : Download

    Dyer County, Tennessee, USA. 2.2. Irrigation experiment A two-year experiment
    (2013–2014) was implemented to study the irrigation-cotton lint yield relationship
    across the different soil types. The field was no-tillage planted to cotton (‘PHY375’
    variety) on the 30th of May, 2013, and to cotton (‘Stoneville 4946’ variety) on
    the 5th of May, 2014. Crop pest management was implemented following state extension
    recommendations. In the first year, the field was harvested on December 2–3, 2013
    and in the 2nd year it was harvested on October 18–20, 2014. There is some overlap
    between the two center pivots that cover the majority of the field (Fig. 2). Irrigation
    scheduling was carried out by the producer since the optimum practical goal was
    to enhance knowledge and expertise of the farmer over the course of the experiment.
    We provided sufficient information for the farmer to irrigate appropriately using
    a wireless network of soil sensors installed throughout the field of study, as
    well as an on-site weather station to estimate ET. Additionally, the Management
    of Irrigation Systems in Tennessee (MOIST) program (http://bioengr.ag.utk.edu/weather/)
    was employed to assist the farmer with irrigation scheduling. MOIST is an irrigation
    decision support tool that delivers irrigation recommendations that consider both
    ET and soil water status. We simulated spatial variability in water application
    across different soil types (Fig. 2) by programing the pivots and partially swapping
    the sprinklers. The pivot’s control panels were Valley Select2 module (Valmont
    Industries, Inc) that were programmable up to 9 sectors, thus allowing one to
    vary the location, frequency, and amount of irrigation across the field by changing
    the travel speed of the irrigation system. Consequently, the sprinklers were swapped
    to apply approximately 50% more/less irrigation water (IW) than the farmer’s decision.
    The IW on sector zones was between 25% and 30% higher/lower than the IW that was
    set by the farmer. Download : Download high-res image (338KB) Download : Download

    the study area (b). This figure is adapted from Haghverdi et al. (2015c). 2.3.
    Input attributes and data preparation Table 1 summarizes the data used in this
    study to derive the WPFs. The field was sampled on March 21 and 22, 2014 where
    400 undisturbed core soil samples from 100 sampling locations at 4 different depths
    were collected to measure soil texture, soil water content, and bulk density.
    Then, the soil water retention curves were predicted for samples using pseudo-continuous
    pedotransfer functions (Haghverdi et al., 2014a) and interpolated to generate
    high-resolution maps. In addition, soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
    was collected using a Veris 3100 (Veris Technologies, Salina, KS) instrument.
    More information on proximal soil data collection/sensing and modeling is provided
    by Haghverdi et al. (2015c). The cotton lint yield maps were obtained from the
    yield monitors. A quality assessment of the raw cotton lint yield data was conducted
    to remove outliers and bad data. The study field was gridded into 5-m × 5-m cells
    or pixels (25 m2 area per cell) and for each cell, all attributes in Table 1 (inputs
    and outputs) were obtained. Ordinary kriging was used for interpolation. Empirical
    semivariograms were calculated using the Geostatistical Analyst toolbox in ArcGIS
    10.2.2 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, California) considering 12 lags and an omnidirectional
    stable model. A total of 16,000 cells were prepared after removing cells with
    missing/bad data. Since neither pivot was shut off in the overlap zone, the water
    applied in that zone was considered to be the summation of the applied water by
    the both pivots. Table 1. Input/output attributes for deriving site-specific water

    for four layers (i.e. 0–25 cm, 25–50 cm, 50–75 cm, 75–100 cm) covering crop effective
    root zone. c The farmer practiced variable rate P and K, but nitrogen was applied
    uniformly. In many situations, there are only a few major driving forces that
    govern a system. As the number of input predictors increases, the likelihood of
    redundancy or high correlation between variables increases with more than one
    attribute capable of explaining the behavior of the system. Principal component
    analysis (PCA) is a statistical method that is used to reduce the dimensionality
    or the number of high correlations in a given data set. PCA finds hidden patterns
    within a data set and extracts the important information from the raw data and
    replaces it with a group of new input predictors called principle components.
    Principal components are orthogonal to each other and each of them is a linear
    combination of the original input attributes. (Mathworks, 2014, Abdi and Williams,
    2010). In this study, we used Matlab 2015a (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Mass.) to
    perform PCA. The Hotelling’s T2, a statistical measure of the multivariate distance
    of each observation from the center of the data set, was calculated to find the
    most important PCs. Prior to establishing WPFs, the data set was randomly divided
    into 10 almost equal-size subsets. The modeling was repeated 10 times where each
    time one subset was assigned to the test phase and the rest of them were used
    to develop the WPFs. 2.4. Modeling and simulation 2.4.1. Establishing site-specific
    water production functions Multiple linear regression water production function,
    MLR WPF Fig. 3 illustrates the three methods that were developed to establish
    site-specific WPFs. Traditionally linear regression is used to derive WPFs that
    typically result in a curvilinear representation of water-yield relationship.
    We followed the recommendations of Haghverdi et al. (2015b) and used k-means cluster
    analysis to divide the data into 4 homogenous soil property sub-groups. Then,
    for each sub-group, a separate MLR-WPF was developed considering IW, IW2 and IW
    × PCs as input predictors. The ten most important PCs were used as input for clustering.

    Fig. 3. The three workflow processes used in this study to develop customized
    site-specific water production functions (WPF) to predict cotton yields for 2
    center pivots in a 73 ha field in west Tennessee; k-NN: k nearest neighbors, PCA:
    principle component analysis, ANN: artificial neural networks. K nearest neighbors
    water production function, k-NN WPF The k-NN is a non-parametric lazy learning
    algorithm that processes all of the data when prediction of the response(s) for
    a new observation is required. The k-NN was considered to be among the top ten
    techniques used for data mining (Wu et al., 2008), but in general has been applied
    less than other data mining techniques in agricultural studies (Mucherino et al.,
    2009). The k-NN considers a distance function, such as the Euclidean distance,
    to find so-called closer observations with higher similarity. Then, it combines
    the response of the k nearest surrounding observations to predict the response
    for new observations. Fig. 3 provides a visual step-by-step guide to deriving
    the site-specific k-NN WPFs, where first the raw inputs (Table 1) were converted
    to PCs. Then, the first 10 PCs and the IW were converted to input predictors with
    a zero mean and a standard deviation of one, and then the ranges of input predictors
    were tuned following the method recommended by Nemes et al. (2006). In order to
    predict yield for a target cell of the test data set at a specific irrigation
    level (I∗), the following steps were taken. First, distance from the target cell
    to every cell in the development data set was computed as the summation of the
    differences among their input predictors: (1) where di is the distance between
    ith cell in the development data set and the target cell, Δaij is the difference
    between jth attribute of the two cells and N = 11 is the number of the input attributes.
    Second, a reference data set was created consisting of those cells in the development
    data set that had irrigation levels within a 20-mm range from the target irrigation
    level (i.e. I∗). Third, the k nearest cells to the target cell were selected from
    the reference data set. Fourth, a distance-dependent weight was assigned to each
    k nearest cell (Nemes et al., 2006): (2) where k is the number of selected nearest
    cells, p is the design parameter and wi is the weight of ith cell. Finally, the
    cotton yield for the target cell (Yp) was predicted as the weighted average of
    the yield values for the k nearest cells: (3) A cross-validation procedure was
    designed to identify the optimum k and p values. The parameter k was varied from
    1 to 10 and p was changed from 0.5 to 3 with 0.5 increments. For each combination
    of k and p parameters, a bagging technique was implemented to compute the output
    of the k-NN-WPF (Breiman, 1996). In other words, the output was the aggregation
    of the output of multiple WPFs which were established on different realizations
    of the reference dataset using sampling with replacement. Haghverdi et al. (2015a)
    recommended that the number of ensemble values be 40. The modeling was done using
    Matlab R2014a (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Mass.). Artificial neural network water
    production function, ANN WPF The past performance of artificial neural networks
    (ANNs) suggests that they have potential to establish reasonable WPFs (Haghverdi
    et al., 2014b). A three-layer perceptron model was selected for this study. SPSS
    Modeler 15 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) automatically computed the best number of
    neurons to be used in the hidden layer to derive ANN WPFs. The first 10 PCs and
    IW were chosen as input predictors. The bagging technique was implemented to enhance
    model stability. The number of ensembles was chosen to be 40. Thirty percent of
    the training data were assigned to cross-validation to avoid over-fitting. 2.4.2.
    Simulating irrigation and zoning strategies The WPF with highest performance was
    selected to simulate irrigation and zoning strategies. Note that both modeling
    and simulation phases were done separately for 2013 and 2014 data. The seasonal
    irrigation level was changed from 0 to 150 mm with 10-mm increments. The optimum
    cotton lint yield maps were delineated for the three irrigation strategies including
    (i) uniform irrigation, (ii) VRI with limited sector control capability and (iii)
    a hypothetical situation in which each cell (5 × 5 m2) to be irrigated individually
    at optimum level. We adopted and modified the integer linear programing (ILP)
    optimization process developed by Haghverdi et al. (2015b) to find the optimum
    arrangement of management zones to maximize cotton lint yield for VRI systems
    with limited sector control capability. Each center pivot irrigation system was
    considered to consist of 360 sectors each 1 deg wide. A total of 12,241 possible
    zones were obtained by all combinations of 1 deg sectors into sectors from 1 to
    360 deg long (Table 2). Then, the optimum irrigation level to maximize cotton
    lint yield was predicted for each zone by means of k-NN WPF separately for each
    cropping season. The optimization process was formulated as follows: (4) subject
    to (5) (6) (7) where xi is the decision variable for zone i, y is the optimum
    yield per unit area predicted by k-NN WPF within zone i, n is the total number
    of the zones, l is the length of each zone in degrees, cij is a coefficient equal
    to 1 if angle j is covered by zone i otherwise equal to 0, Pmax is the maximum
    number of desired zones. Table 2. All of the sector zones that could be delineated
    underneath a center pivot systems. This Table is adapted from Haghverdi et al.

    359–1 … 359–359 a X–Y: start angle-end angle. The objective function (4) maximizes
    cotton lint yields across the zones. Restriction (5) guarantees that each degree
    is covered only by one zone and the optimum zoning scheme covers the entire area
    underneath the center pivots. Constraint (6) keeps the total number of the zones
    less than the maximum user-defined number. Constraint (7) ensures that the length
    of the sectors is greater than the minimum user-defined (i.e. 5 degree in this
    study). If a sector was selected, the decision variable of the model, xi, was
    equal to 1 otherwise 0. 2.5. Evaluation procedure The performance of the WPFs
    was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean bias error (MBE)
    and the correlation coefficient (r): (8) (9) (10) where Ei, and Mi are the estimated
    and the measured cotton lint yield (Mg ha−1), respectively; n is the number of
    actual cells in test/validation set; Em and Mm are the mean of estimated and the
    mean of actual cotton lint yield (Mg ha−1), respectively. 3. Results 3.1. Principal
    component analysis PCA was performed to combine and summarize the variability
    in the input attributes in Table 1 (Fig. 4). A cumulative Hotelling’s T2 was plotted
    against the number of PCs where about 96% of the inputs were explained by considering
    10 PCs, but adding more PCs did not improve nor explain most of the variability.
    Our goal was to explain at least 95% of the variability in our data set using
    selected PCs. Consequently, we used only the first 10 PCs in our WPFs. However,
    to provide an overall insight regarding performance of the PCA approach in this
    study, we only discussed the coefficient of the first two PCs in detail. Download

    by soil structure had the highest influence on PC1. On PC2, percent of clay and
    water content at FC and PWP of the shallow soil played the major role. ECa, irrigation
    and fertilizer produced medium coefficients for both PCs. The PC1 map to a great
    extent showed the expected pattern of soil physical and hydraulic properties across
    field (Fig. 4b). The PC1 negative values corresponds to soils with lower water
    holding capacity and available water content which were formed by three regions
    at the mid-east, mid-south and north west of the field. The PC1 is plotted against
    PC2 when ECa data were used to color code the points (Fig. 4, panel d). There
    was a clear distinction between (i) points with lower ECa (corresponding to coarse
    soil with lower available water content) which were skewed and clustered towards
    upper left corner of the figure and (ii) points with higher ECa (corresponding
    to fine-textured soil with higher water holding capacity) which were skewed towards
    upper right corner of the plot. The transition section at the middle of the plot
    represented soil with medium ECa, corresponding to moderate available water content.
    3.2. Performance of WPFs Fig. 5 presents the performance of k-NN WPFs (i.e. the
    average RMSE as well as the standard deviation of RMSE values among 10 subsets
    of data used for model evaluation) for a range of design parameters, i.e. p and
    k. The trend was identical for both cropping seasons; the error started to decline
    as number of nearest neighbors increased, reached a minimum at k = 5, and started
    to increase again. There was almost no difference in performance of WPFs with
    different p values and k less than 4, but the WPFs with lower p values exhibited
    a higher increase in RMSE for k greater than 4. In general, the standard deviation
    of RMSE values among 10 subsets consistently decreased with increasing k from
    1 to 10 regardless of p values. The optimum parameters for k and p were equal
    to 4 and 1.5, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (309KB) Download

    among 10 test subsets, right side panels: standard deviation of RMSE values among
    10 test subsets. Table 3 summarizes the performance evaluation statistics for
    the WPFs. Fig. 6 illustrates the estimated versus measured lint yield for both
    cropping seasons using all three WPFs. The k-NN exhibited the highest performance
    and accuracy for both 2013 and 2014 with RMSE equal to 0.131 Mg ha−1 and 0.194
    Mg ha−1, respectively, which was in agreement with well scattered cloud of points
    around 1:1 line (Fig. 6). The ANN (MLR) exhibited 60% (73%) and 52% (65%) increase
    in RMSE compared to the corresponding k-NN WPFs in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons,
    respectively. The ANN WPFs had a better performance (i.e. lower RMSE values and
    higher r) than MLR WPFs for both cropping seasons. The low MBE errors showed there
    was no systematic under/over estimation for any of the WPFs. However, both ANN
    and MLR exhibited partial over-estimation tendency for plots with yield smaller
    than 0.40 Mg ha−1 and 0.60 Mg ha−1 in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons, respectively.
    All WPFs showed a slightly better performance in 2014 in comparison with 2013
    considering the correlation coefficient and normal RMSE (i.e. RMSE divided by
    range of yield variation) as the criteria. For instance, ANN WPF had normal RMSE
    equal to 14% and 13% and r equal to 0.65 and 0.78 for 2013 and 2014 lint yield
    data, respectively. Table 3. The performance results (r = correlation coefficient,

    (WPF) and predict cotton lint yields. 3.3. Irrigation and zoning scenarios Fig.
    7 (panels a and b) shows the cotton lint yield predicted by k-NN WPF for different
    irrigation scenarios (i.e. uniform irrigation and irrigating each cell individually
    at optimum level) over the 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons. Yield was lower in
    2013 than in 2014 for all irrigation levels. The predicted yield was slightly
    different between pivots, yet followed the same general trend across irrigation
    levels. We attribute this to differences in soil spatial distribution underneath
    the pivots. Given uniform irrigation scenarios, in 2013 the highest predicted
    yield was (for 110 mm seasonal IW) 1.09 ± 0.06 Mg ha−1 and 0.98 ± 0.06 Mg ha−1
    for the east and west pivots, respectively. In 2013 as IW increased, there was
    a small overall increase in yield up to the maximum level (i.e. IW = 110 mm) but
    it declined after that for higher IW amounts. If each cell was irrigated at optimum
    level, yield was improved to 1.19 ± 0.05 Mg ha−1 and 1.11 ± 0.06 Mg ha−1 underneath
    east and west pivots, respectively. In 2014, there were two peaks at 20 and 120
    mm IWs. There was a sharp increase in predicted yield for small irrigation amount
    compared to rainfed situation in 2014, then it decreased and leveled off for most
    of the intermediate irrigation levels and increased again at IW = 120 mm yet continuously
    decreased after that. The highest predicted yields (IW = 20 mm) were 1.52 ± 0.12
    Mg ha−1 and 1.62 ± 0.12 Mg ha−1, underneath the east and west pivots, respectively.
    When yield in each cell was optimized with a distinct level of IW, the predicted
    yield increased to 1.71 ± 0.10 Mg ha−1 and 1.80 ± 0.09 Mg ha−1 underneath the
    east and west pivots, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (422KB)

    respectively. Bars are associated with right-side y axis and represent average
    irrigation applied by each pivot. Fig. 7 (panels c and d) depicts the average
    irrigation and yield for optimum arrangement of the sectors. Yield was always
    higher in 2014 than in 2013. In both years there was a constant increase in yield
    by adding to the number of sectors, yet the highest boost occurred when pivot
    area was divided into two sectors. The yield was higher under the east pivot than
    under west pivot in 2013, but the opposite was true in 2014. In 2013, as number
    of zones increased, there was a slight reduction in optimum level of IW underneath
    the west pivot, but it remained almost constant across a different number of zones
    for the east pivot. In 2014, as the number of zones increased, higher IW was predicted
    to get the optimum yield underneath west pivot and same was true under the east
    pivot but less pronounced. Compared to rainfed agriculture, for the east pivot,
    the best uniform supplemental irrigation strategy was predicted to boost the yield
    up to 41% and 47% in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons, respectively. Sector control
    VRI added about 4% to the expected yield in both years. For the west pivot, compared
    to rainfed, the best uniform supplemental irrigation scenario improved the yield
    as much as 25% and 40% in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons, respectively. The sector
    control VRI added 4% in 2013 and 7% in 2014 to the expected yield boost. Fig.
    8 illustrates the thematic yield maps predicted by k-NN WPFs for the rainfed condition
    along with multiple irrigation strategies (i.e. best uniform irrigation, cutting
    4 sectors, and irrigating each cell individually at optimum level) for the both
    pivots and cropping seasons. Haghverdi et al. (2015b) suggested four sectors as
    optimum to minimize soil spatial variation underneath the pivots. To compare the
    zoning results across the studies, we selected 4 sectors here too. By visual assessment
    of the yield maps, the biggest change occurred from rainfed to uniform irrigation
    followed by the change from sector control VRI to irrigating each cell individually.
    In 2014, the spatial yield pattern for the rainfed scenario is similar to soil
    texture maps and high resolution soil available water maps for the field of study
    illustrated and modeled by Haghverdi et al. (2015c). They showed that coarse-textured
    regions with low available water content were located in the middle, eastern and
    southwestern parts of the eastern pivot as well as in northern and northwestern
    of the western pivot. In 2013, however, it is hard to match the yield pattern
    for the rainfed scenario against soil spatial distribution, yet yield patterns
    under uniform irrigation were somewhat similar to spatial pattern of soil physical
    and hydraulic properties within the effective root zone. For both pivots and cropping
    seasons, yield predicted under sector control VRI scenario exhibited lower minimum
    but higher maximum than that for the corresponding uniform irrigation maps. Moving
    from sector control VRI into the hypothetical scenario of irrigating each 25 m2
    cell individually, yield improvement mostly occurred for cells with low expected
    yield. In other words, the maximum predicted yield remained almost unchanged but
    minimum predicted yield was substantially improved. Download : Download high-res

    13-W-R for example is 13 for the 2013 cropping season, W for the west center pivot,

    pivot as uniform irrigation (U), sector control pie shape VRI (P), and individual
    cell (M). Fig. 9 shows the spatial arrangement of the optimum sectors from this
    study and the previous study by Haghverdi et al. (2015b). In this study, k-NN
    WPF along with ILP optimization were used to find optimum zones when the objective
    was to maximize cotton lint yield. Haghverdi et al. (2015b) found the best spatial
    arrangement of sector zones using ILP optimization and soil related attributes
    without considering the irrigation-yield relationships. They used soil available
    water content, soil ECa, yield data and Landsat 8 panchromatic satellite data
    when the objective was to minimize soil spatial variation within each zone. The
    spatial arrangement of optimum pie shape sectors to maximize lint yield changed
    from 2013 to 2014 for the both pivots. The 2013 zones for the east pivot were
    somewhat similar to zones by AWC and ECa data from Haghverdi et al. (2015b) study.
    In 2014 for the east pivot, three sectors were located on the coarse-textured
    region with low soil available water content, while a big sector covered rest
    of the pivot. There were some similarities between 2014 zones for the west pivot
    and zoning by ECa and AWC data from Haghverdi et al. (2015b) study. In 2013, sectors
    in northern part of the west pivot were somewhat similar to sectors from AWC data
    from Haghverdi et al. (2015b) study. The spatial arrangement of optimum zones
    using yield data (by Haghverdi et al., 2015b) was different than the configuration
    of zones in our study. Download : Download high-res image (613KB) Download : Download

    production functions The k-NN performed better than MLR and ANN in predicting
    cotton yield. It seems even dividing the field into more homogenous regions did
    not reduce the complexity enough to get the same level of accuracy by MLR WPFs
    as achieved by k-NN WPF. The ANN WPF showed a better performance than MLR, although
    we used the entire data set to train the ANN models. This is in line with the
    results reported by Haghverdi et al., 2014b, Drummond et al., 2003 who found ANN
    a better option than MLR models to predict yield. However, ANN in our study was
    not able to provide the same level of performance as k-NN WPF, meaning ANN could
    not entirely handle the huge amount of data and complex relationships between
    input and outputs. The efficiency of k-NN in our study is in line with the promising
    results reported in the literature: to model soil hydraulic properties (e.g. Nemes
    et al., 2006, Haghverdi et al., 2015a), to estimate cultivar coefficient of crop
    models (Bannayan and Hoogenboom, 2009) and for prediction of daily weather data
    (Bannayan and Hoogenboom, 2008). In general, linear techniques are not suitable
    to model the spatial variability of crop yields (Sudduth et al., 1996), yet the
    k-NN WPF designed in our study performed satisfactory because it acts as a smart
    search engine to selects only a few similar data points for prediction. This approach
    helps k-NN WPF to take advantage of numerous data points (cells) provided by the
    yield monitoring systems without necessarily having a good approximation of the
    non-linear relationships between inputs and yield for all cells across the field
    of study. The k-NN WPF makes use of similarities to distinguish patterns instead
    of fitting coefficients and this approach could be favorable whenever the form
    of relationships between input and output of a system is not known in advance
    (Nemes et al., 2006). One should note that, k-NN WPF introduced in this study
    only provides a pseudo-continuous prediction of yield over a range of applied
    irrigation. In other words, it gives trustable results only in the neighborhood
    of measured IWs. Hence, its application for continuous prediction of yield-water
    relationship is only suggested if IW is applied at multiple levels such that the
    available data sufficiently cover the desired prediction range. We had substantial
    spatial variation of soil properties in the study field. Long-term analysis of
    yield maps for different crops revealed that the spatial variability of soil attributes
    can seriously impact crop yields (Haghverdi, 2015). Guo et al. (2012) tried to
    mathematically explain the spatial and temporal variation of cotton yield on the
    Southern High Plains of Texas by means of ECa, soil brightness, and topography
    data. They observed that these attributes together could explain up to 70.1% of
    the variability in cotton yield. Guo et al. (2012) mentioned soil texture as one
    of the greatest factor affecting cotton yield. They found a relatively stable
    spatial pattern of yield over time although yield and soil properties had stronger
    relationship in dry years than wet seasons. The results of this study showed a
    considerable impact of the spatial and temporal pattern of rainfall pattern on
    the spatial distribution of cotton yield. We realized that rainfall pattern can
    mask/change the effect of supplemental irrigation practices on yield. Receiving
    high amounts of rainfall with random temporal patterns over growing seasons is
    expected in western TN. There were 712 mm and 633 mm of rainfall over the 2013
    and 2014 growing seasons, respectively. The total seasonally applied irrigation
    water by the farmer for the east and west pivots was 133-mm and 93 mm in 2013
    and 65 mm and 50 mm in 2014, respectively. This meant that irrigation was less
    than 20% of precipitation in 2013 and less than 10% of precipitation in 2014.
    Wong and Asseng (2006) introduced interactions of seasonal rainfall, plant available
    soil water storage capacity, and N fertilizer applications as dominant factors
    causing spatiotemporal wheat yield variation. In 2013, wet soil and colder temperatures
    forced the farmer to postpone planting cotton. Furthermore, heavy rainfall throughout
    the growing season caused excessive vegetative growth and larger number of bolls
    on soils with higher available water content. We believe that planting delay caused
    an inability in cotton to accumulate adequate heat-units and delayed its maturity
    leading to a reduction in yield, especially over soils with higher water holding
    capacity, where there was not enough time for all of the bolls to open by harvesting
    time. This trend affected the yield response to irrigation which in turn caused
    slightly higher error in corresponding WPFs. Bajwa and Vories (2007) demonstrated
    that excessive irrigation in wet weather conditions decreased cotton lint yield
    in Arkansas. That is why the quantity of optimum ET required to maximize cotton
    lint yield is directly proportional to length of cropping seasons; in longer seasons,
    higher irrigation is expected to produce the highest cotton lint yield (Orgaz
    et al., 1992). The performance of site-specific WPFs may differ under different
    conditions, hence they should be tested for different crops, climatic conditions
    and the spatial variation of soils. All attributes affecting crop available water
    need to be considered for deriving site-specific WPFs. For instance, there are
    some studies reporting the positive correlation of yield with topographic attributes
    (e.g. Andales et al., 2007, Green et al., 2007). The field of study was fairly
    flat, thus we assume that coarse resolution topography and slope have negligible
    influence on cotton lint yield. However, if topography and slope impact the spatial
    distribution of water within a field they should be considered in the development
    of site-specific WPFs. 4.2. Zoning and irrigation strategies The majority of the
    farmers in west Tennessee practice uniform irrigation despite spatial variability
    in soil properties that exists in their fields. Site-specific WPFs can help them
    to move towards optimum uniform irrigation strategies for different crops and
    climatic condition. Rainfall was abundant over the course of this experiment,
    but some dry periods did occur and supplemental irrigation was crucial to fulfilling
    ET demand, especially for coarse soils with lower AWC. Thus, there was a positive
    cotton lint yield response to irrigation predicted by the use of k-NN WPFs under
    both center pivots when compared to rainfed yields. In 2013, delayed planting
    affected heat unit accumulation/distribution and maturity which in turn suppressed
    the yield across the field, while yield reduction in soils with higher available
    water was more pronounced. This was shown in WPFs prediction as a general slight
    increase in yield as IW increased. Adding more water reduced the drought stress
    for soils with lower AWC but increased overall yield until a peak point. Analysis
    of yield data showed that even for coarse-textured soils with low WHC, cotton
    yield reduction occurred due to over irrigation. That is why, a yield reduction
    was predicted by k-NN-WPF for IWs of more than 120 mm. In 2014, the overall yield-irrigation
    relationship across the field was somewhat different than that for 2013, yet closer
    to what we expected to see in most of the years. As in 2013, there was a peak
    at a high irrigation level (IW = 110 mm) which is attributed to the optimum level
    of IW for soil with lower AWC. Unlike 2013, however, in 2014 there was also a
    second peak for lower IWs which turned out to be the best uniform cotton irrigation
    strategy according to k-NN WPF predictions. This was recognized as the point of
    optimum IW level for soils with higher AWC suggesting that in a more typical year
    like 2014 (a year without delayed planting), lower irrigation for fine-textured
    soils produced higher yields that compensated for the yield reduction over water-stressed
    coarse-textured soils in different regions of the field. More years of data are
    needed to confirm this as a long-term trend. Given the spatial variability of
    soil attributes in the field, west Tennessee farmers are likely to depart from
    uniform irrigation scenarios to some type of VRI. Sector control VRI is an easier
    and less expensive irrigation strategy for those who possess center pivot irrigation
    systems. As previously stated, zone delineation for irrigation management is complex.
    Site-specific WPFs could be beneficial to support such conversion from uniform
    to sector control VRI systems, because they are useful for delineating crop-specific
    irrigation zones and for identifying the optimum irrigation strategy for each
    sector. A field is likely to have sectors with variation in soil attributes where
    real time irrigation scheduling becomes challenging. The site-specific WPFs would
    provide insights into the right soil to follow within each section to maximize
    yield. Haghverdi et al. (2015b) focused on soil properties to delineate irrigation
    management zones. We added crop yields to the optimization process by using site-specific
    WPFs. While there were some similarities between zones in this study and zones
    developed by Haghverdi et al. (2015b), the differences were more substantial both
    between years and methods. To a great extent, this difference reflected the inherent
    spatiotemporal variation associated with crop growth and yield which in turn governed
    the spatial configuration of optimum crop-based zones. According to Basso et al.
    (2009), bias in the evaluation of homogenous management zones may occur due to
    the impact of weather patterns on both crop growth and the interactions with soil
    types. We showed that the year-to-year temporal variation in rainfall patterns
    influences cotton yield-irrigation-soil relationships in west Tennessee. Farmer
    irrigation management techniques also influence the crop-based zoning result,
    because for each cropping season, the k-NN WPF only combines the available observations
    to make a new predication in that year. Therefore, it is important to look at
    the zoning system in this study as an iterative process which helps farmers to
    improve their irrigation decisions. The more a farmer improves their irrigation
    management, the better k-NN WPF predictions reflect a field’s yield potential.
    Consequently, longer experimentation is needed to see how our crop-based zoning
    strategy works across years and how different it would be from the soil-based
    zoning strategies introduced by Haghverdi et al. (2015b). Based on the k-NN WPF
    predictions, irrigating each cell individually at optimum levels would have caused
    a moderate increase in yield in 2014 and a slight increase in 2013 compared to
    the best uniform irrigation strategy. In reality, this provided a cap for the
    potential yield boost expected from a site-specific VRI. Even in 2014, the expected
    boost in yield may not be high enough to compensate for the infrastructure and
    management expenses needed to convert to a VRI system. Obviously, the benefits
    of sector control and zone control VRIs is both site and crop specific and depends
    on a variety of factors including the magnitude of soil spatial heterogeneity
    throughout the field, weather conditions, and the efficiency of real time irrigation
    scheduling (Daccache et al., 2015). 5. Conclusion Design-based statistics were
    dominant for much of the last century when contemporary constraints on data collection
    and processing prevented on-farm experimentation (Pringle et al., 2010). Nowadays,
    however, most of the farmers in US are collecting numerous site-specific data
    useful for on-site experimentation. However, the available data often have different
    spatial and temporal resolutions. Moreover, the observations may be spatially
    and temporally autocorrelated while also carrying inherent error and uncertainties.
    Therefore, in order to convert these data to useful information, robust algorithms
    and models are needed. We designed and evaluated site-specific WPFs. The results
    confirmed that site-specific WPFs may be powerful after-the-fact tools that are
    used by farmers to enhance future site-specific irrigation management. We used
    site-specific WPFs to evaluate different irrigation and zoning strategies. Currently,
    implementation and management of VRI systems demands high capital costs (Evans
    et al., 2013), hence it is crucial to assess the potential yield gain of zone
    control VRI over uniform and sector control VRI scenarios for each crop and a
    specific site. Our results showed that crop-based zoning using WPFs produces different
    zones based on the annual climatic conditions and farmer management practices.
    We believe a long-term data record is required that will capture different climatic
    and irrigation management scenarios that lead to stable zones. A practical option
    is to start with soil-based zoning for sector control VRI systems as proposed
    by Haghverdi et al. (2015b) and then use site-specific k-NN-WPF to improve both
    zoning and within zone irrigation decisions in an iterative process. For the study
    site and over the course of the experiment, the expected yield improvement by
    a zone control VRI system was not substantially higher than that of sector control
    VRI. Note that results will probably differ under drier conditions when greater
    yields are likely to occur under a zone control VRI compared to a sector control
    VRI. Consider that there are fundamental differences in characteristics and applications
    of the traditional CWPF/WPF and proposed site-specific WPFs in this study. Classical
    PFs are mostly derived from multiyear experiments that use research plots at different
    locations. The main goal of classical PFs is to eventually apply the established
    functions for similar places and/or for the same place in the future. Contrary
    to these studies, the site-specific WPFs that we propose are not designed to be
    used in other fields or even on the same field in different years. These WPFs
    may provide insight, but are not ready for real-time VRI scheduling and addressing
    related concerns such as runoff and deep percolation issues. The site-specific
    WPFs developed here are after-the-fact tools to simulate different irrigation
    scenarios for a given-field over a specific cropping season. They are tools to
    help farmers to monitor their irrigation management and provide a unique opportunity
    that has only become possible due to recent advances and the spread of precision
    farming equipment such as yield monitors and VRI systems. Acknowledgments This

    Highlights Irrigation is key to the productivity of Great Plains agriculture but
    is threatened by water scarcity. The irrigated area grew to >9 million ha since
    1870, mostly since 1950, but is likely to decline. Changes in climate, water availability,
    irrigated area, and policy will affect productivity. Adaptation and innovation,
    hallmarks of Great Plains populations, will ensure future success. Abstract. Motivated
    by the need for sustainable water management and technology for next-generation
    crop production, the future of irrigation on the U.S. Great Plains was examined
    through the lenses of past changes in water supply, historical changes in irrigated
    area, and innovations in irrigation technology, management, and agronomy. We analyzed
    the history of irrigated agriculture through the 1900s to the present day. We
    focused particularly on the efficiency and water productivity of irrigation systems
    (application efficiency, crop water productivity, and irrigation water use productivity)
    as a connection between water resource management and agricultural production.
    Technology innovations have greatly increased the efficiency of water application,
    the productivity of water use, and the agricultural productivity of the Great
    Plains. We also examined the changes in water stored in the High Plains aquifer,
    which is the region‘s principle supply for irrigation water. Relative to other
    states, the aquifer has been less impacted in Nebraska, despite large increases
    in irrigated area. Greatly increased irrigation efficiency has played a role in
    this, but so have regulations and the recharge to the aquifer from the Nebraska
    Sand Hills and from rivers crossing the state. The outlook for irrigation is less
    positive in western Kansas, eastern Colorado, and the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles.
    The aquifer in these regions is recharged at rates much less than current pumping,
    and the aquifer is declining as a result. Improvements in irrigation technology
    and management plus changes in crops grown have made irrigation ever more efficient
    and allowed irrigation to continue. There is good reason to expect that future
    research and development efforts by federal and state researchers, extension specialists,
    and industry, often in concert, will continue to improve the efficiency and productivity
    of irrigated agriculture. Public policy changes will also play a role in regulating
    consumption and motivating on-farm efficiency improvements. Water supplies, while
    finite, will be stretched much further than projected by some who look only at
    past rates of consumption. Thus, irrigation will continue to be important economically
    for an extended period. Sustaining irrigation is crucial to sustained productivity
    of the Great Plains “bread basket” because on average irrigation doubles the efficiency
    with which water is turned into crop yields compared with what can be attained
    in this region with precipitation alone. Lessons learned from the Great Plains
    are relevant to irrigation in semi-arid and subhumid areas worldwide. (Download

    Irrigation, particularly pivot-center, is widely used around the world to fill
    the need of crop watering. This method of irrigation has a low efficiency compared
    to other methods of irrigation such as drip systems and generally they use water
    without consider the real need of plants. In this paper we propose an automation
    system based on the Internet of Things (IoT), Geographic Information System (GIS)
    and quasi real-time in the cloud of water requirements to improve the efficiency
    of water use. Indeed, each segment of the pivot-center moves at a different speed
    compared to others; thus, must be individually controlled to optimize the yield
    of irrigation. Moreover, it necessary to integrate factors such as stage of crops''
    development, heterogeneity of soil, runoff, drainage, soil components, nutrients
    and moisture content. In this paper we develop a complete system integrating sensors,
    GIS, Internet of Things and cloud computing. This approach allows to automate
    fine-grained the consumption of water without decreasing the yield. In addition
    to that, the collect of data and the soil moisture measurement will allow to adapt
    coefficient of evapotranspiration to local weather without having to resort to
    lysimetric measures. The proposed architecture allows to store and treat real-time,
    time series data and low-priority data such as 3D images used in digital phenotyping
    field which are treated with batch processing. Published in: 2018 International

    Morocco SECTION I. Introduction The demand of food production and fiber increase
    with de world population. The irrigation management is important particularly
    in context where the fresh water resources are limited. The aim of the irrigation
    is to give to plants the adequate amount of water to ensure their water requirements.
    The use of Water Production Function (WPF) allows to estimate the production in
    terms of dry matter or marketable yield, evapotranspiration ore the amount of
    applied water during irrigation (IW). According to the different production functions
    of IW may also include different components in addition to Crop Water Requirement
    (CWR), such as pre-planting irrigation to prepare the seeding, leaching requirement
    to decrease the salinity, rise of water table by capillarity and rainfall. The
    estimation of water requirement is a stone corner which you can calculate the
    correct irrigation doses. Indeed, the water available for the crop is an indicator
    of the texture of soil, precipitations, previous irrigations, state of development
    of crop and the amount of water already present in the soil. Center-Pivot of irrigation
    are usually reserved to irrigate large areas from 3.5 to 65 ha because of the
    costs; but, the nutrients, fertilizer, herbicide, insecticide and pesticide can
    be directly applied on the canopy of crop [1]. Center-Pivot irrigation systems
    require up to 40% less water application than traditional and conventional gravity
    (furrow) or surface irrigation methods, where a part of water is lost by percolation
    or runoff. But Center-pivot irrigation stays less effective than the drip systems
    that are the most economical in term of water. The main challenge is related to
    the exact estimation of both the evapotranspiration of the crop and how to bring
    the water (frequency and quantity). Traditional hand-feel soil measurement methods
    do not provide quantitative soil water and real-time data. The use of sensors
    in precision agriculture is becoming widespread, especially in irrigation and
    open the field of irrigation management in order to establish an optimal timing
    and amount of irrigation water for greatest effectiveness. Indeed, an optimal
    irrigation management avoid water deficiency and use too much water that reduces
    the potential for profitability of the crop. The supply of an optimal amount of
    water allows also to maximize the yield response to other management practices,
    optimize yield per unit of water applied, reduce the potential runoff, reduce
    soil erosion and pesticide movement into the surface and ground water [1]. To
    optimize the yield and soil water in the crop, plants should not pass the wilting
    point. This means the minimum soil moisture required by a plant not to wilt. At
    this point, any decrease in soil moisture will result in wilting. When a plant
    wilts, its leaves dry out, droop, and wither. The coupling of the irrigation system
    with a soil moisture monitoring and an accurate evapotranspiration calculation
    has a significant advantage in term of water consumption. Precision agriculture
    (PA) uses the Internet of Things and allows real-time control measure and automation
    of pivot-center irrigation systems. Furthermore, Wireless Sensors Network (WSN)
    is affordable and the wide availability of Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) protocol
    such as LoRa, SigFox and Ingenu coupling with cloud IoT platforms pave the way
    of high precision and realtime irrigation management systems. In this paper, we
    combine agronomic and computer science expertise to propose a cloud IoT architecture
    and a network of sensors using LPWA to control, monitor and optimize the crop
    production at quasi real-time. The low-cost sensor network measure on one hand
    the weather data required to calculate potential evapotranspiration of the crop,
    and on other hand the soil moisture at different depths. The proposed architecture
    calculates water requirements of plants and actuate solenoids to open and close
    water individually each sprinkler. SECTION II. Literature Review The main challenges
    in the elaboration of an automated irrigation system for irrigation pivot-center
    are vital; on one hand to choose an adapted evaluation method of water requirements,
    and on other hand to identify a correct cloud IoT platform essential for data
    storage and treatment. The following paragraph focuses on these aspects and on
    reviewing existing works. A. Related Works Classical Water Production Functions
    (WPF) are useful tools for irrigation management and economic analysis of yield
    reduction due to deficit irrigation which is usually based on linear regression
    and don''t give a representation of nonlinear behaviors of complex ecological
    systems. To fix this issue recent research are investigated. We list the use of
    more robust and nonlinear techniques such as machine learning, Artificial Neural
    Network (ANN) and data-mining tools (e.g. Fortin et al in 2010 [2], Dai et al.
    in 2011 [3], Haghverdi et al. in 2014 [4] and Elnesr et al., in 2016 [5]). In
    this study we follow two different controls. The first model consists to control
    the speed of travelling of the central-pivot for a constant flow rate. The second
    uses an electronic control to adapt flow rate in the nozzles. The speed of travelling
    of the central-pivot is maintained constant. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    allows to save 9-19% of irrigation water and to address field-level spatio-temporal
    heterogeneity in terms of soil water holding capacity and depth of soil [6]. According
    to Pan et al in 2013 [7] VRI allows also to enhance water-use efficiency, improve
    productivity, reduce fuel consummation and reduce nutrient leaching. The choice
    of sprinkler package, the pressure of working, meteorological conditions and tower
    dynamics affect the irrigation water distribution pattern [8]. Moreover, variations
    in micro-meteorological and technical conditions can modify the water application
    depth and irrigation uniformity at different lateral positions with flow control
    nozzles or pressure regulators at each head [8]. Wind speed and direction don''t
    significantly modify the uniformity of water applicatIon but impact the absolute
    application depth of zones under VRI management [9]. To adapt flow of irrigation
    soils moisture measure must be done. Traditional soil moisture sensors need to
    be installed early in the growing season and must be removed before the harvesting.
    Dong et al in 2013 [1] has proposed a cyber-physical system based on underground
    sensors to monitor soil moisture but this approach do not monitor soil on only
    one depth [1]. The interest of the coupling of Geographic Information System (GIS)
    and Remote Sensing (RS) with Internet of Things (IoT) has been demonstrated by
    different authors such as Li et al. in 2012 [10] Ye et al. in 2013 [11] Wang et
    al., 2013 [12]. B. Estimations of Water Requirements The estimation of water requirements
    of crop (ETc) can be estimated from a simple soil water balance (SSWB) model.
    A general form of the soil water balance is done by the following equation: ETc=I+P+F+R+ΔS
    (1) View Source Where I is the irrigation dose [mm], P is the precipitation [mm],
    F is the net subsurface flow into the control volume [mm], R is net runoff or
    runon to the control volume surface [mm] and ΔS is the net change in soil water
    stored in the control volume [mm]. The potential evapotranspiration (PET) can
    be calculated by using different methods. A common one requires several weather
    data that are not all the time available. Among these methods, we mention Penman-Monteith
    [13] FAO56 PM) which ranked as the best method for estimating daily and monthly
    ET for all climates. Penman [14] (FAO24), Penman [15] (FAO-ppp-17), Kimberly-Penman
    [16], Hamon [17], Hargreaves [18], Haude [19], Penman [20], Penman-Monteith [21],
    Priestley-Taylor [22], Makkink [23], McCl [24], De Bruin-Keijman [25] (DK), Jensen-Haise
    [16], Blaney-Criddle [26] (BC), Blaney-Criddle [14] (FAO 24 BC), FAO 24 Radiation
    [14], Turc [27], Wendling [28], Valiantzas [29]. Nevertheless, modern technologies
    such as the use of Wireless Infrared Thermometers (IRT) appear to measure surface
    temperature and determine the ETc [30]. A comparison of 16 among the models mentioned
    above has been carried out by Liu et al. in 2017 [31] and have shown that FAO-ppp-17,
    Pen-63 and FAO-24 BC are the better results in semi-arid climate. Therefore, we
    notice that a poor calibration between all the aforementioned researchers lead
    to inconsistent results of existing studies on weighting lysimeter. Indeed, Jensen
    et al. report that FA024BC is better [32]. While Yoder et al. in 2005 [33] and
    Lépez-Urrea et al. in 2006 [34] find that FA056 PM is the better formula. Otherwise
    some authors such as Berengena et al. in 2005 [35], Howell et al. in 1998 [36]
    have proven that the adjustment of the Penman formula coefficients at local scale
    shows significantly performing results. To conclude, we assume that FA056 PM or
    FA024 BC can be tested as a first approach in the evaluation of the evapotranspiration
    and a precise evaluation can be obtained locally by adjusting the parameters of
    the original Penman equation. The local adjustment of coefficient of the Penman
    formula need the use of lysimeters and a long experimentation which is not always
    achievable out of research centres. The Maximal Evapotranspiration (MET) of a
    crop can be calculated at different vegetative stage when amount of water is sufficiently
    available and agronomic condition are optimal. The MET can be calculated by model
    but in real conditions, and the Real Evapotranspiration (RE) is inferior in amount
    calculated by model. By consequence, it''s important to measure accurately real
    evapotranspiration by mean of sensors to provide the necessary quantities of water
    and to avoid percolation losses related to excessive intake linked in particular
    to an overestimation of the actual evapotranspiration. C. Choice of Sensors Both
    approaches can be followed. The first one uses commercial sensing solutions which
    natively provide a wide range of features directly and allows researchers to focus
    on the developments of algorithms and meta-processing, etc. The second one uses
    open hardware solutions which are programmable and flexible allowing to developers
    to have the full control of the behaviors of the nodes [37] The first approach
    is particularly interesting to develop proof of concept but makes researchers
    dependent of one provider and the availability of sensors used for development.
    Moreover, the rapid turnover of product of high technology renders this science
    stream especially risked for long term developments. The second way although requiring
    further development is more sustainable and is generally supported by a large
    community of developers. The choice of sensors is crucial because nodes can move
    over time that causes considerable interferences in the communication between
    nodes. Moreover, the influence of temperature, humidity, rainfall, sandstorm and
    high solar radiation greatly affect the links and communication quality among
    the nodes, particularly in harsh environmental conditions. The high temperature
    encountered in semiarid environments affects significantly the received signal
    strength (RSS). The humidity linked to the irrigation system and the heavy rainfall
    intensely affects the propagation of radio waves. The choice of the wireless transceiver
    and the transmission protocol must take into account the number of nodes, the
    distances between them, the height of antenna and the operating frequency based
    on the desired size of payload [37]. D. Cloud IoT Platform The correct choice
    of the IoT Platform to build a solution can affect the overall success of the
    project [37]. Both explorable approaches acquire and manage the underlying hardware
    and software layers or use a commercial offering which provides all needed services
    to propose an integrative solution. A review proposed by Ray PP in 2016 compare
    the 26 most popular IoT cloud platforms based on the following parameters: deployment
    service, device management, system management, heterogeneity management, data
    management, tools for analysis, deployment, monitoring, visualization and research.
    According to Ray in 2016 [38], they should have at least 49 IoT cloud platforms
    present in the actual global market. Nowadays, any commercial or open source cloud
    platform allows to deploy, and hosts applications or models elaborated on different
    framework on the same cloud architecture. SECTION III. Calculation of Water Requirements
    The soil characterization has been achieved on basis of samples taken in situ
    by BNEDER (National Technical Studies Office for Rural Development) located at
    Alger (Algeria). 96 samples were taken following a systematic grid of 30 × 30
    m over the area covered by the pivot (one by layer of soil). The parameters evaluated
    were bulk density, texture and the soil water holding capacity. Then, parameters
    measured on each of the 32 sampling points for three layers of soil has been interpolated
    to obtain a high-resolution map. The software ArcMap 10.5.1 was used to interpolate
    data measured in order to generate a grid by layer of 5m × 5m (25m2 area per cell)
    for each kind of measure. Moreover, each layer of soil has also been interpolate
    using 3D spline method to obtain a 3D model of soil layer. This 3D model and the
    spatial interpolation of soil water holding capacity allows to calculate the plant
    available in function of the depth of rooting. As shown on Fig. 1. The first layer
    is a mix of one or more existing layers which have been homogenized from a textural
    point of view and the salt content by successive plowing on a height of 25 to
    30 cm. The water available for plant is also function of roots development which
    offers the possibility to explore a more and more large part of soil. The available
    water is obtained by a weighted mean of the depth of all layers explored by the
    root system at each stage of development. A day by day amount of water irrigation
    can be calculated from (1). Fig. 1 Different stages of crop development Show All
    The FAO Penman-Monteith method (2) is used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration
    (PET) and the evapo-transpiration of the crop (ETc), also named MET which takes
    into account the stage of vegetative growth of the crop by weighting the potential
    evapotranspiration by the coefficient Kc [13]. The Kc coefficient allows to modulate
    the PET in function of the crop envisaged and the stage of its stage of development.

    the saturation vapor pressure [kPa], Δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve
    [kPa.°C-1], γ is the psychrometric constant [kPa.°C-1]. The evapotranspiration
    of the crop is calculated with (3). ETc= PET ∗ Kc (3) View Source Where ETc is
    the crop evapotranspiration [mm.day''], PET is the reference evapotranspiration
    [mm.day−1] and Kc is a ponderation coefficient variating between 0.3 to 1.2 depending
    of the crop stage of development [8], see Fig 1. SECTION IV. Material The application
    is tested on a pivot-center irrigation and a crop of soft wheat implanted in Ain
    Salah located in the heart of the Sahara Desert region in the center of Algeria.
    This region is characterized by a hot desert climate where the temperature in
    the summer reach 47 to 50°C. The irrigation pivot-center is composed of 6 spans
    with a total length of 308m. The revolution time of the pivot is 24h, it means
    that every hour an angle of 15° is traveled. As shown in the Fig. 2, the cover
    area is increasing from the center to the outside. The sensors must stay functional
    with important temperature variation from 20 to 65 degrees and remained functional
    also in presence of rate of humidity close to 80%. Fig. 3 The proposed system
    and architecture Show All SECTION V. Proposed System and Archttecture We have
    chosen to follow the open hardware way as part of our developments. The proposed
    system is composed locally of a weather station. Several multi-depth moisture
    sensors distributed on the irrigate area at the middle on each span measure the
    amount of water at different depths and solenoid placed on sprinkler. Data are
    transmitted by LoRa modulation to a gateway which relay data to The Things Network
    using a 4G connection. A cloud architecture collects, treats and stores data received
    from the weather station and soil moisture sensor, and calculates in real-time
    needs in irrigation water. A. Weather Station The weather data are acquired by
    a micro weather station which uses a LoRa transmission system. This low-cost protocol
    has been chosen for its easiness of deployment, its ability to resist interference
    with the spread spectrum technology and the area that can be covered by a single
    gateway. The micro weather station is based on a Weather Sensor (Argent Data Systems)
    which contains an anemometer, a vane direction and a pluviometer. The weather
    station contains a temperature / humidity sensor AM2315 (Aosong) with an error
    of 0.1°C for the temperature and 2% for the relative humidity. The net solar radiation
    is measured by a digital net radiometer SN-500, Apogee Instruments. All sensors
    are connected on a LoPy which collect data and send them on LoRa / 4G gateway
    (see Fig. 3). B. Sensors and Actuators Soil moisture nodes based on LoPy using
    soil moisture underground sensors measure the rate of humidity at different soil
    depths. The humidity is measured at different depth (20, 30 and 50 cm) with Watermark
    Soil Moisture Irrometer sensor model 200SS. The measure of humidity at different
    depth allow to control if amount of water calculate are correct or if they must
    be adjusted. As show on Fig. 2, the 24 sensors are implanted in the middle of
    each ring, the water requirements are controlled 8 times per day (one just before
    the irrigation and one hour just after the irrigation) on each of the four control
    lines of sensors. Solenoid valves are implanted on the sprinkler feed pipes and
    allows them to be operated individually and thus finely control the water supply.
    The fine control of the sprinklers allows to have a same amount of water per unit
    area at each of the 6 zones traveled at the level of each of the different segments
    each hour. C. Cloud Architecture We use our own architecture based on a Cloud
    IoT platform and a share/hosting application platform. This architecture has already
    been tested with cattle behavior [39], digital phenotyping [40] and monitoring
    of bee health [41]. Time-related Data are transmitted to the Cloud IoT platform
    by LPWA network while images, videos and sound are transmitted by Wi-Fi network,
    see Fig. 3. 1) The Cloud IoT Platform The platform is composed of two parts. The
    first one is based on one hand on Apache Kafka, Apache Samza, Druid, to treat
    stream and time-related data. The second one uses an Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark
    are associate to store and treat images, sound and video. a) Time Related-Data
    Data are received by Apache Kafka which transfer them to Apache Samza to be processed
    before the ingesting by Druid. Druid is a distributed column -oriented fault-tolerant
    data store presenting real-time analytical capabilities. The data processing allows
    to increase the speed of ingestion 10 times by elimination of bad formed package,
    inconsistent and incomplete data. Redis Caching accelerate the speed of recurrent
    queries. The data are stored in units of few millions of lines named ‘segments’
    composed of 5 to 10 million of times-stamped events compressed by LZ4. Old segments
    are locally stored on HDFS. Both external dependencies are used: PostgreSQL and
    ZooKeeper to respectively store meta data and monitor the four kinds of nodes
    present in the cluster. These four types of nodes coordinate, broke, store in
    real-time or archive data in the distributed data store. b) Sound, Images and
    Video These kinds of data are independently treated and stored by a second structure
    based on Hadoop and Apache Spark. These kinds of data are also locally stored
    on HDFS. This structure offers better performance than an Hadoop, MapReduce, HiPi.
    Camera placed on the pivot center can make 3D-pictures of same plant every day
    in order to model their development and compare the impact of agricultural practices
    and weather conditions on the growth of the crop. The analysis of sound allows
    to detect any dysfunction may occur of critical parts of pivot-center and program
    a preventive maintenance (PM) to avoid the immobilization of the pivot over a
    long period. But both features are not yet implemented. 2) The Application Sharing
    and Hosting Platform Druid powers high performances application with low query
    latencies. To better exploit this performance and don''t be dependent of one SDK,
    we propose a cloud architecture able to host application developed on principal
    framework. This cloud platform authorizes elaboration of the model by researchers
    and also host endpoint applications of third party adapted to different kinds
    of material allowing to monitor and automate the pivot-center irrigation while
    optimizing crop yields. SECTION VI. Results We compare water requirements calculated
    by the cloud architecture with the one calculated by CropWat [42] decision support
    tool. This tool is developed by the Land and Water Development Division for the
    calculation of crop water requirements and irrigation requirements based on soil,
    climate and crop data. The calculation procedure is described in [8], the response
    of different yield is explained in [43] and the coupling between CropWat and climatic
    data of ClimWat is explicated step by step in [44]. Remarkably values calculated
    by CropWat assume that only water can change and other factors such as agricultural
    practices, fertilization, etc. are at optimal level. Table 1 gives results obtained
    with CropWat 8.0 for a wheat with a planting date of 25 November at In Salah,
    Algeria and total development in 180 days. Water requirements are calculated on
    basis of real daily weather data. Table I. Water requirements calculated with
    cropwat The Fig. 4 shows the comparison between measured and calculated with CropWat
    Potential Evapotranspiration (ETP). Both approach gives similar results. SECTION
    VII. Conclusion and Future Works We have outlined an architecture based on soil
    characteristics interpolate by mean of GIS, soil moisture measured, and weather
    data transmitted by LoRaWan to calculate in quasi real-time the water requirements
    of the crop. The LoRaWan is particularly adapted to transmit data in harsh conditions.
    In the end, the comparison of first approach performed with CropWat has allowed
    to calculate maximal evapotranspiration and verify that these are never exceeded.
    Fig. 4 Comparison between CropWat and measured average daily ETP Show All In order
    to validate the water requirements calculated using the CropWat model, we compared
    them with a precise model called AquaCrop [45]. This model considers more parameters
    affecting the vegetative and reproductive growth of crop. The implementation of
    3D Camera in specific areas places on the pivot, will open a new research path
    in the field of digital phenotyping. In addition to this, the continuous analysis
    of sound from microphones implemented in chosen places will quickly detect signs
    of failure and prevent downtime that can be expensive in term of crop profitability.
    As future work, we plan to exploit GPU Tegra Mobile Processors 1 that offers high
    computation power thanks to the exploitation of GPU processors in parallel [46]
    [47]. In addition to the high performance, these cards provide the possibility
    to exploit artificial intelligence algorithms for a better training and prediction
    of collected data. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to thank our colleagues from Biosystems

    \ by pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coro-\nnavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),\
    \ which has affected millions of people globally. To date, there are no highly\
    \ efficient therapies for \nthis infection. Probiotic bacteria can interact with\

    \ and induce appropriate immune signaling pathways. Several probiotics have been\

    \ fitness may be one of the approaches by which protection against viral infections\
    \ can \nbe reinforced. In general, prevention is more efficient than therapy in\
    \ fighting viral infections. Thus, probiotics have emerged \nas suitable candidates\
    \ for controlling these infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, any approach\
    \ with the capacity to \ninduce mucosal and systemic reactions could potentially\
    \ be useful. Here, we summarize findings regarding the effectiveness \nof various\
    \ probiotics for preventing virus-induced respiratory infectious diseases, especially\
    \ those that could be employed \nfor COVID-19 patients. However, the benefits\
    \ of probiotics are strain-specific, and it is necessary to identify the bacterial\

    \ infections (RIs) cause high morbidity and \nmortality globally. The viruses\
    \ most frequently responsible \nfor these infections include influenza viruses\
    \ (IVs), coro-\nnaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza \n\
    viruses (PIVs), adenoviruses, and rhinoviruses (RVs) [14, \n142]. The severity\
    \ of viral respiratory infections varies \nwidely, and severe disorders mostly\
    \ occur in children and \nolder adults [184]. Fatalities are often observed following\
    \ \na viral infection, which can be exacerbated by underlying \nconditions or\
    \ coinfection of the paranasal sinuses, mid-\ndle ear, or lungs [184]. Most importantly,\
    \ an outbreak of \nSARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease COVID-19, was \ninitially\
    \ reported in China in December 2019 and quickly \nspread worldwide [124, 126,\
    \ 127, 170]. By December 16, \n2020, the virus had caused 71,581,532 confirmed\
    \ cases \nand 1,618,374 deaths worldwide [137]. Currently, there \nare no highly\
    \ effective drugs for treatment of COVID-19 \n[57, 124, 125, 128]. Consequently,\
    \ it is crucial to discover \nalternative and safe approaches to reduce the risk\
    \ of this \ninfection.\nCurrently, some probiotics have been reported to pre-\n\
    vent and alleviate bacterial and viral infections (VIs) \n[84]. Most of our findings\
    \ regarding the reinforcement of \nimmune reactions by probiotics have been from\
    \ in vivo \ninvestigations. For instance, intranasal inoculation of mice \nwith\
    \ Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus plantarum \nhas shown protective effects\
    \ against lethal viral pneumo-\nnia [84]. The expected outcome of probiotic treatment\
    \ in \nhuman investigations includes alleviation of diarrhea in \ninfants and\
    \ reduction of the severity of milk allergy in \nchildren and irritable bowel\
    \ syndrome [44]. Probiotics \nlikely affect mucosae by adjusting the microbiota,\
    \ hin-\ndering the growth of pathogens, and increasing local and \nsystemic immune\
    \ reactions [68].\nRegarding the advantages of probiotics in viral dis-\neases,\
    \ particular probiotic strains have been found to be \nefficient in reducing the\
    \ duration and severity of gastroen-\nteritis caused by rotaviruses [56]. More\
    \ importantly, there \nis increasing evidence that probiotics are beneficial in\
    \ the \ncontrol of viral respiratory infections [97, 178]. Recent \nimmunological\
    \ studies have provided a better understand-\ning of the role of innate immune\
    \ responses and subsequent \nadaptive immune responses in the recognition and\
    \ eradi-\ncation of viral infections. For instance, it has been found \nthat the\
    \ production of type 1 interferons (IFNs) mainly \nmediates the control of viral\
    \ infection, immune pathology, \nand the management of inflammatory cytokines\
    \ via Toll-\nlike receptors and retinoic-acid-inducible gene I [129, 158, \n180].\
    \ Several studies have elucidated the immunostimula-\ntory effects of probiotic\
    \ bacteria and have described their \ncapability to prevent VIs [3, 13, 100].\
    \ Accordingly, pro-\nbiotic administration may be effective in reducing and/\n\
    or blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection, which has caused \nan enormous health and economic\
    \ burden. This review \ndescribes current preventive and curative trial studies\
    \ \nbased on the use of probiotics against viral respiratory \ntract infections.\
    \ We then outline the possible application \nof probiotic bacteria as a prophylactic\
    \ approach against \nCOVID-19.\nViral respiratory infections\nThe respiratory\
    \ tract (upper or lower) is affected by many \nVIs [34, 169]. These infections\
    \ are clinically categorized \nbased on the type of infection (e.g., bronchiolitis,\
    \ common \ncold, pneumonia), and not based on the type of causative \nagent (influenza)\
    \ [34, 169]. Although particular viral patho-\ngens generally cause characteristic\
    \ clinical outcomes (e.g., \nrespiratory syncytial virus causes bronchiolitis,\
    \ while rhino-\nviruses cause the common cold), each pathogen can cause \nviral\
    \ respiratory syndromes [8, 146]. The severity of viral \nrespiratory disorders\
    \ varies widely, and severe disorders are \nmore likely to occur in children and\
    \ older adults [31, 175, \n186]. In most cases, respiratory viral infections are\
    \ limited \nto the upper parts of the respiratory tract, where they induce \n\
    relatively mild symptoms such as runny nose and sneezing \n[145]. Nevertheless,\
    \ in susceptible individuals such as the \nelderly and newborns, infection can\
    \ affect the lower respira-\ntory airways, leading to wheezing, bronchiolitis,\
    \ shortness \nof breath, and pneumonia [31, 175, 186]. Common respira-\ntory viral\
    \ pathogens include RSV, metapneumovirus, PIVs, \nbocaviruses, adenoviruses, IVs,\
    \ RVs, and coronaviruses [14, \n85].\nRecent developments in virology have led\
    \ to the develop-\nment of standardized diagnostic techniques and the discov-\n\
    ery of novel respiratory viruses such as influenza virus A \n(IVA), influenza\
    \ virus B (IVB) and novel human coronavi-\nruses (HCoVs) with the ability to cause\
    \ a pandemic [214]. In \ncontrast to the regular seasonal outbreaks of influenza,\
    \ pan-\ndemics occur irregularly. For example, the so-called Spanish \ninfluenza\
    \ pandemic in 1918 was the worst in recorded history \nand was responsible for\
    \ about 50–100 million deaths [161, \n179]. The influenza pandemic in 2009 was\
    \ caused by IVA \n(H1N1) and is believed to have caused 100,000 to 400,000 \n\
    deaths [35]. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses with \na broad range\
    \ of hosts (humans and animals). Sometimes, an \nanimal coronavirus can shift\
    \ its host specificity, allowing it \nto infect humans [41, 199]. Several well-known\
    \ human coro-\nnaviruses, including 229E, NL63, OC43, and KHU1, have \nemerged\
    \ recently and induce mild-to-moderate RIs such as \nthe common cold [212]. However,\
    \ SARS-CoV-1 and Middle \nEast respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can\
    \ \n1821\nProbiotics and COVID-19\n1 3\ncause critical RIs, and in 2003, the SARS-CoV-1\
    \ outbreak \ninfected 8098 people, causing 774 deaths, while from 2012 \nto 2019,\
    \ MERS infected 2494 people, causing 858 deaths \n[141]. SARS-CoV-2, which was\
    \ first discovered in China, \nhas caused an ongoing worldwide pandemic and, by\
    \ October \n1, 2020, this virus was responsible for 33,842,281 confirmed \ncases\
    \ and 1,010,634 deaths worldwide [137].\nImmune reactions and pathogenesis \n\
    of COVID‑19\nIt has been found that in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 \ndisease, the\
    \ number of naive T helper (Th) lymphocytes \nincreases while the number of memory\
    \ Th lymphocytes and \n CD28+ T lymphocytes decreases [150, 190]. The balance\
    \ \nbetween memory T lymphocytes and naïve T lymphocytes is \nessential for proper\
    \ host immune reactions [160]. Addition-\nally, decreased numbers of natural killer\
    \ (NK) cells and B \nlymphocytes have been observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection \n\
    [107, 185]. Another important finding is the documented \nassociation between\
    \ inflammatory signs, such as IL-6 pro-\nduction, erythrocyte sedimentation, and\
    \ C-reactive protein \ninduction [193]. Although the proportion of  CD4+/CD8+\
    \ T \nlymphocytes in COVID-19 patients is usually the same as in \nuninfected\
    \ subjects, an elevation of this ratio and a decreased \nproportion of  CD8+ T\
    \ lymphocytes and B lymphocytes have \nbeen suggested as predictors of poor outcome\
    \ in follow-up \n[190, 193].\nAfter the virus enters a cell, viral antigens are\
    \ given to \nantigen-presenting cells (APCs), and this step is crucial \nin antiviral\
    \ immunity [104]. The histocompatibility com-\nplex (MHC or human leukocyte antigen\
    \ [HLA]) presents \nthe viral antigen (antigenic peptide) to specific cytotoxic\
    \ \nT lymphocytes (CTLs) [104]. Therefore, understanding \nSARS-CoV-2 antigen\
    \ presentation will help researchers bet-\nter understand COVID-19 pathogenesis\
    \ [104]. So far, our \ninformation about SARS-CoV-2 is incomplete, and most \n\
    of our current knowledge is from earlier investigations on \nSARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.\
    \ MHC I, rather than MHC II, \nis the source of SARS-CoV-1 antigen presentation\
    \ to CTLs \n[104, 108]. Previous research has shown a correlation of \nHLA polymorphisms\
    \ such as HLA-B*4601, HLA-B*0703, \nHLA-DR B1*1202, and HLA-Cw*0801, with susceptibility\
    \ \nto SARS-CoV-1 infection. In contrast, some alleles, such as \nHLA-DR0301,\
    \ HLA-Cw1502, and HLA-A*0201, have been \nlinked to protection against SARS-CoV-1\
    \ disease [104]. \nMHC II is correlated with host susceptibility to MERS-CoV \n\
    disease (such as HLA-DRB1*11:01 and HLA-DQB1*02:0) \n[66]. It has also been shown\
    \ that a mannose-binding lectin \npolymorphism is correlated with an increased\
    \ risk of SARS-\nCoV-1 infection [183]. These investigations provide signifi-\n\
    cant insights into for COVID-19 pathogenesis.\nAntigen presentation initiates\
    \ the induction of adaptive \nimmunity (humoral and cellular responses via virus-specific\
    \ \nB and T cells) [104]. As in other acute VIs, typical IgM and \nIgG responses\
    \ are generated against SARS-CoV-1 [104]. \nThe specific IgM produced against\
    \ SARS-CoV-1 disappears \nat the end of week 12. In contrast, the IgG antibody\
    \ can \npersist for a longer period, suggesting its potential protec-\ntive role.\
    \ The S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-1 are pri-\nmary targets for the production\
    \ of specific IgGs [40, 101, \n104]. Compared to humoral responses, more studies\
    \ have \nbeen conducted on cellular immunity against coronaviruses. \nRecent analysis\
    \ of the peripheral blood of SARS-CoV-\n2-infected subjects has demonstrated reduced\
    \ numbers of \n CD4+ and  CD8+ T cells. Similarly, a significant reduction \n\
    in  CD4+ and  CD8+ T cells is correlated with the acute phase \nof SARS-CoV-1\
    \ infection [104]. Even in the absence of anti-\ngens,  CD4+ and  CD8+ memory\
    \ T cells can persist for four \nyears in some SARS patients, with T cell propagation,\
    \ DTH \nreactions, and IFN-γ generation [49]. A specific memory T \ncell response\
    \ to the SARS-CoV-1 S peptide could still be \nobserved in 14 out of 23 recovered\
    \ patients, even six years \nafter infection [177]. Regarding MERS-CoV, specific\
    \  CD8+ \nT cell responses are responsible for clearing this virus in \nmice [215].\
    \ These findings might provide a basis for devel-\noping appropriate therapeutic\
    \ approaches for treating SARS-\nCoV-2 infections.\nPotential mechanisms of action\
    \ of probiotics \nin prevention of respiratory viral infections\nProbiotics are\
    \ live microorganisms that confer a health \nbenefit on the host [50]. They commonly\
    \ affect the innate \nand adaptive immune responses and can reduce the sever-\n\
    ity of disease in various disorders, including respiratory \ntract infections\
    \ [73, 98, 140]. Recently, some probiotics \nwere found to exert their immunomodulatory\
    \ effect through \ntheir components, such as peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid,\
    \ \nnucleic acid, which stimulates Toll-like receptors, and mura-\nmyl dipeptide,\
    \ which stimulates Nod-like receptors [147]. \nImmune modulation occurs through\
    \ regulatory T cells, type \n3 innate lymphoid cells, and Th17 cells by recognizing\
    \ the \nprobiotic strain or its components and its effect on mucosal \nimmunity\
    \ [58, 84, 143]. The mechanism of action of probiot-\nics in VIs is not entirely\
    \ appreciated. However, it has been \nsuggested that bacterial probiotics might\
    \ bind to viruses, \nthus hindering viral binding to the host receptor [84]. Over-\n\
    all, the following mechanisms have been proposed for the \neffects of probiotics\
    \ on viral respiratory infections (Fig. 1):\n• Direct effect by a trapping strategy\n\
    • Activation of the immune reactions by interleukins, NK \ncells, Th1, and IgA\
    \ production\n1822\n \nR. Mirzaei et al.\n1 3\n• Induction of mucosal protection\
    \ (gut mucins may attach \nto viruses and restrain viral replication)\n• Production\
    \ of antiviral components such as bacteriocins \nand hydrogen peroxide  (H2O2)\n\
    • Induction of low-level nitric oxide (NO) generation by \nhost cells and dehydrogenase\
    \ formation\n• Immunomodulation of immune cells (such as mac-\nrophages and dendritic\
    \ cells [DCs])\n• Induction of the differentiation of  CD8+ T cells into \nCTLs,\
    \ which kill infected cells\n• Differentiation of  CD4+ T cells into Th1 and Th2\
    \ cells \n(and induction of B cells by Th2-cells) [84, 178].\nClinical outcomes\
    \ of using probiotics \nas a prophylactic approach for viral \nrespiratory infections\n\
    Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are two main genera \nthat are commonly used\
    \ as probiotics [52]. The beneficial \neffects of probiotics on viral infections\
    \ have been reported \n[97, 178]. A list of probiotic bacteria administered in\
    \ viral \nrespiratory infections is shown in Table 1. In this section, we \ndescribe\
    \ some of the promising research findings (Table 2). \nLuoto and colleagues studied\
    \ early modifications of \nimmune responses and gut microbiota following Lactobacil-\n\
    lus rhamnosus GG administration to reduce the risk of viral \nrespiratory infections\
    \ in preterm newborns during their first \nyear of life [113]. They found a significant\
    \ reduction in the \nfrequency of VRIs, in particular rhinovirus infections, when\
    \ \nadministering specific probiotic metabolites such as galac-\ntooligosaccharides\
    \ and polydextrose. They also observed \nimmunomodulatory effects that conferred\
    \ clinical ben-\nefits exceeding those due to interference with viral growth \n\
    [113]. The rationale for the administration of probiotics for \nthe prevention\
    \ of VRIs is based on their capacity to dimin-\nish colonization of respiratory\
    \ epithelia by pathogens and \ncontrol mucosal resistance via activation of inflammasomes\
    \ \nand systemic immune reactions [55, 79]. It has been demon-\nstrated that early\
    \ treatment with dietary L. rhamnosus GG in \npreterm newborns can have long-lasting\
    \ effects and decrease \nthe risk of VRIs. In separate studies, Kumpu and colleagues\

    group [110]. Probiotics, depending on the strain and spe-\ncies, can be potent\
    \ modulators of the immune system [116, \n117]. Lin and colleagues showed the\
    \ effect of Lactobacillus \nspp. on antigen-specific IgG and cytokine reactions\
    \ [110]. \nSpecific Lactobacillus strains can induce myeloid DCs to \nactivate\
    \ T cells and induce the production of Th1 cytokines. \nThey can therefore be\
    \ considered potential biotherapeutic \nagents [130]. West and colleagues studied\
    \ the effects of \nusing a single strain, Bifidobacterium lactis subsp. lactis\
    \ \nBl-04, as a probiotic or a combination of Lactobacillus aci-\ndophilus NCFM\
    \ and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis \nBi-07 on pulmonary and gastrointestinal\
    \ diseases in healthy \nsubjects [202]. They found that daily B. lactis Bl-04\
    \ supple-\nmentation led to a 27% decline in RTI incidence compared \nto a placebo.\
    \ In seasonal infections similar to the common \ncold, a delay in disease incidence\
    \ indicated an affirmative \nclinical advantage from supplementation.\nVrese and\
    \ colleagues examined whether the consump-\ntion of probiotic bacteria for at\
    \ least three months in win-\nter/spring could affect the severity of signs, the\
    \ frequency, \nand the duration of the common cold, as well as immune \nreactions\
    \ in normal adults [39]. They showed that probi-\notic bacteria significantly\
    \ decreased the average duration of \ninfection and lessened the severity of symptoms\
    \ [39]. These \nresults were comparable to those of neuraminidase inhibitors \n\
    (NIs), which, when used during the first 48 h of IV infection, \ndecreased the\
    \ severity of signs and decreased the infection \nduration by one day [39]. In\
    \ contrast to NIs, probiotics can \nbe administered as a part of the diurnal regimen\
    \ and do not \nimpose further costs. The reduced severity and duration of \ncold\
    \ symptoms may be due to immunostimulatory effects, \nand in response to specific\
    \ probiotic strains, distinct cell \nlines, such as peripheral blood mononuclear\
    \ cells, mono-\ncytes, DCs, and intestinal cells from human mucosa have \nbeen\
    \ shown to secrete pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines \nand co-stimulatory molecules\
    \ [15, 24, 71]. According to a \nstudy by Vrese and colleagues, CTLs, along with\
    \  CD8+ T \ncells (suppressor cells), increased significantly throughout \nthe\
    \ initial 14 days of supplementation in a probiotic-treated \ngroup that was compared\
    \ to control subjects [39].\nAlthough vaccination against IVs is known to prevent\
    \ \nsevere illnesses, particularly in communities at risk, in some \ncases, vaccine\
    \ efficacy is low, suggesting the need to develop \nnew adjuvant components [122].\
    \ Some Lactobacillus strains \n(e.g., Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716) have been\
    \ sug-\ngested as suitable coadjuvants for increasing antibody \nproduction after\
    \ IV vaccination [37]. During IV infection, \ninnate immunity forms an early barrier\
    \ against the virus via \nexecutive cells, molecules, and agents involved in the\
    \ restric-\ntion of viral spread [105, 176]. In this regard, Olivares and \ncolleagues\
    \ showed that oral administration of L. fermentum \nCECT5716 led to an increase\
    \ in NK cells 14 days after vac-\ncination [134]. Although IgA and IgG provide\
    \ the crucial \nprotective humoral immunity induced by IV infection, these \n\
    authors observed an enhancement of the specific anti-IV IgA \nresponse in subjects\
    \ receiving probiotics, but no such effect \non IgG or IgM levels was observed\
    \ [134].\nGuillemard and colleagues investigated the beneficial \neffect of Lactobacillus\
    \ casei DN-114 001 for protection of \nolder adults against common RIs [64]. In\
    \ their study, fer-\nmented products were shown to decrease the duration of \n\
    common RIs. More importantly, significant reductions were \nobserved for all RIs,\
    \ in particular, rhinopharyngitis. In an \nunblinded trial, elderly individuals\
    \ immunized against influ-\nenza and pneumococcus demonstrated a lower frequency\
    \ \nof disease, particularly viral respiratory infections, after \nadministration\
    \ of a nutritional complement consisting of L. \nparacasei and additional nutrients\
    \ such as vitamins [19]. \nThe reduced duration of RIs could be correlated with\
    \ a low-\nered risk of medical complications, because infections with \nhuman\
    \ rhinoviruses, the most prevalent cause of RIs, were \nfound to be correlated\
    \ with a high incidence of prolonged \ndisease and a lower rate of pulmonary disorders\
    \ in older \nindividuals [70, 188]. For instance, Guillemard and col-\nleagues\
    \ found that consumption of fermented dairy products \ncontaining L. casei DN-114\
    \ 001 was linked to a significant \nreduction in the duration of common rhinopharyngitis,\
    \ pro-\nviding evidence that probiotics may have beneficial effects \non RIs in\
    \ the elderly [64].\nMakino and colleagues assessed whether the consump-\ntion\
    \ of yogurt fermented with Lactobacillus bulgaricus \nOLL1073R-1 improves immunity\
    \ against RTIs such as the \ncommon cold and IV infections [119]. Their results\
    \ showed \nthat L. bulgaricus OLL1073R-1 significantly diminished the \nrisk of\
    \ common cold among the elderly. It was previously \nreported that 1073R-1 yogurt\
    \ and its polysaccharides inten-\nsify NK cell activity in mice [118]. NK cells\
    \ are involved \nin antiviral defense, and low NK cell activity has been \nlinked\
    \ to the development of common cold, pneumonia, \nacute bronchitis, and death\
    \ in older adults [62, 133]. Hence, \nthe effect of 1073R-1 yogurt is mainly associated\
    \ with the \nimmunostimulatory effect of polysaccharides formed by L. \nbulgaricus\
    \ OLL1073R-1.\nPotential role of commensal microbiota \nin protecting the respiratory\
    \ tract \nagainst infectious agents\nA notable difference in lung microbiota composition\
    \ has \nbeen observed between SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients \nand healthy subjects,\
    \ suggesting the occurrence of dysbiosis \nin the lung microbiota of COVID-19\
    \ patients [46]. Strepto-\ncoccus salivarius is a prevailing commensal bacterium\
    \ in \nthe healthy oral and upper respiratory tract [46]. There have \nbeen several\
    \ reports on interference by this bacterium with \n1830\n \nR. Mirzaei et al.\n\
    1 3\nthe growth of potential pathogens [46]. Along with other \noral commensals,\
    \ S. salivarius is commonly found in the \nlung and is associated with maintenance\
    \ of good health [46]. \nThe lung microbiota of COVID-19 patients is significantly\
    \ \nmodified and enriched in potentially pathogenic bacteria \n[46]. Strain K12\
    \ is the best-studied strain of S. salivarius \n[46]. Establishment of an upper\
    \ respiratory tract (URT) \ninfection with strain K12 can significantly decrease\
    \ the \noccurrence of many viral URT infections, both in children \nand in older\
    \ adults, possibly owing to its ability to induce \nIFN-γ release and activate\
    \ NK cells without triggering \ndestructive inflammatory responses [16]. Although\
    \ its effi-\ncacy against COVID-19 has never been investigated explic-\nitly,\
    \ its clinical potential as well as its safety profile, which \ncan last >20 years\
    \ following probiotic application, might \nencourage medical doctors to reconsider\
    \ prescribing it as a \nsupplement to help control viral respiratory infections\
    \ and \nassociated pneumonia by enhancing host immune functions.\nProbiotic bacteria\
    \ can inhibit colonization and establish-\nment of infection by viral and bacterial\
    \ pathogens [22]. For \nexample, proteases generated by Staphylococcus epidermidis\
    \ \ncan degrade the biofilm structure of Staphylococcus aureus \n[82, 123, 152,\
    \ 187]. In this regard, nasal administration of a \nbacterium that belongs to\
    \ the healthy human microbiota ben-\nefits the patient by re-establishing a microbial\
    \ balance and \nreducing the level of various pathogens in the airways [89].\n\
    IFN-λ is a significant immune regulator in various VIs in \nthe epithelial layer\
    \ (mucosa), and stimulation of IFN-λ pro-\nduction results in a quick response\
    \ of immune cells to human \nrespiratory viruses [53, 86]. IFN-λ is thought to\
    \ be involved \nin the initial defense against viral attackers in the host res-\n\
    piratory system and plays a crucial role in local antiviral \ninnate immunity\
    \ [53, 86]. Nevertheless, our current knowl-\nedge about the modulators that contribute\
    \ to the production \nof IFN-λ, particularly in natural RVIs, is limited. The\
    \ human \nmucosal surface is exposed to elements of the external envi-\nronment\
    \ and is thus sensitive to colonization and invasion \nby numerous pathogens [47].\
    \ Mucosal immunity appears to \nhave evolved to accommodate the interaction between\
    \ the \nhost and the mucosal microbiome, with protection mediated \nby the microbiome\
    \ against infections from outside micro-\nbial pathogens [74]. Various inhaled\
    \ microbial pathogens \nencounter immune cells soon after their first contact\
    \ with \nrespiratory mucosa, and the microbial community in the \nnasal passage\
    \ affects the primary immune reactions directly \n[87]. Understanding the microbiome\
    \ of human nasal mucosa \ncould provide substantial knowledge about the susceptibility\
    \ \nof the respiratory tract to viral infections and components \ninvolved in\
    \ immune reactions, such as IFNs. In a study on \nthe regulation of the homeostasis\
    \ of the human immune sys-\ntem by its microbiome, Kim and colleagues evaluated\
    \ the \nmicrobial composition of healthy nasal mucosa [87]. They \nsubsequently\
    \ evaluated whether nasal commensal microbes \nare involved in signaling as part\
    \ of the defense mechanism \nagainst IVA [87]. They identified S. epidermidis\
    \ as the most \nfrequent microbial population. They found that S. epider-\nmidis\
    \ cells collected from nasal mucosa of healthy subjects \naccelerated the elimination\
    \ of IVA from the nasal epithelium \nvia immune responses mediated by IFN-λ [87].\
    \ In addition, \nnasal S. epidermidis cells from humans prevented IVA infec-\n\
    tion in mice by promoting innate immune reactions mediated \nby IFN-λ in the nasal\
    \ mucosa [87]. There have been reports \nof a crucial mechanistic association\
    \ between susceptibility \nto various VIs and innate nasal immunity mediated by\
    \ the \nmicrobiome.\nCompositional and structural variations in the host res-\n\
    piratory microbiota arising from various environmental fac-\ntors have been predicted,\
    \ and the host respiratory microbi-\nome has been found to be important for immune\
    \ protection \n[10, 151]. Therefore, an understanding of the composition \nof\
    \ the respiratory mucosal microbiome and the substantial \nadverse effects of\
    \ medications on these microbial commu-\nnities is needed to develop novel methods\
    \ for treating and \npreventing RIs. Nasal mucosa cells are crucial players in\
    \ \nimmunological resistance to infections of the respiratory \nsystem. They are\
    \ responsible for the filtration of various \nrespiratory microbial pathogens\
    \ from normal inhalation to \npressurized airflow. Various RVs confront host immunity\
    \ \nprimarily in the lower and upper respiratory epithelia [67, \n81]. Protection\
    \ against various viral infections can be attrib-\nuted to the innate immune mechanisms\
    \ of the human nasal \nepithelium for counteracting invasions by respiratory viruses\
    \ \n[87]. Therefore, researchers must focus on the involvement \nof nasal microbiota,\
    \ particularly S. epidermidis strains, in \nmucosal innate immune defense strategies\
    \ against viruses. \nIn the respiratory tract, innate immunity contributes to\
    \ anti-\nviral immunity through secretion of IFNs [139, 144]. The \nactivity of\
    \ type 1 IFNs in the stimulation of antiviral innate \nand adaptive immune reactions\
    \ has been studied extensively \n[136, 198]. IFN-λ is an important factor in antiviral\
    \ reac-\ntions against influenza viruses and rhinoviruses in human \nlungs [87].\
    \ It is also the prevailing IFN stimulated by IVA \nand is involved in the primary\
    \ defense barrier against VIs in \nnasal epithelial cells [87]. Studies have focused\
    \ on studying \nthe host immune moderators involved in the production of \nIFN-λ\
    \ cytokines in the nasal mucosal layer, suggesting that \nthe nasal microbiota\
    \ may control IFN-λ production [87]. \nKim and colleagues demonstrated that S.\
    \ epidermidis has \npotent antiviral activity in the nasal epithelium and that\
    \ all \nantiviral reactions induced by this organism are mediated by \nIFN-λ,\
    \ and not IFN-γ, IFN-β, or IFN-α [87].\nRecent data have shown that commensal\
    \ S. epidermidis \ncan be sensed by Toll-like receptor 2 in the host nasal epi-\n\
    thelium. However, IFN-λ stimulated by S. epidermidis \nvia signal transduction\
    \ (ST) is associated with transcrip-\ntion factors (TFs). IFN regulatory factor\
    \ 3 (IRF3) and IFN \n1831\nProbiotics and COVID-19\n1 3\nregulatory factor 7 (IRF7)\
    \ are TFs that are associated with \nIFN-λ and IFN production by direct ST via\
    \ the phospho-\nrylation of IRF7 and IRF3 [32, 217]. While IRF3 is usually \n\
    thought to be required for triggering of IFN transcription, \na deficiency in\
    \ IRF3 has been shown to have little effect on \nthe expression of IFN [32]. In\
    \ contrast, the absence of IRF7 \nsignificantly reduces IFN production in the\
    \ host airway epi-\nthelium [32]. Kim and colleagues showed that S. epidermidis\
    \ \ncells as nasal commensals can increase the phosphorylation \nof IRF7 relative\
    \ to IRF3 and eventually stimulate immune \nresponses related to IFN-λ in the\
    \ host nasal epithelium [87]. \nHowever, they did not determine the molecular\
    \ mechanism \nthat prompted phosphorylation of IRF7 by S. epidermidis. \nIt can\
    \ be speculated that free molecules from S. epidermidis \ninteract with IRF7 and\
    \ prompt strong IFN-related antivi-\nral immune reactions in the airways. Comparative\
    \ genomic \nstudies can explain how innate immunity reactions are stim-\nulated\
    \ to react with symbiotic commensals. These findings \nprovide further information\
    \ about how the nasal commensals \nenhance IFN-dependent innate immunity against\
    \ IVA infec-\ntions to protect the respiratory tract. These findings indicate\
    \ \nthat, as the prevailing nasal commensal in humans, S. epi-\ndermidis improves\
    \ protection against IVA infection in nasal \nepithelium via IRF-7-dependent production\
    \ of IFN-λ and \nprevents IVA lung infection via the suppression of IVA rep-\n\
    lication in nasal mucosa. Therefore, intranasal inoculation \nwith S. epidermidis\
    \ might be an effective way of preventing \nviral respiratory infections through\
    \ the stimulation of IFN-\nλ-related innate immune reactions.\nMost importantly,\
    \ in a promising approach, research-\ners from Stanford University have started\
    \ a clinical trial to \ninvestigate whether IFN-λ-treatment can help COVID-19\
    \ \npatients and decrease transmission of virus, since IFN- λ \nappears to help\
    \ control viral respiratory diseases such as \ninfluenza and SARS [121].\nDysbiosis\
    \ of gut microbiota in COVID‑19 \npatients\nDysbiosis, which is defined as a persistent\
    \ imbalance of \nthe microbiota, has been associated with several intestinal \n\
    and extraintestinal diseases [11]. Studies have indicated an \nassociation between\
    \ the pharyngeal microbiota and SARS-\nCoV-2 infection [18]. According to these\
    \ studies, the com-\nposition of the pharyngeal microbiota change with age, with\
    \ \nolder individuals having a less diverse microbial community \n[5]. This might\
    \ contribute to the higher susceptibility of the \naged to COVID-19, but more\
    \ investigations are needed to \nconfirm this. Dysbiosis can lead to an inflammatory\
    \ milieu \nthat can be exploited by SARS-CoV-2 [5]. It has been found \nthat cytokines\
    \ are elevated following COVID-9, possibly \nleading to a \"cytokine storm,\"\
    \ which can be more harmful \nthan the virus itself [5, 209]. Recent studies have\
    \ recog-\nnized bacterial markers associated with sensitivity to SARS-\nCoV-2\
    \ infection [59]. Based on the data from COVID-19 \nsubjects, a blood proteomic\
    \ risk score (PRS) was designed to \npredict the progression and severity of SARS-CoV-2\
    \ disease \n[59]. It was found that Ruminococcus gnavus had a positive \ncorrelation\
    \ with inflammation, while Clostridia spp. showed \na negative correlation [59].\
    \ A strong association was also \ndemonstrated between the severity of SARS-CoV-2\
    \ infection \nin the elderly and the bacteria mentioned above as well as \nthe\
    \ PRS. This study investigated a subgroup of 301 healthy \nindividuals over three\
    \ years [59]. Interestingly, microbiome \nmodifications were indicated by the\
    \ PRS, implying that dys-\nbiosis stimulated protein modifications [59].\nThe\
    \ SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein binds to human ACE2 \n[205], an enzyme that is expressed\
    \ in esophageal and intes-\ntinal epithelia as well as lung tissue, and this could\
    \ con-\ntribute to dysbiosis in the normal flora and gastrointestinal \nsymptoms\
    \ following SARS-CoV-2 infection [61, 76, 102]. \nMoreover, SARS-CoV-2 and its\
    \ genetic material have been \nidentified in the faeces of patients with diarrhea\
    \ [95, 216, \n218] indicating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the human \ngastrointestinal\
    \ tract and its possible transmission by the \nfecal-oral route.\nThe potential\
    \ effects of probiotics \non coronavirus infections and COVID‑19\nMany studies\
    \ are being undertaken to investigate the effects \nof probiotics on several coronavirus\
    \ strains, as they are safe \nand capable of modulating immune reactions [83,\
    \ 131]. \nIn addition, a clinical study has described an imbalance \nin intestinal\
    \ microbiota and significantly reduced levels of \nprobiotics such as Lactobacillus\
    \ and Bifidobacterium in \nCOVID-19 cases, possibly facilitating secondary bacterial\
    \ \ninfections [206]. A recent study has demonstrated that por-\ncine epidemic\
    \ diarrhea virus (PEDV) can be inhibited using \ncell-free supernatants or live\
    \ lactic acid bacteria [171]. In \nthat study, using CPE reduction assays and\
    \ qualitative immu-\nnofluorescence, it was shown that probiotics could be useful\
    \ \nin eliminating PEDV in a strain-specific manner [171]. In a \ndifferent study,\
    \ Lactobacillus casei was employed as a vehi-\ncle for the DC-targeting peptide\
    \ (DC-pep) along with the \nPEDV core neutralizing epitope (COE) antigen [196].\
    \ It was \nshown that a genetically modified Lactobacillus casei oral \nvaccine\
    \ could induce the production of IgG (systemic) and \nSIgA antibody (mucosal)\
    \ in a murine model [196]. Several \nother studies have employed various probiotics\
    \ to present \nPEDV genes or antigens of interest [111, 114, 196, 197]. Liu \n\
    et al. [111] showed that an altered Lactobacillus plantarum \n1832\n \nR. Mirzaei\
    \ et al.\n1 3\nstrain had antiviral activity against coronavirus infections in\
    \ \na porcine intestinal epithelial cell line.\nThe sequencing of microbiota in\
    \ COVID-19 patients has \nshown a significant decrease in bifidobacteria and lactoba-\n\
    cilli as the prevailing symbiotic bacteria and an increase in \nthe number of\
    \ opportunistic bacteria such as Corynebacte-\nrium or Ruthenibacterium [51].\
    \ The immune system in the \nlung can be affected by intestinal dysbiosis, which\
    \ therefore \nmight aggravate respiratory distresses caused by COVID-19 \n[23].\
    \ In this regard, oral bacteriotherapy might be useful. \nSome strains of the\
    \ genera Lactobacilli and Bifidobacterium \nhave a protective function against\
    \ IV, RVs, RSV, adenovirus, \nand pneumovirus [20, 115]. As no definitive treatments\
    \ or \nguidelines have been established for COVID-19, d’Ettorre \net al. [33]\
    \ investigated the efficacy of oral bacteriotherapy \nas an additional curative\
    \ option to prevent the progress of \nCOVID-19. Their bacterial formulation included\
    \ Streptococ-\ncus thermophilus DSM 32345, L. acidophilus DSM 32241, \nLactobacillus\
    \ helveticus DSM 32242, Lactobacillus paraca-\nsei DSM 32243, Lactobacillus Plantarum\
    \ DSM 32244, Lac-\ntobacillus brevis DSM 27961, Bifidobacterium lactis DSM \n\
    32246, Bifidobacterium lactis DSM 32247 [33]. They inves-\ntigated two groups:\
    \ 1) patients treated with hydroxychlo-\nroquine, tocilizumab, and antimicrobials\
    \ alone or in com-\nbination and 2) patients treated with oral bacteriotherapy\
    \ \nplus a conventional medication regimen [33]. Their results \nshowed that patients\
    \ who also received bacteriotherapy had \na higher survival rate and a lower need\
    \ for intensive resusci-\ntation [33]. The predicted risk of developing respiratory\
    \ col-\nlapse due to COVID-19 infection was lower in patients who \nreceived oral\
    \ bacteriotherapy [33]. When other manifesta-\ntions of COVID-19 were considered,\
    \ including asthenia, \npyrexia, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, and myalgia, a notable\
    \ \nimprovement was already seen as early as 24–48 h after the \nstart of the\
    \ bacteriotherapy [33]. The authors hypothesized \nthat in COVID-19 patients,\
    \ bacterial compounds with the \n“proper” immunological and biochemical profiles\
    \ could \npromote host immunity. The antioxidant pathway nuclear \nfactor erythroid\
    \ 2p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxy-\ngenase-1 (HO-1) were elevated in\
    \ response to the bacterial \nformulation [21]. These molecules can modulate oxidative\
    \ \nstress, thereby exerting antiviral functions [33]. Antiviral \nactivity of\
    \ Nrf2 and HO-1 has been observed against human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV),\
    \ IV, RSV, Ebola virus, and \ndengue virus [45, 48, 69, 72, 182]. Interestingly,\
    \ the benefi-\ncial characteristics of HO-1 include activity against respira-\n\
    tory viruses.\nCOVID-19 is a severe pulmonary disease, with manifes-\ntations\
    \ including fever, cough, breathing difficulty, fatigue, \nmuscle pain, diarrhea,\
    \ sore throat, and abdominal disorders \n[137, 170]. While most patients experience\
    \ mild symptoms, \nsome experience viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure\
    \ \n[211]. Until now, COVID-19 prevention has been based on \nmaintaining good\
    \ hygiene by washing hands and avoiding \ncontact with infected individuals [138],\
    \ but reinforcing the \nimmune system might also be helpful (Fig. 2) [173]. In\
    \ the \nhuman body, trillions of beneficial bacteria live in homeo-\nstasis to\
    \ help their host to digest food, produce precursors for \nneurotransmitters,\
    \ and enhance the immune response against \npathogens [12]. It has been found\
    \ that microbiota dysbiosis \nis associated with several disorders [42]. Probiotic\
    \ bacteria \ncan interact with microbiota to reinforce the immune system \nand\
    \ prompt immune reactions [203, 208]. Some probiotics \nhave been found to prevent\
    \ bacterial and viral infections or \ndecrease their duration. Lactobacillus reuteri\
    \ DSM 17938 \nhas been shown to be protective against RI signs and gas-\ntrointestinal\
    \ disorders such as diarrhea in children [2, 65, \n200]. It has also been found\
    \ that probiotics can be useful in \nenhancing vaccine immunogenicity, increasing\
    \ the rate of \nseroconversion and seroprotection in adults immunized with \n\
    flu vaccines [99]. Additionally, probiotics, together with \nvitamins, can enhance\
    \ the immune system. For example, \nvitamin D can modulate immune reactions [7].\n\
    Although its pathophysiological mechanism has not been \nentirely elucidated,\
    \ COVID-19 is known to affect the lungs \nand airways [210]. However, since immunological\
    \ mecha-\nnisms play an important role in the course of the disease, \na novel\
    \ therapeutic approach involving probiotic bacterial \nstrains might be promising\
    \ because of their involvement in \nimmune modulation [120, 204, 210]. In this\
    \ regard, inter-\nleukin-17 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine with a crucial \nrole\
    \ in the adaptive immune system, and it is also a potent \ninducer of endoplasmic\
    \ reticulum stress autophagy through \ninositol-requiring enzyme 1 [17, 88]. By\
    \ blocking this inter-\nleukin, autophagy mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress\
    \ \nand inflammation can be prevented [60, 88]. Interestingly, \nBifidobacterium\
    \ strains have an inhibitory effect on inter-\nleukin-17 [17]. Consequently, administration\
    \ of high doses \nof Bifidobacterium strains such as B. animalis subsp. lacti\
    \ \nBB-12 as well as lipopolysaccharides from this strain [164, \n174] could be\
    \ used as a therapeutic and preventive approach \nin COVID-19 patients, particularly\
    \ in those with gastroin-\ntestinal symptoms.\nA biotechnology company (Biosearch\
    \ Life) found that \nLactobacillus coryniformis CECT5711 K8 can decrease \nvirus\
    \ transmission during respiratory infections in older \nadults. Accordingly, they\
    \ assessed the efficacy of K8 in \ndiminishing the frequency or severity of SARS-CoV-2\
    \ \nin a clinical trial [80]. In a study by Xu et al. [207], some \nCOVID-19 patients\
    \ develop intestinal microbial dysbiosis \nwith lowered levels of probiotics such\
    \ as Bifidobacterium \nand Lactobacillus. Therefore, gastrointestinal health should\
    \ \nbe assessed in all COVID-19 patients. The application of \nprobiotics and\
    \ nutritional support has been shown to main-\ntain intestinal microbiota equilibrium\
    \ and decrease the haz-\nard of secondary bacterial infections [207]. Recent work\
    \ by \n1833\nProbiotics and COVID-19\n1 3\nYoon et al. showed that Lactobacillus\
    \ gasseri could decrease \nthe spread of SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting purine as the\
    \ viral \nenergy source, as this source is required for mutation of the \nvirus;\
    \ hence, it can be expected that probiotic bacteria can \nbe considered as potent\
    \ supplements to suppress the spread \nof COVID-19 by inhibiting purine activity\
    \ [157]. However, \nthe reinforcement of immune reactions by safe strategies,\
    \ \nsuch as maintaining a normal gut microbial heterogeneity \nand preventing\
    \ colonic dysbiosis in the aged, children, and \nthe general community, is probably\
    \ beneficial for recovery \nfrom COVID-19. A balanced diet with probiotics and\
    \ vita-\nmin supplementation can help to reinforce the immune sys-\ntem against\
    \ SARS-CoV-2.\nSeveral metabolites derived from Lactobacillus plan-\ntarum, including\
    \ plantaricin, lactic acid, acetic acid, and \ngamma-aminobutyric acid, can boost\
    \ the immune response \nagainst viral pathogens [4]. In order to initiate infection,\
    \ the \nvirus must recognize its receptor. Lie et al. [103] suggested \nthat the\
    \ binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for hACE2 is linked \nto the rate of viral transmission\
    \ and the severity of disease. \nSARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through S glycoprotein\
    \ homo-\ntrimers on the viral surface [181, 191]. The S glycoprotein \nbinds human\
    \ ACE2 receptors with high affinity [189]. \nAnwar et al. [6] targeted both the\
    \ S glycoprotein and ACE2 \nusing a plantaricin metabolite and showed that plantaricin,\
    \ \nvia binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD), prevents \nthe entry of\
    \ SARS-CoV-2. They also targeted the viral RNA-\ndependent RNA polymerase (RdRp),\
    \ which is required for \nviral replication. Anwar et al. [6] chose four metabolites\
    \ \nproduced by Lactobacillus plantarum (metabolites derived \nfrom plantaricin,\
    \ including plantaricin BN, plantaricin JLA-\n9, plantaricin W, and plantaricin\
    \ D) to design antiviral drugs \nthat, based on computer simulations, showed the\
    \ potential to \nbe employed as probiotics to delay, prevent, and eliminate \n\
    SARS-CoV-2 in individuals by hindrance or inactivation of \nRdRp, prevention of\
    \ the emergence of newly budded virus \nFig. 2  The antiviral effects of probiotics\
    \ during SARS-CoV-2 infection\n1834\n \nR. Mirzaei et al.\n1 3\nprogeny, inhibition\
    \ of the RBD fragment of the S protein, or \ninterference with other proteins\
    \ such as the ACE2 receptor. \nThey used computational analysis to predict the\
    \ antiviral \nactivity of plantaricin compounds through several different \nmechanisms.\
    \ Metabolic products of Lactobacillus plan-\ntarum inhibit viral entry by interacting\
    \ with RdRp, RBD, \nand ACE2 [1, 6]. Blocking the S protein, a major structural\
    \ \nprotein with a pivotal function in the life cycle of SARS-\nCoV-2, could be\
    \ one of the most promising strategies [6]. \nThis was confirmed by a molecular\
    \ model that established \nthe durability of the networks of plantaricin w and\
    \ SARS-\nCoV-2 (RdRp, RBD, and ACE2 receptor) [6]. Computa-\ntional and molecular\
    \ models can accurately identify drugs \nthat can be repurposed without requiring\
    \ clinical trials. \nMoreover, it would be challenging to discover a medication\
    \ \nthat has a more favorable protection profile or a lower cost \nthan macrolides.\
    \ The use of plantaricin metabolites under \nproper medical supervision should\
    \ be considered as a tem-\nporary measure until a definite antiviral drug is discovered\
    \ \nfor COVID-19.\nA promising probiotic‑based oral candidate \nvaccine against SARS‑CoV‑2\n\
    Several vaccines have been developed against SARS-CoV-2, \nand others are undergoing\
    \ clinical trials [54, 192, 213]. \nInjected vaccines are costly and require expert\
    \ administra-\ntion, whereas, oral vaccines are more affordable, simple to \n\
    store, easy to administer, and bio-friendly [94, 162, 166]. \nIt has also been\
    \ shown that oral vaccines can induce the \nrobust production of specific IgG\
    \ and IgA as well asTh1 \nand Th17 responses, thereby inhibiting viral replication\
    \ in \nthe respiratory tract and intestinal mucosa [109, 132, 195]. \nThus, an\
    \ efficient oral vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 would be \nof great benefit.\nLactic acid\
    \ bacteria are potentially suitable bacterial vec-\ntors for oral DNA and protein\
    \ delivery. They are frequently \npresent in the human intestine and are beneficial\
    \ in several \ngastro-intestinal and inflammatory diseases [43, 77, 159, \n163,\
    \ 168, 172]. L. plantarum is generally known as a probi-\notic that can be employed\
    \ in food, vaccines, and medication \n[9, 112, 153–156, 165]. Therefore, Wang\
    \ et al. [194] devel-\noped an L. plantarum expression system for SARS-CoV-2 \n\
    S protein production. By optimizing the codon usage of the \nS gene, the S protein\
    \ was efficiently presented on the bacte-\nrial surface, leading to the generation\
    \ of many misfolded \npeptide chains. This protein showed strong reactivity with\
    \ \nan anti-HA-tagged rabbit polyclonal antibody and SARS-\nCov-2-S-protein-specific\
    \ monoclonal antibodies [194]. The \nstability of the immunogenic protein is crucial\
    \ for oral vac-\ncines. Therefore, they examined the stability of the S pro-\n\
    tein presented on the bacterial surface and found that it was \nresistant to heat\
    \ and low pH. The expression level of this \nprotein was elevated following exposure\
    \ to 0.2% bile salt, \nimplying that the recombinant form of L. plantarum Lp18:S\
    \ \ncould be applied as an oral vaccine for COVID-19 [194].\nConclusion\nSARS-CoV-2\
    \ is a newly emerging pathogen, and researchers \nare still in the early stage\
    \ of understanding how this virus \nacts and the mechanisms by which it induces\
    \ an immune \nresponse. Although the advantages of drugs and vaccines for \nthe\
    \ treatment and prevention of VIs have been demonstrated, \ntheir efficiency can\
    \ be limited by changes that occur in viral \npopulations, making it challenging\
    \ to apply an entirely \npractical approach to prevent viral infections. However,\
    \ the \nadministration of probiotics can be beneficial in prevent-\ning VRIs,\
    \ including COVID-19, and probiotic therapy may \nbe considered as an alternative\
    \ for the amelioration and/or \nprevention of COVID-19 disease. Overall, the application\
    \ of \nprobiotic bacteria against COVID-19 appears to be promis-\ning, both in\
    \ terms of vaccination and treatment.\nAuthor contributions RM, AT, SP, EJ, SRHF,\

    Variable rate irrigation (VRI) may improve center pivot irrigation management,
    including

    deﬁcit irrigation. A remote-sensing-based evapotranspiration model was implemented

    with Landsat imagery to manage irrigations for a VRI equipped center pivot irrigated

    ﬁeld located in West-Central Nebraska planted to maize in 2017 and soybean in

    2018. In 2017, the study included VRI using the model, and uniform irrigation
    using

    neutron attenuation for full irrigation with no intended water stress (VRI-Full
    and

    Uniform-Full treatments, respectively). In 2018, two deﬁcit irrigation treatments
    were

    added (VRI-Deﬁcit and Uniform-Deﬁcit, respectively) and the model was modiﬁed
    in an

    attempt to reduce water balance drift; model performance was promising, as it
    was

    executed unaided by measurements of soil water content throughout the season.
    VRI

    prescriptions did not correlate well with available water capacity (R2 < 0.4);
    however,

    they correlated better with modeled ET in 2018 (R2 = 0. 69, VRI-Full; R2 = 0.55,

    VRI-Deﬁcit). No signiﬁcant differences were observed in total intended gross irrigation

    depth in 2017 (VRI-Full = 351 mm, Uniform Full = 344). However, in 2018, VRI resulted

    in lower mean prescribed gross irrigation than the corresponding uniform treatments

    (VRI-Full = 265 mm, Uniform Full = 282 mm, VRI-Deﬁcit = 234 mm, and Uniform Deﬁcit

    = 267 mm). Notwithstanding the differences in prescribed irrigation (in 2018),
    VRI did

    not affect dry grain yield, with no statistically signiﬁcant differences being
    found between

    any treatments in either year (F = 0.03, p = 0.87 in 2017; F = 0.00, p = 0.96
    for

    VRI/Uniform and F = 0.01, p = 0.93 for Full/Deﬁcit in 2018). Likewise, any reduction
    in

    irrigation application apparently did not result in detectable reductions in deep
    percolation

    potential or actual evapotranspiration. Additional research is needed to further
    vet the

    model as a deﬁcit irrigation management tool. Suggested model improvements include

    a continuous function for water stress and an optimization routine in computing
    the basal

    crop coefﬁcient.

    VRI Full and Deﬁcit Irrigation

    INTRODUCTION

    Traditionally, the smallest practical management scale for center

    pivot irrigation has been the ﬁeld scale. Thus, irrigation

    applications are typically intended or assumed to be spatially

    uniform throughout a ﬁeld. Variable rate irrigation (VRI)

    technology for center pivots allows for the management scale

    to be much smaller and application rates to vary within a VRI

    equipped ﬁeld. Consequently, VRI has been the subject of recent

    research (e.g., Stone et al., 2015; Sui and Yan, 2017). As remote

    sensing techniques may provide opportunity to quantify spatial

    variability of irrigation requirements, a number of studies have

    investigated various remote-sensing-based technologies for VRI

    management (infrared thermometers, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015;

    canopy reﬂectance, Stone et al., 2016; and Landsat thermal and

    multispectral imagery, Barker et al., 2018b). In western Nebraska

    and other areas of the High Plains, irrigation water withdrawal

    may be limited in availability, or limited by regulation. In

    some of these areas (and other areas globally), signiﬁcant soil

    variability exists, further complicating irrigation management.

    VRI may be beneﬁcial in such areas as the utility of VRI has

    been demonstrated for ﬁelds with variable soil properties (Hedley

    and Yule, 2009). The utility of VRI in improving eﬃciency of

    irrigation (e.g., reducing the fraction of irrigation that runs oﬀ,

    drains below the root zone or is otherwise not available for

    extraction by plant roots), e.g., in situations of limited water

    supply, has also been demonstrated including deﬁcit irrigation

    management (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2016). One reason that VRI

    may be of interest in deﬁcit irrigation management is that it may

    allow for a more spatially uniform managed level of water stress,

    by accounting for soil, and other variability.

    While the beneﬁts of VRI have been studied as cited

    above, a common misunderstanding regarding new irrigation

    technologies is that they “conserve” water, with reduced pumping

    resulting in more water available to downstream users. In an

    ineﬃcient irrigation system, much of the “ineﬃciency” is water

    that deep percolates past the root zone and recharges the aquifer.

    Irrigation technology, if properly managed, may reduce aquifer

    withdrawals, and reduce deep percolation, also reducing aquifer

    recharge but potentially decreasing water quality issues. From a

    watershed scale perspective, the only way to conserve water in

    the aquifer is to reduce consumptive use or evapotranspiration

    (Allen et al., 2003). Stakeholders are rightly concerned about

    aquifer level declines and the subsequent impacts on streamﬂow.

    However, the hypothesis of the current study is that, while

    VRI can be used to reduce pumping or increase yield, it

    does not signiﬁcantly reduce consumptive use. In this study

    this is explored using a spatial evapotranspiration model to

    manage VRI.

    The Spatial EvapoTranspiration Modeling Interface (SETMI)

    described by Geli and Neale (2012) has been modiﬁed and

    implemented in VRI research in maize and soybean (common

    commodity crops in the High Plains) by Barker et al. (2018a)

    and Barker et al. (2018b). This model includes a reﬂectance-

    based crop coeﬃcient evapotranspiration (ET) model, wherein

    the basal crop coeﬃcient is related to a multispectral vegetation

    index (Neale et al., 1989). SETMI uses relationships developed for

    maize and soybean in Nebraska by Campos et al. (2017). SETMI

    also contains a version of the two-source energy balance (TSEB;

    Norman et al., 1995) as detailed in Barker et al. (2018a). Notably,

    SETMI contains what is referred to as a hybrid methodology,

    wherein ET from an energy balance model is incorporated into

    the water balance through statistical interpolation (Geli, 2012;

    Neale et al., 2012; Barker et al., 2018a). This hybrid model is

    intended to allow the model to compensate for model drift in the

    soil water balance (Neale et al., 2012; Barker et al., 2018a,b).

    While SETMI had been tested for VRI management in western

    Nebraska (Barker et al., 2018b), it had only been tested on

    maize and the soil water balance was found to drift compared

    to neutron attenuation soil water measurements (Barker et al.,

    2018b). Subsequently, modiﬁcations have been made to SETMI

    discussed by Barker et al. (2018b), including dampening surface

    soil evaporation and provisions for incorporating soil water

    measurements into the model. These modiﬁcations had not

    previously been tested, though such are included in concurrent

    research by Bhatti (2018). Finally, no attempt has previously been

    made to test SETMI for deﬁcit irrigation in row crops in the

    western High Plains, though others have studied deﬁcit irrigation

    in the area, for example, Payero et al. (2005) studied deﬁcit

    irrigation in soybean in West-Central Nebraska. However, they

    did not include VRI in their study.

    The objective of the present study was to determine whether

    VRI management using SETMI, when compared to “uniform”

    irrigation, resulted in reduced irrigation applications, reduced

    consumptive use (ET), improvements in yield, and/or reduced

    impact on local water resources as represented by reductions

    in deep percolation (DP) potential. A secondary objective was

    to determine whether SETMI would perform well as a deﬁcit

    irrigation management tool, which could be accomplished by

    accurately simulating soil water content.

    MATERIALS AND METHODS

    SETMI was tested as an irrigation management tool in a 2-year

    ﬁeld experiment in maize in 2017 and soybean in 2018 in western

    Nebraska. This experiment builds upon previous work by Barker

    et al. (2018b), and is complimentary to research by Bhatti (2018).

    Primary response variables were yield, change in soil water

    storage over the measurement period (1SWS), estimated deep

    percolation (DP) during the measurement period, the sum of

    the latter two variables (1SWS+ DP), modeled ET (ETc), and

    water balance measured ET (ETa). The 1SWS+DP represents

    an approximation of the impact on deep drainage from the

    treatments during the measurement periods (beginning prior

    to imposing treatments and ending near harvest). It represents

    potential diﬀerences in groundwater recharge, and nutrient

    leaching capacity.

    Study Location

    The study location for this experiment was a quarter of a ∼48-

    ha center pivot irrigated ﬁeld, which is part of the University

    of Nebraska-Lincoln’s West Central Water Resources Field

    Laboratory, near Brule, NE (41.027◦N, 101.973◦W; Google Earth

    Pro, accessed 8 August 2018; Figure 1). The ﬁeld is irrigated

    with a Zimmatic (Lindsay Corporation, Omaha, NE) center

    pivot equipped with Lindsay Precision VRI with individual

    nozzle control. The pivot was new in 2015 and is equipped

    with Senninger XiWob UP3 sprinklers (Senninger Irrigation Inc.,

    Clermont, FL) on drops ∼2 m above the ground surface (Barker

    et al., 2018b).

    Soils in the study area range from loam (Santana loam) to

    loamy sand (Bankard loamy sand) and loam–gravel complex

    (Santana-Dix complex) (Soil Survey Staﬀ, 2018). The terrain is

    undulating hills with soil texture varying with topography. The

    Koppen-Gieger Climate class for the location is Bsk (cold arid,

    dry summer; Kottek et al., 2006; Brugger, 2017).

    Crops were planted following a circular pattern and the

    center pivot wheel tracks. The ﬁeld was under continuous maize

    production for several years prior to rotating into soybean in the

    2018 season. The ﬁeld was managed as no-till, but was subject

    to a residue removal study prior to 2017 (van Donk et al., 2012;

    Barker et al., 2018b). In 2017, the study area was under a maize

    crop Dekalb DKC55-20RIB planted at 78,740 seeds ha1 on 8

    May 2017. A total of 231 kg ha−1 of N was applied with ∼25%

    applied through fertigation. The maize was harvested for grain

    between 4 and 16 November 2017. In 2018, the crop was soybean

    Pioneer P24A99X, planted at 457,720 seeds ha1 on 8 May 2018.

    The soybean crop was harvested for grain on 26 September 2018.

    Treatments and Irrigation Management

    In 2017, two irrigation treatments were applied: (1) VRI using

    SETMI with Landsat imagery, and (2) uniform irrigation using

    neutron attenuation based measurements of soil water content

    to provide feedback for irrigation scheduling. Both treatments

    were full irrigation, with no intentional water stress, thus they

    are referred to as VRI-Full, and Uniform-Full, respectively.

    In 2018, two additional treatments were added. These two

    treatments were both deﬁcit irrigation and corresponded to

    the two full irrigation treatments in the modeling and neutron

    probe feedback approaches (VRI-Deﬁcit and Uniform-Deﬁcit,

    respectively). Thus in 2018, the experiment became a two-by-

    two factorial layout. Deﬁcit irrigation as deﬁned here included

    an irrigation management allowed soil water depletion that was

    greater than would be used for minimal water stress management

    during part of the growing season. Additionally, in 2017,

    SETMI was executed using the hybrid method and incorporating

    neutron-attenuation-measured soil water content. However in

    2018, SETMI was executed without these two methodologies (i.e.,

    the reﬂectance-based crop coeﬃcient ET model based on Landsat

    satellite multispectral inputs and water balance were exclusively

    used). This was because the hybrid methodology was found to

    induce model drift necessitating the incorporation of neutron

    probe measurements. By eliminating the hybrid model in 2018,

    a SETMI-only approach could be tested. This was deemed more

    beneﬁcial than maintaining the 2017 modeling approach.

    The irrigation was managed similarly to Barker et al. (2018b),

    using the concept of a managed root zone water balance and

    management allowed depletion (Woodruﬀ et al., 1972; Martin

    et al., 1990). This method, used by Barker et al. (2018b) provides

    a convenient way to manage VRI and to apply treatments to VRI

    equipped irrigated ﬁelds. The basics of the method are (Barker

    et al., 2018b):

    • Determine soil properties (e.g., available water capacity) for

    each plot or management area.

    • Determine a management allowed depletion fraction for the

    treatment or ﬁeld.

    • Determine a target stored root zone soil water depth above

    management allowed depletion after irrigation, to which the

    root zone will be reﬁlled during an irrigation event. A value of

    ∼20 mm (0.8 in) was used in this study thus providing a soil

    water storage buﬀer for rainfall capture.

    • Compute the water balance, forecasting ET forward in

    time (precipitation could also be forecasted; soil water

    measurements could be incorporated). Similar to Barker et al.

    (2018b), the VRI treatments received plot-speciﬁc irrigation

    based on mean modeled soil water depletion within a ∼9 m

    buﬀer area in each plot. In this study, the water balance for the

    VRI plots was computed using SETMI.

    • Irrigation application depth is computed for any desired

    date as the diﬀerence between the target water content

    (the speciﬁed depth above management allowed depletion)

    and the modeled water content at the end of the day in

    question assuming no water inputs after inputting the available

    water record. This diﬀerence, if positive, is the net irrigation

    requirement for the plot or management area to be applied by

    the end of that day.

    • Irrigation is triggered such to prevent any plot from exceeding

    management allowed depletion (described in the following

    paragraph). Thus, irrigation events occur at the same time

    for all treatments, but application rates vary by treatment

    and/or plot.

    • Maximum and minimum gross application rates (accounting

    for application eﬃciency) are applied as necessary for pivot

    and pump management. In this study application eﬃciency

    VRI Full and Deﬁcit Irrigation

    (taken here to be the portion of applied irrigation that was

    inﬁltrated) was assumed to be 85%.

    • Irrigation prescriptions are set to a practical irrigation

    application depth (optional). In this study, gross applied

    irrigation was rounded to the nearest ∼5 mm (0.2 in).

    For the full irrigation treatments, management allowed depletion

    (MAD) was set to 50%. Late in the 2017 season, the MAD

    was allowed to reach 60% as in Yonts et al. (2008), but it was

    maintained at 50% throughout the season for soybean in 2018.

    The management allowed depletion was set to 60% for the deﬁcit

    treatments in 2018; this was increased to 75% after reaching the

    end pod-ﬁll stage following the principles of Kranz and Specht

    (2012) who suggest avoiding stress during pod-ﬁll. This strategy

    implicitly seeks to maximize yield with perhaps only modest

    reductions in applied irrigation, since water stress may aﬀect

    soybean yield during pod-ﬁlling more than other crop stages

    (Doss et al., 1974; Momen et al., 1979; Cox and Jolliﬀ, 1986;

    Kranz and Specht, 2012). The soybean crop was near beginning

    pod-ﬁll when the treatments eﬀectively began to be applied in

    2018; thus the deﬁcit irrigated plots may have been insulated

    from yield loss per Kranz and Specht (2012). However, Doss et al.

    (1974), reported that stressing soybean in late pod-ﬁll was more

    consistent at causing a yield reduction than when stress was only

    earlier in the season.

    Irrigation prescriptions were computed about once per week

    during the treatment periods. In 2017, the treatment period

    began on 9 August; prior to this time a total of 182 mm of uniform

    irrigation was applied. In 2018, the treatment period eﬀectively

    began on 13 August. Prior to that time, all treatments eﬀectively

    received 119 mm of uniform irrigation.

    Modeling

    Modeling for Irrigation Scheduling

    Irrigation prescriptions for the uniform plots were based

    upon neutron-attenuation-measured soil water content (see the

    Measurements and Response Variables section) and a short-

    term simple soil water balance including ET modeled using crop

    coeﬃcients based on (Allen and Wright, 2002) for maize in

    2017 and using relationships reported by Irmak et al. (2013) for

    soybean in 2018. Uniform treatments received irrigation based

    on neutron-attenuation-measured soil water depletion and a

    simple water balance for one plot of the treatment in 2017 and the

    maximum irrigation requirement of two selected plots in each of

    the 2018 uniform treatments.

    Irrigation

    prescriptions

    for

    the

    VRI

    treatments

    were

    computed using the SETMI application, with model formulations

    similar to Barker et al. (2018a) and Barker et al. (2018b). The

    SETMI water balance model was modiﬁed prior to use in 2018

    to include other updates to the FAO56 (Allen et al., 1998)

    methodology, which are described in Jensen and Allen (2016).

    The model includes a daily water balance generally following

    Allen et al. (1998), with ET computed using reﬂectance based

    crop coeﬃcients following Campos et al. (2017) and Barker

    et al. (2018a). In 2017, the hybrid method within SETMI was

    included using TSEB-computed ET (using the Priestly-Taylor

    approximation for canopy latent heat ﬂux; Norman et al., 1995;

    Colaizzi et al., 2014) and a statistical interpolation weighting

    factor from Barker et al. (2018a) equal to 0.56. To prevent model

    drift, in 2017, measured soil water depletions from neutron

    attenuation measurements were incorporated into the model as

    the actual end-of-day root zone depletion on the measurement

    date. In this, neutron attenuation measurements from four

    plots in the VRI-Full treatment were compared to model

    output depletion for the same plots. The four selected plots

    had the maximum, minimum, 33 percentile, and 66 percentile

    values of volumetric water content measurements, respectively,

    for that treatment on 27 June 2017. The reasoning was to

    include locations spread across the distribution of soil water

    content. Modeled depletion for all computation pixels was then

    updated based upon correlation between these measurements

    and modeled soil water depletion if R2 ≥ 0.6, or the mean

    diﬀerence between the measured and modeled values for those

    four locations otherwise as in Bhatti (2018). This adjustment

    was to reduce model drift. In 2018, this methodology was not

    used because excluding the hybrid methodology was expected

    to reduce model drift. For the 2018 simulations, the model was

    initiated with soil water content assumed to be at ﬁeld capacity.

    Spatial Soil Properties

    Prior to execution in 2018, the SETMI water balance model

    was also modiﬁed to include a slow root zone drainage routine

    using the drainage equations of Raes et al. (2017); soil below

    the root zone was assumed to have instantaneous drainage

    whenever water content exceeded ﬁeld capacity. Furthermore,

    the model was expanded to allow for the input of properties

    for three soil layers. The properties for the root zone were

    computed as depth-weighted averages of layers within the

    root zone on a given day. Saturated hydraulic conductivity

    (Ksat) for the root zone, a key parameter in the drainage

    formulas (Raes et al., 2017), was computed throughout the

    season (as root depth increased) based upon Equation 3.10 of

    Radcliﬀe and Šimunek (2010):

    Ksatr =

    Zri

    P3

    j=1

    1Zrij

    Ksatj

    (1)

    where the subscript Ksatr is Ksat in the root zone, Zr is

    the root zone depth, 1Zr is the thickness of a soil layer

    within the root zone, with subscripts i and j being time

    and soil layer, respectively. This method is for steady-state,

    saturated ﬂow. However, it provided a practical means of

    computing Ksat for the root zone and allowed the model

    to stay within the framework of a simple water balance

    (Allen et al., 1998; Jensen and Allen, 2016).

    Soil properties for each plot were estimated from neutron

    attenuation, lab measurements, and the gSSURGO (Soil Survey

    Staﬀ, 2015) database. Field capacity (FC) was computed using

    the maximum neutron attenuation measurement from the 1

    June and 27 June 2017 measurements for each depth and plot,

    using the concept of observational FC (Lo et al., 2017). For 2017

    irrigation management, plot FC was then computed by taking

    the depth-weighted average of this maximum water content from

    the soil surface to 1 m. For 2018 irrigation scheduling, the same

    data were used to compute FC; however FC was computed

    for three soil layers (0–0.23, 0.23–0.61, and 0.61–1.22 m) using

    depth-weighted averages. For the ﬁnal analysis, FC was computed

    as in 2018 irrigation scheduling with the lowest layer being

    0.61–1.0 m and the inclusion of an improved neutron probe

    calibration for 27 June 2017, which changed some of ﬁnal plot

    FC values.

    was determined for each sample using a WP4-T Dewpoint

    PotentiaMeter (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA) assuming a

    potential of −1.5 MPa for WP. The resulting WP values were

    correlated with respective FC values for the same plot and depth

    from the 1 June and 27 June 2017 data (R2 = 0.72; Figure 2). The

    resulting relationship was applied depth-by-depth to compute

    WP for all plots corresponding to the respective FC estimation

    methods (i.e., 2017, 2018, and ﬁnal analysis). The regression was

    recalculated for ﬁnal analysis using the updated neutron probe

    calibration mentioned above. However, this made no diﬀerence

    in the resulting WP for the ﬁnal analysis when rounded to the

    nearest 0.01 m3 m−3.

    In 2018, the inclusion of the drainage equations from Raes

    et al. (2017) required the input of both volumetric soil water

    content at saturation (θsat) and saturated hydraulic conductivity

    (Ksat). These values were obtained for each plot and soil layer

    using values from gSSURGO and relationships with FC. The FC

    for these relationships was computed based on volumetric water

    content at −1.5 MPa and available water capacity (AWC) for

    the soil horizons of the dominant components of the four soil

    map units in the study area. This was done assuming this was

    a better estimate of FC than was water content at −0.033 MPa.

    A piecewise linear relationship was developed for θsat using linear

    regression for values of FC < 0.25 m3 m−3 (R2 = 0.92), and

    then the average of all θsat for FC > 0.25 m3 m−3 (Figure 3A). A

    power regression ﬁt well (R2 = 0.96) for Ksat as a function of FC

    (Figure 3B). The relationships in Figure 3 were used in irrigation

    scheduling in 2018 and in ﬁnal analysis, using the respective soil

    layer FC values.

    Model Input Data

    Other spatial model inputs included Landsat 7 and Landsat

    8 multispectral imagery obtained from U.S. Geological Survey

    (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). This imagery included Level 2

    Surface Reﬂectance and Level 1 thermal infrared imagery (2017

    only). Thermal infrared imagery were corrected for atmospheric

    eﬀects similar to Barker et al. (2018a) and Barker et al. (2018b),

    whose method was based upon Brunsell and Gillies (2002).

    The correction parameters from NASA’s Atmospheric Correction

    Parameter web app (https://atmcorr.gsfc.nasa.gov/, by J. Barsi)

    were used. Local surface weather data described below were input

    to the web application. Only Tier 1 and Real Time imagery

    were used for irrigation scheduling (with the exception of 5

    August 2017, which was a Tier 2 image, included as Real

    Time quality). In the ﬁnal analysis, only Tier 1 imagery were

    included. Landsat 7 imagery were included if no pixels were

    missing due to the scan line gap over the entire study plot

    area. Thirteen images were included in 2017 and 14 images

    in 2018. Not all images were included in irrigation scheduling

    or ﬁnal analysis (Table 1); for example, images were included

    in the ﬁnal analysis that were not available during irrigation

    scheduling and some used in irrigation scheduling in 2017

    were determined to not be of suﬃcient quality to use in ﬁnal

    analysis. The model was executed using a ground resolution of

    1 m in 2017 and 5 m in 2018 and ﬁnal analysis to account for

    discrepancies between Landsat pixel size and position and the

    plot geometry (Bhatti, 2018).

    Weather data for modeling were obtained from three

    Nebraska Mesonet (https://mesonet.unl.edu/) weather stations:

    Big Springs 8NE, Brule 6SW, and Keystone 3W Beta. The

    Brule 6SW data were used for near real-time data for irrigation

    management in 2017 and for the ﬁnal analysis. The Big Springs

    8NE data were used for near real-time data in 2018. This

    weather station was nearby and was used thinking it was the

    Brule 6SW station, which was adjacent to the research ﬁeld.

    The diﬀerence was expected to be small; however the Brule

    6SW station was still determined to be the best suited for

    the ﬁnal analysis. The nearby Keystone 3W Beta data were

    used to compute 20-year historic average reference ET (ETr)

    and temperatures for growing degree-day computation, both

    used for ET forecasting similar to Barker et al. (2018b). This

    station was used because the records for the Brule 6SW and

    Big Springs 8NE stations were not suﬃciently long. ETr was

    computed using the ASCE Standardized Reference ET equation

    (ASCE, 2005). Barometric pressure was obtained from a nearby

    cosmic-ray neutron probe station and was provided by T. E.

    Franz (University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Precipitation from the

    Brule 6SW weather station was veriﬁed in 2017 using a lab-

    rain gauge coupled with a H07-002-04 HOBO Event Data

    Logger (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA) installed

    near the northwest corner of the ﬁeld. These latter data were

    also used from 1 to 8 November 2017, because the Brule

    6SW dataset did not cover this period. Data from the National

    Weather Service Global Historic Climate Network Ogallala NE

    station were used for 9–13 November 2017 because neither

    the lab-calibrated rain gauge nor the Brule 6SE data were

    available. Weather data for the Mesonet and National Weather

    Service stations were obtained from the High Plains Regional

    Climate Center.

    Besides precipitation, the other major water balance input for

    modeling was applied irrigation. The prescribed irrigation was

    assumed to be applied (with an application eﬃciency of 85%—

    used throughout the study) on the day that the pivot passed over

    the plots. In the case that the pivot passed over the plots during

    the night (covering two dates), the irrigation was attributed to

    plots on the date it was estimated to pass over them in the 2017

    irrigation scheduling. The average pivot travel speed from start-

    stop times and travel angle were used to determine the overpass

    time for plots. Irrigation depth was assigned typically the latter of

    the two dates in 2018 scheduling, for simplicity. In ﬁnal analysis,

    the earlier of the two dates was used in all cases, because this

    would make the water available sooner to alleviate any modeled

    water stress (see the formulations of Jensen and Allen, 2016).

    Soil Water Content Model Validation

    Since the value of SETMI in this research was in modeling

    soil water content, the model performance was validated using

    neutron attenuation measurements after the ﬁrst measurement.

    Missing measurements in both years and for the 2018 plots that

    were aﬀected by the irrigation system malfunction during this

    season were excluded. The model was executed using only the

    reﬂectance-based crop coeﬃcient ET and water balance. The ﬁrst

    neutron attenuation measurements each year were incorporated

    into the model as described in the Measurement and Response

    Variables section.

    Measurements and Response Variables

    The total prescribed irrigation depth (the total gross irrigation

    depth for each plot that was used in the executed irrigation

    prescriptions) was analyzed as a primary treatment comparison.

    This was assumed to be equivalent to the actual gross applied

    irrigation for each plot. The ﬁnal irrigation in both years (applied

    19 September 2017 and 14 September 2018, respectively) were

    not applied and/or computed as intended. In the case of 19

    September 2017, the prescription for the previous irrigation (14

    September 2017) was applied in what was probably a logistically

    practical situation. In the case of 14 September 2018, the applied

    prescription from 8 September 2018 was not converted from

    inches to mm before input into SETMI, thus the prescribed

    irrigation was erroneously high for some plots. In both cases,

    both total applied prescribed (total prescribed irrigation as

    deﬁned above) and the total intended prescribed gross irrigation

    (or the total gross irrigation if correcting for the errors described

    above in the paragraph) were analyzed. The pivot had some low

    pressure problems in 2017. However, these may have been related

    to a pressure sensor (not actual pressure) and were assumed

    not to have aﬀected sprinkler application and uniformity. To

    assess the ability of the VRI methodology on accounting for

    spatially varying irrigation requirements, intended prescribed

    irrigation was compared to available water capacity (AWC) and

    plot modeled ET (ETc; described later in this section).

    Primary measurements included grain yield and soil water

    content. Plot yield was computed from production yield

    monitor data, which was cleaned and processed using the U.S.

    Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service’s Yield

    Editor 2.0.7 software (Sudduth et al., 2012) similar to Barker

    et al. (2018b). Yield points were only included if they were

    within a ∼12 m buﬀer within each plot boundary (Barker et al.,

    2018b). Plots included in the ﬁnal statistics had 22–47 yield

    points within the buﬀer in 2017 and 26–45 points in 2018. Dry

    grain yield was computed using the yield monitor’s moisture

    content measurements.

    †Attributed to previous day during ﬁnal analysis.

    ‡All data were used as if collected on 31 July. For irrigation scheduling, only
    standard

    neutron counts from 31 July were used.

    Soil water content measurements were used in computing

    the other response variables. Soil volumetric water content

    was measured in each plot using neutron probes (503 Elite

    Hydroprobe, CPN, Concord, CA). Access tubes were installed

    in the approximate center of each plot. The neutron probe

    instruments used were either locally calibrated or cross-

    calibrated with a locally-calibrated probe. The local calibration

    was conducted in a ﬁeld immediately east of the study site. Local

    calibration of a gauge used in the study resulted in a slope of

    0.2068 and an oﬀset of −0.0607. Calibrations were applied at a

    4 decimal accuracy in 2017 and ﬁnal analysis; they were applied

    at a higher numerical precision in 2018 irrigation, though this

    was of little consequence. Neutron attenuation measurements

    were taken at the following soil depths with measurements

    assumed to represent the range in parentheses: 0.15 (0–0.23 m),

    0.30 (0.23–0.38 m), 0.46 (0.38–0.61 m), 0.76 (0.61–0.91 m), 1.07

    (0.91–1.22 m), and 1.37 m (1.22–1.52 m). Neutron attenuation

    measurements were limited in temporal frequency in 2017 and

    in seasonal coverage in 2018 (Table 2). However, the coverage

    in both years began before the treatment period had eﬀectively

    started and ﬁnished near harvest. For modeling purposes in

    irrigation scheduling, neutron attenuation measurements were

    treated as the actual root zone water content at the end of

    the measurement date for the VRI-Full treatment in 2017 and

    the uniform treatments in both years. However, some neutron

    attenuation data were shifted to represent the ending conditions

    on the previous day for ﬁnal analysis depending on rainfall

    and irrigation on the measurement day (Table 2). The neutron

    attenuation data for the 0.91–1.22 m depth for two plots for all

    2018 dates except 10 July 2018 were gap ﬁlled for ﬁnal analysis.

    These were ﬁlled using the respective measurement value from

    the 0.61–0.91 m reading.

    The response variables relating to the impact of treatments

    on DP and ET were all derived from the neutron attenuation

    data. The ﬁrst was 1SWS in mm in the top 1.0 m of the

    soil proﬁle (using the 1.07-m reading to represent 0.91–1.0 m)

    between the ﬁrst and last neutron attenuation measurement each

    year (Table 2). Modeled DP and ETc were computed using the

    SETMI water balance with soil properties described for ﬁnal

    analysis. In modeling DP and ETc, the depth-weighted neutron

    VRI Full and Deﬁcit Irrigation

    attenuation measurements were incorporated as the actual root

    zone depletions and the average water contents of the soil

    below the root zone (down to 1.0 m below ground surface) at

    the end of the ﬁrst date each year (Table 2). This is similar

    to the method used by Djaman and Irmak (2013). A similar

    method, but using repeated soil water content measurements

    as model input was used by Barker et al. (2018b). ET was also

    computed using the residual of the water balance (ETa). Both

    ETc and ETa were included as response variables. The ﬁnal

    variable considered was the sum 1SWS and DP (1SWS+DP).

    For all of these variables, the neutron-attenuation-measured

    values were assumed to represent the entire plot area. The plot-

    average modeled root depth (based upon time to reach peak

    basal crop coeﬃcient for each pixel) was used to compute root

    zone depletion and average volumetric water content below

    the root zone from the neutron attenuation data. The average

    root depth was computed as a spatial mean for each plot and

    neutron attenuation date excluding a ∼9 m buﬀer within each

    plot boundary (Barker et al., 2018b). The model was executed at a

    5-m pixel resolution in the ﬁnal analysis. The response variables

    were also computed as spatial means excluding the same ∼9 m

    buﬀer within each plot boundary.

    Experimental Design and Statistical

    Analysis

    The experiment was a generalized randomized complete block

    design, with multiple replicates of at least some treatments in

    each block. The study area was broken into plots ∼0.2 ha in

    size accommodating the precision of the sprinkler system and

    the commercial combine yield monitor similar to Barker et al.

    (2018b). Plots were arranged radially with plot boundaries falling

    on pivot wheel tracks (Figure 1). The plots were designed with

    criteria of a minimum of ∼37 m in width and length (Barker

    et al., 2018b). Plots were grouped into six blocks using computed

    AWC for the top 1 m of soil (as computed for the 2017 irrigation

    scheduling) as the blocking criterion. Plots were not blocked by

    radial distance from the center based on results of Barker et al.

    (2018b). Treatments were randomly assigned to plots afresh in

    both years (Figure 1).

    Responses for each treatment and variable were compared

    using ANOVAs computed using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS 9.4

    (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The ANOVAs were computed

    separately for the 2 crop years and for each variable (i.e.,

    no MANOVAs were included). Total prescribed irrigation was

    compared using 95% conﬁdence intervals computed using SAS

    PROC MEANS to compare with the uniform treatments as in

    Barker et al. (2018b). ANOVA was used to compare irrigation for

    the two VRI treatments in 2018.

    A number of plots were discarded from the ﬁnal analysis based

    upon missing data or misapplication of irrigation. In 2017, a

    total of six plots received an erroneous application depth during

    one of the irrigation events. These plots were all Uniform-Full,

    the misapplication aﬀected some VRI-Full plots also, but that

    would have automatically been compensated for in the following

    irrigation prescription. Another plot had water in the neutron

    access tube on the 13 November 2017 measurement and was

    also excluded. All seven plots were excluded from ﬁnal analysis

    for 2017. An additional two plots in 2017 did not have neutron

    attenuation data for 20 July 2017. For 2017, only data for plots

    and measurement dates that had missing data were excluded

    from validating the modeled water content. In 2018, two banks

    of four sprinklers did not function properly during much, if

    not all, of the irrigation season. Based upon the pivot dealer’s

    sprinkler chart (provided by Holzfaster’s Equipment, Ogallala,

    NE, and computed using software by Senninger Irrigation Inc.,

    Clemont, FL, 6 February 2015), the aﬀected areas were near the

    center of the second and sixth radial rows of plots from the

    pivot center (Figure 1). Thus, a total of 14 plots were aﬀected,

    one of which was also missing neutron attenuation data. All 14

    plots were eliminated from the ﬁnal analysis for 2018. One of

    the aﬀected plots in 2018 was used to schedule irrigation for the

    Uniform-Full treatment. However, this treatment always received

    the maximum irrigation depth during a given irrigation cycle.

    Given that the aﬀected sprinklers were likely always on (a default

    conditions of the system; personal communication, Lindsay

    Corporation personnel), this plot would not have adversely

    aﬀected that treatment.

    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

    Study Conditions

    The May–September total ETr was 1,020 mm in 2017 and

    910 mm in 2018 for the Brule 6SW station, comparable to a 20-

    years average of 1,080 mm for 1998–2017 for the Keystone 3W

    Beta station. This is also similar to the 950–1,050 mm reported

    by Sharma and Irmak (2012) for 1986–2009 for this part of

    Nebraska. Total May–September precipitation was 280 mm in

    2017 and 400 mm in 2018, compared to 290 mm for the 1998–

    2017 20-year average for Keystone 3W Beta. This is also similar

    to the 280–320 mm reported by Sharma and Irmak (2012) for

    1986–2009 for the area.

    In addition to weather, the soil properties at the site may

    greatly aﬀect an irrigation experiment. Using the ﬁnal analysis

    values, FC in the top 1 m of the soil proﬁle ranged from 0.11

    to 0.30 m3 m−3. The range of WP values was smaller, 0.05–0.16

    m3 m−3. Calculated AWC for the plots ranged from 0.06 to 0.14

    m3 m−3. This translates into 60–140 mm over a 1-m managed

    root zone.

    Modeling and Treatment Execution

    The incorporation of TSEB-ET in 2017 had a general eﬀect of

    increasing modeled soil water depletion (decreasing soil water

    content). This was in part because of the nature of the piecewise

    water stress coeﬃcient used (Ks; Allen et al., 1998; Figure 4).

    That is, Ks is equal to unity when the modeled root zone water

    content is above the water stress threshold (Allen et al., 1998;

    Figure 4). In the hybrid methodology, the ET modeled by the

    reﬂectance-based crop coeﬃcient method in the water balance

    (WB-ET) is updated based upon TSEB-ET. If TSEB-ET ̸= WB-

    ET, then the water balance is updated by back-calculating for Ks

    and then back calculating for start-of-day root zone depletion

    (Geli, 2012). For example, assume that the TSEB-ET had little

    mean bias as compared with the WB-ET. At times, it would

    FIGURE 4 | Generalized depiction of the piecewise water stress coefﬁcient

    (Ks) function based on average root zone soil water content, as used in Allen

    et al. (1998) and Jensen and Allen (2016).

    be expected that TSEB-ET < WB-ET, even under non-stressed

    conditions, due solely to model variation. This condition would

    result in a decrease of Ks after TSEB-ET incorporation, whether

    such represented reality or not. However, at times when TSEB-

    ET > WB-ET, and the water balance already indicates a Ks < 1;

    mathematically, the soil water depletion can only be decreased

    (soil water content increased) as far as the water stress threshold

    (Figure 4). It is noted that in cases where Ks = 1 and TSEB-

    ET > WB-ET, no adjustment is made (Barker et al., 2018a).

    These challenges led to exclusion of the TSEB-ET in 2018. One

    possible solution for these challenges may be the inclusion of a

    continuous Ks function. For example the relationship of Jensen

    (1970) has been used for similar purposes (Colaizzi et al., 2003,

    Zhang et al., 2017). Another non-linear relationship presented by

    Boonyantharokul and Walker (1979) is also promising because

    the shape could be modiﬁed to account for diﬀerent sensitivity

    to stress in diﬀerent crops as is done in the piecewise method

    used by Allen et al. (1998). A ﬁnal solution may be incorporation

    of ET in parts (evaporation and transpiration) using canopy and

    soil components from the TSEB. This may help better identify

    what ET diﬀerences are truly related to Ks. The Penman Monteith

    formulation of the TSEB has been reported to provide more

    accurate partitioning of ET than original formulations (Colaizzi

    et al., 2014).

    Possible modiﬁcations to the hybrid model aside, the

    discrepancies in scale of the Landsat thermal infrared imagery

    (60–100 m; Bhatti, 2018; USGS, 2019) and our plot size was

    also a reason for dropping the TSEB-ET in 2018. It was evident

    that incorporating the soil water content measurements into the

    SETMI water balance in 2017 prevented what seemed to be a

    likely bias toward a dry modeled root zone. Thus, it was expected

    that without the TSEB-ET, the neutron attenuation data was

    less necessary. Furthermore, the water balance model had not

    previously been tested in this climate for soybean without soil

    water content measurement incorporation, as it has been for

    maize (Barker et al., 2018b).

    One ﬁnal challenge encountered with using the SETMI model

    was the division of Landsat images as being either early or

    late in the season with regards to computing the basal crop

    coeﬃcient time series (see Barker et al., 2018a). In this, images

    either contribute to the increasing portion of the crop coeﬃcient,

    before and up-to peak value, or they contribute to the decreasing

    portion of the crop coeﬃcient after peak. In the case of 2017, the

    best cutoﬀ was not the same for all pixels. For example, if only

    imagery before 21 July 2017 was included in the development

    portion of the season, then crop coeﬃcients were poorly ﬁt for

    ∼13 plots. However, if the cutoﬀ was set to include 21 July 2017 in

    the development portion of the season, all performed reasonably

    well, but some not as well as if 21 July 2017 was forced to be

    late in the season. Ultimately, 21 July 2017 was allowed to be

    a development period image for all plots. The eﬀect was small

    in terms of modeled root zone depletion. Ultimately, the model

    would be improved by adding an optimization routine based on

    goodness of ﬁt to determine the best cutoﬀ date for each pixel.

    Model Performance

    The modeled 1-m average proﬁle soil volumetric water content

    (θp) had a negative mean bias error (MBE) of ∼-0.03 m3 m−3,

    with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of ∼0.04 m3 m−3, in

    2017 (Figure 5). These results may be improved with model

    calibration, including reducing soil evaporation. Assuming a 1.5-

    m root zone did not appreciably improve results for 2017. Model

    performance was improved in 2018 soybean with modeled θp

    for the top 1-m having a MBE < 0.01 m3 m−3 and an RMSE

    ≈ 0.02 m3 m−3. These results represent an improvement over

    results in the same ﬁeld in 2017. Furthermore, these results

    indicate that the water balance model in SETMI is suitable

    for irrigation management under these conditions without the

    periodic incorporation of secondary datasets as was done in

    2017. Assessing the uncertainty associated with using SETMI

    for irrigation management was beyond the scope of this study.

    However, such is acknowledged as a possible source of variability

    and error presented in Figure 5.

    Prescribed Irrigation

    For the 2017 season, the VRI-Full treatment had a range (across

    plots) of 314–375 mm for prescribed gross irrigation depth

    and a range of 304–375 mm for intended prescriptions. When

    comparing treatment means, the total prescribed irrigation

    was essentially the same for the VRI-Full and Uniform-

    Full treatments (353 and 355 mm, respectively; Table 3). The

    mean total intended prescribed irrigation was also similar (351

    and 344 mm for the VRI-Full and Uniform-Full, respectively,

    Table 3). With a 95% conﬁdence interval of the mean of ±

    9 mm for the applied VRI-Full and ± 10 mm for the intended

    VRI-Full, the two treatments were not statistically diﬀerent and

    practically the same. This is logical as both treatments included

    incorporation of neutron attenuation measurements.

    In 2018, total intended gross prescribed irrigation application

    depth ranged from 236 to 277 mm for VRI-Full and 216 to

    241 mm for VRI-Deﬁcit. The range was 246–282 mm for applied

    prescribed gross irrigation for VRI-Full and 221–246 mm for

    VRI-Deﬁcit. In that year total applied prescribed irrigation

    was statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (t = 17.7) for both VRI

    treatments. Both were also diﬀerent from the two uniform

    treatments. Total intended prescribed irrigation was likewise

    diﬀerent for the two VRI treatments (t = 10.2) with only the

    VRI-Full and Uniform-Deﬁcit not being diﬀerent. The greatest

    total intended irrigation depth was 282 mm for Uniform-Full,

    followed by 267 mm for Uniform-Deﬁcit, 265 mm for VRI-Full,

    and 234 mm for VRI-Deﬁcit. Since the uniform treatments had

    no variability in prescribed irrigation, a factorial analysis was

    not performed. However, in both cases intended full irrigation

    was greater than deﬁcit (31 mm greater in the case of VRI

    and 15 mm greater in the case of Uniform). Likewise, intended

    VRI was less than Uniform with Full being 17 mm less and

    Deﬁcit being 33 mm less. It is possible that model bias (Figure 5;

    which was from the ﬁnal analysis, but is still illustrative) may

    have biased the VRI treatments. This could potentially have the

    impact of increasing prescribed irrigation for the VRI treatments.

    It is evident that under our study conditions, adoption of

    VRI based upon reduced water withdrawal alone may not be

    justiﬁable, agreeing with the ﬁndings of Lo et al. (2016), and

    Barker et al. (2018b). Justiﬁcation for VRI would need to include

    other beneﬁts, e.g., changes in yield, lower cost of production

    or reduced nutrient leaching (Lo, 2015; Lo et al., 2016). The

    late imposition of treatments (i.e., the VRI treatments were

    irrigated similar to the Uniform during the ﬁrst portion of

    both years) may also have reduced potential diﬀerences. This

    may particularly be the case for the deﬁcit irrigated soybean

    treatments in 2019, which may have responded diﬀerently had

    the diﬀerent treatments been imposed from the beginning of the

    irrigation season. Furthermore, the Landsat shortwave imagery

    resolution (30 m; USGS, 2019) may limit the ability to address

    the soil and other variability within the study ﬁeld. This may

    have a smoothing eﬀect that may reduce potential beneﬁts of VRI.

    Concurrent research is investigating unmanned aircraft systems

    as a source of high-resolution imagery for VRI management

    with SETMI (Bhatti, 2018). However, the practical management

    scale of VRI may be similar in scale to Landsat as discussed by

    Barker et al. (2018a).

    VRI Full and Deﬁcit Irrigation

    FIGURE 6 | Total gross intended irrigation vs. AWC and ETc for VRI-Full plots
    included in the ﬁnal analysis for 2017 maize VRI-Full treatment.

    Irrigation Variability

    The intent of VRI is to manage irrigation at a sub-ﬁeld scale

    to account for sub-ﬁeld scale heterogeneity. In the framework

    of the procedure and modeling used in this study, VRI would

    be anticipated to respond to conditions when spatial variability

    exists for root zone AWC and/or ETc. The total intended

    prescribed irrigation was compared for these two variables for

    each VRI plot included in the ﬁnal analysis. In 2017, the

    correlation between total intended gross irrigation depth and

    AWC was negative, as expected, but it was poor (R2 = 0.26, n

    = 18; Figure 6). The poor correlation is likely a result of the

    hybrid model adjustments to the water balance, which were also

    responsible for much of the model drift. In 2018, the correlation

    between total intended gross irrigation depth and AWC was

    similarly poor (R2 = 0.37, n = 6, for VRI-Full; R2 = 0.10, n

    = 4, for VRI-Deﬁcit). The prescribed irrigation depth would be

    expected to be highly correlated with AWC under conditions of

    large AWC variability in situations where diﬀerences in rainfall

    storage capacity across soils may be mined (e.g., Lo et al., 2016),

    as may have been expected for 2018, but this was not observed.

    Scale discrepancies between the SETMI modeled scale, which

    was dependent upon Landsat imagery resolution (30 m; USGS,

    2019) and Landsat pixel positioning, and soil variability may have

    also contributed. There was a poor positive correlation between

    intended gross irrigation and ETc (R2 = 0.12; Figure 6) in 2017.

    In 2018 there was a stronger correlation between total intended

    gross irrigation and ETc for both VRI treatments (R2 = 0.69, n

    = 6, for VRI-Full; R2 = 0.55, n = 4, for VRI-Deﬁcit), suggesting

    that variability in ETc was a major driver in 2018. Despite the

    small dataset, the results of the ETc correlations for 2018 may be

    better than 2017 because the ﬁnal ETc values are close to those

    used in irrigation scheduling for 2018, but in 2017 irrigation

    management, the model was updated with other data sources,

    which may have reduced correlation. Attempts to ﬁnd correlation

    between intended gross irrigation and the product and quotient

    of ETc and AWC generally yielded poor results. The ﬁeld has

    variability in ETc even in the VRI-Full treatment, which is a

    response derived from the Landsat imagery and soil properties.

    Yield and Soil Water Storage Response

    In both years, dry grain yield was similar between all included

    treatments (F = 0.03, p = 0.87 in 2017; F = 0.00, p = 0.96 for

    VRI/Uniform and F = 0.01, p = 0.93 for Full/Deﬁcit in 2018).

    Estimated mean maize grain yield was both statistically and

    practically similar between treatments with 8.91 Mg ha−1 for the

    VRI-Full in 2017 and 8.98 Mg ha−1 for Uniform-Full (Table 4).

    Variability was, however, notable with 95% conﬁdence intervals

    of the estimated means being ± 6 and ±8% of the estimated

    mean for the VRI-Full and Uniform-Full, respectively. In 2018,

    the dry grain yield was statistically similar between all treatments

    ranging from 3.33 Mg ha−1 for Uniform-Full to 3.10 Mg ha−1

    for Uniform-Deﬁcit. However, the variability was substantial,

    ranging from 19% of the estimated mean for Uniform-Full to 24%

    for the VRI-Deﬁcit. This is also notable in the apparent reversal

    of expected response for the VRI-Full and VRI-Deﬁcit treatments

    (3.11 Mg ha-1 and 3.29 Mg ha-1, respectively; Table 4). However,

    it must be remembered that because of the variance of the data,

    these values are statistically the same; thus any conjecture about

    apparent diﬀerences is not valid. It is possible that response

    variance is being induced by the soil variability beyond what is

    captured in the AWC blocking and modeling scale.

    Not only did the irrigation treatments not have a signiﬁcant

    impact on yield, there were also no signiﬁcant diﬀerences

    between treatments for the DP-related variables (1SWS, DP,

    and 1SWS+DP; Table 4). In 2017, 1SWS was similar for both

    treatments (−23 and −20 mm for the VRI-Full and Uniform-

    Full, respectively). 1SWS is presented as a depth-weighted

    average down to 1 m for the last neutron attenuation reading

    minus ﬁrst neutron attenuation reading (Table 2). When deeper

    neutron attenuation values were included, down to 1.52 m, the

    magnitudes increased, but were similar (VRI-Full = −35 mm,

    Uniform-Full = −36 mm; in these deep estimates, three

    additional plots were eliminated because of missing deep neutron

    attenuation readings as compared with the data in Table 4). In

    2017, estimated DP was likewise similar between treatments and

    was practically negligible < 1 mm for both treatments, though the

    diﬀerence was determined to be statistically signiﬁcant.

    mm [±8 mm] and Deﬁcit = 20 mm [±7 mm].

    We acknowledge that the estimates for the DP-related

    variables are dependent upon the water balance; during the

    period of 2 June−13 November 2017 the total precipitation was

    241 mm with an estimated 4 mm of runoﬀ using the NRCS

    Runoﬀ Equation (NRCS, 2004) with a curve number of 80.

    In computing DP, the SETMI water balance was executed

    for each plot with the initial soil water content condition on

    1 June 2017 taken from neutron attenuation readings. The

    mean total modeled ETc between 2 June and 13 November

    2017 ranged from 567 to 572 mm for the two treatments. The

    corresponding ETa determined from the water balance was

    548 mm (VRI-Full) and 544 mm (Uniform-Full), a 19–28 mm

    diﬀerence. This diﬀerence could have been reduced by further

    dampening the surface soil evaporation rate in SETMI or by

    reducing the water stress threshold or modifying soil properties;

    however the apparent error was ∼5% or less and we deemed

    these adjustments not justiﬁable. Interestingly, the diﬀerences in

    applied irrigation did not translate into meaningful diﬀerences in

    ET, DP, or 1SWS.

    Results for 2018 were similar to 2017, despite the diﬀerences

    in crops, SETMI methodologies, and the inclusion of the deﬁcit

    treatments. The 1SWS ranged from 8 mm (deﬁcit treatments) to

    17 mm for the VRI-Full. 1SWS is presented as a depth weighted

    average down to 1 m. When deeper neutron attenuation values

    were included, down to 1.22 m (many measurement tubes were

    not suﬃciently deep for the 1.52 m readings), the magnitudes

    were practically and statistically similar (5 mm for the deﬁcit

    treatments, 10 mm for Uniform-Full, and 15 mm for VRI-Full).

    In 2018, estimated DP ranged from 5 mm for VRI-Deﬁcit to

    22 mm for Uniform-Full. Signiﬁcant full/deﬁcit factor main

    eﬀects were found (F = 5.91, p = 0.03) for 1SWS+DP, with full

    treatments being 31 mm and deﬁcit being 20 mm (Table 4). Thus,

    deﬁcit irrigation had a small impact on DP potential.

    With respect to water balance, the 2018 DP estimates were

    computed for the period of 10 July−25 September 2018. The

    total precipitation was 125 mm during this period with an

    estimated 16 mm of runoﬀ (computed as in 2017). In 2018,

    the ETa computed as a residual of the water balance ranged

    from 279 mm (VRI-Deﬁcit) to 299 mm (Uniform-Full), with

    no signiﬁcant diﬀerences. The SETMI modeled ETc had less

    treatment variability ranging from 300 mm (VRI-Deﬁcit) to

    305 mm (Uniform-Deﬁcit), again with no signiﬁcant diﬀerences.

    The net diﬀerence between ETa and ETc ranged from 5 mm

    (Uniform-Full) to 21 mm (VRI-Deﬁcit), diﬀerences < 8% of

    ETa. Again, we feel that SETMI performed adequately and

    that the results did not justify further model adjustments in

    computing DP.

    While there was some diﬀerence in irrigation in 2018,

    there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in dry grain yield or ET.

    Interestingly, even the deﬁcit-irrigated treatments where such

    an eﬀect might be expected, did not result in a signiﬁcant yield

    diﬀerence. Part of the cause may be that the deﬁcit treatments

    were eﬀectively not implemented until mid-August (see the

    Treatments section). However, Doss et al. (1974) found that

    stressing soybean in late pod-ﬁll was more consistent at causing

    a yield reduction than when stress occurred only earlier in

    the season. Moreover, the deﬁcit treatment experienced the

    greatest managed stress around the end pod-ﬁll stage and later.

    One ﬁnal observation is that yield and ET in this ﬁeld may

    both be highly governed by nutrient availability in consequence

    of the light soils (T.H. Lo, UNL, personal communication).

    Future work should seek to quantify possible nutrient stress.

    VRI Full and Deﬁcit Irrigation

    Even though the treatments did not have diﬀerent ET, there

    was the 12 mm diﬀerence in DP potential as represented by

    1SWS+DP between the full and deﬁcit irrigated treatments.

    This diﬀerence corresponds closely to the diﬀerence in applied

    irrigation between the full and deﬁcit irrigated treatments

    (12 mm for VRI and 28 mm for uniform). This supports the

    hypothesis that VRI is unlikely to reduce consumptive use;

    however it may reduce deep percolation. In stating this, it should

    be remembered that all treatments were treated similarly in the

    ﬁrst portion of both seasons. This may have dampened some of

    the potential responses.

    CONCLUSIONS

    Ultimately, the results support the conclusion that, under our

    study conditions, VRI managed with SETMI resulted in a

    relatively small, nominal reduction in water withdrawn in 2018

    as compared to uniform treatments; however no diﬀerence was

    observed in 2017. These results are subject to model performance,

    scale, and treatment implementation. Furthermore, irrigation

    treatments did not result in diﬀerences in grain yield. It is

    evident that any variability accounted for in the VRI management

    did not result in corresponding detectable changes in yield.

    Likewise, few statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found in

    estimated deep percolation, modeled or water balance measured

    evapotranspiration, change in soil water storage in the top 1 m

    of the proﬁle, or the sum of these latter two variables between

    any treatments in either year. More testing should be performed

    to demonstrate the utility of SETMI for deﬁcit irrigation

    management. The performance of the SETMI water balance

    model in 2018 was promising, as it was executed unaided by on-

    site measurements beyond weather data, FC, and WP. Testing

    over longer periods and varied conditions is necessary to fully

    test that utility. The temporal and spatial scale of Landsat data

    was a concern (especially thermal imagery); alternate satellite

    data products and/or unmanned aircraft imagery may address

    this problem. The proposed modiﬁcations to SETMI, including

    optimization of the basal crop coeﬃcient development, inclusion

    of a non-linear Ks function, and partitioning TSEB-ET, may also

    improve model performance.

    irrigation. Abstract. Accurate generation of spatial soil water maps is useful
    for many types of irrigation management. A hybrid remote sensing evapotranspiration
    (ET) model combining reflectance-based basal crop coefficients (Kcbrf) and a two-source
    energy balance (TSEB) model was modified and validated for use in real-time irrigation
    management. We modeled spatial ET for maize and soybean fields in eastern Nebraska
    for the 2011-2013 growing seasons. We used Landsat 5, 7, and 8 imagery as remote
    sensing inputs. In the TSEB, we used the Priestly-Taylor (PT) approximation for
    canopy latent heat flux, as in the original model formulations. We also used the
    Penman-Monteith (PM) approximation for comparison. We compared energy balance
    fluxes and computed ET with measurements from three eddy covariance systems within
    the study area. Net radiation was underestimated by the model when data from a
    local weather station were used as input, with mean bias error (MBE) of -33.8
    to -40.9 W m-2. The measured incident solar radiation appeared to be biased low.
    The net radiation model performed more satisfactorily when data from the eddy
    covariance flux towers were input into the model, with MBE of 5.3 to 11.2 W m-2.
    We removed bias in the daily energy balance ET using a dimensionless multiplier
    that ranged from 0.89 to 0.99. The bias-corrected TSEB ET, using weather data
    from a local weather station and with local ground data in thermal infrared imagery
    corrections, had MBE = 0.09 mm d-1 (RMSE = 1.49 mm d-1) for PM and MBE = 0.04
    mm d-1 (RMSE = 1.18 mm d-1) for PT. The hybrid model used statistical interpolation
    to combine the two ET estimates. We computed weighting factors for statistical
    interpolation to be 0.37 to 0.50 for the PM method and 0.56 to 0.64 for the PT
    method. Provisions were added to the model, including a real-time crop coefficient
    methodology, which allowed seasonal crop coefficients to be computed with relatively
    few remote sensing images. This methodology performed well when compared to basal
    crop coefficients computed using a full season of input imagery. Water balance
    ET compared favorably with the eddy covariance data after incorporating the TSEB
    ET. For a validation dataset, the magnitude of MBE decreased from -0.86 mm d-1
    (RMSE = 1.37 mm d-1) for the Kcbrf alone to -0.45 mm d-1 (RMSE = 0.98 mm d-1)
    and -0.39 mm d-1 (RMSE = 0.95 mm d-1) with incorporation of the TSEB ET using
    the PM and PT methods, respectively. However, the magnitudes of MBE and RMSE were
    increased for a running average of daily computations in the full May-October
    periods. The hybrid model did not necessarily result in improved model performance.
    However, the water balance model is adaptable for real-time irrigation scheduling
    and may be combined with forecasted reference ET, although the low temporal frequency
    of satellite imagery is expected to be a challenge in real-time irrigation management.

    Abstract: In this demo, a novel underground communication system and an online
    underground sensor network testbed is demonstrated. The underground communication
    system, developed in the Cyber-physical Networking (CPN) Laboratory at the University
    of Nebraska-Lincoln, includes an underground antenna that is tailored to mitigate
    the adverse effects of soil on underground communication. An online connection
    is established with the CPN underground sensor network testbed that is located
    at Clay Center, Nebraska. The underground sensor network testbed consists of a
    network of underground communication systems equipped with soil moisture sensors
    and a mobile data harvesting unit equipped with cellular communication capabilities.
    Real-time soil moisture data delivery from Nebraska to Korea is demonstrated.

    (South) SECTION I. Introduction Excessive, wasted water has prompted the creation
    of the Top 10 Water Challenges of Nebraska [9]. Approximately 70% of the world''s
    water usage is related to agriculture [8], thus, more efficient irrigation solutions
    promise a large benefit for farmers, consumers and the environment. The demand
    for reducing water consumption encourages development of precision agriculture
    (PA) techniques, which focus on the existence of in-field variability of natural
    components, including chemical leaching, runoff, drainage, water content, nutrients,
    and soil components [3], [4]. One of the examples of PA is the Variable Rate Irrigation
    (VRI) system from Valmont Industries [10], which controls the irrigation rate
    at different zones in a field. This system allows for the flow of each sprinkler
    head to be adjusted, which gives a virtual dartboard of control, where each cell
    can get as much or little water as needed. Thus timing and amount of irrigation
    can be controlled across a field. Precision irrigation hardware techniques are
    already developed, but determination of the exact amount of water needed in a
    zone of field is the main challenge. Currently, fields are analyzed only once,
    and irrigation systems are programmed according to these results [1]. However,
    due to the fact that the environment is highly variable and unpredictable [5],
    a real-time system to monitor the soil and control the irrigation system has the
    potential to yield even greater water savings. Current research in this area suggests
    promising results. In [11], the effect of using a wireless sensor network to aid
    in irrigation is examined. Their approach uses a permanent aboveground wireless
    sensor networks (WSN) deployed in a field. This allows for real-time soil moisture
    collection. A portion of the field was watered using traditional means, the other
    half was watered adaptively using the data collected by the WSN. The goal of this
    experiment is to keep soil moisture tension (which is related to how well crops
    can absorb moisture) in an optimal range. The results of the experiment showed
    that the adaptive half of the field stayed within range more often than the control
    half, rarely going beyond the set threshold. However, the aboveground motes are
    susceptible to destruction by farm equipment. In addition, soil moisture sensors
    need to be installed early in the growing season and need to be removed before
    harvest, adding additional time and labor requirements. Fig. 1: Overview of the
    system: aboveground motes attached to the center-pivot collect and relay soil
    moisture messages from underground motes to the base station. Show All In our
    previous research, we examed the usage of wireless underground sensor networks
    (WUSNs) to monitor the soil qualities, especially soil moisture to facilitate
    PA [2], [7]. These networks consist of wirelessly-connected underground sensor
    nodes that communicate through soil. For the autonomous PA, WUSNs provide an adaptable
    and efficient cyber-physical system (CPS) that provides timely information of
    the soil condition with high granularity [6]. Compared with satellites and aerial
    remote sensing, WUSNs can provide more direct and precise information about some
    of the soil conditions. In addition, the operation cost of WUSNs is far less than
    these other techniques [11]. Unlike wired sensor networks, which need to be deployed
    and removed frequently during the process of planting, WUSNs are deployed in the
    ground at a safe depth and do not interfere with agriculture machinery operations,
    such as tillage practices. In this demonstration, we describe a system that collects
    soil moisture information in a field and relays data to a control system through
    cellular phone network. Thus, the soil moisture status of the field is provided
    to the farmers in real-time. The cellular network is employed in our system due
    to its highly availability such that no further infrastructure is needed. The
    implementation details are presented in Section II and the demonstration is provided
    in Section III, followed by conclusions in Section IV. SECTION II. Implementation
    In the demonstration, an aboveground mote on a center-pivot irrigation system
    is employed to collect the real-time data via a WUSN and the information is relayed
    to the base station through short message service (SMS) messages (a.k.a. text
    messages). In the envisioned system, the data collected at the base station are
    utilized to control the speed of the center-pivot, and thus, adjust the irrigated
    water. This concept is shown in Fig. 1. The interface between the mote and the
    center-pivot is: Mote to SMS (text messaging) SMS to center-pivot controller The
    first part of the interface uses a Mica2 mote connected to a GSM (Cellular) radio.
    The base station mote facilitates this communication and translation. The second
    part receives SMS messages and forward them to the center-pivot''s controller.
    This portion is often implemented by center-pivot manufacturers or controller
    add-ons. Though in our demonstration the data are displayed but the center-pivot
    is not controlled, the system interfaces with any controller that will accept
    SMS control. In this section, the implementation of the system is described in
    detail. The hardware is introduced in Section II-A and the program procedure is
    introduced in Section II-B. A. Hardware The hardware of the system includes WSN
    motes, soil moisture sensors and cellular modems. In our system, Mica2 motes are
    employed as the sensor mote platform. For the underground motes, a soil moisture
    sensor is connected to each mote. The readings of the sensor are obtained via
    a GPIO port of Mica2. The hardware for the aboveground motes and base station
    mote is shown in Fig. 2. In addition to the Mica2 mote, a GSM chip is employed
    for the SMS message communication. A custom printed circuit board (PCB) was created
    to interface the two devices (Mica2 mote and GSM chip), as well as power each
    devices at the appropriate voltage. As shown in our previous study [2], antenna
    design is imperative to the success of WUSN applications. In our system, A Yagi
    antenna is adapted for the aboveground mote due to its high directivity (10 dB).
    For the underground motes, an underground antenna is specifically designed for
    our application. This antenna has good performance over a wide range of soil moisture
    levels. Fig. 2: The aboveground mote with Mica2 and the GSM chip. Show All B.
    Program Procedure The program of the system deals with mote-to-mote communications
    to collect soil moisture data, converting soil moisture values to center-pivot
    control commands and Sending SMS messages. 1) Mote to Mote Message Aboveground
    Mica2 motes set on the center-pivot act as relay nodes. They gather soil moisture
    readings from underground motes via TinyOS wireless messages and send this information
    to a Mica2 base station mote via SMS messages. Due to the characteristics of the
    underground-to-aboveground channel, the communication distance between the underground
    sensor motes and the aboveground relay nodes is limited [2]. However, the GSM
    module on the relay motes can relay the messages to a very long distance. 2) Moisture
    to Speed Conversion As the base station mote receives moisture updates, it can
    decide on a more appropriate travelling speed of the center-pivot, which determines
    the irrigation rate. This can be implemented by a lookup table (or conversion
    equation) that is preprogrammed at this mote. 3) Mote to SMS Messages Every time
    a new speed is chosen by the base station mote, an SMS message is sent to the
    controller of the center-pivot. These messages would be formated using the application
    programming interface (API) provided by the manufacturer. Direction is also included,
    either clockwise or counterclockwise. SECTION III. Demonstration Our experiments
    are carried out in the South Central Agricultural Laboratory (SCAL) of University
    of Nebraska-Lincoln at Clay Center, Nebraska. As shown in Fig. 3, underground
    sensor motes are buried in a corn field. The burial depth is chosen to be 0.4
    m so that the machinery operations will not destroy the motes. An aboveground
    relay mote is employed on the center-pivot. The mote, with its Yagi antenna, is
    shown in Fig. 4. The SMS messages sent by the aboveground mote are received at
    the base station and stored in a database. Fig. 3: The setup of the demonstration.
    Show All Fig. 4: An aboveground mote attached to the center-pivot. Show All During
    the experiments, the underground motes work according to a duty cycle. Each mote
    sleeps for a period of T s before waking up to take a soil moisture sample. The
    soil moisture value is written to the flash memory of the mote. In the meantime,
    The underground mote remains active for a period of T a to listen to the request
    from the aboveground mote. If there is no request in T a , the underground mote
    turns off its radio and switch to sleeping mode. When the center-pivot operates
    in the field, the aboveground mote sends out requests periodically as the center-pivot
    moves towards underground motes. The interval of the requests, T r is much smaller
    than T a so that the underground mote can receive at least one request when it
    is active and the aboveground mote is in its communication range. After receiving
    the request, the underground mote first replies to the aboveground mote to establish
    the communication. Then, it reads its flash memory and sends all of the soil moisture
    recordings to the aboveground mote. Since sending SMS messages is slower than
    receiving data messages from the underground mote, a buffer is implemented at
    the aboveground mote to temporarily store the received messages. These messages
    are then sent out as SMS messages via the GSM module. Fig. 5: The display of the
    soil moisture results. Show All At the base station, the SMS messages are parsed
    and the soil moisture values are stored in a database and displayed on a chart.
    The display is shown in Fig. 5. SECTION IV. Conclusions Being able to dynamically
    control a center pivot irrigation system allows for a wireless underground sensor
    network to actuate on the environment. The system presented here fits into the
    larger, autonomous irrigation system by implementing a wireless connection between
    WUSN motes and a center pivot irrigation system with an SMS enabled controller.
    Demonstrations carried out show that by adapting proper APls with the center-pivot,
    the system is feasible. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Italy SECTION I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) [15] and the billions
    of sensors that will be deployed in the next decade [5], as well as novel associated
    technological breakthroughs, have been enabling the emergence of a new breed of
    smart applications and services for the benefic or our society in different domains
    or verticals, such as smart farming, smart cities, smart healthcare and smart
    industries. Building interoperable IoT services and applications requires a set
    of middleware components and system development, deployment and operation tools
    and platforms, In order to avoid developing extremely focused and vertical IoT
    applications not able to interact with other applications, common and generic
    middleware services used by different application domains become necessary. The
    widespread availability of IoT-based applications requires adequate platforms
    for both development and operation phases. The former for releasing developers
    from the need of mastering different technologies outside their core business
    and that do not add value to the process [7]. The latter for freeing organizations
    from the need of deploying and testing customized platforms for supporting the
    operation of IoT-based applications. There are some IoT platforms available today,
    both open source and proprietary [4]. There is a tradeoff in the deployment of
    such platforms, which traditionally are hosted in cloud datacenters, but are slowly
    considered to be partially moved to edge infrastructure closer to the users, which
    is known as fog computing [2]. Although many IoT platforms exist today, the arena
    is not clear regarding the suitability of them for the different deployment scenarios
    for different smart applications. IoT tools and platforms must provide an end-to-end
    treatment for the data path, since data is generated by sensors, transmitted to
    the storage place, processed by smart algorithms, decisions are made, which fire
    actions that are finally forwarded to actuators as commands aimed at changing
    some configuration. Also, scalability is a major concern for IoT platforms. It
    has been shown that different architectural choices of IoT platforms affect system
    scalability and that automatic real time decision-making is feasible in an environment
    composed of dozens of thousands of sensors continuously transmitting data [16].
    Currently, there is no scalable de facto open IoT platform but the European Commission
    is pushing FIWARE to fill this gap. The SWAMP project develops and assesses an
    IoT-based smart water management platform for precision irrigation in agriculture
    with a hands-on approach that focuses on pilots in Italy, Spain and Brazil [9].
    The same underlying platform can be customized to different pilots considering
    different countries, climate, soil, and crops. The SWAMP platform may be implemented
    in a range of deployment configurations involving both cloud and fog environments.
    In this paper, we analyze the performance of FIWARE under different platform configurations
    comparing fog/cloud and cloud-only scenarios for precision irrigation using one
    of the SWAMP pilots as the evaluation scenario. Experiments consisted simulated
    sensors sending messages to FIWARE, deployed both in a fog/cloud and a cloud-only
    configuration mode. We performed experiments with a large number of probes simultaneously
    sending messages to the platform, in order to verify and understand it scalability.
    Security and privacy aspects are key components for making it possible to emergence
    of a true market for such IoT platforms for precision irrigation, such as SWAMP
    [8]. However, these aspects have not been evaluated here since they are outside
    the scope of this paper that focuses on performance and scalability of the FIWARE
    Platform when configured for the needs of SWAMP. Our results reveal interesting
    and non-intuitive outcomes, such as, that fog computing does not always improve
    the overall system performance. In some cases, the addition of a fog processing
    nodes even proved to worsen the performance. An important and unexpected factor
    in the experiments was the impact of the network. Initially, we believed that
    the network would equally impact both configurations (fog/cloud and cloud-only).
    However, the impact was much higher in the fog/cloud configuration. In the remainder
    of the paper, section II presents background and related work. Section III introduces
    SWAMP and the two scenarios for the MATOPIBA pilot. Section IV provides a detailed
    view of research design and methods. The key results are presented in section
    V, followed by discussion of lessons learned in section VI. Finally, section VII
    draws some conclusions and propose relevant future work. SECTION II. Background
    and Related Work This section introduces related background and related work.
    A. IoT and Fog Computing Fog computing is a fairly new paradigm aimed at dealing
    with challenges related to the huge amount of data that inevitably will be generated
    with the increasing utilization of IoT-based systems [2]. It solves serious problems
    such as decreasing latency from real time applications, decreasing data traffic
    between the network edge and core, and softening the processing burden of the
    cloud by performing load balancing. The metaphor comes from the fact that fog
    is a cloud but closer to the ground and to the people [13]. The fog is based on
    a highly virtualized platform that provides computing, storage and communication
    services between users and the datacenter where the cloud is hosted [1], by bringing
    services from the cloud closer to the users. Since its inception the fog has been
    envisioned for operating together with the cloud for making it possible to implement
    IoT-based smart applications. In other words, fog and IoT are related yet independent
    concepts, as the fog can deal with a broader variety of applications and IoT does
    need the fog to come true. A new technological trend that has been used for implementing
    the fog is container-based virtualization that provides a lightweight alternative
    to the traditional hypervisors [12]. Containers do not emulate the underlying
    hardware. Rather, the virtualized OS communicates directly with the host OS, which
    makes the appropriate calls to the real hardware. Lightweight virtualization minimizes
    the use of computational resources of the host machine, since there is no need
    to duplicate the operating system. B. The FIWARE Platform The FIWARE platform
    (fiware.org) has been attraction general attention for being a worldwide open
    source solution fostered and funded by the European Commission under Horizon 2020
    program. It is comprised of a series of software components called Generic Enablers
    (GE) that perform functions needed in a different variety of IoT-based applications
    for smart societies, focusing in cities, farming, industry, healthcare and sustainability.
    GEs can be used to build different applications that exchange information through
    a REST API following the OMA NGSI standard (openmobilealliance.org/release/NGSI),
    based on JSON. The central aspect of the FIWARE NGSI Context Management information
    model is the concept of entities and their attributes. Among the many GEs available
    by the FIWARE, some are considered the key enablers for smart applications. Here
    we only introduce the ones cited and used in our paper. Orion Context Broker:
    Orion is a publish/subscribe context broker, which makes it the main FIWARE GE
    and the heart of the platform. Orion provides an interface where clients can register
    entities and their attributes as well as producers/consumers of those entities.
    Orion only stores the latest version of entity attributes and it needs to work
    together with other GEs or applications in order to maintain historical data.
    Orion is available in fiware-orion.readthedocs.io. IDAS and IoT Agents: IDAS is
    an implementation of the Device Backend Management GE that comprises many IoT
    Agents that map data coming from sensors and going to actuators to the FIWARE
    NGSI information model to be stored in Orion and further processed by other GEs
    or external applications. Since low power sensors do not possess computing, storage
    and transmission capabilities for speaking NGSI, they use different IoT protocols
    such as MQTT, CoAP, Ultralight or LoRaWAN transport, which are converted into/from
    NGSI by IoT Agents. IDAS is available in catalogueserver.fiware.org/enablers/backend-device-managementidas.
    STH Comet: Short Time Historic, also known as Comet, works with Orion storing
    entity data as a time series that can be further used by applications or other
    GEs. STH Comet is available in fiware-sth-comet.readthedocs.io. The use of FIWARE
    by any organization or developer involves the installation of its GEs in an appropriate
    infrastructure where it can run, which might be standalone machines, public clouds
    or preferentially a private cloud using the OpenStack cloud manager. FIWARE has
    been used as a computing platform for many IoT-based applications, such as farming
    and environment [14]. Also, many large scale projects use FIWARE for IoT in agriculture,
    such as IoF2020 (iof2020.eu), as well as startups such as Breeze (breeze-technologies.de),
    Hop Ubiquitous (hopu.eu) and Agricolus (agricolus.com). C. Related Work Scalability
    is a major concern for IoT platforms. Numbers vary but in general it is forecasted
    that in the beginning of the 2020’s there will be about 30 billion connected devices
    [5]. It has been shown that different architectural choices of IoT platforms affect
    system scalability and that automatic real time decision-making is feasible in
    an environment composed of dozens of thousands of sensors continuously transmitting
    data [16]. The performance of FIWARE has been calling the attention its user community.
    A comprehensive study that proposes qualitative and quantitative metrics and evaluates
    the performance of various IoT platforms is presented by da Cruz et al. (2018)
    [4]. From 11 platforms analyzed by the qualitative approach, 5 were selected for
    the quantitative performance analysis, including FIWARE. However, since they adopted
    a generic approach, they did not go into the specifics of FIWARE-only a single
    Orion + STH platform configuration was considered – and they did not evaluate
    different infrastructures (as fog computing). Martínez et al. (2016) [11] gives
    a detailed description of the architecture of a testbed of the FIWARE platform
    configured for the precision agriculture domain, which differs from our approach,
    because their test application connects directly to FIWARE using NGSI JSON interface,
    while we included an IoT Agent for MQTT using a scalable IoT sensor simulator
    for generating synthetic data. Lastly, Cardoso et al. (2017) [3] compared the
    performance of FIWARE and their own implementation of ETSI M2M, under different
    running conditions, which makes it difficult to understand the tradeoffs of each
    platform. In this paper, we differ from previous work by evaluating five configurations
    of FIWARE and focusing on the scenarios of smart irrigation in agriculture from
    the SWAMP project [9]. SECTION III. Smart Water Management Platform The primary
    objective of the SWAMP project is to develop IoT based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in precision irrigation domain and to pilot them in
    four places, two pilots in Europe (Italy and Spain) and two pilots in Brazil [9],
    more information can be found in swampproject.org. Also, it is aimed at improving
    precision irrigation by increasing the awareness of the condition of the crop,
    by monitoring the field based on crop status and environment, and to adjust the
    irrigation prescription map accordingly. A. SWAMP Pilots The four SWAMP pilots
    are based on the similar technical solutions and deal with different crops and
    have different primary goals. CBEC Pilot (Bologna/Italy): the main objective of
    the Consorzio di Bonifica Emilia Centrale (CBEC) pilot is optimizing water distribution
    to the farms. Intercrop Pilot (Cartagena/Spain): Intercrop Iberica addresses several
    challenges since production is in a dry area and its primary goal is making a
    rational use of water. Guaspari Pilot (Espírito Santo do Pinhal / Brazil): The
    Guaspari Winery transfers the wine grape harvesting to the winter season (June-August)
    using irrigation techniques. The main goal for Guaspari is improving wine quality.
    MATOPIBA Pilot (Barreiras/Brazil): The Rio das Pedras Farm is located in the MATOPIBA
    region, and irrigation is mostly performed by center pivots. The main pilot goal
    is to implement and evaluate a smart irrigation system based on Variable Rate
    Irrigation (VRI) for center pivots in soybean production and save energy used
    in irrigation. The SWAMP project is developing a high-precision smart irrigation
    system concept for agriculture. The fundamental idea is to enable optimizations
    of irrigation, water distribution, and consumption based on a holistic analysis
    that collects information from all aspects of the system including even the natural
    water cycle and the cumulated knowledge related to growing particular plants.
    It results in savings to all parties as it guarantees the availability of water
    in situations where water supply is limited and also prevents over- and under-irrigation.
    A fundamental idea in SWAMP is to facilitate the replication of water management
    systems built on top of its platform with minimum redesign and redevelopment.
    Different layers of the architecture have components that are more generic and
    thus less difficult to be ported to other pilots, whereas others are more application-specific
    and thus require new development efforts whenever a new pilot is conceived. B.
    SWAMP MATOPIBA Scenario In this paper we will evaluate the performance of FIWARE
    when configured for the SWAMP MATOPIBA scenario depicted in Fig. 1 , which represents
    the center-pivot with variable-rate irrigation pilot. The scenario captures both
    the farm and SWAMP Platform viewpoints and represents a future vision and not
    the current situation. A center pivot irrigates a circular agricultural plot of
    100 hectares that alternates soybeans and cotton. The plot is further divided
    into different management zones, identified before the crop season and based on
    differences in the soil properties. Two general types of sensors collect data
    for the SWAMP system: a) stationary sensors within the soil at the root system
    depth that continuously measure metrics such as temperature and moisture, and;
    b) drones acting as flying sensors equipped with thermal/multispectral cameras
    or working as data mules by collecting sensor data and transmitting to the farm’s
    office. The center pivot is electrified to make it able to control the variable
    rate irrigation sprinklers (actuators) and thus it can also be equipped with processing
    and communication capabilities. No special energy harvesting is predicted for
    the sensing devices. We developed multiparametric probes for soil sensing, which
    include moisture, temperature and electrical conductivity sensors at three depths
    from the soil surface. Sampling and transmission rates will be adjusted from a
    few minutes up to hours, according to the time of the day and the application
    requirements. This way, the probe sensing electronics combined with ZigBee or
    LoRaWAN will be powered by extended lifespan batteries. The key difference between
    Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) is that the former includes a distributed fog/cloud configuration
    of the platform whereas the latter is solely based on the cloud for hosting all
    software components. Depending on different variables - such as farmers interest,
    availability of infrastructure, intended responsiveness to delay, robustness to
    disconnections, and cost/effectiveness – one or the other scenario may be more
    or less appropriate. For the MATOPIBA pilot, the preferred solution is the fog-based
    one, for providing autonomous processing capacity to the farm as it is located
    in a region where Internet connections may suffer periods of instability. Anyway,
    we evaluate both approaches because the cloud-based one might be used as well.
    In Fig. 1(a) both the center pivot and drones are deemed Field Fog Nodes (FFN)
    for the SWAMP architecture. Notably, the FFN at the center pivot acts as a sensor
    aggregation point and as a distributor of actuator commands received from the
    SWAMP system. FFNs communicate with the nearest fixed attachment point of the
    SWAMP platform, which usually is an on-premises Typically, when sensors are powered
    with LoRaWAN, the FFN will host the LoRaWAN Gateway and possibly the LoRaWAN Server
    and other supplementary features. The Fog Hub is located in the farm’s office.
    SWAMP allows FFNs to communicate directly with the platform running in the cloud,
    whenever this is the preferred deployment choice. The FFNs send data directly
    to the SWAMP platform located in the Fog Hub at the farm’s offices via different
    wireless technologies, which in Fig. 1(a) is WiFi. For this scenario, the functions
    performed by the SWAMP architecture are divided up into local fog and remote cloud
    components. Heavy processing, such as irrigation models and analytics using smart
    algorithms (i.e., machine learning), is performed in the cloud. External information
    is fed to the platform, such as crop yield models, meteorological data and historical
    data. On the other hand, Fig. 1(b) depicts a scenario where no fog is available
    and data generated by sensors are sent directly to the cloud via a typical cellular
    technology that might be 3G/4G or even NB-IoT. Fig. 1. SWAMP MATOPIBA scenario;
    a) Fog-cloud; b) Cloud-only Show All SECTION IV. Research Design and Methods A.
    Evaluation Scenario and Environment One of the main goals of this paper is to
    compare fog/cloud and cloud-only based approaches for smart water management.
    Therefore, based on the SWAMP MATOPIBA pilot specification ( Section 3), we designed
    a FIWARE-based IoT platform that involves obtaining sensor data values up to the
    point of they are transparently consumed by an application that can be deployed
    in the cloud and/or in the fog. The software modules depicted in Fig.3 and Fig.4
    are implemented by lightweight virtualization of Docker containers, including
    the FIWARE modules, whose container images can easily be obtained in that format.
    The other modules of this scenario are: SenSE: the Sensor Simulating Environment
    (SenSE, is an open-source large-scale IoT sensor data generator able to abstract
    real devices and to model different complex scenarios, such as smart farms [16].
    The tool is a traffic workload generator that emulates a huge number of heterogeneous
    sensors representing tens of thousands of IoT sensors sending data simultaneously
    via a typical IoT protocol (e.g., MQTT). Although the sensors are synthetic, the
    traffic is real. In our scenarios, SenSE generates probe data and represents the
    fog field node that forward sensor data to the platform. The source code can be
    download from github.com/ivanzy/SenSE-Sensor-Simulation-Environment. Mosquitto:
    Eclipse Mosquitto is an open source MQTT message broker. Available in mosquitto.org.
    MongoDB: a document-oriented NoSQL database. Available in mongodb.com. Consumer:
    Consumer is a special purpose Express.js web application that subscribes in Orion
    and receives sensor data from the probes. When Orion sends a message to the consumer’s
    API, a timestamp is recorded and is subtracted from the timestamp of the message,
    in such a way we obtain the elapsed time between the generation of the message
    until it reaches the Consumer. The sequence of processing steps and data flow
    starting from the sensor data generation and ending at the consumer is shown in
    Fig. 2. This data flow is deployed in both fog and cloud-only scenarios, depicted
    in Fig. 1. SenSE generates sensor (probe) data and sends it to Mosquitto MQTT
    broker; IoT Agent receives the probe messages from the MQTT broker, stores it
    in MongoDB, translates them to the NGSI format, and finally sends it to Orion
    through HTTP protocol; Orion Context Broker receives NGSI data from the IoT Agent,
    updates entity values, stores them in MongoDB, and sends them to the subscribed
    applications through HTTP protocol and structured as NGSI; Data is delivered to
    the consumer, which stores it and calculates the elapsed since the message was
    generated in the probe (by SenSE), the consumer is subscribed to be notified from
    all probe sensors updates. Fig. 2. Processing steps and data flow Show All In
    the cloud-only experiments ( Fig.3) the sensor data is directed sent to the cloud,
    where all modules are in the same physical machine. Since both Orion and IoT Agent
    are in the same VM, both use the same MongoDB instance. In the fog experiments,
    the first two steps of processing occur in the fog node, which means that the
    MQTT broker and the IoT Agent run in the edge device, and the Orion and Consumer
    are executed in a VM in the cloud. This configuration needs a MongoDB instance
    in each machine, where the fog hosts the IoT Agent and cloud hosts Orion and the
    Consumer. In order to fully understand the evaluation scenario, one needs to comprehend
    the data model of the probe messages. We adopted the Ultralight 2.0 (UL) protocol
    – a lightweight text based protocol aimed to constrained devices and communications
    where the bandwidth and device memory may be limited resources [6]. Each probe
    consists of a set of seven sensors of three different types: Three soil temperature
    sensors in different depths; Three soil moisture sensors in different depths;
    One soil electrical conductivity sensor. Each probe sends a message every 10 minutes
    using the UL protocol over MQTT. The structure of each message is: t1|v|t2|v|t3|v|m1|v|m2|v|m3|v|c|v|ts|v
    View Source where: t1, t2, t3: temperature sensors in different depths; m1, m2,
    m3: moisture sensors in different depths; c: electrical conductivity of the soil;
    ts: timestamp of message generation; v: value of the metric. Fig.3 and Fig.4 show
    the two evaluation scenarios, cloud-only and fog/cloud, respectively. We performed
    the experiments in a lab testbed – all the VMs in the same LAN - and using a network
    emulator (WANem – available to download at wanem.sourceforge.net) to consider
    the impact of network parameters between the place where the data is generated
    (in the farm, where the sensors and fog nodes are located) and the place it is
    processed (the cloud, usually located in some datacenters placed in big cities).
    Although the case where the machines representing the fog and the cloud are in
    the same LAN does not adequately portray the reality, it is important to further
    understand the behavior of the IoT platform and what are the impacts of a constrained
    network. Fig. 3. Cloud/Only FIWARE-SWAMP Evaluation Scenarios – with and without
    WAN Show All Fig. 4. Fog/Cloud FIWARE-SWAMP Evaluation Scenarios – with and without
    WAN Show All The experiments were performed in a private cloud environment implemented
    with OpenStack in a lab testbed. As the experiments were in our own private cloud,
    we could assure that they did not suffer from outside interference from other
    virtual machines running in the same physical servers. Both fog and cloud were
    implemented using virtual machines (VM) in OpenStack, though with very different
    configurations. We used the standard Amazon AWS VM configurations: cloud VM equivalent
    to a t2.medium instance (2vCPU - 4GB of RAM) and the fog VMs (both fog field node
    and fog hub) equivalent to a t2.small instance (1vCPU – 2 GB RAM). Our cloud was
    composed by 6 machines with the following configuration: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU
    E3-1240 V2 @ 3.40GHz - 8 cores and GB of RAM. Two different physical machines
    were used. B. Metrics There are two different metric used in our experiments:
    Average elapsed time: the average time elapsed since a sensor data point is generated
    in the probe until it reaches the consumer application. Basically, we are interested
    in the time elapsed since the data is collected until it is ready to be used by
    another application – such as a dashboard or an analytics module; System metrics:
    CPU and memory usage per Docker container, which allows us to observed each application,
    obtained by docker stats command every 5 seconds. C. Experiments Experiments consisted
    of SenSE simulating probes and sending messages to the IoT platform, running in
    the cloud-only configuration or in the fog/cloud configuration. We performed experiments
    with a large number of probes simultaneously sending messages to the platform,
    in order to verify and understand it scalability. Table I shows the factors and
    levels used in the performance analysis. Our experiments varied all factors with
    all levels, consisting of 16 different possibilities. Each experiment took 2 minutes
    and was replicated 30 times, totalizing 16 hours of running experiments. The asymptotic
    confidence intervals were calculated with a confidence level of 99%. Table I Factors
    and Levels To configure the emulated WAN, we tried to replicate a connection from
    a farm to a cloud. Therefore, we made a simple experiment in order to obtain the
    parameters used in the network emulator by pinging a public cloud using a 4G connection,
    and next we estimated the parameters as a 10 Mbps connection with 45ms of delay
    time and 5ms of jitter. SECTION V. Results The results for the elapsed time in
    all configurations are depicted in Fig.5, wherein one can observe the effect of
    increasing the workload in the fog/cloud and cloud-only scenarios. The platform
    remained stable during almost all experiments, except for the ones performed with
    a workload of 15,000 probes - that we consider being a very high workload. The
    high confidence interval in those experiments reveals this instability. Regarding
    the comparison between the experiments with the presence of the fog and the ones
    with only the cloud, it is essential to analyze networking issues. First we analyze
    those configurations without the network effects (no WANEm emulator), and next
    the impact of the WAN in the experiments. It is important to reinforce that experiments
    without considering the impact of the network are only for a baseline comparison
    and do not reflect real scenarios. In the experiments using a local network, the
    two approaches had equivalent results, since neither the fog nor the cloud were
    overloaded. The difference between the two approaches –fog and cloud - is that
    in the fog case some software modules (Docker containers) were moved to another
    machine (representing the fog), there was no improvement in the overall performance
    of the system when the cloud was not overloaded. Therefore, our experiments revealed
    that performing load balancing between two different machines does not improve
    the performance of the system. In the case where the cloud is overloaded (15,000
    probes), distributing the processing to another machine (the fog) should have
    improved the overall performance of the system. However, the results show that
    there is an overlap between the confidence interval of the experiments with fog
    and cloud with 15000 probes, with the fog experiments having a slightly better
    performance. This occurs due to the limited computational resources of the machine
    that represents the edge device, so that when the workload increases the fog node
    becomes the bottleneck. Experiments with the network emulator (WANem) had results
    that did not confirm our intuition. In the scenarios with a low workload (1,000
    and 5,000 probes), the cloud approach has a significant better performance than
    the fog. This occurs because in the cloud experiments the network traffic was
    composed of small MQTT packets, which did not impose a major constrain to the
    network. However, in the fog experiments the MQTT traffic is only send to the
    fog, which sends a very verbose NGSI/HTTP traffic via the network to the cloud.
    This traffic suffers much more with the network constrains (latency and limited
    bandwidth). Anyway, there is a clear trade-off between the cloud and fog approaches
    when processing becomes the bottleneck, instead of the network. The almost perfect
    balance occurs with experiments with 10,000 probes, in which both approaches achieved
    the same performance. For higher workloads, the fog has a slightly better performance
    than the cloud. The system metrics – RAM and CPU usage - for the cloud-only experiments
    are depicted in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, for the fog/cloud experiments are showed in
    Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. Since the workload in the system is very similar with and without
    the network, we opted to portrait only the results performed considering the network,
    since they illustrate the whole set of experiments. The experiments using the
    fog approach, there were two MongoDB instances - in the fog to help the IoT Agent
    and in the cloud connected to Orion - are identified as Mongo-fog and Mongo-cloud
    respectively. Analyzing Fig. 6 and Fig. 8, it becomes clear that the container
    that demands more processing and it is the potential bottleneck of the system
    is MongoDB. Also, when comparing the cloud-only and fog/cloud results for the
    CPU usage, it is possible to infer that Orion imposes a higher workload in, since
    when the IoT Agent is on the fog node, MongoDB in the cloud has only an approximately
    20% decrease of CPU usage. Unlike the CPU usage, the memory usage has a stable
    behavior, even with the increase of the workload, as shown by Fig.7 for the cloud
    experiments, and in Fig. 9 for the fog experiments. However, there is also a decrease
    of approximately 20% of memory usage when the IoT-Agent is moved to the fog, with
    its own instance of MongoDB. Fig. 5. Response time for the cloud and fog configurations

    SECTION VI. Discussion The experiments were successful in replicating a large-scale
    smart farm environment considering the number of sensors. Also, they showed that
    fog computing does not always improve the overall system performance. However,
    there are complex issues to evaluated in opting for a cloud or a fog approach
    beyond simply adding a machine in the edge of the network. There is a non-trivial
    trade-off between the given application, the available infrastructure and the
    system workload. In the SWAMP scenarios, we expect a smaller number of sensors,
    due to costs and farm sizes, and therefore the experiments that better represent
    real case scenarios are the ones with 1,000 and 5,000 probes. In those cases,
    the addition of a fog processing node proved to be a downgrade regarding performance.
    Nevertheless, the fog has others benefits that compensate the lack of performance.
    In farms in the inward countryside of Brazil, when there is Internet connectivity,
    it is frequently unstable and limited, suffering from frequent disconnections.
    In this case, the fog node is responsible to store sensor data and keep a subset
    of services online when there is no connection to the Internet. An important and
    unexpected factor in the experiments was the impact of the network. Initially,
    we believed that the network would equally impact both configurations fog and
    cloud). However, the impact was much higher in the fog configuration. This happens
    because the traffic of JSON/HTTP packets suffer more from network constrains than
    the lightweight UL 2.0 MQTT traffic. Therefore, when deploying a solution in a
    real environment, there is the need to analyze if the gain in processing part
    of the data in another device (the fog) will overcome the limitations imposed
    by the network. Another solution is to use a lightweight protocol when sending
    the data to the cloud form the fog. This set of experiments created higher awareness
    about the scalability tradeoffs of the FIWARE IoT platform. A major concern is
    regarding the default database used by Orion and the IoT Agent (i.e. MongoDB)
    that was the major bottleneck of the experiments. It is a known fact that MongoDB
    does scale as well as other NoSQL databases, such as Cassandra [10]. In the FIWARE
    documentation, there is no guide or configuration regarding using a different
    database for both software and it seems that they were hardcoded for working with
    MongoDB. FIWARE could potentially increase its scalability if it allows the of
    more efficient databases other than MongoDB. Another solution is to place MongoDB
    in a dedicated machine. Although FIWARE has a scalability ceiling due to MongoDB,
    it is suitable for most of the IoT scenarios in smart farms, being capable to
    handle 10,000 probes without major performance issues. It is proven to be a reliable
    tool with several advantages. It provides a standard communication format between
    all services in a given system through the NGSI information model. FIWARE also
    provides a transparent way to applications – such as dashboards and analytics
    – to consume sensor data. The IoT Agent can handle data from different sensors
    and translate them to a standard NGSI and automatically send this data to Orion,
    whose API is very flexible and able to add new sensors on-the-fly. Orion also
    proved to be a reliable and useful tool to manage context information, as it stores
    the last data point of each attribute and provides a simple API to consult it.
    Also, by using the subscribe operation in Orion, applications do not need to perform
    polling in the interesting devices. Rather, when data is changed, Orion notifies
    the subscribed application. SECTION VII. Conclusion We analyzed the performance
    of FIWARE under different platform configurations comparing fog/cloud and cloud-only
    scenarios for precision irrigation using one of the SWAMP pilots as the evaluation
    scenario. Our results reveal non-intuitive outcomes, such as, that fog computing
    does not always improve the overall system performance. In some cases, the addition
    of a fog processing nodes even proved to worsen the performance. Also, the network
    between the farm and the cloud datacenter causes some unexpected differences between
    different scenarios. The results presented in this paper reveal the tip of the
    iceberg. In order to fully understand the tradeoffs involved in using IoT platforms
    and particularly FIWARE, we need to broaden our scope and perform experiments
    in different configurations, pilots and in scenarios beyond smart farming. Authors

    agriculture (PA) involves the application of technologies and agronomic principles
    to manage spatial and temporal variation associated with all aspects of agricultural
    production in order to improve crop performance and environmental quality. The
    focus of this book is to introduce a non-specialist audience to the the role of
    PA in food security, environmental protection, and sustainable use of natural
    resources, as well as its economic benefits.  The technologies covered include
    yield monitors and remote sensing, and the key agronomic principles addressed
    are the optimal delivery of fertilizers, water and pesticides to crops only when
    and where these are required. As a result, it is shown that both food production
    and resource efficiency can be maximized, without waste or damage to the environment,
    such as can occur from excessive fertilizer or pesticide applications. The authors
    of necessity describe some technicalities about PA, but the overall aim is to
    introduce readers who are unfamiliar with PA to this very broad subject and to
    demonstrate the potential impact of PA on the environment and economy.  Chapter

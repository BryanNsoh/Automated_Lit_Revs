    \ for calibrating and validating land surface models and\nsatellite-based soil\
    \ moisture retrievals.\nIn addition, long-\nterm time series of in situ soil moisture\
    \ measurements them-\nselves can reveal trends in the water cycle related to cli-\n\
    mate or land cover change. Nevertheless, on a worldwide\nbasis the number of meteorological\
    \ networks and stations\nmeasuring soil moisture, in particular on a continuous\
    \ ba-\nsis, is still limited and the data they provide lack standardiza-\ntion\
    \ of technique and protocol. To overcome many of these\nlimitations, the International\
    \ Soil Moisture Network (ISMN;\nhttp://www.ipf.tuwien.ac.at/insitu) was initiated\
    \ to serve as\na centralized data hosting facility where globally available\n\
    in situ soil moisture measurements from operational net-\nworks and validation\
    \ campaigns are collected, harmonized,\nand made available to users. Data collecting\
    \ networks share\ntheir soil moisture datasets with the ISMN on a voluntary\n\
    and no-cost basis.\nIncoming soil moisture data are auto-\nmatically transformed\
    \ into common volumetric soil moisture\nunits and checked for outliers and implausible\
    \ values. Apart\nfrom soil water measurements from different depths, impor-\n\
    tant metadata and meteorological variables (e.g., precipita-\ntion and soil temperature)\
    \ are stored in the database. These\nwill assist the user in correctly interpreting\
    \ the soil moisture\ndata. The database is queried through a graphical user in-\n\
    terface while output of data selected for download is pro-\nvided according to\
    \ common standards for data and metadata.\nCorrespondence to: W. A. Dorigo\n(wd@ipf.tuwien.ac.at)\n\
    Currently (status May 2011), the ISMN contains data of 19\nnetworks and more than\
    \ 500 stations located in North Amer-\nica, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The time\
    \ period spanned\nby the entire database runs from 1952 until the present, al-\n\
    though most datasets have originated during the last decade.\nThe database is\
    \ rapidly expanding, which means that both\nthe number of stations and the time\
    \ period covered by the\nexisting stations are still growing. Hence, it will become\
    \ an\nincreasingly important resource for validating and improving\nsatellite-derived\
    \ soil moisture products and studying climate\nrelated trends. As the ISMN is\
    \ animated by the scientiﬁc\ncommunity itself, we invite potential networks to\
    \ enrich the\ncollection by sharing their in situ soil moisture data.\n1\nIntroduction\n\
    Across many landscapes, soil moisture and its freeze/thaw\nstate control evapotranspiration,\
    \ thus providing the link be-\ntween terrestrial and atmospheric water, energy,\
    \ and carbon\ncycles (Robock et al., 2000). In addition, surface soil mois-\n\
    ture is a determinant of the partitioning of surface precipita-\ntion into inﬁltration\
    \ and runoff. The availability of better spa-\ntial estimates of surface soil\
    \ moisture conditions can there-\nfore help to improve forecasting of precipitation,\
    \ droughts\nand ﬂoods as well as climate projections and predictions\n(Dirmeyer\
    \ et al., 2006).\nIt will also contribute to further\nthe development of other\
    \ hydrological applications that can\nsupport water managers and water resource\
    \ decision-makers.\nThe importance of soil moisture in the global climate system\n\
    Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n\
    1676\nW. A. Dorigo et al.: The International Soil Moisture Network\nhas recently\
    \ been underlined by the Global Climate Observ-\ning System (GCOS) by endorsing\
    \ soil moisture as an Essen-\ntial Climate Variable1.\nThe value of soil moisture\
    \ for various applications is re-\nﬂected by the large number of satellite-based\
    \ soil moisture\nproducts that have emerged during the last decade. Only in\n\
    2000, Robock et al. (2000, p. 1298) concluded their paper\nstating: “There are\
    \ no existing global soil moisture datasets\nmeasured from remote sensing”. Today,\
    \ a wide variety of op-\nerational global soil moisture products are available\
    \ for ex-\nisting microwave sensors such as AMSR-E (Jackson, 1993;\nNjoku et al.,\
    \ 2003; Koike et al., 2004; Owe et al., 2008),\nTRMM-TMI (Owe et al., 2008), SSM/I\
    \ (Owe et al., 2008),\nWindSat (Li et al., 2010), ERS 1 and 2 (Wagner et al.,\
    \ 1999;\nScipal et al., 2002), and ASCAT (Naeimi et al., 2009). In ad-\ndition,\
    \ special missions dedicated to soil moisture either have\nbeen recently launched,\
    \ i.e. the Soil Moisture and Ocean\nSalinity Mission (SMOS) of the European Space\
    \ Agency\n(ESA; Kerr et al., 2001; Wigneron et al., 2007), or are sched-\nuled\
    \ for the near future, such as the Soil Moisture Active\n& Passive (SMAP) mission\
    \ of the United States National\nAerospace Space Administration (NASA; Entekhabi\
    \ et al.,\n2010a).\nIn addition, global soil moisture products based\non land\
    \ surface models are being made available routinely\nthrough operational forecast\
    \ systems, e.g. from the European\nCentre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (Drusch\
    \ and\nViterbo, 2007), re-analyses (Uppala et al., 2005; Simmons et\nal., 2007)\
    \ or the soil moisture ﬁelds provided by the Global\nLand Surface Data Assimilation\
    \ System (Rodell et al., 2004)\nand the Global Soil Wetness Project (Dirmeyer\
    \ et al., 1999).\nTo calibrate and validate such satellite- and model-based\n\
    soil moisture estimates, in situ measurements are an indis-\npensable source of\
    \ information (e.g. Ceballos et al., 2005;\nWagner et al., 2007; Balsamo et al.,\
    \ 2009; Gruhier et al.,\n2010; Jackson et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2011).\nMoreover,\n\
    in situ soil moisture measurements provide information that\nfacilitates the study\
    \ of the spatial and temporal variability\nof soil moisture at different scales\
    \ (Famiglietti et al., 1999;\nEntin et al., 2000; Brocca et al., 2007), the exchange\
    \ of water\nbetween different layers within the soil column or between\nthe land\
    \ surface and the atmosphere (Mahfouf and Noilhan,\n1991; Chen and Hu, 2004; Albergel\
    \ et al., 2008), and climate\nrelated trends in soil moisture (Robock et al.,\
    \ 2005).\nSince the early 1980s, several dedicated soil moisture ﬁeld\ncampaigns\
    \ in the US, Europe, and Australia have resulted in\nboth short term and long\
    \ term soil moisture datasets. Most\nof these campaigns were designed for satellite\
    \ validation pur-\nposes. Of great historical importance were the soil moisture\n\
    ﬁeld experiments performed at the Beltsville Agricultural\nResearch Center (BARC)\
    \ where for one the ﬁrst times remote\nsensing measurements were coupled with\
    \ ﬁeld observations\n(Wang et al., 1980). Being one of the ﬁrst datasets publicly\n\
    available, the BARC datasets triggered many researchers to\n1http://gosic.org/ios/MATRICES/ECV/ECV-Introduction.htm\n\
    study the ability of retrieving soil moisture from space obser-\nvations. Other\
    \ historically important experiments include the\nBotswana experiment (Van De\
    \ Griend et al., 1989), HAPEX-\nSahel (Prince et al., 1995), EFEDA (Braud et al.,\
    \ 1993), FIFE\n(Peck and Hope, 1995), and the soil moisture experiments\ncoordinated\
    \ by the United States Department of Agriculture\n(e.g. Jackson et al., 2002).\n\
    The importance of soil moisture has been growing in im-\nportance also in the\
    \ meteorological and hydrological com-\nmunities and as a result several networks\
    \ now measure soil\nmoisture as a routine observation (e.g. Beyrich and Adam,\n\
    2007; Calvet et al., 2008) . Nevertheless, on a global basis\nthe number of long-term\
    \ in situ monitoring networks is still\nsmall and mostly restricted to mid-latitude\
    \ regions. Only few\nmeasurements are being made in Africa and South America.\n\
    Complicating the easy utilization of network data is the lack\nof a standard measurement\
    \ technique and a standard mea-\nsurement protocol (Robock et al., 2000). Also,\
    \ the fact that\nthe various datasets are managed by a large number of dif-\n\
    ferent organizations makes clear that global studies incorpo-\nrating in situ\
    \ soil moisture measurements are tedious to per-\nform.\nActions to collect data\
    \ from several networks and to offer a\ncentralized portal for dissemination are\
    \ basically conﬁned to\nthe historical Global Soil Moisture Data Bank previously\
    \ ex-\nisting at Rutgers University, NJ (Robock et al., 2000, 2005).\nThis data\
    \ archive provided data and metadata for various his-\ntorical and operative networks\
    \ around the globe. The dozens\nof scientiﬁc publications relying on its datasets\
    \ have afﬁrmed\nthe importance of this dissemination platform. Although the\n\
    Global Soil Moisture Data Bank was a good starting point for\nglobal validation\
    \ efforts, the last update of the data base oc-\ncurred in 2005 which made it\
    \ unusable for the most recent\nand upcoming satellite-based soil moisture products\
    \ listed\nabove. In addition, the observations of the various networks\nin the\
    \ Global Soil Moisture Data Bank were not harmonized\nin terms of measurement\
    \ units. They were presented either\nas plant-available volumetric or as total\
    \ volumetric soil mois-\nture in cm or percent for a given soil layer depth. Hence,\
    \ the\nsoil water units needed to be carefully checked before per-\nforming a\
    \ comparison.\nThe need for intensiﬁed international cooperation in estab-\nlishing\
    \ new monitoring networks and constructing central-\nized and harmonized global\
    \ soil moisture datasets has been\nbroadly recognized by the international community\
    \ (Grabs\nand Thomas, 2002; Jackson et al., 2005). Hence, in 2006\nthe International\
    \ Soil Moisture Working Group (ISMWG)\nwas established to facilitate the creation\
    \ of multi-source soil\nmoisture datasets, including in situ observations. The\
    \ de-\nvelopment of these datasets and an in situ soil moisture net-\nwork was\
    \ consequently included in the Group on Earth Ob-\nservation (GEO) 2009–2011 Work\
    \ Plan under sub-task WA-\n08-01a lead by the Global Energy and Water Cycle Exper-\n\
    iment (GEWEX) and ESA. Its implementation is coordi-\nnated through the ISMWG\
    \ under auspices of GEWEX. The\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1675–1698, 2011\n\

    \ Soil Moisture Network\n1677\nlaunch of SMOS in November 2009 has given a strong\
    \ im-\npulse to the establishment of a centralized data hosting fa-\ncility for\
    \ in situ soil moisture measurements in support of a\nreliable calibration and\
    \ validation of the mission soil mois-\nture products. It was recognized that\
    \ an integrated system\nwas needed to host quality-controlled and harmonized soil\n\

    \ of operation\nof a data hosting facility called the International Soil Mois-\n\
    ture Network (Dorigo et al., 2011). The International Soil\nMoisture Network (ISMN)\
    \ has been implemented by the Vi-\nenna University of Technology and provides\
    \ no-cost access\nto its datasets for all users.\nThis article gives an overview\
    \ of the ISMN, which can be\naccessed through http://www.ipf.tuwien.ac.at/insitu.\
    \ To put\nthe structure of the system and the data manipulations per-\nformed\
    \ within the system into a clearer context, the article\nstarts with an overview\
    \ of soil moisture deﬁnitions and the\nmeasurement techniques and instruments\
    \ commonly used to\nmeasure soil moisture in situ (Sect. 2). Section 3 provides\n\
    an overview of the technical design and implementation of\nthe ISMN, and the methods\
    \ used for harmonizing the soil\nmoisture datasets. Section 4 summarizes the datasets\
    \ cur-\nrently contained in the database. Even though the number of\nnetworks\
    \ and stations are still rapidly increasing (visit http:\n//www.ipf.tuwien.ac.at/insitu/index.php/news.html\
    \ for news\non recent updates), this section intends to provide insight in\nthe\
    \ diversity of the datasets that are considered for integra-\ntion in the ISMN.\
    \ Section 5 discusses the possible outreach\nof the ISMN and some issues that\
    \ should be taken into con-\nsideration if in situ soil moisture data are used\
    \ for calibration\nand validation of remote sensing products and land surface\n\
    models. Section 6 concludes this paper by looking into the\nfuture and outlining\
    \ some prerequisites for a successful con-\ntinuation of the ISMN.\n2\nMeasuring\
    \ in situ soil moisture\n2.1\nSoil moisture deﬁnitions and units\nSoil moisture\
    \ (2) is usually deﬁned as the water present\nin the unsaturated part of the soil\
    \ proﬁle, i.e., between the\nsoil surface and the ground water level and can be\
    \ expressed\nin different units (e.g. Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993; Hillel,\n1998;\
    \ Robock et al., 2000; Seneviratne et al., 2010). An\nunderstanding of the different\
    \ deﬁnitions is crucial for ho-\nmogenization of the soil moisture measurements.\
    \ The most\ncommon deﬁnition of soil moisture is volumetric soil mois-\nture.\
    \ It is either expressed as the volumetric fraction of water\nin a given soil\
    \ depth [m3 water per m3 soil] or as the depth of\na column of water contained\
    \ in a given depth of soil [mm wa-\nter per mm soil]. The volumetric fraction\
    \ [m3 m−3] is most\nwidespread in earth observation. Therefore, this is also the\n\
    unit adopted in the ISMN. Datasets that are provided in other\nunits will be converted\
    \ to this unit (Sect. 3.3.2). Some other\nrelevant descriptors are presented below.\n\
    Soil moisture can also be expressed as fraction of satura-\ntion. A fraction of\
    \ the soil, typically less than 0.5, consists\nof pores that can be ﬁlled with\
    \ air or water. This fraction is\ncalled the porosity (P). If this fraction were\
    \ completely ﬁlled\nwith water, the soil would reach its maximum soil moisture\n\
    content or saturation. The saturation ratio varies between 0\n(no soil moisture)\
    \ and 1 (full saturation). The porosity, or\nwater storage capacity, is needed\
    \ to convert the saturation ra-\ntio into volumetric fraction.\nAnother commonly\
    \ used term is plant available water\n(PAW), which is the volume of water available\
    \ to plants.\nPAW is computed by subtracting the volume of water cor-\nresponding\
    \ to the permanent wilting point from the total vol-\numetric soil water content.\
    \ Below the wilting point water is\nheld too strongly by the soil matrix and is\
    \ not accessible to\nplants (Hillel, 1998). The wilting point depends on soil\
    \ prop-\nerties such as soil texture, and thus varies geographically.\nEssential\
    \ for the deﬁnition of soil moisture is the char-\nacterization of the soil volume,\
    \ as soil moisture content is\nnot homogeneously distributed vertically and horizontally\n\
    and thus depends on the soil volume considered.\nThis is\nof high relevance for\
    \ intercomparing in situ measurements\noriginating from different stations and\
    \ for the comparison of\nin situ measurements with Earth observation and land\
    \ sur-\nface model data. For example, some methods sample only\nsoil moisture\
    \ in the top few millimeters to centimeters of the\nsoil (e.g., microwave remote\
    \ sensing), a small volume at a\ngiven depth (e.g., Time Domain Reﬂectometry (TDR)\
    \ mea-\nsurements Sect. 2.2), or provide an integral measure down\nto the water\
    \ table depth. Moreover, for certain soil moisture\ndeﬁnitions (e.g., root zone\
    \ soil moisture, total soil moisture),\n2 may be a function of space and time\
    \ (i.e., as a function of\nthe plants’ rooting depth or the water table depth).\n\
    For a more extensive description of soil moisture deﬁni-\ntions we refer the reader\
    \ to existing literature (e.g. Hillel,\n1998; Seneviratne et al., 2010).\n2.2\n\
    Measurement techniques\nSeveral techniques are available for measuring soil moisture\n\
    content in situ (Ward and Robinson, 1990; Robock et al.,\n2000; Walker et al.,\
    \ 2004; Robinson et al., 2008; Senevi-\nratne et al., 2010). They can be categorized\
    \ either as direct\nor indirect methods. The most frequently used methods are\n\
    summarized below. For a more detailed discussion we refer\nto the references cited\
    \ above.\n2.2.1\nGravimetric method\nThe gravimetric method is the only method\
    \ that measures\nsoil moisture directly. Typically, soil samples are taken using\n\
    coring devices or augers at speciﬁc depths and locations. The\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1675/2011/\n\
    Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1675–1698, 2011\n1678\nW. A. Dorigo et al.: The\
    \ International Soil Moisture Network\nsamples are weighted before and after drying,\
    \ and from the\nchanges in mass, the soil moisture content can be derived.\nThe\
    \ method is labor-intensive and destructive (i.e., a sam-\nple cannot be taken\
    \ at exactly the same location more than\nonce). When implemented as a monitoring\
    \ technique, the\ntemporal resolution of long-term measurement networks us-\n\
    ing this technique is usually coarse, typically of the order of\n1–2 weeks at\
    \ best (Seneviratne et al., 2010). Nevertheless,\nas the gravimetric method is\
    \ low-tech and simple, it makes\nan excellent technique for long homogeneous climatological\n\
    records (Robock et al., 2000). Today, most systematic obser-\nvations are based\
    \ on indirect methods; however, calibration\ntypically requires using the gravimetric\
    \ method.\n2.2.2\nNeutron probes\nNeutron probes are relatively easy to use, accurate,\
    \ and capa-\nble of measurements in real time. This indirect method uses\na radioactive\
    \ source of fast (high-energy) neutrons, which is\nlowered into a borehole, and\
    \ the backscattered slow neutrons\nare measured.\nA detector counts the number\
    \ of neutrons\nslowed down or thermalized by collisions with hydrogen nu-\nclei,\
    \ mainly representing soil water. A relationship with vol-\numetric soil moisture\
    \ content is obtained by calibrating the\nslow neutron counts with gravimetric\
    \ samples of soil mois-\nture content and bulk densities (Vachaud et al., 1977).\
    \ Since\nradioactive scattering occurs over a spherical domain, a neu-\ntron probe\
    \ samples a volume of soil rather than a point. The\nprobe’s relatively large\
    \ volume of inﬂuence makes observa-\ntions at shallow depths prone to errors,\
    \ as adjoining air is\nalso sampled. Disadvantages of neutron probes include their\n\
    requirement to be calibrated to soil types and zones over a pe-\nriod of time\
    \ with different soil moisture fractions, that they\nare also labor-intensive,\
    \ the need for precautions associated\nwith handling radioactive material, and\
    \ the relatively high\ncosts. It is also not adaptable to frequent and automated\
    \ ob-\nservations. The neutron probe is mostly used to measure soil\nmoisture\
    \ differences rather than absolute soil moisture con-\ntent.\n2.2.3\nElectromagnetic\
    \ techniques\nSoil capacitance measurements, TDR, and Frequency Do-\nmain Reﬂectometry\
    \ (FDR) are electromagnetic techniques\nthat make use of the dependency of the\
    \ dielectric permittivity\nof the soil on soil moisture content, caused by the\
    \ difference\nbetween the dielectric constant of soil components and wa-\nter,\
    \ respectively. These techniques are non-destructive and\nnon-radioactive and\
    \ can be easily set up for automated oper-\nation with a data logger. This facilitates\
    \ frequent measure-\nments up to several measurements per hour. TDR and FDR\n\
    sensors, operating at higher frequencies, are more accurate\nthan capacitance\
    \ sensors (e.g. Robinson et al., 2008). How-\never, the latter are of much lower\
    \ cost, which can allow for\na higher number of instruments and thus much denser\
    \ net-\nworks (e.g., Bogena et al., 2007). On the other hand, FDR is\nsensitive\
    \ to temperature ﬂuctuations and ideally would need\nto be corrected for these.\
    \ All techniques require calibration\nwith gravimetric samples.\n2.2.4\nCosmic-ray\
    \ neutrons\nRecently, a non-invasive method has been proposed that\nmeasures low-energy\
    \ cosmic-ray neutrons that are generated\nwithin the soil, moderated mainly by\
    \ hydrogen atoms, and\ndiffused back to the atmosphere (Zreda et al., 2008; Desilets\n\
    et al., 2010). These neutrons are sensitive to water content\nchanges, but largely\
    \ insensitive to variations in soil chem-\nistry. Their intensity above the surface\
    \ is inversely correlated\nwith hydrogen content of the soil. Portable neutron\
    \ detec-\ntors are placed a few meters above the ground and allow for\na sampling\
    \ interval of several minutes to hours. Soil mois-\nture information is inferred\
    \ over a depth of 15 to 70 cm. In\ncontrast to the methods presented above, cosmic-ray\
    \ mea-\nsurements integrate soil moisture measurements over much\nlarger horizontal\
    \ scales (diameter ∼670 m) and hence have\nthe potential to bridge the spatial\
    \ mismatch between point\nmeasurements using contact methods and remote sensing\
    \ es-\ntimates over large areas. Several operational and experimen-\ntal networks\
    \ based on this method are currently set-up world-\nwide2.\n2.2.5\nOther indirect\
    \ techniques\nTensiometers and electrical resistance blocks are capable of\nmeasuring\
    \ the matric potential of soil water, which is di-\nrectly related to the ability\
    \ of plants to extract water from\nsoil. However, each instrument has a limited\
    \ accessible wa-\nter potential range. Tensiometers work well only in wet soils,\n\
    whereas resistance blocks (mostly made of gypsum) do bet-\nter in moderately dry\
    \ soils (WMO8, 2008). Keeping in mind\nthese known limitations they are sufﬁciently\
    \ reliable and in-\nexpensive. However, tensiometers are relatively service in-\n\
    tensive and sensitive to temperature ﬂuctuations while resis-\ntance blocks need\
    \ careful (re-)calibration during longer op-\neration periods. Both sensor types\
    \ are frequently used for\nagricultural purposes. A detailed description of these\
    \ meth-\nods can be found in (WMO8, 2008).\nHeat dissipation (or pulse) sensors\
    \ measure temperature\nchanges in response to a heat pulse (Robock et al., 2000).\
    \ It\nmakes use of the principle that the thermal behavior of the\nsoil is closely\
    \ related to its water content. Other indirect soil\nmoisture measurement techniques\
    \ include gamma densitom-\netry (based on the relatively greater gamma radiation\
    \ atten-\nuation factor of water compared to other soil components)\nand psychrometers.\
    \ All these indirect techniques need to be\nrecalibrated with gravimetric samples.\n\

    \ facility\n3.1\nData and metadata included\nThe ultimate goal of the ISMN is\
    \ to provide a system for\nthe dissemination of quality-controlled and harmonized\
    \ soil\nmoisture measurements from various ground validation cam-\npaigns and\
    \ operational networks. Harmonization and quality\ncontrol of soil moisture datasets\
    \ can only be performed if suf-\nﬁcient data and metadata are available (Sects.\
    \ 3.3 and 3.4).\nThe information that is useful in interpreting the soil mois-\n\
    ture measurements can be subdivided into information that is\nconsidered either\
    \ static (site characteristics) or that is highly\nvariable over time (e.g. most\
    \ meteorological and hydrologi-\ncal variables).\nThe static variables that are\
    \ included in the ISMN are sum-\nmarized in Table 1. The coordinates of the measurement\
    \ sta-\ntions are obligatory. Conditional variables like bulk density\nand soil\
    \ porosity are needed if soil moisture data are pro-\nvided in units other than\
    \ volumetric soil moisture and, as a\nconsequence, the data need to be converted\
    \ (Sect. 3.3.2). All\nother variables are not obligatory, but are very useful\
    \ for a\nqualitative interpretation of observed soil moisture dynam-\nics or encountered\
    \ anomalies, e.g., between satellite-derived\nsoil moisture and soil moisture\
    \ contents measured in situ.\nEven though the variables listed in Table 1 may\
    \ be consid-\nered static over time, they usually vary with depth.\nTable 2. Meteorological\

    \ Some\nof the variables (e.g., soil suction) are directly related to the\nsoil\
    \ moisture content, whereas others (e.g., soil temperature\nand precipitation)\
    \ can be helpful indicators of soil moisture\ndata quality (Sect. 3.4). Temporal\
    \ sampling resolutions of\nthese variables (including soil moisture measurements)\
    \ vary\nfrom 10 min to infrequent measurements every couple of\ndays or even weeks,\
    \ although an hourly sampling interval is\nmost common. The sampling rate of the\
    \ original soil mois-\nture measurements for each network will be summarized in\n\
    Sect. 4.\n3.2\nSystem overview\n3.2.1\nGeneral layout\nThe data hosting facility\
    \ has been designed fulﬁlling the fol-\nlowing requirements: Firstly, the data\
    \ hosting facility had to\nbe able to store all relevant information for the networks,\
    \ the\nstations, the datasets, and the measurements techniques. Sec-\nondly, this\
    \ information should also be easily accessible, e.g.,\nby users who are looking\
    \ for datasets within a speciﬁc region\nof interest, or by users that for satellite\
    \ product validation are\ninterested only in soil moisture measurements of the\
    \ top soil\nlayer. Finally, any modiﬁcations made to the original data,\nlike\
    \ harmonization, should be traceable and the user should\nbe able to invert this\
    \ procedure to obtain the original mea-\nsurement values (e.g., plant available\
    \ water).\nBased on these considerations the following system was\nimplemented\
    \ (Fig. 1):\n1. software for automated reading, conversion, harmoniza-\ntion,\
    \ and quality checking of input data,\n2. a database containing the harmonized\
    \ data and meta-\ndata, and\n3. a web portal to provide the interface between\
    \ the\ndatabase and user queries and output.\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1675/2011/\n\

    The last two items are presented in this section, whereas\ndata harmonization\
    \ and quality control are discussed in\nSects. 3.3 and 3.4, respectively.\nThe\
    \ system is automated to the highest degree possible to\nfacilitate the processing\
    \ of large datasets and frequent up-\ndates. In practice, this means that data\
    \ harmonization, qual-\nity control, and archiving are performed in a fully automated\n\
    way.\nOnly the ingestion into the system of the original\ndatasets needs to be\
    \ tailored to the speciﬁc network, as the\ndata made available to the ISMN (e.g.,\
    \ by email or by down-\nload) are very heterogeneous with respect to ﬁle naming,\
    \ ﬁle\ntype, ﬁle format, the variables measured, and the metadata\navailable.\
    \ All data manipulations are performed in the Inter-\nactive Data Language (IDL)\
    \ of ITT-VIS3.\n3.2.2\nDatabase\nThe database (or archive) is the core of the\
    \ ISMN data host-\ning facility. Its design was very critical, since inadequate\n\
    design considerations can signiﬁcantly slow down operation\nwhen the database\
    \ gets ﬁlled or leads to a database structure\nthat is incapable of assimilating\
    \ new networks with a differ-\nent design or measurement setup. The design and\
    \ content of\nthe database was established after inventorying potential con-\n\
    tributing networks, expected soil moisture and other datasets,\npossible users,\
    \ and standards for hydrometeorological and\nspatial data and metadata (Sect.\
    \ 3.2.4). Thus, an overview\nof expected database entries, data volumes, and data\
    \ trafﬁc\ncould be established. A prototype of the data hosting facil-\nity was\
    \ ﬁrst tested with a selected number of users and data\nproviders and, wherever\
    \ feasible, modiﬁed to their sugges-\ntions.\nThe database distinguishes between\
    \ mandatory, condi-\ntional, and optional database entries (see also Tables 1-2)\
    \ and\nuses the following hierarchy: network > station > dataset.\n3http://www.ittvis.com\n\
    Apart from data and metadata of soil moisture and other vari-\nables, additional\
    \ relevant information on the networks and\nthe stations is included, e.g., the\
    \ responsible organization or\nreferences to more detailed information on the\
    \ networks and\nsites. Among others, an important design consideration has\nbeen\
    \ the use of a measurement depth interval (“from – to”)\nto comply with the different\
    \ measurement techniques and in-\nstallation positions of the sensors. In the\
    \ case of a variable\nmeasured at a speciﬁc depth, the “from” and “to” depths\
    \ are\nidentical.\nThe database was implemented in the open-source object-\nrelational\
    \ database management system PostgreSQL4 (ver-\nsion 8.4) including the spatial\
    \ database extension PostGIS5\n1.3.6.\n3.2.3\nWeb portal\nThe ISMN can be accessed\
    \ at http://www.ipf.tuwien.ac.at/\ninsitu. It consists of two major parts: (i)\
    \ a project website\nproviding details about networks, partners, and the project\n\
    itself, and (ii) the data hosting centre itself where users can\nquery, view,\
    \ and download the data contained in the database.\nFigure 2 shows a screenshot\
    \ of the initial view of the data\nhosting centre. It embeds a Google Maps application\
    \ pro-\ngramming interface (API), which offers the user a map-based\nselection\
    \ tool to view and download the available data. In ad-\ndition, through the satellite\
    \ data and orthophotos in Google\nMaps the user is able to obtain additional information\
    \ about\nthe land use/land cover and topography in the vicinity of the\nmeasurement\
    \ stations. By clicking on the markers, the user\nobtains a summary of important\
    \ metadata about the networks\nor stations, respectively, depending on the zoom\
    \ level within\nGoogle Maps. For a selected station the available data can\nbe\

    \ stan-\ndards of the Coordinated Energy and water cycle Observa-\ntions Project\

    \ hydroclimates for hy-\ndrologic applications and coordination of the regional\
    \ hy-\ndroclimate projects. CEOP has accelerated the adoption of\nstandards for\
    \ various types of observations, including those\nof soil moisture. These standards\
    \ do not only specify the\nformats of the data (Table 3) but also provide prescriptions\n\
    on metadata formats and ﬁle naming conventions. Metadata\ndescriptions compliant\
    \ with ISO 19115 and INSPIRE (In-\nfrastructure for Spatial Information in the\
    \ European Com-\nmunity)8 are directly retrieved from the database and saved\n\
    in an XML ﬁle that is appended to the data download.\n6 CEOP is renamed GEWEX\

    Datasets provided by participating networks (Sect. 4) are har-\nmonized in time\
    \ and with respect to the measurement units.\n3.3.1\nTemporal resampling\nThe\
    \ various networks and stations measure at different tem-\nporal sampling intervals.\
    \ Whereas the datasets contained in\nthe Global Soil Moisture Data Bank (Robock\
    \ et al., 2000)\nsupply only several observations per month, most modern\nautomated\
    \ stations provide several measurements per hour\n(Sect. 4). Following recommendations\
    \ from the World Me-\nteorological Organization, co-sponsored programs and appli-\n\
    cations for satellite soil moisture products9, we decided that\nfor the ISMN a\
    \ temporal resolution of 1 hour is sufﬁcient for\nall applications, including\
    \ regional numerical weather pre-\ndiction.\nObservation datasets, which are available\
    \ at sub-hourly\nsampling rates, have been thinned selecting the individual\n\
    measurements at the hourly UTC reference time step (Ta-\nble 4).\nIf at this hourly\
    \ sampling interval no measure-\nment is available (e.g., indicated by a dummy\
    \ value like\n“−99.90”), the database entry will receive the value “NaN”\n(Not\
    \ a Number). This is illustrated in Table 4 for the time\nstep 18:00 UTC. If no\
    \ valid measurement is available, which\nmeans that the measurement value is outside\
    \ a plausible\nrange, the database entry for this measurement is labeled\nwith\

    \ it is not a common practice\nthat soil moisture networks provide quality indicators\
    \ with\ntheir data.\nTherefore, we decided to integrate the alloca-\ntion of quality\
    \ indicators in the data hosting facility itself.\nA rather conservative quality\
    \ checking scheme was imple-\nmented, so that suspect observations can be detected\
    \ more\neasily. We decided to provide only quality indicators that\ncan be checked\
    \ in an objective way. Hence, indicators like\n“Bad” and “Good” are not included.\
    \ This leads to the subset\nof CEOP quality ﬂags presented in Table 6.\nTable\
    \ 7 shows the possible ranges for the most important\nmeteorological variables.\
    \ If a measured data value exceeds\nthis range (on either side of the range) the\
    \ measurement re-\nceives the ﬂag value “C.” If a measurement is missing, its\n\
    quality ﬂag is set to “M.” All other dataset values have been\nset to “U” for\
    \ unchecked.\nIn contrast to the other meteorological measurements, for\nsoil\
    \ moisture also the quality ﬂag “Questionable/Dubious\n(D)” is adopted. This quality\
    \ ﬂag is adopted when a soil\nmoisture measurement in combination with another\

    \ for civil protection activities related\nto hydrometeorological monitoring for\
    \ ﬂood and landslide\nrisk mitigation. More details on this network are found\
    \ in\nBrocca et al. (2011) and Table 9. Soil moisture measure-\nments provided\
    \ by this network have been used for the vali-\ndation of various satellite-based\
    \ soil moisture products from\nAMSR-E and ASCAT (Brocca et al., 2011).\n4.3\n\
    CAMPANIA\nThe CAMPANIA network is located near the city of Naples\nin the Campania\
    \ region in southern Italy.\nThe data are\nmeasured and prepared by the Centro\
    \ Funzionale per la\nPrevisione Meteorologica e il Monitoraggio Meteo-Pluvio-\n\
    Idrometrico e delle Frane, Settore Programmazione Inter-\nventi di Protezione\
    \ Civile sul Territorio, Regione Campa-\nnia.13 Details on the measurements performed\
    \ in this net-\nwork are found in Brocca et al. (2011) and Table 9. Soil\nmoisture\
    \ measurements provided by this network have been\nused for the validation of\
    \ various satellite-based soil moisture\nproducts from AMSR-E and ASCAT (Brocca\
    \ et al., 2011)\n4.4\nCHINA\nThis dataset was previously contained in the Global\
    \ Soil\nMoisture Data Bank (Robock et al., 2000). The observa-\ntions were taken\
    \ at the 8, 18 and 28th of each month during\nthe period 1981–1999 and served\
    \ agricultural purposes. For\nsome stations, no measurements were taken in the\
    \ cold sea-\nson due to the frozen surface. Despite the low sampling rate,\nthe\
    \ soil moisture measurements provide detailed information\non the vertical distribution\
    \ of soil water as measurements\nwere taken at 11 depth intervals over the upper\
    \ 1 m soil layer.\nMore details are found in Table 9 and Robock et al. (2000).\n\
    Data from the CHINA network have been extensively used\nfor a large range of applications,\
    \ including fundamental re-\nsearch on the behavior of soil moisture (e.g., Entin\
    \ et al.,\n2000), improvement of land surface and reanalysis models\n12http://www.cfcalabria.it/\n\
    13http://www.regione.campania.it/\n(e.g., Rodell et al., 2004), evaluating drought\
    \ severity mod-\nels (e.g., Dai et al., 2004), and satellite soil moisture product\n\
    validation (e.g., Reichle et al., 2004).\n4.5\nCNR-IRPI\nThe CNR-IRPI network\
    \ is located near the city of Perugia\nin central Italy. The network is maintained\
    \ by the Research\nInstitute for Geo-Hydrological Protection (IRPI) of the Ital-\n\
    ian National Research Council (CNR)14 to serve ﬂood fore-\ncasting. Additional\
    \ information on the sites can be found in\nTable 9 and in Brocca et al. (2008,\
    \ 2009). Data from the\nCNR-IRPI network have been used to test the reliability\
    \ of\nvarious AMSR-E and ASCAT-based soil moisture products\n(Brocca et al., 2010b,\
    \ 2011; Liu et al., 2011) and to study\nthe spatio-temporal dynamics of soil moisture\
    \ (Brocca et al.,\n2007, 2010a).\n4.6\nFMI\nThis network is operated by the Finish\
    \ Meteorological In-\nstitute (FMI) as part of an operational weather observatory.\n\
    Currently it consists of a single station (FMI Arctic Research\nCentre in Sodankyl¨a)15\
    \ that measures soil moisture in a fully\nautomated operational mode at three\
    \ different locations a few\nmeters apart. The network has participated in several\
    \ inter-\nnational projects and initiatives, such as FLUXNET (Baldoc-\nchi et\
    \ al., 2001) and the validation of diverse SMOS products\n(Rautiainen et al.,\
    \ 2011). More information on the FMI can\nbe found in Rautiainen et al. (2011)\
    \ and in Table 9. The\nFMI network is the ﬁrst network in the ISMN that provides\n\
    updates on a fully automated basis. Once a day, data sets\nare downloaded from\
    \ the FMI server, processed and qual-\nity controlled, and ingested into the database\
    \ of the ISMN.\nData sets of the FMI network were used for studying the rela-\n\
    tionship between soil moisture and microwave emissions and\nbackscatter in L-.,\
    \ C-, and X-band (Pulliainen et al., 1994;\nRautiainen et al., 2011).\n4.7\nICN\n\
    The Illinois Climate Network (ICN)16 is coordinated by the\nWater and Atmospheric\
    \ Resources Program of the Illinois\nState Water Survey. This network was also\
    \ contained in the\nGlobal Soil Moisture Data Bank. Measurements began in\n1981\
    \ and the network continues to operate until present. The\nmain purpose of the\
    \ network is to provide information on ex-\ntreme and usual weather events, as\
    \ well as short and long-\nterm trends in climate data. The dataset contained\
    \ in the\nISMN covers the period 1983 through July 2008 while an\nupdate with\
    \ the most recent datasets is foreseen for the near\nfuture. The ﬁrst two years\
    \ were removed because of spin-up\n14http://www.irpi.cnr.it/\n15 http://fmiarc.fmi.ﬁ/index.html\n\

    4.8\nIOWA\nThe IOWA dataset was transferred from the Global Soil\nMoisture Data\
    \ Bank and consists of soil moisture observa-\ntions from two different catchments\
    \ located in the southwest\nof Iowa. Soil moisture observations were taken for\
    \ scientiﬁc\npurposes until 1994 when it ceased operation. The gravi-\nmetric\
    \ method was used to measure soil moisture for the top\n5 layers, neutron probes\
    \ for the deeper layers. On average,\nobservations were made twice a month between\
    \ April and\nOctober. More information about this network can be found\nin Table\
    \ 9, Entin et al. (2000), and Robock et al. (2000). The\nIOWA dataset has been\
    \ used e.g. for trend analysis in soil\nmoisture (Robock et al., 2000), satellite\
    \ product validation\n(Reichle et al., 2004) and for studying the temporal and\
    \ spa-\ntial scales of soil moisture dynamics (Entin et al., 2000).\n4.9\nLindenberg\
    \ Meteorological Observatory\nThe Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory – Richard\
    \ Ass-\nmann Observatory (MOL-RAO)17 is situated close to Berlin,\nGermany. It\
    \ is operated by the German Meteorological Ser-\nvice DWD and perfoms systematic\
    \ observations of the atmo-\nsphere and the land surface. Soil moisture is operationally\n\
    measured at a grassland site (Falkenberg) and a forest site\n(Kerigh) since 1998\
    \ and 2002, respectively. Being part of\nan operational meteorological observatory,\
    \ also several other\nrelevant hydrometeorological variables are provided and\
    \ soil\nproperties are well documented. Information on the network\ncan be found\
    \ in Table 9, in Beyrich and Adam (2007) and in\nvarious web sources 18. Soil\
    \ moisture data of the MOL-RAO\nnetwork have been used to study the effect of\
    \ soil moisture on\nsurface heat ﬂuxes (Beyrich et al., 2006; Heret et al., 2006).\n\
    4.10\nMONGOLIA\nAlso this dataset was previously contained in the Global\nSoil\
    \ Moisture Data Bank. Soil moisture datasets were col-\nlected by the National\
    \ Agency of Meteorology, Hydrology\nand Environment Monitoring in Ulaanbaatar\
    \ for agricultural\npurposes. All observations were initially provided as volu-\n\
    metric plant-available water. As the original measured wilt-\ning levels, required\
    \ to convert PAW into fractional volumet-\nric soil moisture content, could not\
    \ be retrieved, these were\ncalculated from soil texture and organic carbon content\
    \ at\neach station using the predictive equations of Saxton and\nRawls (2006).\
    \ Input to the equations was provided by the\nHarmonized World Soil Database (FAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISS-\n\
    CAS/JRC, 2009). Soil moisture measurements are provided\nthree times a month during\
    \ the warm period of the year,\nwhich runs from April until the end of October.\
    \ More infor-\nmation about this network is found in Table 9 and Robock\net al.\
    \ (2000). Datasets of the MONGOLIA network have\nbeen extensively used in studies\
    \ connected to climate vari-\nability (Robock et al., 2000), the evaluation of\
    \ drought sever-\nity models (Dai et al., 2004), validation of satellite-based\
    \ soil\nmoisture products (Reichle et al., 2004), and for studying the\nspatial\

    \ is situated in the center of the\nIberian Peninsula. It was set up in 1999 as\
    \ an experimen-\ntal network by the Centro Hispano Luso de Investigaciones\nAgrarias\
    \ (CIALE) group of the University of Salamanca20.\nThe stations lie in an agricultural\
    \ area. In the vicinity of a\nfew stations irrigation occurs. As a result, large\
    \ jumps in\nmeasured soil moisture that cannot be coupled to meteoro-\nlogical\
    \ events and very high soil moisture fractions (up to\n0.95 m3 m−3) may be observed\
    \ here. As irrigation usually\nis a very local phenomenon, the stations that are\
    \ affected\nshould be treated with caution when interpreted in a spa-\ntial context.\
    \ Details of the network can be found in Table 9\nand in Mart´ınez-Fern´andez\
    \ and Ceballos (2005). Datasets\nof the REMEDHUS network have been used by study\
    \ the\nspatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture (Mart´ınez-\nFern´andez\
    \ and Ceballos, 2003, 2005) and for satellite prod-\nuct validation (Ceballos\
    \ et al., 2005; Wagner et al., 2007; Liu\net al., 2011; Parinussa et al., 2011).\n\
    4.13\nRUSWET-AGRO\nSoil moisture datasets for 78 districts in the Former Soviet\n\
    Union were prepared for agricultural purposes by the Rus-\nsian Hydrometeorological\
    \ Center, Moscow, Russia and ini-\ntially distributed through the Global Soil\
    \ Moisture Databank.\nThe soil moisture observations were originally provided\
    \ as\nvolumetric plant-available water [volumetric %]. Due to the\nlag between\
    \ observations and the publication of the data in\nreference books, and geo-political\
    \ changes during the era,\ninformation on the wilting points (required to convert\
    \ plant\navailable water into volumetric soil moisture) has gone lost.\nTo resolve\
    \ this problem and make the data compatible, the\npredictive equations of Saxton\
    \ and Rawls (2006) were used\nto estimate the wilting points from soil texture\
    \ and organic\ncarbon content. Input to the equations was provided by the\nHarmonized\
    \ World Soil Database (FAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISS-\nCAS/JRC, 2009). As the RUSWET-AGRO\
    \ dataset was de-\nsigned for monitoring soil moisture at agricultural ﬁelds,\n\
    datasets were separately available for spring cereal crops and\nwinter cereal\
    \ crops for all locations. In the ISMN stations\nwith the sufﬁx “a” represent\
    \ spring cereal crops while sta-\ntions with “b” illustrate winter cereal crops.\
    \ Measurements\nare available three times a month during the growing period\n\
    of 1987 and 1988. More information about this network is\n20http://campus.usal.es/∼hidrus/\n\
    available in Table 9, Vinnikov and Yeserkepova (1991), and\nRobock et al. (2000).\
    \ The RUSWET-AGRO datasets have\nbeen widely used for climate research (Robock\
    \ et al., 2000),\nevaluation of drought severity models (Dai et al., 2004), land\n\
    surface model evaluation (Balsamo et al., 2009), and satellite\nproduct validation\
    \ (Reichle et al., 2004).\n4.14\nRUSWET-GRASS\nThe RUSWET-GRASS dataset is a merger\
    \ of the RUSWET-\n130STA and RUSWET-50STA networks from the former So-\nviet Union\
    \ previously contained in the Global Soil Moisture\nData Bank.\nMeasurements were\
    \ originally used for agri-\ncultural predictions. As soil moisture was originally\
    \ pro-\nvided as plant available water, wilting points were needed\nto covert\
    \ the measurements into volumetric soil moisture.\nSimilarly as for the RUSWET-AGRO\
    \ network, the predic-\ntive equations of Saxton and Rawls (2006) were used to\
    \ es-\ntimate the wilting points from soil texture and organic car-\nbon content\
    \ while input to the equations was provided by the\nHarmonized World Soil Database\
    \ (FAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISS-\nCAS/JRC, 2009). The dataset covers the years 1952–1985,\n\
    but the spatial extent of these data is poor until about 1975.\nObservations were\
    \ made with a temporal resolution of about\n10 days during the warm season, and\
    \ once a month during\nwinter. The provided measurements are the average of four\n\
    samples taken within an area of about 1000 m2. More in-\nformation on this dataset\
    \ can be found in Table 9, Vinnikov\nand Yeserkepova (1991), and Robock et al.\
    \ (2000).\nThe\nRUSWET-GRASS datasets have been widely used for cli-\nmate research\
    \ (e.g., Robock et al., 2000), evaluation of land\nsurface models (e.g., Robock\
    \ et al., 1995, 1998; Yang et\nal., 1997), evaluation of drought severity models\
    \ (e.g., Dai\net al., 2004), and satellite product validation (e.g., Reichle\n\
    et al., 2004).\n4.15\nRUSWET-VALDAI\nSoil moisture datasets for 3 catchments located\
    \ in the Val-\ndai basin were collected by the State Hydrological Institute\n\
    in St. Petersburg from 1960 to 1990 for water balance stud-\nies. The catchments\
    \ are characterized by different types of\nvegetation. Soil moisture [volumetric\
    \ %] was computed us-\ning data from 9–11 observational points distributed over\
    \ the\nbasin area. The resulting ﬁles contain monthly means of soil\nmoisture\
    \ for three different depth intervals. Thus, soil mois-\nture values are available\
    \ as monthly means, precipitation as\nmonthly totals [mm], and temperature [◦C]\
    \ as daily values.\nOther variables measured but not included into the ISMN\n\
    are runoff, monthly averaged water table depth, snow water\nequivalent, and evaporation.\
    \ More information can be found\nin Table 9, Vinnikov and Yeserkepova (1991),\
    \ and Robock\net al. (2000). The RUSWET-VALDAI datasets have been\nwidely used\
    \ for climate research (Robock et al., 2000), anal-\nysis of scales of soil moisture\
    \ variation (e.g., Vinnikov et al.,\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1675–1698,\

    \ et al., 2003),\nevaluation of drought severity models (Dai et al., 2004), and\n\
    satellite product validation (Reichle et al., 2004).\n4.16\nSMOSMANIA\nThe SMOSMANIA\
    \ network in southern France was\nset up in support of calibration and validation\
    \ activi-\nties for SMOS. The network is operated by the Cen-\ntre National de\
    \ Recherches M´et´eorologiques,\nGroupe\nd’Etude de l’Atmosph`ere M´et´eorologique\
    \ (CNRM/GAME),\nM´et´eoFrance, CNRS. Initially, 12 stations were installed, but\n\
    from the start of 2009 the network was extended with an-\nother 9 stations. Details\
    \ of SMOSMANIA can be found in\nTable 9 and in Albergel et al. (2008) and Calvet\
    \ et al. (2008).\nMeasurements taken by this network have been extensively\nused\
    \ for validating various satellite-based soil moisture prod-\nucts (Albergel et\
    \ al., 2009, 2010; Li et al., 2010; Brocca et\nal., 2011; Liu et al., 2011; Parinussa\
    \ et al., 2011) and for\nstudying the interaction between surface and sub-surface\
    \ soil\nmoisture levels (Albergel et al., 2008).\n4.17\nSWEX POLAND\nThe\nSoil\n\
    Water\nand\nEnergy\neXchange\nPoland\n(SWEX Poland) network is operated by the\
    \ Institute of\nAgrophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences.\nThe\nnetwork has\
    \ been set up in particular to support calibration\nand validation of SMOS products\
    \ over wetlands.\nSoil\nmoisture and soil temperature are measured over eight\n\
    different depths. More info is found in Table 9 and Mar-\nczewski et al. (2010).\
    \ Primary purpose of the network will\nbe the validation of satellite–based soil\
    \ moisture retrievals\n(Marczewski et al., 2010).\n4.18\nUDC SMOS\nThe\nUpper\n\
    Danube\nCatchment\nSMOS\nnetwork\n(UDC SMOS) in Southern Germany is one of the\
    \ two\nofﬁcial European SMOS cal/val test sites. The soil moisture\nnetwork is\
    \ run as a cooperation between the University\nof Munich and the Bavarian State\
    \ Research Center for\nAgriculture. It is funded by the German Aerospace Centre\n\
    (DLR) through the project SMOSHYD21. At some stations\nsoil moisture of a speciﬁc\
    \ layer is measured by multiple\nsensors. Details on the UDC SMOS network can\
    \ be found\nin Ttable 9 and Loew et al. (2009). Loew and Schlenz (2011)\nused\
    \ the soil moisture data of this network to quantify the\nuncertainties of an\
    \ AMSR-E derived soil moisture product.\n21http://www.geographie.uni-muenchen.de/department/ﬁona/\n\
    forschung/projekte/index.php?projekt id=103\n4.19\nUMSUOL\nUMSUOL is a network\
    \ in the Po river plain in Northern Italy.\nIt is part of an operational meteorological\
    \ network operated\nby the Service of Hydrology, Meteorology and Climate of the\n\
    Regional Agency for Environmental Protection in Emilia-\nRomagna (ARPA – SIMC)\
    \ mainly for agricultural purposes.\nMore information is given in Table 9. Soil\
    \ moisture data of\nthis network have been used for satellite product validation\n\
    and intercomparison (Brocca et al., 2011).\n5\nDiscussion\n5.1\nImpact of the\
    \ ISMN for satellite products and land\nsurface models\nEven though initial funding\
    \ for the establishment of the\nISMN, as provided by ESA, mainly focuses on the\
    \ SMOS\nmission, other satellite-based soil moisture products from the\nexisting\
    \ and future missions such as AMSR-E, ASCAT, and\nSMAP can proﬁt from the established\
    \ network (for refer-\nences see the individual networks in Sect. 4). However,\
    \ the\nintention of the ISMN is to go beyond the role of satellite val-\nidation\
    \ resource and to serve other scientiﬁc and application-\noriented communities\
    \ as well, such as hydrological model-\ning, numerical weather forecasting, and\
    \ water management.\nTo fulﬁll this task, the ISMN stores not only surface soil\n\
    moisture but also soil water content of the deeper layers and\nrelevant hydrometeorological\
    \ variables such as precipitation\nand temperature of the air and soil. In addition,\
    \ to better\nserve time critical applications (ranging from several hours\nto\
    \ a few days), the ISMN has been structured in a way that\nenables processing\
    \ incoming soil moisture measurements on\na fully automated basis. The automated\
    \ daily update of data\nfrom the FMI network shows that a NRT assimilation and\n\
    redistribution of data is possible. Nevertheless, prerequisite\nfor the added\
    \ value of such a mode is the presence of opera-\ntional measurement and processing\
    \ chains on the part of the\ndata providers in order to guarantee timely data\
    \ delivery to\nthe ISMN.\n5.2\nConsiderations on data representativeness and\n\
    quality\nThe appropriateness of one or more soil moisture datasets\nfrom the ISMN\
    \ for a speciﬁc application strongly depends\non the spatial and temporal scales\
    \ of the in-situ measure-\nments and of the process that the user wishes to describe.\n\
    For example, if the aim is to validate satellite-derived surface\nsoil moisture,\
    \ the user should be aware that these products\ncontain information only about\
    \ the upper few millimeters to\ncentimeters of the soil column, whereas a technique\
    \ based\non cosmic-ray neutrons provides information up to a depth\nof ∼70 cm.\
    \ On the other hand, the latter provides estimates\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1675/2011/\n\

    \ International Soil Moisture Network\nthat are spatially more consistent than\
    \ single electromagnetic\ndevices or gravimetric measurements.\nApart from the\
    \ choice of the measurement technique itself,\nalso its employment has a strong\
    \ impact on what is exactly\nobserved. The in-situ measurements are inﬂuenced\
    \ by sev-\neral factors including:\n– Installation depth of the sensor.\n– Placement\
    \ of the sensor, e.g., is sensor positioned hori-\nzontally or vertically?\n–\
    \ Is soil moisture measured at a speciﬁc depth or inte-\ngrated over a certain\
    \ soil depth interval? This is often\nclosely related to the positioning of the\
    \ instrument.\n– Density and geographical distribution of measurements.\n– Characterization\
    \ of the soil, including texture, porosity,\nand organic matter content.\n– Calibration\
    \ of the sensor\nIdeally, all these factors should be accounted for when har-\n\
    monizing in situ soil measurements from different sites, so\nthat observed variations\
    \ are related only to real differences in\nsoil moisture. However, such a harmonization\
    \ of data would\ngo beyond the current objective of the ISMN.\nThe choice of the\
    \ measurement technique may also have a\nstrong impact on the data quality. In\
    \ Sect. 2.2 and several ad-\nvantages and disadvantages of the different techniques\
    \ were\nhighlighted while the relative performance of various sensors\nhas been\
    \ extensively documented in literature (Baumhardt et\nal., 2000; Walker et al.,\
    \ 2004; Czarnomski et al., 2005; Mit-\ntelbach et al., 2011). Even if TDR sensors\
    \ nowadays are of-\nten considered as benchmark for operational ﬁeld monitoring\n\
    of soil moisture, other, less expensive systems may in many\nsituations show comparable\
    \ performance (e.g. Czarnomski\net al., 2005) and therefore should not be excluded\
    \ on before-\nhand from data analysis.\nThe relative accuracy and precision of\
    \ stations may differ\nfrom site to site (even when employing similar instruments)\n\
    and can shift over time due to sensor degradation or external\ndisturbances. Not\
    \ considering these differences in further us-\nage of the data may falsely affect\
    \ results obtained and con-\nclusions drawn by a study. Therefore, adequate quality\
    \ char-\nacterization of the individual networks and stations is highly\ndesired.\
    \ As the current quality control procedure is only able\nto detect evident outliers\
    \ but does not give us any informa-\ntion about subtle differences between stations,\
    \ future efforts\nwill primarily focus on improved quality control. This will\n\
    be done at the level of individual measurement values as well\nas at the station\
    \ and network level.\n5.3\nUtilization strategies for ISMN datasets\nEvaluating\
    \ satellite- and model-derived soil moisture re-\ntrievals with in situ soil moisture\
    \ measurements is commonly\nbased on the root-mean-square metric (Jackson et al.,\
    \ 2010).\nHowever, to use in situ soil moisture measurements from\nthe ISMN in\
    \ satellite and land surface model validation and\ncalibration, the user should\
    \ be aware of the systematic dif-\nferences that may exist between in situ measurements\
    \ and\nsoil moisture estimates from models and satellite observa-\ntions (Entekhabi\
    \ et al., 2010b). Even though the ISMN pro-\nvides soil moisture measurements\
    \ in the same volumetric\nunit that is returned by most satellite products and\
    \ models, bi-\nases and differences in the dynamic range may exist between\nthe\
    \ datasets, e.g., by assumptions and generalizations made\nwithin the retrieval\
    \ concept, scaling issues, or due to the dif-\nferent soil layers or soil depths\
    \ considered. Thus, other met-\nrics, such as the Pearson or Spearman correlation\
    \ coefﬁcient,\noften provide valuable and complementary information on\nthe performance\
    \ (Entekhabi et al., 2010b).\nTo combine in situ soil moisture measurements with\
    \ satel-\nlite retrievals and a ﬁrst guess predicted by a land surface\nmodel,\
    \ e.g., in the framework of data assimilation, it is often\nnecessary to minimize\
    \ systematic differences between the in-\ndividual datasets (e.g. Drusch, 2007).\
    \ These correction meth-\nods include standard rescaling techniques, e.g. based\
    \ on sim-\nple statistic descriptors of both datasets such as minimum,\nmaximum,\
    \ mean, and variance (Dorigo et al., 2010; Miralles\net al., 2010), linear regression\
    \ (Scipal et al., 2008), or CDF-\nmatching (Drusch et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2011).\
    \ Other studies\npropose the use of exponential ﬁlters or land surface models\n\
    to ﬁnd a robust relationship between the soil moisture dy-\nnamics observed at\
    \ different observation depths and in dif-\nferent observation spaces (Wagner\
    \ et al., 1999; Sabater et al.,\n2007; Albergel et al., 2008).\n5.4\nAdditional\
    \ science beneﬁts of the ISMN\nSince for the ﬁrst time a globally harmonized soil\
    \ moisture\ndataset is available, the ISMN may help to ﬁnd comprehen-\nsive answers\
    \ to fundamental science questions regarding soil\nmoisture and its role in the\
    \ integrated water cycle, such as:\n– Can we reﬁne our understanding of the memory\
    \ of soil\nmoisture (e.g., Entin et al., 2000)? How does it depend\non climate\
    \ variability, climate persistence and soil hy-\ndraulic properties? How do vegetation\
    \ characteristics\naffect this memory?\n– How is surface soil moisture dynamics\
    \ linked with that\nin the subsurface proﬁle? How does soil moisture at the\n\
    surface and below the surface respond to precipitation\nevents and drydowns?\n\
    Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1675–1698, 2011\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1675/2011/\n\
    W. A. Dorigo et al.: The International Soil Moisture Network\n1693\n– Can long-term\
    \ trends and changes in the frequencies of\nextremes that have been regionally\
    \ observed in regional\nin situ observations (e.g., Robock et al., 2005) be ex-\n\
    trapolated to the global scale?\n– What are the functional relationships between\
    \ soil mois-\nture and evaporation (e.g. Jung et al., 2010)? How does\nit depend\
    \ on vegetation, soil type and structure?\nIn addition, existing knowledge on\
    \ the temporal stability and\nspatial correlation of soil moisture (e.g. Vachaud\
    \ et al., 1985;\nMart´ınez-Fern´andez and Ceballos, 2005; Cosh et al., 2008),\n\
    can now be strengthened with global evidence. Moreover,\nthere is a proven strong\
    \ relationship between soil moisture\nand the biogeochemical cycles (e.g. Ciais\
    \ et al., 2005) while,\nat the same time, our knowledge on how this interaction\
    \ ex-\nactly takes place is still very limited (van der Molen et al.,\n2011).\
    \ The ISMN may help to gain further inside in this pro-\ncess.\n6\nConclusions\
    \ and outlook\nWith the establishment of the ISMN data hosting center pre-\nsented\
    \ in this paper, a ﬁrst important step has been taken to-\nward a global soil\
    \ moisture observing system. Although soil\nmoisture is now recognized as an essential\
    \ climate variable\nby GCOS, the growth and continuity of this effort will de-\n\
    pend upon the commitment of ﬁnancial support and the co-\noperation of data providers\
    \ on a long-term basis. To reach\nthe goal of a fully integrated global soil moisture\
    \ observing\nsystem it will be necessary to establish, expand and improve\ncurrent\
    \ soil moisture observations, both in situ and remotely\nsensed. The in situ efforts\
    \ should focus on:\n– Developing a coordinated plan for soil moisture net-\nworks\
    \ at both the national and international levels.\n– Designing a supersite program,\
    \ approximately satellite\nfootprint size regions with high density measurements,\n\
    needed to provide the comprehensive datasets required\nfor satellite sensor evaluation\
    \ and calibration, and to\nprovide a basis for developing soil wetness algorithms\n\
    for satellite measurements and the evaluation of cli-\nmate model outputs. For\
    \ example, we expect the newly\nestablished National Ecological Observatory Network\n\
    (NEON) in the US and the densely sampled watershed\nvalidation networks operated\
    \ by USDA, to help serve as\na model for such efforts.\n– Enhancing consistency\
    \ and standardization of measure-\nments, data, and metadata.\n– Striving for\
    \ data continuity and automation.\n– Advancing data exchange.\nThe positive and\
    \ vital contributions of international orga-\nnizations such as WCRP, GEWEX and\
    \ GEO, the support of\nSpace Agencies, and the voluntary efforts of numerous in-\n\
    dividual scientists contributing to the ISMN have raised the\nconﬁdence that the\
    \ consciousness and willingness to realize\nsuch an integrated soil moisture observing\
    \ system are ubiq-\nuitous.\nFinally, we would like to emphasize that the ISMN\
    \ is a\ngrowing entity animated by the scientiﬁc community itself.\nWe therefore\
    \ solicit users to download, use, and give feed-\nback on the datasets currently\
    \ contained in the database, and\ninvite potential networks to enrich the collection\
    \ by shar-\ning their data with the ISMN. As was demonstrated by the\nsuccess\
    \ the Global Soil Moisture Data Bank (Robock et al.,\n2000), the beneﬁt of sharing\
    \ soil moisture data free of cost\nwith the scientiﬁc community is valuable not\
    \ only for data\nusers but also for the networks. Networks may become em-\nbedded\
    \ as key networks in international calibration and val-\nidation activities or\
    \ climate monitoring programs, e.g. like\nhappened to the ﬂux tower sites participating\
    \ to FLUXNET\n(Baldocchi et al., 2001) or the stations participating to the\n\
    Baseline Surface Radiation Network (Ohmura et al., 1998).\nThis in turn may lead\
    \ to vast international scientiﬁc recog-\nnition and pave the way for access to\
    \ extended funding re-\nsources.\nAcknowledgements. We greatly thank all data\

    Get rights and content Highlights • Advances in field phenotyping are needed to
    capitalize on developments in genetics. • We present developments in field phenotyping
    platforms for crop breeding. • Platforms need more focus on environmental monitoring
    and capturing field variability. • Improvements in data management and use will
    spread the adoption of field platforms. Constraints in field phenotyping capability
    limit our ability to dissect the genetics of quantitative traits, particularly
    those related to yield and stress tolerance (e.g., yield potential as well as
    increased drought, heat tolerance, and nutrient efficiency, etc.). The development
    of effective field-based high-throughput phenotyping platforms (HTPPs) remains
    a bottleneck for future breeding advances. However, progress in sensors, aeronautics,
    and high-performance computing are paving the way. Here, we review recent advances
    in field HTPPs, which should combine at an affordable cost, high capacity for
    data recording, scoring and processing, and non-invasive remote sensing methods,
    together with automated environmental data collection. Laboratory analyses of
    key plant parts may complement direct phenotyping under field conditions. Improvements
    in user-friendly data management together with a more powerful interpretation
    of results should increase the use of field HTPPs, therefore increasing the efficiency
    of crop genetic improvement to meet the needs of future generations. Previous

    sensingspatial variabilitystress tolerance Why is phenotyping so important in
    the breeding pipeline? Crop production must double by 2050 to meet the predicted
    production demands of the global population [1]. However, achieving this goal
    will be a significant challenge for plant breeders because crop yields would have
    to increase at a rate of 2.4% per year, yet the average rate of increase is only
    1.3%, with yields stagnating in up to 40% of land under cereal production 2, 3.
    Extensive breeding and agronomic efforts over the past 50 years have been responsible
    for tripling cereal yields [4]. Continuing advances in the techniques available
    to breeders offer the potential to increase the rate of genetic improvement [5].
    Attempts to exploit new molecular tools to their full potential (Figure 1), particularly
    the ability to dissect the genetics of quantitative traits such as yield and stress
    tolerance 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, are limited by our ability to phenotype. However, plant
    breeders and farmers have been making selections based on phenotypes long before
    the discovery of DNA and molecular markers. The development of improved varieties
    relies on the ability to identify the best genetic variation for advancement.
    Breeding is essentially a numbers game: the more crosses and environments used
    for selection, the greater the probability of identifying superior variation.
    Plant breeders want to be able to phenotype large numbers of lines rapidly and
    accurately identify the best progeny. To meet future needs there is a need to
    increase breeding efficiency. Advances in high-throughput genotyping have provided
    fast and inexpensive genomic information. Low cost, high-throughput genotyping
    has paved the way for the development of large mapping populations and diversity
    panels of thousands of recombinant inbred lines for phenotyping [11]. Although
    molecular breeding strategies, such as marker-assisted recurrent selection (MARS)
    and genomic selection, place greater focus on selections based on genotypic information,
    they still require phenotypic data [12]. In genomic selection, phenotypes are
    not used for selection but are used to train a prediction model [13]; whereas
    in MARS, a single phenotyping cycle is used to identify markers for subsequent
    selection through generations. Similarly, phenotyping is necessary to identify
    promising events in transgenic studies 14, 15. Given that molecular breeding populations
    can include up to 5000 lines, the ability to accurately characterize all lines
    simultaneously is challenging [11]. Advances in phenotyping are likely to be essential
    to capitalize on developments in conventional, molecular, and transgenic breeding
    and ensure genetic improvement of crops for future food security. Download : Download

    Redrawn from [20]. High-throughput phenotyping In recent years, there has been
    increased interest in high-throughput phenotyping platforms (HTPPs) 16, 17. Most
    HTPPs, both those run by the big transnational seed companies and the most advanced
    public plant research institutions around the world, such as the Australian Plant
    Phenomics Facility (http://www.plantphenomics.org.au/), the European Plant Phenotyping
    Network (http://www.plant-phenotyping-network.eu/eppn/structure), and the USDA
    (http://www.nifa.usda.gov/nea/plants/pdfs/whitepaper_finalUSDA.pdf), (http://www.wheatgenetics.org/downloads/Projects/HTP_ProjectNarrative_20130219.pdf)
    are fully automated facilities in greenhouses or growth chambers with robotics,
    precise environmental control, and remote sensing techniques to assess plant growth
    and performance. However, low-cost HTPP approaches are now starting to be developed
    [18]. In this review, we examine the need for high-throughput field phenotyping,
    the current technical developments, and the factors that limit its implementation,
    together with the future avenues that will pave the way for its wide adoption
    in practical breeding. Field phenotyping Although HTPPs enable detailed, non-invasive
    information to be captured throughout the plant life cycle in a carefully controlled
    environment, quantitative trait loci and candidate genes identified within controlled
    environments have generally not translated into gains in grain yield in the field
    19, 20, 21. Field conditions are notoriously heterogeneous and the inability to
    control environmental factors makes results difficult to interpret. However, results
    from controlled environments are far removed from the situation plants will experience
    in the field and, therefore, are difficult to extrapolate to the field. The problems
    associated with controlled environments are well established 6, 22, 23 (Figure
    2). For example, the volume of soil available to roots within a pot is considerably
    smaller than in the field, thereby reducing the amount of water and nutrients
    available to plants 24, 25, 26. The soil environment plays a crucial role in plant
    growth and development and is difficult to simulate under controlled conditions
    [27]. Drought stress phenotyping is particularly challenging because declining
    soil moisture content is associated with increased mechanical impedance in the
    field, which is an effect that is difficult to replicate within pots [28]. Moreover
    plants in the field do not growth isolate but configuring a canopy. Varietal improvement
    has heavily relied on multilocation screening within the target environment [29].
    Here, plants experience a range of stresses throughout their life cycle. In many
    cases, the environmental characteristics are not monitored and, hence, are poorly
    understood. This further complicates the ability to mimic the field environment
    under controlled conditions. Phenotyping under field environmental conditions
    remains a bottleneck for future breeding advances 7, 10, 19, 30, 31. Besides the
    above considerations, the choice of phenotyping under controlled conditions versus
    field environments largely depends on the purpose of phenotyping and the heritability
    of the trait, together with the logistical considerations of collecting the data
    [10]. For example, there are no feasible spatial or temporal options for testing
    high atmospheric CO2 in the field [32]. Download : Download full-size image Figure
    2. Continuum of environments for drought-resistance screening. The control over
    environmental factors decreases from the use of growth chambers to the target
    population environment (TPE), whereas the correlation of performance with the
    target commercial environments increases. Rainout shelters are designed to protect
    a selected area of land against receiving precipitation so that an experimentally
    controlled drought stress can be imposed on that area. Redrawn from [24]. Traits
    for phenotyping The most successful traits for evaluation integrate in time (throughout
    the crop cycle) and space (at the canopy level) the performance of the crop in
    terms of capturing resources (e.g., radiation, water, and nutrients) and how efficiently
    these resources are used 19, 33. Different methodological approaches have been
    proposed to evaluate these traits in the field (Figure 1). Using the criteria
    proposed in [20] they can be summarized into three categories: (i) proximal (remote)
    sensing and imaging, (ii) laboratory analyses of samples, and (iii) near-infrared
    reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) analysis in the harvestable part of the crop.
    Besides the choice of the most appropriate traits, it is also crucial to determine
    the key time(s) for their evaluation. Measuring these traits at more or less frequent
    intervals during the crop cycle together with the measurements of the harvestable
    components would be unfeasible (or at least impractical) and may even be negative
    in terms of the impact of the trait for breeding. Proximal (remote) sensing: different
    categories of sensors Remote sensing phenotyping methods are non-destructive,
    non-invasive approaches 20, 34, 35 based mostly on the information provided by
    visible/near-infrared (VIS-NIR) radiation reflected (or transmitted) and far-infrared
    (thermal) radiation emitted by the crop 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41. These methods
    are termed proximal in the sense that information is gathered ‘near’ the crop.
    Remote sensing techniques may be deployed in in situ screening for a wide range
    of breeding objectives, including yield potential, adaptation to abiotic (water
    stress, extreme temperatures, salinity) and biotic (susceptibility to pests and
    diseases) limiting conditions, and even quality traits. Many categories of traits
    may be measured under different environmental conditions using remote sensing
    approaches, ranging, for example, from green biomass through to photosynthetic
    transpirative gas exchange and on to quality traits or even to predict grain yield
    [39]. For example, the same authors [39] working with a set of 300 maize testcrosses
    grown under different water and temperature regimes reported that partial least
    square regression (PLSR) models from hyperspectral reflectance of maize explained
    up to 40% of the variation in grain yield in each trial, with a relative efficiency
    of selection of 0.88 and 0.68 using leaf and canopy reflectance, respectively.
    Moreover, strong agreement has been reported between remote sensing and imaging
    values of traits measured by HTPPs at the land and aerial levels, as well as through
    manual phenotyping approaches, with determination values ranging between 0.35
    and 0.82 in the case of cotton under different water regimes [42]. These results
    confirmed the ability of the phenotyping system to measure multiple traits rapidly
    and accurately. Concerning NIRS, it is already routinely used in breeding for
    a wide array of food and feed quality traits [43]. In fact, NIRS can be applied
    to drought or nutrient use efficiency screening, or other more general breeding/gene
    discovery objectives. The implementation in imaging formats of proximal sensing
    with VIS-NIR and far-infrared radiation has enabled the process of taking measurements
    to be upscaled: for example, from measuring a single plot to dissecting an entire
    trial composed of different plots, providing that the image has enough resolution
    (pixels). However, imaging speed is limited by post-processing, which may include
    image alignment, geometric and radiometric calibrations, atmospheric correction,
    automatic mosaicking, and algorithms for automatic image segmentation 44, 45.
    Proximal (remote) sensing and imaging techniques include different approaches.
    The approaches that are most implemented (feasible) for field phenotyping can
    be grouped into three different categories (see Box 1 for images): (i) VIS-NIR
    spectroradiometry (including multispectral and the even less developed hyperspectral
    imaging) [45], (ii) infrared thermometry and thermal imaging, and (iii) conventional
    digital photography (RGB color cameras). The first approach is undergoing rapid
    technical advances associated with the use of high-resolution full-range spectroradiometers
    that reach into the NIR region wavelengths around 2500 nm. This, together with
    the use of special adaptors with their own light source, enables such spectroradiometers
    to be used as field-portable NIRS devices, generating large amounts of data with
    a wide range of potential applications. Examples include the development of empirical
    models to assess specific photosynthetic characteristics related to radiation
    use efficiency [46], or to predict a complex trait such as grain yield [39], and
    the use of single spectroradiometrical indices to predict yield [41]. At the imaging
    level, hyperspectral sensors are being developed along similar lines, although
    it is not possible for them to carry their own light source (specifically for
    large-scale images), thus this may represent a limitation [44]. Nevertheless,
    hyperspectral imagery enables assessment of complex traits, such as canopy photosynthesis
    and fluorescence under natural sunlight conditions 45, 47. There are several software
    programs available to process information to extract phenotype data from images,
    including free options [10]. Box 1 Cameras for crop monitoring Different categories
    of imaging systems for remote sensing evaluation of vegetation are detailed below
    with examples of prototypes capable of being carried by UAPs of limited payload
    (Figure I). Download : Download full-size image Figure I. Examples of false-color
    images taken with different categories of cameras: (A) RGB/CIR, (B) multispectral,
    (C) hypespectral, and (D) thermal imaging. RGB/CIR cameras The combination of
    color infrared (CIR) and red, green, and blue light (called visible or RGB) imagery
    enables the estimation of green biomass (NDVI type of information). Miniaturization
    is advancing fast with cameras that weigh only 100 g and have spectral range bands
    in red, green, and NIR. Figure IA shows an image taken with a multispectral mono
    lens camera (ADC Lite) of three bands. Multispectral cameras Multispectral imagers
    are widely used for crop monitoring via remote sensing. They can acquire a limited
    number of spectral bands at once in the VIS-NIR regions. Besides vegetation indices
    for evaluating green biomass, multispectral imagers can be formulated to other
    different spectral indices targeting senescence evaluation, nutrient status, pigment
    degradation, photosynthetic efficiency, or water content [84]. Figure IB shows
    an image taken with a multispectral camera (miniMCA-6) of six lens. Hyperspectral
    visible and near-infrared imager The hyperspectral visible and near-infrared imager
    enables the acquisition of hundreds of images at once, covering the entire electromagnetic
    spectrum between the visible and the near-infrared regions in a continuous mode
    (wavelengths ranging from 400 to 900 nm). Other configurations cover the range
    from 1000 to 2500 nm. Therefore, it is possible to run empirical calibrations
    (like in a ‘NIRS mode’) against a wide and miscellaneous set of traits. Figure
    IC shows an image taken with a hyperspectral (Microhyperspec VNIR) camera. Long-wave
    infrared cameras or thermal imaging cameras Long-wave infrared cameras and thermal
    imaging cameras render infrared radiation in the range of μm as visible light.
    Potential use of thermal imaging in phenotyping includes predicting water stress
    in crops, disease, and pathogen detection in plants, evaluating the maturing of
    fruits and bruise detection in fruits and vegetables 50, 37, 85, 38. The low resolution
    of the imaging (current cameras are in the range of 640 × 500 pixels) may limit
    the use of such cameras from aerial platforms. Thermal images obtained from a
    UAP using this type of camera have a resolution in the range of 20–40 cm [41].
    Figure ID shows an image taken with a thermal (MIDAS) camera. For more information
    about imaging sensors, visit http://quantalab.ias.csic.es/pdf/. Conventional digital
    cameras (NDVI type work) Conventional digital cameras are low-cost instruments
    that enable, for example, plant cover (green biomass) or senescence to be estimated.
    Moreover, the software needed is usually freely available. A general limitation
    of spectroradiometrical approaches lies in the differences in plant architecture
    and developmental stage, together with the anisotropic characteristics of the
    leaf (mostly due to the leaf surface: roughness, trichomes, epicuticular waxes).
    These may negatively affect the estimation of traits (mostly of biochemical traits)
    by spectroradiometrical approaches [10]. The effect of leaf anisotropy is more
    evident in the remote sensing-based approaches that use reflected instead of transmitted
    radiation, which is the situation in the majority of systems. Moreover, care should
    be taken, for example, to standardize measures with plants at similar developmental
    stages and exhibiting a narrow range of variability in plant architecture, whereas
    sun elevation should also be taken into consideration because the majority of
    spectroradiometrical evaluations in the field use passive sensors. In the case
    of canopy temperature, variation in development and canopy architecture must be
    taken into account (e.g., plant height, soil covering, emerged spikes, leaf angle
    and size) when interpreting performance and selecting cooler breeding lines 48,
    49. This is in addition to the environmental variability (e.g., in light intensity,
    temperature, relative humidity, wind speed) and timing of measurements, which
    affects the accuracy of thermal measurements [50]. Digital photography is also
    a promising approach given the low cost of the sensor (i.e., a conventional camera)
    and access to free software for data processing that enables estimation of green
    biomass, soil cover, plant color 51, 52, or even agronomical components such as
    plant or inflorescence density. Moreover, alongside these approaches, other techniques
    are starting to be adopted for field phenotyping, such as the use of laser imaging
    detection and ranging (Lidar). This is an active remote sensing technique that
    uses Lidar sensors to directly measure the 3D distribution of plant canopies as
    well as subcanopy topography, thus providing high-resolution topographic maps
    and highly accurate estimates of vegetation height, cover, and canopy structure
    53, 54, 55. Furthermore, laser scanning and fluorescence enables evaluation of
    photosynthetic performance and has potential in areas such as plant pathology
    [56]. Field-based high-throughput phenotyping platforms By combining advances
    in remote sensing, aeronautics and high-performance, computing is paving the way
    for the development of field-based HTPPs. Recently, several platforms have been
    developed, ranging from ground-based to aerial systems (e.g., the Australian Plant
    Phenomics Facility, http://www.plantphenomics.org/hrppc/capabilities/technology).
    Ground-based HTPPs include modified vehicles equipped with a global positioning
    system (GPS) navigation device and sensors often referred to as ‘phenomobiles’.
    Different ‘phenomobiles’ have been developed within the past few years 20, 42,
    57, 58, 59, 60 (http://www.plant-phenotyping-network.eu/eppn/inra_diaphen). For
    example, in the case of cotton a system has been developed that carries four sets
    of sensors to measure canopy height, reflectance, and temperature simultaneously
    on four adjacent rows, enabling the collection of phenotypic data at a rate of
    0.84 ha h−1 [42]. The mounting of sensors (such as NIRS) on agricultural harvesters
    may also be included within the category of ‘phenomobiles’ 61, 62. Ground-based
    HTPPs enable data to be captured at the plot level and require little post-processing.
    However, this also limits the scale at which ground-based HTPPs can be used. Furthermore,
    simultaneous measurements of all plots within a trial are not possible with ground-based
    platforms.Aerial platforms are increasingly being considered as an alternative
    option to overcome limitations associated with ground-based HTPPs. Aerial HTPPs
    enable the rapid characterization of many plots within minutes. Initial aerial
    HTPPs used small airplanes (e.g., crop-dusting airplanes); however, this is costly
    and it is difficult to safely achieve the low speeds required for high-definition
    images at low altitude. The current generation of aerial HTPPs significantly varies
    in payload, initial costs, maintenance costs, and control. Recently developed
    alternatives include ‘phenotowers’ [63] and blimps [64]. However, this type of
    aerial HTPP has a maximum height of 50 m. Blimps are helium-filled balloons that
    can be held in a stationary position and have sensors mounted underneath. They
    can carry a heavy payload (several kilograms), enabling many sensors to be used
    concurrently; however, they require many people for control and considerable room
    for storage when inflated. Alternatives to blimps are unmanned aerial platforms
    (UAPs) such as polycopters (e.g., Ascending Technologies: http://www.asctec.de;
    MikroKopter: http://www.mikrokopter.de) and airplanes (see ‘Innovative agricultural
    technologies for sustainable intensification’ at the MAIZE Annual Report of the
    CGIAR Research Program: http://repository.cimmyt.org/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10883/3209/98018.pdf?sequence=1).
    Although the payload of UAPs is lower than blimps, they can generally carry up
    to 2 kg, enabling at least two sensors to be mounted for simultaneous image capture.
    UAPs enable greater flight control and autonomy and are becoming increasingly
    affordable. Unlike airplanes, polycopters can be maneuvered into a stationary
    position; however, advances in aeronautics and sensors now enable high-quality
    images to be obtained from unmanned airplanes. Furthermore, the autonomy and area
    covered by airplanes is larger and the risk of destruction by crashing lower than
    for polycopters. Most UAPs carry an RGB/CIR camera, together with a thermal-imaging
    sensor [and sometimes a conventional color (RGB) digital camera]. Replacing the
    RGB/CIR camera with a multispectral or hyperspectral imaging sensor increases
    the payload but opens up a huge range of new possibilities (Box 1). The software
    requirements for UAPs include programs to: (i) plan flight missions, (ii) gather
    the images, and (iii) extract the data for plots within the images. UAPs are controlled
    by an autopilot for autonomous flying; the ground control station and the UAP
    are radio linked, transmitting position, altitude, and status. The imager is operated
    from the ground station. Laboratory and NIRS analyses In addition to proximal
    sensing approaches, the analysis of plant samples, for example, the analysis of
    stable isotopes [65], may complement direct phenotyping under field conditions.
    When breeding for yield potential and adaption to abiotic stresses such as drought,
    carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C) in dry matter is a promising tool that frequently
    exhibits high heritability and genetic correlation with yield 66, 67, 68, and
    has already been applied to breeding programs [69]. The use of grain Δ13C relies
    on a good understanding of tested populations and assumes no confounding of genotypic
    differences in phenology, anthesis biomass, pre-anthesis water use, and remobilization
    of stem carbohydrates 19, 66, 69. Whereas Δ13C is still an expensive tool for
    use in large-scale phenotyping, there are low cost surrogates (see next paragraph).
    In addition, if analyzed through the regular (mass spectrometry) technique, Δ13C
    can still be used on just the tails to complement HTPP approaches. Other traits
    that may be deployed as indicators of transpiration and, hence, of water use are
    the total minerals accumulated in transpiring organs [70]. NIRS is regularly deployed
    not only at the laboratory level but also in harvesting machinery to analyze grain
    characteristics. When used in harvesting machinery, this technique secures a broad
    distribution of measurements within plots and covers substantially larger amounts
    of plot material than analyses at the laboratory level using conventional sample-based
    methods 61, 62. In any case, the near-infrared spectrum captures physical and
    chemical characteristics of the samples, either of vegetative plant tissues or
    harvested seeds. By using calibration models, several traits can be determined
    on the basis of a single spectrum. Thus, NIRS is regularly used to analyze, for
    example, the protein, nitrogen, starch and oil content, grain texture, and grain
    weight of (intact) seeds 20, 61, 62, 71. However, the same spectrum may be used
    to develop prediction models for analyzing traits of potential interest for phenotyping
    for stress adaptation, such as Δ13C, mineral content, or the composition of other
    stable isotopes 34, 72, 73. Although the precision of these indirect estimations
    may be lower than those of direct analysis, the rapid, low-cost, and non-destructive
    nature of NIRS may justify its use, at least in the early generations of a breeding
    program, as a first screening approach when thousands of genotypes need to be
    evaluated. Although considerable advances have been made for evaluating the aerial
    parts of plants, roots are still hidden in terms of phenotyping, despite their
    importance in capturing resources for the crop. A broad overview of the different
    approaches proposed for root phenotyping under field conditions is set out in
    Box 2. Box 2 Phenotyping roots Roots are notoriously difficult to phenotype in
    the field 26, 86. Besides technical considerations, screening under field conditions
    is limited by significant soil environment–genotype interactions [87]. Traditional
    studies have focused on excavation techniques, from which root depth and root
    length density can be determined. Trenching is labor intensive and slow. Recently,
    the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO)
    implemented a high-throughput soil-sampling system to evaluate the maximum root
    depth and distribution [86]. This system uses a hydraulic push press: 2–5 min
    per core and 200 cores (200 cm long) per day. The system is being used to assess
    the impact of root architecture traits on water uptake. To that end, continuous
    logging of soil water content (gypsum blocks) and canopy temperature is combined
    with root architecture. Another approach that has been proposed for use in graminaceous
    crops and that is less intensive in terms of the resources deployed is ‘shovelomics’
    [88]. Values for root architectural traits are derived from the visual scoring
    of roots, which includes in the case of maize (Zea mays), numbers, angles, and
    branching patterns of crown and brace roots. Several non-invasive (i.e., indirect)
    techniques have been proposed. These include, for example, electrical capacitance
    [89]. At the level of root imaging, ground-penetrating radar has been explored,
    but resolution limitations mean that it is still likely to be restricted to trees
    and woody plants 86, 90. The use of electrical resistance tomography, even if
    still mostly at the container level [91], is perhaps more promising for mapping
    soil moisture and root biomass in herbaceous crops in the field [92]. Other techniques
    such as magnetic resonance imaging are still restricted to use at the container
    level [63]. Root biomass and performance can also be assessed (indirectly) through
    the evaluation of shoot proxy traits. This is the case for the natural abundances
    of stable oxygen and deuterium isotopes in shoot water [93]. The increasing availability
    of laser analyzers is making such determination faster and less expensive than
    conventional mass spectrometry. Canopy temperature has been used for remote sensing
    of wheat (Triticum aestivum) lines with deeper roots [94]. In the same way, Δ13C
    in dry matter may also be a valuable indicator of differences in access to water
    by mature root systems 95, 96s. Shoot biomass may also be considered as an indirect
    indicator of root biomass and performance 86, 96. However, problems of reliance
    on indirect measures of root growth may be encountered under field conditions
    60, 86. More than traits and tools: spatial variability and environmental monitoring
    Earlier HTPP initiatives have largely focused on phenotyping and little emphasis
    has been placed on environmental monitoring and reducing error variances. The
    phenotyping environment plays a vital role in the quality of phenotypic data generated
    through experiments and, consequently, in the efficiency of breeding. Field variation
    increases error variances, thereby masking important genetic variation for key
    traits and reducing repeatability, regardless of the cost and precision of a phenotyping
    platform [74]. Spatial variation can be caused by several factors, including the
    soil, which is inherently heterogeneous even in relatively uniform experimental
    sites. HTTPs allow a larger number of genotypes to be phenotyped, thereby increasing
    the likelihood of soil variability masking genetic effects. In general, as the
    land requirement of an experiment increases the harder it becomes to find an area
    with minimum soil heterogeneity. Information on field variability can be incorporated
    into field designs by avoiding areas of high spatial variation [75]. The basic
    concept is to create homogeneous blocks in which the ‘noise’ factors are held
    constant, whereas the factor of interest (‘signal’) is allowed to vary. Earlier
    measurements of field variation relied on direct (i.e., destructive soil sampling)
    and subsequent laboratory analysis. However, advances in proximal and remote sensing
    technologies enable high-resolution mapping of spatial variability [76] (Figure
    1). Proximal sensors include cone penetrometers, which can be used to measure
    soil mechanical impedance and depth. However, measurements are time consuming
    and, therefore, soil penetrometers are of limited use for obtaining the necessary
    detail required to create field maps over large areas [28]. Apparent soil electrical
    conductivity is closely related to clay, water, and ionic content and electromagnetic
    surveys can be used to determine field gradients in soil texture 30, 60. Crop
    performance provides the best indicator of field variability. Imaging techniques
    in parallel with wireless sensor networks and geographical information systems
    will allow a more precise mapping and monitoring of, for example, spatial variability
    [77]. For example, aerial HTPPs that enable fast non-destructive GPS-linked measurements
    of biomass using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be used
    to measure field variability either on a single variety planted in the off-season
    to develop subsequent planting maps or within experiments to build up performance
    maps to guide planting of the next season. Compared with proximal sensors of field
    variability (Figure 1), aerial HTPPs allow the rapid characterization of experimental
    blocks (less than 30 min for 1 ha plus data processing). Environmental variability
    inconsistently affects phenotypic observation over both space and time and must
    be accounted for in any statistical models that are used to estimate parameters
    of interest [10]. Spatial modeling is a key requirement because of the size of
    the trials, the time taken to collate traits, and the use of high-throughput phenotyping
    approaches. In that context, multitrait mixed modeling looks promising for the
    analysis of traits collected by aerial remote sensing platforms where multiple
    traits derived from the same procedure may produce correlated errors [26]. Linear
    models have long been the mainstay of quantitative genetic experiments and are
    the most commonly applied statistical approach to understanding phenotypic variation.
    However, they have inherent limitations when measurements are not adequately replicated
    and not normally distributed. In this regard, alternatives such as the Bayesian
    inference may overcome the limitations imposed by a maximum-likelihood approach
    [10]. In HTPPs, the implementation of environmental characterization is essential
    to facilitate data interpretation, meta-data analysis, and, in the case of drought
    phenotyping, understanding patterns of water availability [74]. Weather data are
    frequently sourced from nearby weather stations at the end of experiments; however,
    soil moisture is often not measured [75]. The need for environmental data is particularly
    pertinent in drought screening where knowledge of soil moisture availability is
    necessary to ensure that the field environment and the type of drought imposed
    are representative of the target environment [56]. Real-time information on soil
    moisture can be used to facilitate irrigation decisions, which is becoming increasingly
    important with increased climatic variability in the off-season when managed drought
    phenotyping is often conducted. The development of wireless sensor networks to
    characterize both climatic and soil moisture conditions should enable real-time
    monitoring of environmental conditions (Figure 3). Download : Download full-size
    image Figure 3. Summary of the different components of the breeding process where
    high-throughput phenotyping is involved. These include evaluation of key traits
    at the right moment, assessment of spatial variability, environmental characterization,
    and further integration of all the information. A better understanding of the
    stresses prevailing under the target conditions is still needed [78]. Managed
    Environment Facilities are becoming more important as they permit selection under
    controlled stress [60]. Controlling environmental conditions increases the accuracy
    of performance measurements and the attribution of phenotypic effects to individual
    traits and the underlying genetic makeup [79]. Field phenotyping bottleneck HTPPs
    have benefitted in recent years from the rapid progress that has been made in
    the development of a wide array of technologies including novel sensors, image
    analysis and modeling, robotics, and remote control and data mining. Previously,
    time was the largest limitation to phenotyping, but HTPPs now allow plot-level
    measurements within seconds. However, the bottleneck that may slow down the full
    implementation of these platforms is the management of the huge amount of information
    generated 10, 50. Two of the main limiting factors that need to be improved are:
    data management and use of bioinformatics to mine the volumes of phenotypic data,
    and the way in which modeling is used to incorporate genotypic, phenotypic, environmental,
    and management data 48, 80. Advanced analysis tools are required beyond even the
    usual statistical tools [20]. We do not even have a physical concept of what some
    of the numbers obtained by HTPPs mean in terms of plant or crop performance [10].
    Much of the data are just mathematical transformations of numbers, but perhaps
    some linear combination of them will, for reasons we do not yet understand, have
    some correlation with important traits such as leaf angle and planting density
    [21]. However, in the case of information generated through hyperspectral sensors,
    the generation of a set of indices, even of a miscellaneous nature, does not enable
    full advantage to be taken of the hundreds of wavelengths measured. In this regard,
    the ‘NIRS approach’, although it represents construction of a purely empirical
    model, might use the most relevant information regardless of whether it has a
    clear physiological meaning or not [7]. Moreover, such an approach might share
    with genomic selection the possibility of training a model by adding new sets
    of data periodically. Pyramiding all levels of information (different categories
    of traits measured at different times, spatial variability, environmental information)
    in a coherent manner requires the setting down of a strong modeling foundation
    based on a wide but deep understanding of the ecophysiological and genetic factors
    determining crop performance. Above all, more user-friendly post-processing of
    the raw data generated is needed. Improved software tools to optimize automation
    and speed up robust data analysis should support such a trend [81]. Concluding
    remarks and future perspectives The capacity for undertaking precision phenotyping,
    particularly under repeatable and representative growing conditions in the field,
    is lagging far behind the capacity to generate genomic information. This is constraining
    breeding advances. Developments (e.g., sensors, platforms, and analytical capability)
    in HTPPs have enabled these measurements to be made in situ; however, the integration
    of data is lagging behind. Field phenotyping of the appropriate traits, using
    low cost, easy-to-handle tools, should become an integral and key component in
    the breeding pipeline. Using technological advances with regard to phenotyping
    instrumentation should also go hand-in-hand with methods to characterize and control
    field site variation (for improving repeatability), adopting appropriate experimental
    designs, selection of the right traits, and, finally, proper integration of heterogeneous
    datasets, analysis, and application, including prediction models 8, 19, 21, 82,
    83. Efficient integration of all the components of the system is needed to pave
    the way for the adoption of field HTPPs in the near future. This includes more
    user-friendly data management combined with data gathering and processing. Acknowledgments

    amounts of data have been produced, since the past decade as the miniaturization
    of Internet of things (IoT) devices increases. However, such data are not useful

    Relationship between IoT and big data analytics. Published in: IEEE Access ( Volume:
    5) Page(s): 5247 - 5261 Date of Publication: 29 March 2017 Electronic ISSN: 2169-3536
    DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2689040 Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction
    The development of big data and the Internet of things (IoT) is rapidly accelerating
    and affecting all areas of technologies and businesses by increasing the benefits
    for organizations and individuals. The growth of data produced via IoT has played
    a major role on the big data landscape. Big data can be categorized according
    to three aspects: (a) volume, (b) variety, and (c) velocity [1]. These categories
    were first introduced byGartner to describe the elements of big data challenges
    [2]. Immense opportunities are presented by the capability to analyze and utilize
    huge amounts of IoT data, including applications in smart cities, smart transport
    and grid systems, energy smart meters, and remote patient healthcare monitoring
    devices. The widespread popularity of IoT has made big data analytics challenging
    because of the processing and collection of data through different sensors in
    the IoT environment. The International Data Corporation (IDC) report indicates
    that the big data market will reach over US$125 billion by 2019 [3]. IoT big data
    analytics can be defined as the steps in which a variety of IoT data are examined
    [4] to reveal trends, unseen patterns, hidden correlations, and new information
    [5]. Companies and individuals can benefit from analyzing large amounts of data
    and managing huge amounts of information that can affect businesses [6]. Therefore,
    IoT big data analytics aims to assist business associations and other organizations
    to achieve improved understanding of data, and thus, make efficient and well-informed
    decisions. Big data analytics enables data miners and scientists to analyze huge
    amounts of unstructured data that can be harnessed using traditional tools [5].
    Moreover,big data analytics aims to immediately extract knowledgeable information
    using data mining techniques that help in making predictions, identifying recent
    trends, finding hidden information, and making decisions [7]. Techniques in data
    mining are widely deployed for both problem-specific methods and generalized data
    analytics. Accordingly, statistical and machine learning methods are utilized.
    IoT data are different from normal big data collected via systems in terms of
    characteristics because of the various sensors and objects involved during data
    collection, which include heterogeneity, noise, variety, and rapid growth. Statistics
    [8] show that the number of sensors will be increased by 1 trillion in 2030. This
    increase will affect the growth of big data. Introducing data analytics and IoT
    into big data requires huge resources, and IoT has the capability to offer an
    excellent solution. Appropriate resources and intensive applications of the platforms
    are provided by IoT services for effective communication among various deployed
    applications. Such process is suitable for fulfilling the requirements of IoT
    applications, and can reduce some challenges in the future of big data analytics.
    This technological amalgamation increases the possibility of implementing IoT
    toward a better direction. Moreover, implementing IoT and big data integration
    solutions can help address issues on storage, processing, data analytics, and
    visualization tools. It can also assist in improving collaboration and communication
    among various objects in a smart city [9]. Application areas, such as smart ecological
    environments, smart traffic, smart grids, intelligent buildings, and logistic
    intelligent management, can benefit from the aforementioned arrangement. Many
    studies on big data has focused on big data management; in particular, big data
    analytics has been surveyed [10], [11]. However, this survey focused on IoT big
    data in the context of the analytics of a huge amount of data. The contributions
    of this survey are as follows. State-of-the-art research efforts conducted in
    terms of big data analytics are investigated. An architecture for big IoT data
    analytics is proposed. Several unprecedented opportunities brought by data analytics
    in the IoT domain are introduced. Credible use cases are presented. Research challenges
    that remain to be addressed are identified and discussed. These contributions
    are presented from Sections 3 to 6. The conclusion is provided in Section 7. SECTION
    II. Overview of IoT and Big Data An overview of IoT technologies and big data
    is provided before the discussion. A. IoT IoT offers a platform for sensors and
    devices to communicate seamlessly within a smart environment and enables information
    sharing across platforms in a convenient manner. The recent adaptation of different
    wireless technologies places IoT as the next revolutionary technology by benefiting
    from the full opportunities offered by the Internet technology. IoT has witnessed
    its recent adoption in smart cities with interest in developing intelligent systems,
    such as smart office, smart retail, smart agriculture, smart water, smart transportation,
    smart healthcare, and smart energy [12], [13]. IoT has emerged as a new trend
    in the last few years, where mobile devices, transportation facilities, public
    facilities, and home appliances can all be used as data acquisition equipment
    in IoT. All surrounding electronic equipment to facilitate daily life operations,
    such as wristwatches, vending machines, emergency alarms, and garage doors, as
    well as home appliances, such as refrigerators, microwave ovens, air conditioners,
    and water heaters are connected to an IoT network and can be controlled remotely.
    Ciufo [14] stated that these devices “talk” to one another and to central controlling
    devices. Such devices deployed in different areas may collect various kinds of
    data, such as geographical, astronomical, environmental, and logistical data.
    A large number of communication devices in the IoT paradigm are embedded into
    sensor devices in the real world. Data collecting devices sense data and transmit
    these data using embedded communication devices. The continuum of devices and
    objects are interconnected through a variety of communication solutions, such
    as Bluetooth, WiFi, ZigBee, and GSM. These communication devices transmit data
    and receive commands from remotely controlled devices, which allow direct integration
    with the physical world through computer-based systems to improve living standards.
    Over 50 billion devices ranging from smartphones, laptops, sensors, and game consoles
    are anticipated to be connected to the Internet through several heterogeneous
    access networks enabled by technologies, such as radio frequency identification
    (RFID) and wireless sensor networks. Reference [15] mentioned that IoT could be
    recognized in three paradigms: Internet-oriented, sensors, and knowledge [16].
    The recent adaptation of different wireless technologies places IoT as the next
    revolutionary technology by benefiting from the full opportunities offered by
    Internet technology. B. Big Data The volume of data generated by sensors, devices,
    social media, health care applications, temperature sensors, and various other
    software applications and digital devices that continuously generate large amounts
    of structured, unstructured, or semi-structured data is strongly increasing. This
    massive data generation results in “big data” [17]. Traditional database systems
    are inefficient when storing, processing, and analyzing rapidly growing amount
    of data or big data [18]. The term “big data” has been used in the previous literature
    but is relatively new in business and IT [19]. An example of big data-related
    studies is the next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity; McKinsey
    Global Institute [20] defined big data as the size of data sets that are a better
    database system tool than the usual tools for capturing, storing, processing,
    and analyzing such data [18]. “The Digital Universe” study [21] labels big data
    technologies as a new generation of technologies and architectures that aim to
    take out the value from a massive volume of data with various formats by enabling
    high-velocity capture, discovery, and analysis. This previous study also characterizes
    big data into three aspects: (a) data sources, (b) data analytics, and (c) the
    presentation of the results of the analytics. This definition uses the 3V’s (volume,
    variety, velocity) model proposed by Beyer [2]. The model highlights an e-commerce
    trend in data management that faces challenges to manage volume or size of data,
    variety or different sources of data, and velocity or speed of data creation.
    Some studies declare volume as a main characteristic of big data without providing
    a pure definition [22]. However, other researchers introduced additional characteristics
    for big data, such as veracity, value, variability, and complexity [23], [24].
    The 3V’s model, or its derivations, is the most common descriptions of the term
    “big data.” SECTION III. Big Data Analytics Big data analytics involves the processes
    of searching a database, mining, and analyzing data dedicated to improve company
    performance [25]. Big data analytics is the process of examining large data sets
    that contain a variety of data types [4] to reveal unseen patterns, hidden correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful business information [5].
    The capability to analyze large amounts of data can help an organization deal
    with considerable information that can affect the business [6]. Therefore, the
    main objective of big data analytics is to assist business associations to have
    improved understanding of data, and thus, make efficient and well-informed decisions.
    Big data analytics enables data miners and scientists to analyze a large volume
    of data that may not be harnessed using traditional tools [5]. Big data analytics
    require technologies and tools that can transform a large amount of structured,
    unstructured, and semi-structured data into a more understandable data and metadata
    format for analytical processes. The algorithms used in these analytical tools
    must discover patterns, trends, and correlations over a variety of time horizons
    in the data [26]. After analyzing the data, these tools visualize the findings
    in tables, graphs, and spatial charts for efficient decision making. Thus, big
    data analysis is a serious challenge for many applications because of data complexity
    and the scalability of underlying algorithms that support such processes [27].
    Talia (2013) highlighted that obtaining helpful information from big data analysis
    is a critical matter that requires scalable analytical algorithms and techniques
    to return well-timed results, whereas current techniques and algorithms are inefficient
    to handle big data analytics. Therefore, large infrastructure and additional applications
    are necessary to support data parallelism. Moreover, data sources, such as high-speed
    data stream received from different data sources, have different formats, which
    makes integrating multiple sources for analytics solutions critical [28]. Hence,
    the challenge is focused on the performance of current algorithms used in big
    data analysis, which is not rising linearly with the rapid increase in computational
    resources [19]. Big data analytics processes consume considerable time to provide
    feedback and guidelines to users, whereas only a few tools [29] can process huge
    data sets within reasonable amount of processing time. By contrast, most of the
    remaining tools use the complicated trial-and-error method to deal with massive
    amounts of data sets and data heterogeneity [30]. Big data analytics systems exist.
    For example, the Exploratory Data Analysis Environment [31] is a big data visual
    analytics system that is used to analyze complex earth system simulations with
    large numbers of data sets. A. Existing Analytics Systems Different analytic types
    are used according to the requirements of IoT applications [32]. These analytic
    types are discussed in this subsection under real-time, off-line, memory-level,
    business intelligence (BI) level, and massive level analytics categories. Moreover,
    a comparison based on analytics types and their levels is presented in Table 1.
    TABLE 1 Comparison of Different Analytics Types and Their Levels Real-time analytics
    is typically performed on data collected from sensors. In this situation, data
    change constantly, and rapid data analytics techniques are required to obtain
    an analytical result within a short period. Consequently, two existing architectures
    have been proposed for real-time analysis: parallel processing clusters using
    traditional relational databases and memory-based computing platforms [33]. Greenplum
    [34] and Hana [35] are examples of real-time analytics architecture. Off-line
    analytics is used when a quick response is not required [32]. For example, many
    Internet enterprises use Hadoop-based off-line analytics architecture to reduce
    the cost of data format conversion [36]. Such analytics improves data acquisition
    efficiency. SCRIBE [37], Kafka [38], Time-Tunnel [39], and Chukwa [40] are examples
    of architectures that conduct off-line analytics and can satisfy the demands of
    data acquisition. Memory-level analytics is applied when the size of data is smaller
    than the memory of a cluster [32]. To date, the memory of clusters has reached
    terabyte (TB) level [41]. Therefore, several internal database technologies are
    required to improve analytical efficiency. Memory-level analytics is suitable
    for conducting real-time analysis. MongoDB [42] is an example of this architecture.
    BI analytics is adopted when the size of data is larger than the memory level,
    but in this case, data may be imported to the BI analysis environment [43]. BI
    analytic currently supports TB-level data [32]. Moreover, BI can help discover
    strategic business opportunities from the flood of data. In addition, BI analytics
    allows easy interpretation of data volumes. Identifying new opportunities and
    implementing an effective strategy provide competitive market advantage and long-term
    stability. Massive analytics is applied when the size of data is greater than
    the entire capacity of the BI analysis product and traditional databases [44].
    Massive analytics uses the Hadoop distributed file system for data storage and
    map/reduce for data analysis. Massive analytics helps create the business foundation
    and increases market competitiveness by extracting meaningful values from data.
    Moreover, massive analytics obtains accurate data that leverage the risks involved
    in making any business decision. In addition, massive analytics provides services
    effectively. B. Relationship Between IoT and Big Data Analytics Big data analytics
    is rapidly emerging as a key IoT initiative to improve decision making. One of
    the most prominent features of IoT is its analysis of information about “connected
    things.” Big data analytics in IoT requires processing a large amount of data
    on the fly and storing the data in various storage technologies. Given that much
    of the unstructured data are gathered directly from web-enabled “things,” big
    data implementations will necessitate performing lightning-fast analytics with
    large queries to allow organizations to gain rapid insights, make quick decisions,
    and interact with people and other devices. The interconnection of sensing and
    actuating devices provide the capability to share information across platforms
    through a unified architecture and develop a common operating picture for enabling
    innovative applications. The need to adopt big data in IoT applications is compelling.
    These two technologies have already been recognized in the fields of IT and business.
    Although, the development of big data is already lagging, these technologies are
    inter-dependent and should be jointly developed. In general, the deployment of
    IoT increases the amount of data in quantity and category; hence, offering the
    opportunity for the application and development of big data analytics. Moreover,
    the application of big data technologies in IoT accelerates the research advances
    and business models of IoT. The relationship between IoT and big data, which is
    shown in Figure 1, can be divided into three steps to enable the management of
    IoT data. The first step comprises managing IoT data sources, where connected
    sensors devices use applications to interact with one another. For example, the
    interaction of devices such as CCTV cameras, smart traffic lights, and smart home
    devices, generates large amounts of data sources with different formats. This
    data can be stored in low cost commodity storage on the cloud. In the second step,
    the generated data are called “big data,” which are based on their volume, velocity,
    and variety. These huge amounts of data are stored in big data files in shared
    distributed fault-tolerant databases. The last step applies analytics tools such
    as MapReduce, Spark, Splunk, and Skytree that can analyze the stored big IoT data
    sets. The four levels of analytics start from training data, then move on to analytics
    tools, queries, and reports. FIGURE 1. Relationship between IoT and big data analytics.
    Show All C. Big Data Analytics Methods Big data analytics aim to immediately extract
    knowledgeable information that helps in making predictions, identifying recent
    trends, finding hidden information, and ultimately, making decisions [7]. Data
    mining techniques are widely deployed for both problem-specific methods and generalized
    data analytics. Accordingly, statistical and machine learning methods are utilized.
    The evolution of big data also changes analytics requirements. Although the requirements
    for efficient mechanisms lie in all aspects of big data management [30], such
    as capturing, storage, preprocessing, and analysis; for our discussion, big data
    analytics requires the same or faster processing speed than traditional data analytics
    with minimum cost for high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety data [45].
    Various solutions are available for big data analytics, and advancements in developing
    and improving these solutions are being continuously achieved to make them suitable
    for new big data trends. Data mining plays an important role in analytics, and
    most of the techniques are developed using data mining algorithms according to
    a particular scenario. Knowledge on available big data analytics options is crucial
    when evaluating and choosing an appropriate approach for decision making. In this
    section, we present several methods that can be implemented for several big data
    case studies. Some of these analytics methods are efficient for big IoT data analytics.
    Diverse and tremendous size data sets contribute more in big data insights. However,
    this belief is not always valid because more data may have more ambiguities and
    abnormalities [7]. We present big data analytics methods under classification,
    clustering, association rule mining, and prediction categories. Figure 2 depicts
    and summarizes each of these categories. Each category is a data mining function
    and involves many methods and algorithms to fulfill information extraction and
    analysis requirements. For example, Bayesian network, support vector machine (SVM),
    and k -nearest neighbor (KNN) offer classification methods. Similarly, partitioning,
    hierarchical clustering, and co-occurrence are widespread in clustering. Association
    rule mining and prediction comprise significant methods. FIGURE 2. Overview of
    big data analytics methods. Show All Classification is a supervised learning approach
    that uses prior knowledge as training data to classify data objects into groups
    [46]. A predefined category is assigned to an object, and thus, the objective
    of predicting a group or class for an object is achieved (see Figure 2). Finding
    unknown or hidden patterns is more challenging for big IoT data. Furthermore,
    extracting valuable information from large data sets to improve decision making
    is a critical task. A Bayesian network is a classification method that offers
    model interpretability. Bayesian networks are efficient for analyzing complex
    data structures revealed through big data rather than traditional structured data
    formats. These networks are directed acyclic graphs, where nodes are random variables
    and edges denote conditional dependency [47]. Naïve, selective naïve, semi-naïve
    Bayes, and Bayes multi-nets are the proposed categories for classification [48].
    Analyzing data patterns and creating groups are efficiently performed using SVM,
    which is also classification approach for big data analytics. SVM utilizes statistical
    learning theory to analyze data patterns and create groups. Several applications
    of SVM classification in big data analytics include text classification [49],
    pattern matching [50], health diagnostics [51], and commerce. Similarly, KNN is
    typically designed to provide efficient mechanisms for finding hidden patterns
    from big data sets, such that retrieved objects are similar to the predefined
    category [52]. Using cases further improve the KNN algorithm for application in
    anomaly detection [53], high-dimensional data [54], and scientific experiments
    [55]. Classification has other extensions while adopting a large number of artificial
    intelligence and data mining techniques. Consequently, classification is one of
    the widespread data mining techniques for big data analytics. Clustering is another
    data mining technique used as a big data analytics method. Contrary to classification,
    clustering uses an unsupervised learning approach and creates groups for given
    objects based on their distinctive meaningful features [56]. As we have presented
    in Figure 2 that grouping a large number of objects in the form of clusters makes
    data manipulation simple. The well-known methods used for clustering are hierarchical
    clustering and partitioning. The hierarchical clustering approach keeps combining
    small clusters of data objects to form a hierarchical tree and create agglomerative
    clusters. Divisive clusters are created in the opposite manner by dividing a single
    cluster that contains all data objects into smaller appropriate clusters [57].
    Market analysis and business decision making are the most significant applications
    of big data analytics. The process of association rule mining involves identifying
    interesting relationships among different objects, events, or other entities to
    analyze market trends, consumer buying behavior, and product demand predictions
    (see Figure 2). Association rule mining [58] focuses on identifying and creating
    rules based on the frequency of occurrences for numeric and non-numeric data.
    Data processing is performed in two manners under association rules. First, sequential
    data processing uses priori-based algorithms, such as MSPS [59] and LAPIN-SPAM
    [60], to identify interaction associations. Another significant data processing
    approach under association rule is temporal sequence analysis, which uses algorithms
    to analyze event patterns in continuous data. Predictive analytics use historical
    data, which are known as training data, to determine the results as trends or
    behavior in data. SVM and fuzzy logic algorithms are used to identify relationships
    between independent and dependent variables and to obtain regression curves for
    predictions, such as for natural disasters. Furthermore, customer buying predictions
    and social media trends are analyzed through predictive analytics [61] (see Table
    2). In the case of big data analytics, processing requirements are modified according
    to the nature and volume of data. Fast data access and mining methods for structured
    and unstructured data are major concerns related to big data analytics. Furthermore,
    data representation is a significant requirement in big data analytics. Time series
    analysis reduces high dimensionality associated with big data and offers representation
    for improved decision making. Research related to time series representation includes
    ARMA [62], bitmaps [63], and wavelet functions [64]. TABLE 2 Applications of Big
    Data Mining for IoT The big data analytics methods discussed in this section are
    widely adopted in many application areas of big data, such as disaster management,
    healthcare, business, industry, and e-governance. In Table 2, we present the application
    areas of big data mining functionalities that are elaborated in this section,
    ‘ ✓ ’ is used to show the support for an application whereas ‘-’ denotes that
    it is not obvious whether the method supports to an application or not. In particular,
    Table 2 shows that classification methods are suitable for medical imaging, industry,
    speech recognition, natural language processing, and e-governance. Clustering
    and association rule-based data analytics methods are applicable to industry and
    e-governance and are well adopted in healthcare, e-commerce, and bioinformatics.
    Predictive analytics are useful for disaster and market predictions, whereas time
    series analysis is used in disaster forecasting, medical imaging, speech recognition,
    social network analysis, and e-governance. D. IoT Architecture for Big Data Analytics
    The architectural concept of IoT has several definitions based on IoT domain abstraction
    and identification. It offers a reference model that defines relationships among
    various IoT verticals, such as, smart traffic, smart home, smart transportation,
    and smart health. The architecture for big data analytics offers a design for
    data abstraction. Furthermore, this standard provides a reference architecture
    that builds upon the reference model. Many IoT architectures are found in the
    literature [13], [66], [67]. For example, [13] offered an IoT architecture with
    cloud computing at the center and a model of end-to-end interaction among various
    stakeholders in a cloud-centric IoT framework for better comparison with the proposed
    IoT architecture. This architecture is achieved by seamless ubiquitous sensing,
    data analytics, and information representation with IoT as the unifying architecture.
    However, the current architecture focuses on IoT with regard to communications.
    To our knowledge, our proposed architecture, which integrates IoT and big data
    analytics, has not been studied in the current literature. Figure 3 illustrates
    the IoT architecture and big data analytics. In this figure, the sensor layer
    contains all the sensor devices and the objects, which are connected through a
    wireless network. This wireless network communication can be RFID, WiFi, ultra-wideband,
    ZigBee, and Bluetooth. The IoT gateway allows communication of the Internet and
    various webs. The upper layer concerns big data analytics, where a large amount
    of data received from sensors are stored in the cloud and accessed through big
    data analytics applications. These applications contain API management and a dashboard
    to help in the interaction with the processing engine. FIGURE 3. IoT architecture
    and big data analytics. Show All A novel meta-model-based approach for integrating
    IoT architecture objects is proposed. The concept is semi-automatically federated
    into a holistic digital enterprise architecture environment. The main objective
    is to provide an adequate decision support for complex business, architecture
    management with the development of assessment systems, and IT environment. Thus,
    architectural decisions for IoT are closely connected with code implementation
    to allow users to understand the integration of enterprise architecture management
    with IoT. SECTION IV. Use Cases This section presents a number of use cases for
    big IoT data analytics. Although the use cases are relevant to IoT applications,
    the choices have been guided for the ones that are most commonly used in IoT applications
    and for the amount of data that can be generated for analytics. A. Smart Metering
    Smart metering is one of the IoT application use cases that generates a large
    amount of data from different sources, such as smart grids, tank levels, and water
    flows, and silos stock calculation, in which processing takes a long time even
    on a dedicated and powerful machine [68]. A smart meter is a device that electronically
    records consumption of electric energy data between the meter and the control
    system. Collecting and analyzing smart meter data in IoT environment assist the
    decision maker in predicting electricity consumption. Furthermore, the analytics
    of a smart meter can also be used to forecast demands to prevent crises and satisfy
    strategic objectives through specific pricing plans. Thus, utility companies must
    be capable of high-volume data management and advanced analytics designed to transform
    data into actionable insights. B. Smart Transportation A smart transportation
    system is an IoT-based use case that aims to support the smart city concept. A
    smart transportation system intends to deploy powerful and advanced communication
    technologies for the management of smart cities. Traditional transportation systems,
    which are based on image processing, are affected by weather conditions, such
    as heavy rains and thick fog. Consequently, the captured image may not be clearly
    visible. The design of an e-plate system [69] using RFID technology provides a
    good solution for intelligent monitoring, tracking, and identification of vehicles.
    Moreover, introducing IoT into vehicular technologies will enable traffic congestion
    management to exhibit significantly better performance than the existing infrastructure.
    This technology can improve existing traffic systems in which vehicles can effectively
    communicate with one another in a systematic manner without human intervention.
    Satellite navigation systems and sensors can also be applied in trucks, ships,
    and airplanes in real time. The routing of these vehicles can be optimized by
    using the bulk of available public data, such as traffic jams, road conditions,
    delivery addresses, weather conditions, and locations of refilling stations. For
    example, in case of runtime address change, the updated information (route, cost)
    can be optimized, recalculated, and passed on to drivers in real time. Sensors
    incorporated into these vehicles can also provide real-time information to measure
    engine health, determine whether equipment requires maintenance, and predict errors
    [70]. C. Smart Supply Chains Embedded sensor technologies can communicate bidirectionally
    and provide remote accessibility to over 1 million elevators worldwide [71]. The
    captured data are used by on-and off-site technicians to run diagnostics and repair
    options to make appropriate decisions, which result in increased machine uptime
    and enhanced customer service. Ultimately, big IoT data analytics allows a supply
    chain to execute decisions and control the external environment. IoT-enabled factory
    equipment will be able to communicate within data parameters (i.e., machine utilization,
    temperature) and optimize performance by changing equipment settings or process
    workflow [72]. In-transit visibility is another use case that will play a vital
    role in future supply chains in the presence of IoT infrastructure. Key technologies
    used by in-transit visibility are RFIDs and cloud-based Global Positioning System
    (GPS), which provide location, identity, and other tracking information. These
    data will be the backbone of supply chains supported by IoT technologies. The
    information gathered by equipment will provide detailed visibility of an item
    shipped from a manufacturer to a retailer. Data collected via RFID and GPS technologies
    will allow supply chain managers to enhance automated shipment and accurate delivery
    information by predicting time of arrival. Similarly, managers will be able to
    monitor other information, such as temperature control, which can affect the quality
    of in-transit products. D. Smart Agriculture Smart agriculture is a beneficial
    use case in big IoT data analytics. Sensors are the actors in the smart agriculture
    use case. They are installed in fields to obtain data on moisture level of soil,
    trunk diameter of plants, microclimate condition, and humidity level, as well
    as to forecast weather. Sensors transmit obtained data using network and communication
    devices. These data pass through an IoT gateway and the Internet to reach the
    analytics layer shown in Table 1. The analytics layer processes the data obtained
    from the sensor network to issue commands. Automatic climate control according
    to harvesting requirements, timely and controlled irrigation, and humidity control
    for fungus prevention are examples of actions performed based on big data analytics
    recommendations. E. Smart Grid The smart grid is a new generation of power grid
    in which managing and distributing electricity between suppliers and consumers
    is upgraded using two-way communication technologies and computing capabilities
    to improve reliability, safety, efficiency with real-time control, and monitoring
    [73], [74]. One of the major challenges in a power system is integrating renewable
    and decentralized energy. Electricity systems require a smart grid to manage the
    volatile behavior of distributed energy resources (DERs) [75]. However, most energy
    systems have to follow governmental laws and regulations, as well as consider
    business analysis and potential legal constraints [76]. Grid sensors and devices
    continuously and rapidly generate data related to control loops and protection
    and require real-time processing and analytics along with machine-to-machine (M2M)
    or human-to-machine (HMI) interactions to issue control commands to the system.
    However, the system must fulfill visualization and reporting requirements. F.
    Smart Traffic Light System The smart traffic light system consists of nodes that
    locally interact with IoT sensors and devices to detect the presence of vehicles,
    bikers, and pedestrians. These nodes communicate with neighboring traffic lights
    to measure the speed and distance of approaching transportation means and manage
    green traffic signals [77]. IoT data gathered using the system require real-time
    analytics processing to perform necessary tasks, such as changing the timing cycles
    according to traffic conditions, sending informative signals to neighboring nodes,
    and detecting approaching vehicles that use IoT sensors and devices to prevent
    long queues or accidents. Moreover, smart traffic light systems can send their
    collected IoT data to cloud storage for further analytics. Table 3 presents the
    use cases of IoT big data analytics. TABLE 3 Comparison of IoT Big Data Analytics
    use Cases As shown in Table 3, most use cases are related to M2M communication
    technologies and decrease the role of human interaction. However, the technologies
    use prediction methods and decision-making techniques to improve real-time control,
    monitoring, and performance. Textual data are among the common data types generated
    by IoT devices, which are mostly sensors and cameras. Text-based data are suitable
    for analysis by distributed file systems, such as Hadoop. SECTION V. Opportunities
    IoT is currently considered one of the most profound transitions in technology.
    Current IoT provides several data analytics opportunities for big data analytics.
    Figure 4 shows the examples of use cases and opportunities discussed in Sections
    4 and 5. FIGURE 4. Example of use cases and opportunities for big IoT data analytics
    architecture. Show All A. E-Commerce Big IoT data analytics offers well-designed
    tools to process real-time big data, which produce timely results for decision
    making. Big IoT data exhibit heterogeneity, increasing volume, and real-time data
    processing features. The convergence of big data with IoT brings new challenges
    and opportunities to build a smart environment. Big IoT data analytics has widespread
    applications in nearly every industry. However, the main success areas of analytics
    are in e-commerce, revenue growth, increased customer size, accuracy of sale forecast
    results, product optimization, risk management, and improved customer segmentation.
    B. Smart Cities Big data collected from smart cities offer new opportunities in
    which efficiency gains can be achieved through an appropriate analytics platform/infrastructure
    to analyze big IoT data. Various devices connect to the Internet in a smart environment
    and share information. Moreover, the cost of storing data has been reduced dramatically
    after the invention of cloud computing technology. Analysis capabilities have
    made huge leaps. Thus, the role of big data in a smart city can potentially transform
    every sector of the economy of a nation. Hadoop with YARN resource manager has
    offered recent advancement in big data technology to support and handle numerous
    workloads, real-time processing, and streaming data ingestion. C. Retail and Logistics
    IoT is expected to play a key role as an emerging technology in the area of retail
    and logistics. In logistics, RFID keeps track of containers, pallets, and crates.
    In addition, considerable advancements in IoT technologies can facilitate retailers
    by providing several benefits. However, IoT devices generate large amounts of
    data on a daily basis. Thus, powerful data analytics enables enterprises to gain
    insights from the voluminous amounts of data produced through IoT technologies.
    Applying data analytics to logistic data sets can improve the shipment experience
    of customers. Moreover, retail companies can earn additional profit by analyzing
    customer data, which can predict the trends and demands of goods. By looking into
    customer data, optimizing pricing plans and seasonal promotions can be planned
    efficiently to maximize profit. D. Healthcare Recent years have witnessed tremendous
    growth in smart health monitoring devices. These devices generate enormous amounts
    of data. Thus, applying data analytics to data collected from fetal monitors,
    electrocardiograms, temperature monitors, or blood glucose level monitors can
    help healthcare specialists efficiently assess the physical conditions of patients.
    Moreover, data analytics enables healthcare professionals to diagnose serious
    diseases in their early stages to help save lives. Furthermore, data analytics
    improves the clinical quality of care and ensures the safety of patients. In addition,
    physician profile can be reviewed by looking into the history of treatment of
    patients, which can improve customer satisfaction, acquisition, and retention.
    SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Future Directions IoT and big data analytics have
    been extensively accepted by many organizations. However, these technologies are
    still in their early stages. Several existing research challenges have not yet
    been addressed. This section presents several challenges in the field of big IoT
    data analytics. A. Privacy Privacy issues arise when a system is compromised to
    infer or restore personal information using big data analytics tools, although
    data are generated from anonymous users. With the proliferation of big data analytics
    technologies used in big IoT data, the privacy issue has become a core problem
    in the data mining domain. Consequently, most people are reluctant to rely on
    these systems, which do not provide solid service-level agreement (SLA) conditions
    regarding user personal information theft or misuse. In fact, the sensitive information
    of users has to be secured and protected from external interference. Although
    temporary identification, anonymity, and encryptions provide several ways to enforce
    data privacy, decisions have to be made with regard to ethical factors, such as
    what to use, how to use, and why use generated big IoT data [7]. Another security
    risk associated with IoT data is the heterogeneity of the types of devices used
    and the nature of generated data, such as raw devices, data types, and communication
    protocols. These devices can have different sizes and shapes outside the network
    and are designed to communicate with cooperative applications. Thus, to authenticate
    these devices, an IoT system should assign a non-repudiable identification system
    to each device. Moreover, enterprises should maintain a meta-repository of these
    connected devices for auditing purposes. This heterogeneous IoT architecture is
    new to security professionals, and thus, results in increased security risks.
    Consequently, any attack in this scenario compromises system security and disconnects
    interconnected devices. In the context of big IoT data, security and privacy are
    the key challenges in processing and storing huge amounts of data. Moreover, to
    perform critical operations and host private data, these systems highly rely on
    third party services and infrastructure. Therefore, an exponential growth in data
    rate causes difficulty in securing each and every portion of critical data. As
    previously discussed, existing security solutions (Karim, 2016 #86) are no long
    applicable to providing complete security in big IoT data scenarios. Existing
    algorithms are not designed for the dynamic observation of data, and thus, are
    not effectively applied. Legacy data security solutions are specifically designed
    for static data sets, whereas current data requirements are changing dynamically
    (Lafuente, 2015). Thus, deploying these security solutions is difficult for dynamically
    increasing data. In addition, legislative and regulatory issues should be considered
    while signing SLAs. With regard to data generated through IoT, the following security
    problems can emerge [78]: (a) timely updates - difficulty in keeping systems up
    to date, (b) incident management - identifying suspicious traffic patterns among
    legitimate ones and possible failure to capture unidentifiable incidents, (c)
    interoperability - proprietary and vendor-specific procedures will pose difficulties
    in finding hidden or zero day attacks, (d) and protocol convergence - although
    IPv6 is currently compatible with the latest specifications, this protocol has
    yet to be fully deployed. Therefore, the application of security rules over IPv4
    may not be applicable to protecting IPv6. At present, no answer can address these
    challenges and manage the security and privacy of interconnected devices. However,
    the following guidelines can overcome these adversities. (a) First, a true open
    ecosystem with standard APIs is necessary to avoid interoperability and reliability
    problems. (b) Second, devices must be well protected while communicating with
    peers. (c) Third, devices should be hardcoded with the best security practices
    to protect against common security and privacy threats. B. Data Mining Data mining
    methods provide efficient and best-fitting predictive or descriptive solutions
    for big data that can also be generalized for new data [45]. The evolution of
    big IoT data and cloud computing platforms has brought the challenges of data
    exploration and information extraction [79]. However, for the overall big IoT
    data architecture, Figure 5 presents the primary challenges related to processing
    and data mining. FIGURE 5. Big data mining issues in IoT. Show All Exhaustive
    data reads/writes: The high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety qualities
    of big IoT data challenge exploration, integration, heterogeneous communication,
    and extraction processes. The size and heterogeneity of data impose new data mining
    requirements, and diversity in data sources also poses a challenge [80]–[82].
    Furthermore, compared with small data sets, large data sets comprise more abnormalities
    and ambiguities that require additional preprocessing steps, such as cleansing,
    reduction, and transmission [23], [83]. Another issue lies in the extraction of
    exact and knowledgeable information from the large volumes of diverse data. Consequently,
    obtaining accurate information from complex data requires analyzing data properties
    and finding association among different data points. Researchers have introduced
    parallel and sequential programming models and proposed different algorithms to
    minimize query response time while dealing with big data. Moreover, researchers
    have selected existing data mining algorithms in different manners to (a) improve
    single source knowledge discovery, (b) implement data mining methods for multi-source
    platforms, and (c) study and analyze dynamic data mining methods and stream data
    [84]. Hence, parallel k -means algorithm [85] and parallel association rule mining
    methods [65] are introduced. However, the need to devise algorithms remains to
    provide compatibility with the latest parallel architectures. Moreover, synchronization
    issues may occur in parallel computing, while information is exchanged within
    different data mining methods. This bottleneck of data mining methods has become
    an open issue in big IoT data analytics that should be addressed. C. Visualization
    Visualization is an important entity in big data analytics, particularly when
    dealing with IoT systems where data are generated enormously. Furthermore, conducting
    data visualization is difficult because of the large size and high dimension of
    big data. This situation shows underlying trends and a complete picture of parsed
    data. Therefore, big data analytics and visualization should work seamlessly to
    obtain the best results from IoT applications in big data. However, visualization
    in the case of heterogeneous and diverse data (unstructured, structured, and semi-structured)
    is a challenging task. Designing visualization solution that is compatible with
    advanced big data indexing frameworks is a difficult task. Similarly, response
    time is a desirable factor in big IoT data analytics. Consequently, cloud computing
    architectures supported with rich GUI facilities can be deployed to obtain better
    insights into big IoT data trends [86]. Different dimensionality reduction methods
    have been introduced as a result of complex and high-dimensional big IoT data
    [87], [88]. However, these methods are unsuitable for all types of presented data.
    Similarly, when fine-grained dimensions are visualized effectively, the probability
    to identify observable correlations, patterns, and outliners is high [89]. Moreover,
    data should be kept locally to obtain usable information efficiently because of
    power and bandwidth constraints. In addition, visualization software should run
    with the concept of reference locality to achieve efficient outcome in an IoT
    environment. Given that the amount of big IoT data is increasing rapidly, the
    requirement of enormous parallelization is a challenging task in visualization.
    Thus, to decompose a problem into manageable independent tasks to enforce concurrent
    execution of queries is a challenge for parallel visualization algorithms [90].
    At present, most big data visualization tools used for IoT exhibit poor performance
    results in terms of functionality, scalability, and response time. To provide
    effective uncertainty-aware visualization during the visual analytics process,
    avoiding uncertainty imposes a considerable challenge [32]. Furthermore, several
    important issues are addressed [91], such as (a) visual noise - most data set
    objects are closely related to one another, and thus, users may perceive different
    results of the same type; (b) information loss - applying reduction methods to
    visible data sets can cause information loss; (c) large image observation - data
    visualization tools have inherent problems with respect to aspect ratio, devise
    resolution, and physical perception limits; (d) frequently changing image - users
    will not notice rapid data changes in an output; and (e) high performance requirements
    - high performance requirements are imposed because data are generated dynamically
    in an IoT environment. Moreover, methods supported by advanced analytics enable
    interactive graphics on laptops, desktops, or mobile devices, such as smartphones
    and tablets [92]. Real-time analytics is another consideration highlighted in
    IoT architectures. Several guidelines on visualization in big data are presented
    [93], such as (a) data awareness, i.e., appropriate domain expertise, (b) data
    quality - cleaning data using information management or data governance policies,
    (c) meaningful results - data clustering is used to provide high-level abstraction
    such that the visibility of smaller groups of data is possible, and (d) outliers
    should be removed from the data or treated as a separate entity. Reference [94]
    suggested that visualization should adhere to the following guidelines: (a) the
    system should provide special attention to metadata, (b) visualization software
    should be interactive and should require maximum user involvement, and (c) tools
    should be built based on the dynamic nature of the generated data. D. Integration
    Integration refers to having a uniform view of different formats. Data integration
    provides a single view of the data arriving from different sources and combines
    the view of data [95]. Data integration includes all processes involved in collecting
    data from different sources, as well as in storing and providing data with a unified
    view. For each moment, different forms of data are continuously generated by social
    media, IoT, and other communication and telecommunication approaches. The produced
    data can be categorized into three groups: (a) structured data, such as data stored
    in traditional database systems, including tables with rows and columns; (b) semi-structured,
    such as HTML, XML, and Json files; and (c) unstructured data, such as videos,
    audios, and images. Good data offer good information; however, this relationship
    is only achieved through data integration [96]. Integrating diverse data types
    is a complex task in merging different systems or applications [97]. Overlapping
    the same data, increasing performance and scalability, and enabling real-time
    data access are among the challenges associated with data integration that should
    be addressed in the future. Another challenge is to adjust structures in semi-structured
    and unstructured data before integrating and analyzing these types of data [98].
    Information, such as entities and relationships, can be extracted from textual
    data by using available technologies in the eras of text mining, machine learning,
    natural processing, and information extraction. However, new technologies should
    be developed to extract images, videos, and other information from other non-text
    formats of unstructured data [98]. Text mining is expected to be conducted by
    applying several specialized extractors on the same text. Hence, managing and
    integrating different extraction results from a certain data source require other
    techniques [99]. SECTION VII. Conclusion The growth rate of data production has
    increased drastically over the past years with the proliferation of smart and
    sensor devices. The interaction between IoT and big data is currently at a stage
    where processing, transforming, and analyzing large amounts of data at a high
    frequency are necessary. We conducted this survey in the context of big IoT data
    analytics. First, we explored recent analytics solutions. The relationship between
    big data analytics and IoT was also discussed. Moreover, we proposed an architecture
    for big IoT data analytics. Furthermore, big data analytics types, methods, and
    technologies for big data mining were presented. Some credible use cases were
    also provided. In addition, we explored the domain by discussing various opportunities
    brought about by data analytics in the IoT paradigm. Several open research challenges
    were discussed as future research directions. Finally, we concluded that existing
    big IoT data analytics solutions remained in their early stages of development.
    In the future, real-time analytics solution that can provide quick insights will
    be required. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

    Abstract: 6G and beyond will fulfill the requirements of a fully connected world
    and provide ubiquitous wireless connectivity for all. Transformative solutions
    are expected to drive the surge for accommodating a rapidly growing number of
    intelligent devices and services. Major technological breakthroughs to achieve
    connectivity goals within 6G include: (i) a network operating at the THz band
    with much wider spectrum resources, (ii) intelligent communication environments
    that enable a wireless propagation environment with active signal transmission
    and reception, (iii) pervasive artificial intelligence, (iv) large-scale network
    automation, (v) an all-spectrum reconfigurable front-end for dynamic spectrum
    access, (vi) ambient backscatter communications for energy savings, (vii) the
    Internet of Space Things enabled by CubeSats and UAVs, and (viii) cell-free massive
    MIMO communication networks. In this roadmap paper, use cases for these enabling
    techniques as well as recent advancements on related topics are highlighted, and
    open problems with possible solutions are discussed, followed by a development
    timeline outlining the worldwide efforts in the realization of 6G. Going beyond
    6G, promising early-stage technologies such as the Internet of NanoThings, the
    Internet of BioNanoThings, and quantum communications, which are expected to have
    a far-reaching impact on wireless communications, have also been discussed at
    length in this paper. The envisioned key enabling technologies for 6G and beyond

    I. Introduction Wireless communication systems have experienced substantial revolutionary
    progress over the past few years. Various stakeholders, including commercial solutions
    providers, academic research groups, standards bodies, and end-users, have all
    greatly benefited from the radical changes led by the most recent 5G developments,
    which include paradigm-defining techniques such as network softwarization and
    virtualization, massive MIMO, ultra-densification, and the introduction of new
    frequency bands. Numerous burgeoning applications and verticals, including virtual
    and augmented reality (VAR), e-commerce, contactless payment, machine-to-machine
    communications, and enhanced mobile broadband, among others, have demonstrated
    the vast potential of 5G, which continues to evolve and adapt to a wide variety
    of emerging use cases. However, as societal needs continue to evolve, there has
    been a marked rise in a plethora of emerging use cases that cannot be served satisfactorily
    with 5G. For example, the next generation of VAR, i.e., holographic teleportation,
    requires Tbps-level data rates and microsecond-level latency, which cannot be
    achieved with even the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands within 5G. Further,
    increasing industrial automation and the move from Industry 4.0 to the upcoming
    Industry X.0 paradigm will push connectivity density well beyond the 10 6 k m
    2 metric that 5G is designed for, in addition to requiring an overhaul of existing
    network management practices. Further, an increase in the connection density will
    also result in demands for improved energy efficiency, which 5G is not designed
    for. Consequently, the research community has gravitated towards addressing the
    aforementioned major challenges, and we posit that ongoing research in the domains
    of terahertz band communications, intelligent surfaces and environments, and network
    automation, for example, may very well hold the key to the future of wireless.
    To this end, an amalgamation of societal needs and technological breakthroughs
    that serve to enable those needs are the key drivers for a generational leap beyond
    existing wireless systems. Together, these factors make a strong case for a focused
    discourse on the next frontier in wireless communications, i.e., 6G systems. We
    envision that 6G will not only enable a pervasively intelligent, reliable, scalable,
    and secure terrestrial wireless network, but will also incorporate space communications
    to form an omnipresent wireless network, in keeping with the need for true wireless
    ubiquity. This paper details our vision for the future of wireless communications,
    highlighting emerging use cases and detailing the key enabling technologies that
    are essential to the realization of 6G. We begin our discussion on 6G by formally
    introducing the key performance indicators (KPIs) that are expected to guide the
    design of 6G systems. While the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)
    is working on a set of official recommendations for the KPI metrics, the tentative
    values have appeared in the public domain recently [1]. Table 1 presents these
    values and contrasts them against the metrics associated with 5G. These KPIs serve
    as the fundamental metrics to evaluate system performance. In particular, from
    the table, we note the following classes of KPIs: System Capacity: This class
    of KPIs primarily deals with metrics that are associated with system throughput.
    These include peak data rate, experienced data rate, peak spectral efficiency,
    experienced spectral efficiency, maximum channel bandwidth, area traffic capacity,
    and connection density. Within this context, the experienced data rate and spectral
    efficiency metrics refer to the values that should be guaranteed to 95% of all
    user locations [1]. System Latency: This class of KPIs includes the end-to-end
    latency metric, along with delay jitter. We note that jitter is a new KPI for
    6G that quantifies the latency variations in the system, and is absent from 5G.
    System Management: This class of KPIs primarily deals with metrics related to
    the management and orchestration of networks such as energy efficiency, reliability,
    and mobility. Here too we note that while 5G does not specify a target KPI for
    the energy efficiency metric, 6G introduces a target energy efficiency of 1 Tb/J.
    Achieving the KPIs highlighted in Table 1 will require revolutionary breakthroughs
    across all domains of wireless communications. In particular, we identify the
    following major thrusts: New Spectrum Usage and Radio Design Paradigms: While
    5G ensured the mainstream adoption of mmWave spectrum, the need for higher data
    rates and consequently larger channel bandwidths will necessitate the incorporation
    of terahertz (THz) and sub-THz spectrum within 6G. At the same time, the opening
    up of new spectrum bands will also require novel radio designs that can simultaneously
    sense and communicate over the entire EM spectrum. Novel Network Architectures:
    The classical cell-based architecture of wireless networks cannot scale to meet
    the area traffic capacity and connection density requirements put forth by 6G.
    Instead, 6G will need to incorporate communications infrastructure into the very
    fabric of the environment. Increasing Intelligence and Automation: The strict
    spectral efficiency, reliability, and latency requirements associated with 6G
    imply that manual configuration of the network will no longer be possible. Rather,
    network intelligence and automation will occupy centre stage, helping build an
    increasingly autonomous network. Enhancing Network Coverage Beyond the Terrestrial
    Domain: In order to achieve true wireless ubiquity, 6G will need to expand beyond
    terrestrial networks, incorporating both near-Earth as well as deep-space connectivity.
    TABLE 1 The Evolution From 5G to 6G Wireless Systems [1] Towards the fulfillment
    of this grand vision, we note that several enabling solutions have been conceived
    and are being actively studied. As shown in Figure 1, these technologies include:
    (i) a network operating at the THz band with abundant spectrum resources, (ii)
    intelligent communication environments that enable a wireless propagation environment
    with active signal transmission and reception, (iii) pervasive artificial intelligence,
    (iv) large-scale network automation, (v) an all-spectrum reconfigurable front-end
    for dynamic spectrum access, (vi) ambient backscatter communications for energy
    savings, (vii) the Internet of Space Things enabled by CubeSats and UAVs, and
    (viii) cell-free massive MIMO communication networks. We also make note of three
    very promising technologies that are expected to shape the future of communications,
    yet will not be sufficiently mature for 6G. These include: (i) the Internet of
    NanoThings, (ii) the Internet of BioNanoThings, and (iii) quantum communications.
    Further, in addition to the aforementioned key technologies, holistic security
    solutions will also be vital to the success of 6G. However, these fall outside
    the purview of this paper. FIGURE 1. The envisioned key enabling technologies
    for 6G and beyond wireless communications systems. Show All Further, we posit
    that while prior art concerning 6G wireless systems has been become increasingly
    commonplace over the past year [2]–[7], a majority of the past publications in
    this domain focus on a select few topics, potentially hampering a comprehensive
    overview in terms of key aspects that are expected to shape the future of wireless
    communications. In addition, discussion concerning beyond 6G systems such as the
    Internet of NanoThings, the Internet of BioNanoThings, and quantum communications
    is equally critical but largely absent from existing publications. As research
    on 6G wireless systems continues to evolve and break new ground, this paper is
    intended to equip readers with a targeted insight into the next generation of
    wireless communications. More specifically, through this paper, we aim to deliver
    a holistic roadmap for 6G and beyond wireless systems, replete with a detailed
    discussion surrounding the use cases and key enabling technologies. The larger
    goal here is to encourage the scientific community to work together towards tackling
    the critical research challenges associated with the realization of the 6G systems.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present a wide
    variety of use cases that will be enabled by 6G. Further, Sections III–VI present
    details concerning key technologies that are critical to the success of 6G, along
    with a discussion on the major challenges faced by each. Then, in Section XI,
    we discuss promising enablers for beyond 6G systems, followed by a timeline for
    the evolution of 6G in Section XII. Finally, in Section XIII, we conclude this
    paper. SECTION II. Use Cases The lessons learned from the continued evolution
    of 5G systems will serve as the backdrop for use cases that will be best served
    by 6G. 5G first introduced the targeted use cases of enhanced mobile broadband
    (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), and massive machine
    type communications (mMTC), intended to serve a wide variety of applications.
    However, as noted in Section I, there exist a plethora of applications for which
    the 5G KPIs are not strict enough. As we come to realize the performance trade-offs
    in terms of throughput, latency, coverage, energy efficiency, and reliability,
    associated with 5G systems, we can better posit the applications that would benefit
    the most from 6G. As shown in Figure 2, in the following, we present a variety
    of critical use cases that will be enabled by 6G. FIGURE 2. Use cases best served
    by 6G systems. Show All A. Multi-Sensory Holographic Teleportation While virtual
    reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have immensely benefited from eMBB and
    URLLC introduced as part of 5G, there are many applications such as advanced healthcare
    including remote diagnosis and surgery, high-resolution sensing for remote exploration,
    and near-real person video conferencing that cannot be adequately served by a
    combination of AR and VR. To this end, holographic teleportation has been recognized
    as the natural successor to AR and VR-based solutions. Unlike existing solutions,
    holographic teleportation operates in a true three-dimensional space and leverages
    all five senses– sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste, to provide a truly immersive
    experience. At the same time, we note that holographic teleportation requires
    data rates close to 5 Tbps and an end-to-end latency of less than 1 ms [8], both
    of which are impossible to achieve with 5G systems. Thus, 6G, with its expected
    Tbps-level throughput and sub-millisecond latencies, will play a vital role in
    building upon the groundwork established by eMBB and URLLC. B. Real-Time Remote
    Healthcare The success of remote healthcare solutions primarily depends on both
    the quality as well as the availability of connectivity [9]. Concerning the former,
    we note that through its use of key enabling technologies such as THz band communications
    and network automation solutions, 6G will usher in the highest possible wireless
    communications quality focusing on very-high throughput augmented with ultra-low
    latency. Concerning the latter, the Internet of Space Things will play a vital
    role in providing pervasive connectivity, thus enhancing the availability of rural
    healthcare solutions. Further, we expect that within the domain of healthcare,
    advances in 6G and beyond will not only serve as a connectivity solution, but
    will also play a vital role in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases as detailed
    in Section XI-B. C. Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems Autonomous vehicles and
    UAVs are some of the most promising cyber-physical systems in existence today
    [10], [11]. The operation of these autonomous systems is characterized by the
    exchange of large amounts of data between the constituent nodes, i.e., both vehicles
    and UAVs, relating to high-resolution real-time mapping of the terrain, route
    optimization, and traffic and safety information. While the resulting large volumes
    of data must be delivered within strict deadlines in an error-free manner, it
    also imperative to note that these nodes typically operate at speeds in excess
    of 100 km/h. Therefore in addition to providing sub-millisecond latency and very
    high reliability, the connectivity solution that enables autonomous cyber-physical
    systems must also offer robust operation at very high speeds, which is not possible
    with existing 5G systems [12]. D. Intelligent Industrial Automation Over the past
    few years, Industry 4.0 [13] has been the driving force behind industrial automation
    based on the concepts of supply chain optimization, autonomous equipment, additive
    manufacturing, data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Yet, these concepts
    are treated as silos working in isolation, limiting the true potential of industrial
    automation. On the other hand, the upcoming Industry X.0 paradigm [14] seeks to
    realize synergies between the various nuances of industrial automation through
    its use of artificial intelligence. Vital to this vision are networked factories
    that serve as critical sources of big data that helps inform decision making.
    To this end, the modern industrial floor is expected to require reliable high-throughput
    connectivity across thousands of devices often with sub-millisecond response times,
    making it the perfect use case for the next frontier in wireless communications.
    E. High-Performance Precision Agriculture Within the broader domain of precision
    agriculture, soil moisture measurements have been a mainstay in irrigation decisions
    for decades now. However, real-time measurements and irrigation automation solutions
    still face challenges stemming from a lack of robust wireless coverage. Going
    beyond simple automated irrigation solutions, high-performance precision agriculture
    is largely centered around delivering data-driven insights to address the specific
    needs of customers, farms, crop, and soil. At the same time, scalable and timely
    access to such data is a major challenge owing to gaps in rural connectivity.
    Therefore, we expect that 6G, with its focus on ubiquitous wireless access, will
    play a major role in enhancing the adoption of technology in agricultural production.
    F. Space Connectivity While near-Earth and deep-space connectivity are still nascent
    within 5G, there are a wide variety of use cases ranging from radio astronomy
    and remote sensing to navigation and backhauling that would stand to benefit from
    the pervasive connectivity offered by 6G. More specifically, such applications
    include freight tracking, terrestrial cellular offloading, environmental monitoring,
    and long-range UAV coordination, to name a few. To this end, the Internet of Space
    Things as described in Section IX, will serve as the key enabling technology for
    beyond-Earth connectivity, furthering the reach of 6G systems. G. Smart Infrastructure
    and Environments The use cases discussed thus far primarily deal with the use
    of third-party systems that seek to leverage advanced telecommunications infrastructure.
    Simultaneously, the evolution of such infrastructure itself is an important use
    case. Going beyond network optimization strategies, there is also a need for exercising
    control over the propagation of wireless signals. To this end, we note that in
    5G and its predecessor systems, the wireless communication environment has always
    played a passive role. However, with the ever increasing demand for data, as evidenced
    by the applications presented herein, control over the manner in which electromagnetic
    waves interact with the indoor and outdoor environment will be critical to the
    success of 6G. In this direction, we posit that the intelligent communication
    environments described in Section IV will play a leading role in the ubiquity
    and pervasiveness of the next generation of wireless systems. SECTION III. Terahertz
    Band Communications Recent years have witnessed a dramatic rise in wireless data
    traffic brought forth by numerous exciting technologies in wireless communications.
    This exponential growth has been accompanied by the demand for higher data rates
    and better coverage [15]. Among emerging research and development trends in wireless
    communications, terahertz band (0.1-10 THz) communications has been envisioned
    as one of the key enabling technologies for the next decade. Buoyed by the availability
    of ultra-wide spectrum resources, the THz band can provide terabits per second
    (Tbps) links for a plethora of applications, ranging from ultra-fast massive data
    transfer among nearby devices in Terabit Wireless Personal and Local Area Networks
    to high-definition videoconferencing among mobile devices in small cells. Recently,
    the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has released the frequency bands above
    95 GHz for research purposes [16]. While a handful of cellular operators have
    adopted low millimeter wave frequencies for their 5G services with the intention
    of achieving a maximum data rate of 100 Gbps, the test results thus far leave
    much to be desired, showing a peak data rate of around 1 Gbps.1 This gap between
    the targeted and practically achievable data rates is influenced by multiple factors,
    including a high complexity in realistic communication channels, imperfections
    in circuitry design, and interference from other systems operating in adjacent
    frequency bands, among others. Nevertheless, even though the THz bands have been
    applied in imaging and object detection, as well as for THz radiation spectroscopy
    in astronomical research, their use cases in wireless communications are still
    under investigation. Lying between the mmWave spectrum and infrared light spectrum,
    as shown in Figure 3, THz bands, with their abundant spectrum resources, have
    been previously deemed as a “no-man’s land”. However, major progress in the domains
    of transceiver and antenna design has seen THz links become a promising option
    for realizing indoor communications networks. More recently, there has been significant
    progress on realizing wireless network on chip (WNoC) using THz bands [17]. FIGURE
    3. The THz band offers hundreds of GHz usable spectrum resources for wireless
    communication links in long, medium, short, indoor, and near-field range. Show
    All A. Use Cases of THz Band Communications Different from wireless networks at
    lower frequencies, THz-band wireless communications has several unconventional
    application scenarios, owing to the distinct electromagnetic and photonics characteristics
    of this tremendously high frequency band. In addition to the promised Tbps-level
    links for cellular systems, THz-band spectrum can also be leveraged for the following
    scenarios: Local Area Networks: Several spectrum windows are feasible for short-range
    links within ten meters, including 625-725 GHz and 780-910 GHz [18]. THz band
    communications is expected to form the THz-optics bridge to enable seamless transition
    between fiber-optics and THz-band links with zero latency. Personal Area Networks:
    THz band communications can provide “fiber-like” data rate without the need of
    wires, between multiple devices at a distance of a few meters. Such communication
    scenarios can be found in indoor offices and multimedia kiosks. Data Center Networks:
    Conventional data centers manage and maintain connectivity in wired networks using
    cables, resulting in high costs in terms of both installation and reconfiguration.
    On the other hand, THz links provide promising prospects for seamless connectivity
    at ultra-high-speeds in fixed networks and adaptability for hardware reconfiguration.
    Wireless Network on Chip: As the trend in transceiver hardware development motivates
    a higher level of integration and miniaturization as well as weight reduction,
    the THz band links can serve as a promising candidate to establish wireless connections
    among different modules within the transceiver chassis, in order to replace the
    wired connections commonly found in existing transceiver hardware products. Nano-networks:
    With its wavelength falling into the nanometer (10−9 m) range, the THz band can
    operate better than any other frequencies in nano-networks. Within this context,
    a nano-network is a set of interconnected nano-devices or nano-machines for information
    exchange, storage, and computation. A more detailed overview can be found in Section
    XI-A. Inter-satellite Communications: Lying largely outside the Earth’s atmosphere,
    inter-satellite links are not constrained by atmospheric attenuation, which makes
    the THz band a favorable candidate for such communication links. Compared to existing
    spectrum resources allocated for inter-satellite links, the THz band has a much
    wider bandwidth which can accommodate more satellites and achieve higher link
    performance. Unlike the widely used optical links, the THz band does not impose
    stringent requirements on beam alignment, which can help maintain a high level
    of link stability as satellites drift out of their orbits. B. Devices in the THz
    Band The need for higher output power, lower phase noise, and better receiving
    sensitivity in THz band transceivers has driven advances in corresponding device
    development. Currently, three main directions are deployed in THz band signal
    generation: photonics-based, electronic-based, and emerging material-based, respectively.
    In the photonics-based approach, many III-V semiconductors, including gallium
    arsenide (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP), which provide high electron mobility,
    are excellent candidates especially for high frequency (i.e., above 100 GHz) applications.
    Such photonics-based techniques generate time-domain pulses with lengths of femto-seconds
    (10−15 s) and experimental works have demonstrated 50 Gbps data links in an indoor
    scenario at 300 GHz using the uni-traveling-carrier photodiode (UTC-PD) technique
    [19]. The UTC-PDs and modified UTC-PD structures, an effective photomixing solution
    which allows wider spectrum tuning and simpler construction compared to laser
    pulse generators, has pushed the output signal range from 300 GHz to 2.5 THz,
    with output powers of 10 μW at 300 GHz and 1 μW at 1 THz [20]. Additionally, a
    design based on slot-antenna-integrated UTC-PDs has shown superior performance
    in generated THz band signal strengths at 350-850 GHz and 900 GHz-1.6 THz, compared
    to that of the bowtie-antenna integrated UTC-PD [21]. Similar photonics-based
    THz signal generation at above 1 THz can be realized using quantum cascade lasers
    (QCLs) and other solid state lasers [22]. However, the operations of such devices
    are limited at room temperatures, requiring liquid helium cooling, which affects
    their deployment in local area networks with space restrictions. Furthermore,
    photoconductive antennas (PCAs) have been utilized widely for both pulse and continuous-wave
    signal generation at THz band [23], demonstrating a wide spectrum (up to 4.5 THz)
    with a remarkable dynamic range of up to 100 dB [24]. In parallel to the photonics-based
    approach for THz band device design which down-converts the optical frequencies,
    the electronic-based THz band signal generation relies on frequency up-conversion
    using multipliers [25], including frequency doublers and triplers, as well as
    backward wave oscillators [26]. A recent experiment has demonstrated an all-electronics-based
    wireless link at 240 GHz with a throughput of 50 Gbps and a maximum 29% error
    vector magnitude using QPSK modulation [27]. The backward wave oscillator, which
    is a compact design to generate THz band signals based on the mechanism of energy
    transfer from an electron beam to an electromagnetic wave through a vacuum tube,
    has been used to generate signals at 300 GHz with an output power of 1 W in plasma
    diagnostics [26]. Among the two commonly used approaches, the photonics-based
    design benefits from a relatively simpler transceiver architecture based on the
    photomixing technique, while the electronics-based solution relies on cascaded
    frequency up-conversion of RF signals, which sets stringent requirements on linear-range
    operation and potentially limits the terahertz bandwidth. On the other hand, the
    electronics-based approach is less sensitive to environmental conditions, such
    as temperature, humidity, among others, which makes it more favorable for outdoor
    operations, whereas the link reliability from its photonics-based counterpart
    is affected by scattered particles in the channel, making the THz band link less
    robust. Besides these classical approaches for THz band device development, new
    materials, including graphene, carbon nanotubes, and graphene nanoribbons, are
    gaining more attention due to their extremely high electron mobility in the order
    of 8,000−10,000c m 2 /(V⋅s) at room temperature, as compared to 1,400 c m 2 /(V⋅s)
    of silicon, and 8,500 c m 2 /(V⋅s) of GaAs, which means that the link throughput
    can be potentially up to ten times higher than is currently achievable with most
    semiconductors [28]. The graphene-based devices, offering outstanding mechanical,
    electrical, and optical properties, have been utilized in the development of power
    detectors at 600 GHz [29] and 200 GHz [30], as well as plasmonic antenna arrays
    and transceivers [31], [32]. Graphene-based devices have the potential to break
    new ground in reaching the desired level of performance at much higher frequencies
    above 1 THz. C. Physical Layer Modeling at the THz Band The realization of wireless
    communications at THz frequencies requires the development of accurate channel
    models to capture the impact of both channel peculiarities including the high
    atmospheric attenuation and molecular absorption rates at various transmission
    windows, as well as the propagation effects including reflection, scattering,
    and diffraction, with respect to different materials. Current research has reported
    several efforts to provide fundamental understanding of such channels. For example,
    an early work in [33] demonstrates the remarkable capacity the THz band channel
    can support for short transmission distances. The model provides a detail analysis
    on the effect of attenuation caused by the molecular absorption and spreading
    loss, on which the performance of channel throughput is heavily dependent. One
    step further, in order to extend the transmission distance at THz bands, an idea
    dubbed as the ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM MIMO) communications,
    enabled by an element array size of 1024×1024 with plasmonic nano-antennas, can
    drastically boost the signal strength by steering and focusing the transmitted
    beams in both space and frequency [34]. Correspondingly, a UM MIMO channel model
    has been developed in [35] which takes into account the role of such arrays. Additionally,
    a stochastic channel model for indoor THz band communications at 300 GHz has been
    reported in [36] which characterizes both spatial and temporal domain channel
    information. More recently, based on the aforementioned applicable scenarios in
    the THz band, a stochastic channel model for kiosk applications has been reported
    in [37] which ranges from 200-340 GHz. The main takeaway from current models validated
    using either measurements or the ray-tracing technique is that the direct path
    between the transmitter and the receiver and the single-bounce reflected paths
    dominate the received power, while other channel effects, including diffraction
    and scattering, attenuate power significantly along propagation. On the basis
    of the ultra-wideband channel characterization, THz band communications faces
    a critical and challenging task of synchronization in the receiver design. Existing
    pulse-based modulation schemes permit the use of low-complexity non-coherent analogue
    detectors, e.g., energy detector and auto-correlation receiver, which involve
    the multiplication of the received signal with itself, followed by an integrator.
    However, a more advanced non-coherent receiver architecture in [38] based on a
    continuous time moving average symbol detection scheme demonstrates better performance
    compared to previous detection schemes for pulse-based modulations in terms of
    the symbol error rate. In addition, robust frequency and timing synchronization
    for multi-carrier communication in the THz band is desirable to decode multiple
    incoming signal streams. The work presented in [39] realizes both a low-rate sampling
    scheme for channels with high SNR values and a maximum likelihood-based algorithm
    for low SNR channels with satisfying bit-error-rate performance. More recently,
    a synchronization scheme based on medium access control protocols is reported
    in [40], which shows good performance in both a macro-scale scenario to overcome
    the distance limitation at the THz band and a nano-scale scenario for nano-devices
    for energy harvesting. Similarly, given the peculiar ultra-wideband nature and
    frequency selectivity of THz band communications, equalization solutions pose
    another relevant challenge [15], [41]. In [42], three equalization solutions,
    including the Tomlinson-Harashima precoding, a waveform with interference management
    for time-reversal systems, and an iterative algorithm with adaptive soft feedback,
    are reviewed and compared for an indoor channel. Results show that the iterative
    algorithm with adaptive soft feedback yields the most promising BER performance
    [42]. D. Medium Access Control in THz Band Communications On top of physical layer
    channel models, the medium access control (MAC) schemes in THz band communications
    should adopt certain spatial and spectral features in order to provide solutions
    in resolving issues such as the deafness problem and LoS blockage, among others
    [43], [44]. Different from commonly used MAC solutions in RF systems that utilize
    omnidirectional antennas, such as carrier sense multiple access with collision
    avoidance (CSMA/CA), the MAC protocols designed for THz band rely on handshakes
    between transceivers with highly directional beams. These razor-sharp beams can
    provide higher power radiation gain and prolong the transmission distance, but
    when misalignment happens, the deafness problem arises. As such, the deafness
    avoidance approach is required in MAC scheme design. Existing solutions utilized
    in IEEE 802.15.3c [45] and others employ a beam-training phase to estimate and
    steer beams towards destined devices. Recent works also propose methods based
    on angular division multiplexing [46] and a priori aided channel tracking schemes
    [47]. The results in such proposed solutions suggest that with good beam alignment
    strategies the channel throughput can be improved significantly. Moreover, the
    MAC protocols can also resolve the issue of LoS blockage where the received power
    of a user device may undergo deep fading due to the device being held in a manner
    that blocks the LoS path. Studies have shown that such attenuation by the human
    body can be as high as 20 dB at 60 GHz and up [49], [50]. To mitigate the blockage
    problem, researchers have proposed a multi-hop scheme at the mmWave and THz bands
    to form alternative routes [51], [52]. A careful link-level scheduling and neighbor
    discovery process is necessary to achieve high throughput while maintaining low
    interference. E. Open Problems in THz Band Communications Currently, the fabrication
    and testing of THz band antenna arrays remains a relevant challenge. Some techniques
    based on photolithography, electro-beam lithography, among others, are able to
    produce the front-end with hundreds of plasmonic antenna elements. The utilization
    of large antenna arrays can extend the signal coverage by forming array radiation
    patterns with main lobes of high directivity, thus focusing energy towards desired
    directions. However, such highly directional beams limit coverage in the angular
    domain, causing low energy efficiency at the transmitter to serve each user. A
    recent solution named “THzPrism” has been proposed to form multiple beams with
    slight frequency shifts towards different directions while maintaining good distance
    coverage [53] in addition to other proposed solutions discussed in Section III-C
    to solve the transmission distance problem. This design employs true time delays
    for RF chains before phase-shifters to obtain a prism-like effect, which spreads
    the original beam into several beams, each with a slight frequency shift with
    respect to the center frequency. In parallel to the quest for more novel solutions
    in antenna design, other remaining challenges reside in the control and signal
    processing schemes associated with transceiver designs in the THz band. On the
    one hand, real-time control algorithms are needed. On the other hand, communication
    protocols for coordination between the transmitter, receiver, and reflectarrays
    are needed. Among others, in [54], researchers reported a smart reflectarray-assisted
    mmWave system compatible with IEEE 802.11ad. Besides the design of the reflectarray
    and a study on deployment strategies, a three-way beam-searching protocol is developed,
    in which the reflectarray coordinates with the transmitter through a 2.4 GHz control
    channel in order to discover the best joint transmit and reflect sectors for which
    the signal at the receiver is maximized. However, this work does not capture the
    extended functionalities of plasmonic reflectarrays. Furthermore, when highly
    directional beams are utilized at mobile transceivers, a relevant challenge arises
    from the limited field-of-view of antenna arrays for each transceiver to locate
    the next hop to forward its data; thus, new routing solutions are necessary for
    THz band communications to efficiently discover and establish links. A study in
    [55] reports a solution in link discovery at THz band using a leaky-wave antenna
    to sense the angular information of a user. SECTION IV. Intelligent Communication
    Environments Along with the rapid growth in the number of wireless devices, services,
    and applications, a corresponding demand for higher speed wireless communications
    has burgeoned in recent years. Nevertheless, the major challenge at mmWave and
    THz-band frequencies is the limited communication distance because of the remarkably
    high path loss inherent to small wavelengths and the limited transmission power
    of mmWave and THz-band transceivers [56]. Current solutions primarily focus on
    the advancement of wireless transceiver hardware and software, as well as network
    optimization strategies. However, the wireless propagation medium has been largely
    neglected. The wireless communication environments, for both indoor and outdoor
    scenarios, can be actively utilized in order to become controllable for signal
    propagation. To control signal propagation in environments is essentially to control
    how electromagnetic waves interact with scatterers, which include indoor furniture
    and outdoor buildings as well as other infrastructure. Typically, the controllable
    behaviors of electromagnetic waves include controlled reflection, absorption,
    wave collimation, signal waveguiding, and polarization tuning, as illustrated
    in Figure 4. The notion of “Intelligent Communication Environments” resides in
    the control algorithms where deep learning and reinforcement learning are to be
    exploited to dynamically configure the environments. In the following subsections,
    we elaborate on these controllable wave behaviors, current research efforts, as
    well as corresponding open issues. FIGURE 4. Conceptual design of a plasmonic
    reflectarray able to unconventionally manipulate EM waves [48]. Show All A. Basics
    of Intelligent Communication Environments The intelligent environments can be
    seen as a three-dimensional structure with several layers, each with different
    functionalities. Recent research under the EU Research Project “VisorSurf” has
    demonstrated a structure with five main layers, which are (from top to bottom)
    the EM behavior layer, the actuation and sensing layer, the shielding layer, the
    computing layer, and the communication layer, respectively [57]. Specifically,
    the EM behavior layer is composed of metasurfaces, a two-dimensional representation
    of metamaterials, and has a tunable impedance to control directions of reflection
    of the EM waves. Some other works use reflectarray antennas as the top surface
    [58], [59]. The actuation and sensing layer consists of circuits for phase shifting
    and sensors for impinging signal sensing. Some options for actuation include PIN
    diodes with controllable biasing voltage as switches in reflectarray antennas,
    and complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (CMOS) transistors as well as micro-electro-mechanical
    (MEMS) switches for metasurfaces. The shielding layer isolates the upper and lower
    parts of the layered structure so as to minimize the possible interference. The
    computing layer serves to control the phase shifts and process sensed impinging
    waves. To this end, another reported solution makes use of field-programmable
    gated arrays (FPGAs) to fulfill such functions on metasurfaces [60]. Finally,
    the communication layer connects all upper layers and serves as the gateway towards
    the central controller which processes all connection requests, forwards and receives
    signals, and conducts the aforementioned controlled wave functions. Compared to
    existing relays with multiple antennas which are widely deployed in wireless networks,
    Intelligent Communication Environments offer the following advantages: (i) a higher
    spatial diversity due to the wide coverage of the intelligent surface with controllable
    antenna arrays, (ii) a reduced processing time given that the computing and communication
    layers are directly underneath the surface layer, and (iii) a higher flexibility
    in network routing when impinging signals come from different directions and the
    intelligent surfaces are able to collimate waves and reflect them towards desired
    directions. B. Functionalities of Intelligent Environments Bolstered by the layered
    structure, intelligent surfaces can enable controlled EM wave operations. At micro-
    and mmWave frequencies, metasurfaces are considered as a good candidate. While
    at THz bands, graphene-based plasmonic antenna arrays are desirable. In metasurfaces,
    a meta-atom is the smallest unit, which is a conductor with a size smaller than
    half the wavelength of the signal. Metasurfaces can thus control the impinging
    EM waves with a very fine granularity. The meta-atoms are interconnected by a
    set of miniaturized controllers that connect the switches of the metasurfaces
    in the computing layer, while a gateway serves as the connectivity unit in the
    communication layer to provide inter-element and external control. At THz bands,
    when the metasurfaces do not yield optimal performance, the graphene-based plasmonic
    antenna arrays serve as a promising alternative. Compared to metallic antenna
    arrays, the plasmonic antenna arrays can have much denser element layout and go
    beyond the conventional λ/2 sampling of space towards more precise space and frequency
    beamforming, owing to the physics of plasmonics. In our previous work, we have
    demonstrated that, graphene can be used to build nano-transceivers and nano-antennas
    with a maximum dimension of λ/20 at THz frequencies, allowing them to be densely
    integrated in very small footprints (1024 elements in less than 1 mm2), as shown
    in Figure 4 [34]. Therefore, by incorporating the graphene-based plasmonic antenna
    arrays at THz bands and metasurfaces operating at mmWave bands, we can expand
    the operational spectrum of intelligent environments and utilize them in transmission
    and reception in a controllable manner. C. Layered Structure of Intelligent Communication
    Environments Based on the operating principles of the aforementioned Intelligent
    Communication Environments, in this subsection, we anatomize the layered structure
    and detail each layer’s functionality. 1) Metamaterial Plane The metamaterial
    plane is also the surface plane, as shown in Figure 4. In designs based on reflectarrays,
    phase shifts are applied to each element to improve useful signals while canceling
    interference [58], [61]. The metasurface element proposed in [62] with millimeter-scale
    dimensions is connected to a PIN diode with a bias voltage to control operation
    modes, such as altering polarizations. In general, this layer comprises the supported
    EM function of the tile as well as its operation principle. In particular, reflectarray
    employ modifiable phase shifts applied over their surface. In the far field of
    radiation, reflected rays can be considered co-directional, and their superposition–constructive
    or destructive–is controlled by the applied phase shifts [63]. Hence, wave scattering
    or controlled reflecting functions can be attained. Metamaterial tiles, however,
    operate as surfaces with tunable local impedance [64]. Impinging waves create
    inductive surface currents over the tile, which can be routed by tuning the local
    impedance across the tile. Notice that the Huygens Principle dictates that any
    EM wavefront can be traced back to a current distribution over a surface [65].
    As a result, in principle, metamaterials can produce any custom EM function as
    a response to an impinging wave. Common functions include wave steering, focusing,
    collimating (i.e., producing a planar wavefront as a response to an impinging
    wave), polarizing, phase altering, full or partial absorption, frequency selective
    filtering and even modulation [60], [64]. 2) Sensing and Actuation Plane In order
    to control the EM waves per actual channel conditions, the programmable surfaces
    are expected to sense the propagation environment and actuate the upper surface
    plane accordingly. Such layer contains hardware elements that can be controlled
    to achieve a phase shift or impedance distribution across a tile. Commonly, the
    layer comprises arrays of planar antennas–such as copper patches–and multi-state
    switches between them. Reflectarray tiles usually employ PIN diodes with controllable
    biasing voltage as switches [62]. Metamaterials have employed a wider range of
    choices, both in the shape and geometry of the planar antennas and in the nature
    of switches. CMOS transistors, PIN diodes, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Switches (MEMS),
    micro-fluidic switches, magnetic and thermal switches are but a few of the considered
    options in the literature [66]. Notably, some options–such as micro-fluid switches–are
    state-preserving in the sense that they require power only to change state but
    not to maintain it (i.e., contrary to biased PIN diodes). Sensing impinging waves
    are also necessary for exerting efficient control over them. While this information
    can be provided by external systems [67], with dynamic channels and mobile end-users,
    tiles capable of incorporating sensing capabilities can be immune from the channel
    aging problem [68]. The sensing can be direct, employing specialized sensors,
    or indirect, e.g., via deducing some impinging wave attributes from currents or
    voltages between tile elements. 3) Computing Plane The computing functionality
    serves the processing functionality in the controllable surface system. In the
    metasurface designs in [60] and [62], FPGA-based controllers are connected to
    the metasurfaces to implement the computing functions. This layer comprises the
    computing hardware that controls the actuation and sensing elements. Its minimum
    computing duties include the mapping of local phase or impedance values to corresponding
    actuator states. Reflectarray tiles commonly implement this layer using FPGAs
    and shift registers [62]. Metasurfaces, and specifically HyperSurfaces, can alternatively
    employ standard IoT devices for the same purpose. Moreover, they can optionally
    include computing hardware elements (ASICs) distributed over the tile meta-atoms
    [69], [70]. This can enable autonomous and cognitive tiles, where meta-atoms detect
    the presence and state of one another, and take local actuation decisions to meet
    a general functionality objective. Nonetheless, these advanced capabilities are
    not required for programmable wireless environments. 4) Communication Plane The
    communication plane passes the signals from the processing layer to corresponding
    metasurface layer and collects signals from the sensing and actuation plane. In
    complicated programmable surface systems, communication occurs among planes to
    realize various EM wave control functions. The command signals normally operate
    at much lower frequencies compared to the ones emitted from programmable surfaces;
    such signals prove to be more efficient in tuning the bias voltage of the PIN
    diodes [60]. This layer comprises the communication stack and connects actuation
    and sensing layer as well as computing layer with tile-external devices such as
    controllers. In the simplest case, this layer is implemented within the computing
    hardware, acting as a gateway to the external world using any common protocol
    such as the Ethernet. HyperSurface tiles with embedded distributed computing elements
    additionally require inter-tile communication schemes, to handle the information
    exchange between smart meta-atoms. Both wired and wireless intra-tile communication
    is possible [69], [70]. In both cases, the ASIC hardware employs custom and nonstandard
    protocols. D. Use Cases of Intelligent Environments With the utilization of well-coordinated
    tiles in the Intelligent Environments, the wireless system can be greatly improved
    in terms of communication efficacy. 1) On Signal Propagation Enhancements From
    the perspective of multiple users and moving users, the Intelligent Environments
    system is envisioned to serve a large number of users with more realistic user
    patterns, including mobile users and users in a cluster. Additionally, the Intelligent
    Environments system should ensure physical layer security against jamming and
    eavesdropping, an increasingly important problem that remains to be solved. Transmission
    Distance: For users in the NLoS areas relative to the transmitter, the Intelligent
    Environments system is expected to extend the transmission distance and reach
    previously uncovered areas through waveguiding or reflection. Simulation results
    in [67] demonstrate that at 60 GHz the coverage can be extended to an entire NLoS
    area. Interference Mitigation: Due to the scenario with multiple users, there
    is inevitably concern of interference. As in the envisioned scheme, each Intelligent
    Environment unit is dedicated to an individual user, thus the majority of interference
    will reside in the wireless section of the end-to-end link. Reliability: The primary
    efforts in terms of physical layer reliability include using highly directional
    antennas to nullify jamming, forming exclusion areas, assigning secret keys to
    legitimate users, and so on. From the perspective of fundamental propagation channels
    with Intelligent Environments, good reliability is achieved when the eavesdroppers
    do not have the knowledge of the frequencies where packages are transmitted, or
    the eavesdroppers are in the same frequency channel but with much higher noise
    which makes the intercepted data impossible to decode [71]. Therefore, the dedicated
    links in Intelligent Environments are inherently secure. 2) On the Physical Layer
    Security The more frequent data exchange between users and service providers exposes
    a higher risk of personal and private data leakage. The 6G wireless network should
    not only inherit existing network secrecy measures, but also provide enhanced
    physical layer security associated with new enabling techniques. In current 5G
    networks, highly directional beams are used for mmWave communications in spatial
    domain to prevent signals from being intercepted. However, a recent study has
    shown that such pencil-sharp beams are still vulnerable to agile eavesdropping
    [72]. Other physical layer encryption algorithms, including source coding approaches
    such as the low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, are demonstrated with optimal
    performance under specific conditions [73]. Furthermore, existing solutions in
    the reconfigurable intelligence surface apply reflectarrays, which do not have
    the capability to effectively distinguish target users from malicious attackers.
    Hence, a solution based on the Intelligent Environments serves the purpose of
    identifying unintended recipients, creating null areas, and improving link secrecy
    rate. Essentially, the envisioned Intelligent Environments have the capability
    to sense user locations and exchange such information with a system controller
    to verify the user’s authenticity. Only affirmative users shall be served with
    signal streams from the sender. On the other hand, connection requests from unauthorized
    users (i.e., eavesdroppers) will be nullified from attempting to access secure
    information or even trying to establish links with the sender. In practice, the
    Intelligent Environments can be configured to tune the phases of multipath components
    in the channel, such that those arrived at intended users can be coherently combined
    with boosted received signal strengths, whereas those intercepted by eavesdroppers
    will be scrambled or even cancelled due to non-coherent combining [74]. Simulation
    results demonstrate a 6-dB attenuation observed at the received signal strength
    from the eavesdropper, validating the proposed physical layer security solution
    [74]. Hence, the good channel secrecy is achieved when such unintended users do
    not own the knowledge of equalizer to recover the transmitted signals from noise.
    E. Open Problems in Intelligent Environments A number of open problems need to
    be addressed in order to facilitate the Intelligent Environments in becoming a
    market-ready solution. Trade-off Between Dimensions and Energy Consumption: In
    terms of real-world applications, the Intelligent Environments are expected to
    be coated onto surfaces of interior walls and/or ceilings, and building facades,
    which require dimensions that can both fit specific installation areas and satisfy
    link requirements. Meanwhile, with more reflectarray elements and RF chains built
    into the system, the energy consumption will also increase, due to the advanced
    signal processing circuitry. Therefore, how to achieve an economic solution to
    balance the overall dimension and energy consumption while serving users to its
    desired performance is a nontrivial issue. Compatibility With Existing Solutions:
    Current Wi-Fi access points have a mature protocol stack to sense the channel
    and establish links with users. In order for the Intelligent Environments to assist
    with improving indoor signal coverage, it needs to be compatible with the IEEE
    802.11 series standard. For now this is still under research and serves as a worthy
    problem for novel solutions. Standardization: With many candidate approaches being
    investigated in reflectarrays, metasurfaces, frequency selective surfaces, among
    others, there has not been a consensus on how to standardize the device architecture,
    maximum emitted power, and communication protocols. As more ideas evolve, a standardization
    effort within a work group is necessary towards a solidary framework. Inclusion
    of advanced application scenarios: as a promising solution for future generation
    of wireless systems, the Intelligent Communication Environments should be designed
    to fit to more advanced scenarios, for example, in use cases with a very large
    quantity of devices as in the Internet of Things, under high demands of real-time
    video streaming, with devices of high mobility, among others. Smart resource allocation
    solutions: resources in the spatial, temporal, and spectral domains should be
    allocated in an optimal manner to satisfy per-user demand. AI-driven design and
    optimization: in complicated scenarios under which no closed-form solutions can
    be found using conventional optimization approaches, advanced algorithms in artificial
    intelligence can assist in the deployment of Intelligent Communication Environments,
    especially when complex surface layout or structures are in presence. SECTION
    V. Pervasive Artificial Intelligence In the past few years, the field of artificial
    intelligence (AI) has witnessed immense growth, leading to its application in
    a wide variety of fields across both academia and industry. In the realm of communications
    and signal processing, AI can be readily applied to cognitive radios, remote sensing,
    computer vision, and network management. More specifically, in the domain of wireless
    communications, AI and its associated algorithms are also gradually proving their
    utility in various emerging techniques such as massive MIMO communications which
    requires efficient channel estimation and symbol detection. Such tasks often do
    not yield low complexity optimal solutions in complex channels [75], and thus
    parallel processing inherent in machine learning can be favorably leveraged to
    enhance computational capacity. Admittedly, even though current wireless communication
    networks follow a layered structure, in which each layer primarily serves several
    functions, applications of AI and relevant algorithms are gradually bridging the
    gap across layers in a way that can globally optimize the performance in the entire
    wireless network. However, in order to provide a marked trail to navigate through
    a plethora of pervasive AI applications, this section is organized based on the
    existing layers. It is worth noting that AI is a broad concept, under which reside
    several branches covering interleaved research topics, such as robotics, natural
    language processing, machine learning (ML), computer vision, among others. In
    this section, we focus specifically on the ML algorithms and their applications
    in wireless communications under the AI umbrella. These two terms are thus used
    interchangeably in this section. As shown in Figure 5, artificial intelligence
    can be applied to each layer of the wireless network. At the network layer, machine
    learning (ML) algorithms can be used for traffic clustering to further adapt the
    network resources to various scenarios [76]. At the physical and MAC layers, deep
    learning can optimize resource allocation strategies for power distribution, and
    modulation and coding schemes, among others. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms
    can also assist with channel estimation and multi-user detection. FIGURE 5. Applications
    of artificial intelligence at different layers of wireless systems. Show All A.
    AI in the Physical Layer Traditionally, physical layer modeling has been model-oriented—a
    practice in which mathematical models following a certain framework are proposed
    and optimized under constraints to satisfy a series of pre-determined performance
    requirements. For example, in order to conduct channel estimation, a channel model
    is assumed along with other parametric configurations. These model-based solutions
    usually perform well if the derivation of mathematical models is relatively straightforward
    or there exists a closed-form solution. The models can then be validated by field
    measurements or numerical simulations. However, in real-world scenarios, the applicability
    of such model-based solutions falls short in complicated environments, due to
    factors such as non-linearity inside systems and uncontrollable interference,
    among others. On the other hand, another approach, which is based on statistics,
    or data sets, builds the model through learning from the data. This method is
    particularly useful when theoretical analysis is intractable or when a closed-form
    solution is difficult to obtain. For example, in diffusion-based channels commonly
    found in molecular communication, the channel characteristics depend largely on
    the environment, making them challenging to model theoretically [77]. In such
    cases, some data is used for training, which can help establish a model, while
    other data is used for testing in order to validate the model. To date, artificial
    intelligence has demonstrated its usefulness in various physical layer techniques.
    For example, in channel estimation and symbol detection, deep learning approaches
    reported in [78], [79] have shown that the proposed deep learning-based symbol
    detection algorithms can provide robust and accurate results with reduced complexity.
    Furthermore, a deep learning method based on the deep neural network architecture
    also demonstrates an improved channel estimation accuracy under the effects of
    non-linearities of power amplifiers, I/Q imbalance, and quantization errors induced
    by hardware impairments [80]. An autoencoder-based communication system is proposed
    to reconstruct the transmitted signals from channel impairment based on trained
    deep neural networks in an end-to-end manner [81]. Furthermore, self-supervised
    learning is becoming a trend for user localization since it has been demonstrated
    that relevant methods can significantly reduce the size of labeled dataset for
    efficient processing [82] B. AI in Wireless Networks In other essential layers
    of a wireless network, the existence of rich datasets lends itself to the applicability
    of machine learning-based solutions. In routing protocol design for wireless sensor
    networks, researchers have successfully utilized reinforcement learning methods
    to achieve a more energy-efficient routing scheme for underwater sensor networks
    [83]. In the vehicular industry, autonomous driving has already been studied and
    become a reality in some cities in Arizona, US.2 With respect to vehicular communication
    networks, due to the constant movement of vehicles, a predictive model based on
    real-time data has superiority over traditional theoretical models in terms of
    accuracy. Artificial intelligence and its plethora of algorithms can be applied
    in varied ways in such networks: autoencoders for predicting traffic flow [84],
    k -means clustering for traffic congestion control [85], and Q -learning for intelligent
    resource management [86], among others [87]. In the Internet of Space Things,
    with our envisioned multi-band communication capabilities in both inter-satellite
    and ground-to-satellite links, we have proposed a deep neural network-based resource
    allocation strategy to enable a flexible scheme for CubeSats to stay connected
    without human intervention from the ground [88]. Apart from advancements in algorithm
    development, a potential issue dwells on the location of data storage and processing,
    which has largely happened in central data centers in the cloud. For devices distributed
    in a wide geographic range, this undoubtedly adds significant delays in performing
    tasks which require real-time operation. Moreover, a centralized computing manner
    is not desired from perspectives of data security and constraint in processing
    capacity [89]. In order to relieve such challenges, edge AI pushes local devices
    to fulfil operation and management tasks. Admittedly, this could lead to possible
    overburden in local devices, since they are not equipped with as powerful processing
    units as the cloud processing center, however, research efforts in this direction
    are dedicated to: (i) acceleration in boosting the hardware’s processing capability,
    and (ii) leveraging the coordination between local and central processing units
    to optimization task distribution. C. AI in Network Management and Orchestration
    AI, or more specifically ML, has an integral role to play in the management of
    networks [90]–[92]. In fact, Clark et al. introduced the concept of the Knowledge
    Plane [93] back in 2003, describing it as a pervasive ML-based system within the
    network that is geared towards providing services and advice to other elements
    of the network. More recently, with sofware-defined networking (SDN) and network
    function virtualization (NFV) becoming mainstream, large-scale data acquisition
    has become easier than ever before, making a strong case for ML-based management
    and orchestration primitives within 6G, ultimately leading to full network automation
    as discussed in the next section. In particular, the domain of network management
    presents a wide variety of problems that can be broadly categorized into: [91]
    Supervised Learning: Supervised learning is typically applied to problems relating
    to traffic prediction [94] and classification [95], as well as slice resource
    prediction [96]. While the former primarily involves preemptively determining
    the network traffic load, as well as determining the applications, protocols and
    QoS classes the traffic belongs to, for fine-grained traffic engineering, the
    latter involves predicting the resource requirements associated with different
    network slices based on the anticipated traffic load. Reinforcement Learning:
    Reinforcement learning typically finds use in problems associated with resource
    management [97], [98]. For example, the popular virtual network embedding problem
    wherein the network orchestrator performs optimal placement of virtual network
    functions onto the underlying physical substrate, is highly amenable to reinforcement
    learning [99]. Other applications include elastic scaling of network infrastructure
    [100], failure prevention, and configuration rollback [101]. Unsupervised Learning:
    While both supervised learning and reinforcement learning have shown significant
    promise in the network management domain, we note that there exist certain use
    cases such as those relating to optimizing the end-users’ Quality of Experience
    (QoE) [102] and network security [103] where: (i) labeled data for training is
    simply not present and (ii) the real-time nature of the application makes it impractical
    to wait for feedback. In such cases, unsupervised learning can prove to be an
    indispensable tool. For example, intrusion detection systems based on autoencoders
    have been shown to outperform supervised learning-based systems [104]. D. Open
    Problems for Pervasive AI During early years of 5G standardization, researchers
    have discussed potentials of AI in achieving high time and spectrum efficiency
    once incorporated in 5G. Specifically, AI algorithms can help facilitate the following
    tasks which would yield low efficiency with conventional solutions: identify network
    anomalies, allocate network resources, perform network management, among others
    [106]. However, so far these solutions have not been officially adopted in 5G
    standards worldwide. In June 2020, the ITU has initiated an AI/ML in 5G challenge
    to motivate researchers to identify and solve real-world problems using AI/ML
    solutions in relevant 5G directions.3 As such, it is envisioned that such efforts
    would be factored in later 5G development but will be materialized in a more concrete
    and pervasive manner in 6G. While pervasive artificial intelligence in wireless
    communication networks will undoubtedly bring a paradigm shift towards data-oriented
    approaches, there are still open problems to be resolved. First, thus far no agreement
    has ever been reached on which algorithms work the best to solve a generalized
    problem in wireless networks, such as modulation and coding scheme design, channel
    estimation, and resource allocation, among others. Almost all published works
    claim significant accuracy or reduced complexity with either analytical theories
    or practical data sets [107]. Additionally, we note the absence of an effective
    method to draw a fair comparison among all proposed solutions, due to variations
    in selected data sets, assumptions, evaluation criteria, and so on. However, when
    it comes to realistic deployments, a careful gleaning process should be performed
    in order to identify algorithms without loss of general applicability. Second,
    the limited availability of quality datasets is detrimental to the testing and
    validation of proposed classification or regression algorithms. SECTION VI. Network
    Automation SDN and NFV have been widely recognized as the major paradigm shifts
    that occurred with the advent of 5G [108]. In particular, SDN has paved the way
    for the separation of the data and control planes, while NFV has been instrumental
    in decoupling the software from the hardware. Consequently, both wired and wireless
    networks have witnessed significant benefits from the adoption of SDN and NFV,
    including but not limited to simplified network management and service deployment,
    availability of advanced traffic engineering solutions and fine-grained network
    slicing techniques, and reduced CAPEX and OPEX. A major contribution of network
    softwarization has also been the commoditization of key network components such
    as switches [109] and base stations [110], [111], allowing for their implementation
    on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware. In addition, the large open-source
    community supporting these projects has played a pivotal role in engaging a wider
    set of stakeholders than was previously possible. As networks evolve further,
    the traditional network operations routine, rooted in manual configuration and
    static script-based primitives, cannot keep up with the increasing complexity.
    Instead, we posit that automation will serve as the major driving force behind
    building upon the improvements brought forth by SDN and NFV. More specifically,
    network automation is defined as the process of automating the configuration,
    management, testing, deployment, and operations of physical and virtual devices
    within a network [112]. Network automation is intended to speed up the delivery
    of network services while adhering to dynamic and robust service-level agreements
    (SLAs), and reducing the potential for errors through minimization of manual intervention.
    Standardization efforts in this domain have led to the introduction of the Network
    Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in the control plane and the Management Data Analytics
    Service (MDAS) in the management plane, for enhanced data collection and analytics
    functionalities within 3GPP Releases 15 and 16 [113], [114]. Both these functions
    form a critical segment of the Service-Based Architecture (SBA) within 5G, highlighting
    the growing importance of network automation. To this end, we explore three key
    tenets of network automation in this section– software-defined programmable data
    planes, automated service decomposition and orchestration, and self-driving networks.
    While the first two are primarily concerned with automating specific aspects of
    the network, i.e., the data plane and the network slicing procedure, self-driving
    networks are the holy grail of network automation, requiring absolutely no manual
    intervention. A. Software-Defined Programmable Data Planes Being the most popular
    Southbound API, OpenFlow [115] is synonymous with SDN and has been featured widely
    in 5G networks. Yet, the stateless match-action abstraction implemented by OpenFlow
    precludes true data plane programmability since it relies largely on static header
    field matching. Within the context of this paper, we define data plane programmability
    as a feature that allows data plane devices, such as switches, to expose their
    packet-processing logic to the control plane in order for it be completely reconfigured
    if required. For example, the controller should be seamlessly able to modify the
    packet parsing and processing pipeline as required, add support for new protocols,
    and modify existing ones. To this end, P4 [116] is being increasingly recognized
    as “the programming language for the data plane”. P4 supports a wide variety of
    hardware ranging from ASICs to commodity CPUs, and allows the controller to specify:
    (i) a packet parser for extracting header fields, and (ii) a collection of match-action
    tables that process these headers. Further, we note that the operation of many
    applications depends upon the real-time state of the system, and relying on the
    controller to update the forwarding state each time introduces a significant latency
    burden. Consequently, there has been a growing body of research that seeks to
    develop stateful data planes, wherein some of the stateful packet processing and
    control tasks are offloaded to the data plane switches [117]–[119]. For example,
    a stateful data plane device may store some form of packet metadata, using it
    to process new packets belonging to the same flow. The general packet forwarding
    rules are still set by the controller, however, the presence of state information
    provides context for rule selection at the switch level. Programmable stateful
    data planes present a variety of inter-related research challenges. First, there
    is a need for a generic broad-based definition of state, along with abstractions
    that expose this state. Second, since packet-level state maintenance will be done
    by distributed switching devices, there is a need for a state consistency mechanism.
    A mechanism of this kind could potentially be enforced through the controller,
    to prevent conflicting forwarding actions. Third, security considerations present
    another important challenge. If the data plane switches are going to perform actions
    based on packet metadata, a malicious actor could easily use malformed packets
    to trigger state transitions for example. In this case, ultra-lightweight mechanisms
    will be needed to verify packet integrity. B. Automated Service Decomposition
    and Orchestration Network slicing allows for the provisioning of differentiated
    services over the same physical infrastructure [120], and has been a major research
    focus in the cellular domain [121]–[124]. However, the slice instantiation and
    deployment process is largely template-driven and requires manual configuration.
    For example, current 3GPP network slicing specification [120] is primarily based
    on the concept of network slice templates (NSTs). An NST explicitly defines the
    virtual network functions (VNFs) and associated service function chain that comprise
    a network service. Consequently, such network slicing primitives allow for the
    deployment of a limited set of network services, i.e., only those services for
    which a template has already been defined. Clearly, an approach of this kind is
    not scalable because: (i) it does not provide a mechanism to deal with new kinds
    of network services, and (ii) as network services increase in complexity, the
    effort required to create and maintain templates will become an operational burden.
    Going beyond the traditional template-driven model, we propose the concept of
    automated service decomposition and orchestration for network slice automation,
    as shown in Figure 6. To this end, and in line with 3GPP terminology, we identify
    three major stakeholders– the communication service customers (CSCs), the communication
    service providers (CSPs), and the virtual infrastructure service providers (VISPs).
    The CSCs request communications services from CSPs, who instantiate network slices
    and deploy them over infrastructure owned by VISPs to deliver the requested services.
    As part of the slice automation workflow, the CSCs provide high-level requirements
    such as those relating to latency, throughput, reliability, etc., along the lines
    of the emerging intent-based networking paradigm [125]. Next, the CSC automatically
    decomposes the request into a constituent VNF-forwarding graph (VNF-FG). It is
    important to note here that the service to VNF-FG mapping is not a based on a
    template, but instead makes use of deep learning models to extract service requirements
    and construct the corresponding VNF-FG. The resulting service-specific VNF-FG
    also contains the resource requirements for the constituent VNFs, allowing for
    seamless deployment onto the underlying infrastructure. Once the service has been
    deployed, continuous monitoring and real-time telemetry are used to ensure operational
    optimality. FIGURE 6. Automated network slicing framework. Show All C. Self-Driving
    Networks For decades, the network operator has served as the centerpiece of network
    operations. However, the increasing complexity of communications networks coupled
    with the constant state of flux brought forth by an ever-increasing number of
    connected devices has made the task of real-time network management nearly impossible
    for human operators. Therefore, there is a strong case for transitioning from
    operator-driven networks to self-driving networks. More specifically, self-driving
    networks are expected to allow for elastic utilization of resources, error-free
    operation, prompt and targeted responses to security incidents, and proactive
    rather than reactive service handling [126, §2]. Seeking complete automation of
    network management, a self-driving network is defined as a network where: (i)
    network measurements are task-driven and tightly integrated with the control of
    the network, and (ii) large-scale data analytics and machine learning models are
    used for network control, as opposed to closed-form models of individual protocols
    [127]. In a nutshell, self-driving networks should be capable of measuring, analyzing,
    and controlling themselves in an automated manner [128]. At the outset, a self-driving
    network should take a high-level goal or intent as input. Expanding upon the concept
    of intents, we note that there are broadly two types of intents– imperative and
    declarative. While the former describes in explicit detail how a particular procedure
    should be carried out, the latter just describes the end-goal without specifying
    how the stated goal should be achieved. For example, “reduce network congestion
    by shifting incoming traffic originating at ingress node 1 from load balancer
    2 to load balancer 3” is an imperative intent since it explicitly defines the
    steps that network must undertake in order to relieve congestion. On the other
    hand, “optimize network operations” is a declarative intent. However, a truly
    declarative intent of the kind described here would be extremely difficult to
    implement in the near future. Instead, semi-declarative intents that define more
    concrete goals would be far more helpful. “Minimize network congestion”, is one
    example of such an intent since it tasks the network with optimizing its operation
    by focusing on a specific objective, i.e., minimizing congestion. Based on the
    intent, the network is expected to determine: (i) the measurements that need to
    be performed, (ii) the corresponding inferences and learning that is required,
    and (iii) the actions that must be undertaken in response to the input intent.
    While a formal representation for self-driving networks is yet to be realized,
    a high-level architecture has been presented in Figure 7, highlighting the importance
    of large-scale data acquisition, real-time analytics and inference, and programmable
    data planes. FIGURE 7. High-level architecture for self-driving networks. Show
    All However, the realization of self-driving networks brings forth several research
    challenges as described next. Accurate Intent Definitions: As discussed previously,
    good intent definitions must toe the line between imperative and declarative.
    If the intent is primarily imperative, it defeats the point of automation. On
    the other hand, if the intent is purely declarative, the automation procedure
    becomes unnecessarily complex. Therefore, there is a pressing need for formal
    guidelines that put forward a clear framework for intent definitions. For example,
    a framework of this kind could take into account customer expectations in terms
    of throughput and latency, network-wide resource optimization goals, along with
    other application-specific functions and services that are required from the network.
    Automated Real-time Inference: Machine learning is vital to the automated decision
    making process in self-driving networks. However, previous work in this domain
    has largely focused on applying pre-existing learning techniques for network control,
    which are not well-suited for network data, given its high-volume, distributed
    nature, and rapid evolution. The major challenge here is the native integration
    of inference and control algorithms with the network’s decision and control fabric.
    In addition, network design needs to evolve to improve the quality of data that
    is input to the designed control algorithms [127]. Within the domain of self-driving
    networks, it is widely accepted that quality of data (QoD) is a pre-requisite
    for quality of service (QoS) [127]. In-band Telemetry: Research into in-band telemetry
    (INT) has been largely driven by the need for high quality network monitoring
    data, without introducing additional overhead. The INT approach makes use of programmable
    data planes to encapsulate additional metadata within the data packets themselves
    [129]. Examples of such metadata include switch processing times, buffer occupancy
    levels, and even specific policy rules. As packets traverses the network, they
    keep accumulating additional metadata, which can be extracted as desired, thus
    providing highly-detailed accurate sets of network data. To this end, there is
    a need to quantify the impact of INT on network performance [130]. In particular,
    metrics such as the relationship between the amount of metadata and packet size,
    the additional processing burden introduced, and the accuracy of the measurements
    obtained are all important parameters that merit careful consideration. SECTION
    VII. 6G Radio: Reconfigurable Transceiver Front-Ends The massive increase in the
    number of wirelessly interconnected devices, combined with the ever-growing demand
    for higher wireless data rates, is leading to an overcrowded electromagnetic (EM)
    spectrum. To overcome the spectrum scarcity problem and increase the capacity
    of wireless networks, communication at frequencies beyond RF (i.e., from the mmWave
    to the THz bands) is required. To meet the data-rate, reliability, and scalability
    requirements from RF to THz, transformative solutions are needed which include
    the design, implementation, and optimization of frequency-agile, ultra-broadband
    reconfigurable systems. A system of this kind is able to simultaneously sense
    and communicate over the full EM spectrum (1 GHz to 10 THz), and serves as a major
    contributor towards the infrastructure needed for the next generation of wireless
    communications. To realize this vision, pioneering contributions are required
    in terms of: (i) new devices that surpass the limits of CMOS technology by leveraging
    the state-of-the-art in materials science and nanoscale physics, (ii) heterogeneous
    integration of such devices which is compatible with the electrical, thermal,
    and EMI requirements for reconfigurability and manufacturing scalability, and
    (iii) novel all-spectrum dynamic sensing and communication algorithms, which maximize
    the achievable network capacity. The primary goal for 6G radio is to establish
    dynamic all-spectrum sensing and communication from RF to THz bands, therefore,
    transforming the way in which wireless devices sense, access, and share the EM
    spectrum. To achieve such a goal, key steps include: (i) intelligent all-spectrum
    sensing solutions, (ii) transceiver hardware design and implementation, and (iii)
    spectral and energy efficiency optimization as well as resource management. It
    is worth noting that currently reported works are fulfilling part of this grand
    goal by achieving dynamic spectrum sensing or multi-band communications over several
    frequency bands. It is our hope to motivate advanced solutions to realize all-spectrum
    communications through this section. A. Dynamic All-Spectrum Sensing and Access
    In recent times, a concentrated research effort at the physical and link layers
    has driven exciting progress at RF frequencies for individual cognitive radios
    (CRs). For example, a recently awarded research project by the Research and Innovation
    Program in the United Kingdom named “6G Mitola Radio” aims to establish self-regulating
    societies for wireless communications with fairness and high efficiency.4 This
    research will facilitate seamless convergence across heterogeneous wireless networks
    with intelligent decisions made by radios to maximize the quality of experience
    for end-users. One step further, a major challenge is to develop innovative spectrum
    sensing and sensing-informed communication and network optimization techniques
    for dynamic access to all-spectral resources. Within this context, the targeted
    breakthrough would be the development of wireless network-aware state inference
    using all-spectrum cartography for cognition over the swath of frequencies from
    RF to the THz bands, along with cartography-constrained algorithms for the physical
    and cross-layer control protocols. Artificial intelligence and associated learning
    algorithms should be investigated for dynamic spectrum sharing with a minimum
    cost in interference. The techniques developed should wholly exploit the capabilities
    of the hybrid front-ends, which include a multi-band transceiver design and solutions
    for resource management. B. Multi-Band Transceiver Design The optimal selection
    of materials and devices needed to enable all-spectrum communications is vital
    to the success of any multi-band transceiver design. Existing solutions mostly
    rely on CMOS for multi-band operations, but such an approach only works well in
    narrowbands. Moreover, solutions based on software-defined radios (SDRs) have
    high energy consumption and carbon footprint, consuming several Watts in operation
    [131], [132]. Instead, novel approaches based on metamaterials, MEMS switches,
    and even nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) switches should be sought to implement
    hybrid front-ends (Figure 8), which are able to simultaneously sense the EM spectrum,
    identify the best available band, and communicate over it, at frequencies anywhere
    from 1 GHz to 10 THz. Furthermore, fast-evolving deep learning algorithms serve
    as an efficient solution for identifying available spectrum, tuning channels,
    and adjusting RF power levels. FIGURE 8. Conceptual design of a hybrid front-end
    for dynamic all-spectrum sensing and communication in 6G. Show All To realize
    this vision, new techniques in materials and devices, integration and packaging,
    and spectrum sensing and communication are necessary. At the RF and microwave
    frequency bands, a combination of low-risk mature CMOS technology, with less-mature,
    potentially transformative technologies, including quantum cascade lasers (QCLs)
    and new plasmonic technologies based on graphene and other 2D materials will be
    able to provide optimal tunabilities as well as a high quality factor (i.e., the
    Q-factor). The heterogeneous integration of discrete devices into a fully functional
    front-end will require innovation to satisfy material compatibility, EMI shielding,
    thermal dissipation, and scalability requirements. On the other hand, metamaterial
    and nano-materials will be deployed at sub-THz and THz bands, based on recent
    advances in nano-tubes and graphene, as well as other single-atom-thin semiconductors.
    Space-time-frequency coding in metasurfaces will also allow programmable and fine-tunable
    radio access at mmWaves. Optimal control of the front-ends requires innovative
    all-spectrum sensing, utilization and sharing techniques, new waveform and hierarchical
    modulation designs to maximize the capacity and distance in ultra-broadband systems,
    and scalable networking solutions which are able to support the envisioned node
    density in future cyber-physical systems. The combination of several cutting-edge
    techniques can help maximize: (i) spectrum utilization (toward all-spectrum utilization),
    (ii) data-rates (toward terabit-per-second links) and, (iii) network user capacity
    (billions of interconnected wireless devices). The proposed technology will enable
    a plethora of applications in the consumer, military, industrial and medical fields,
    including transformative networking architectures designed to meet the scalability
    demands in future cyber-physical systems. C. Reconfigurable Front-End Scheme Accompanying
    the dynamic all-spectrum sensing and multi-band operation, agile front-ends should
    also be equipped with reconfigurability. In terms of hardware design, the plasmonic
    reflectarrays can be deployed in the 3D environment, with a size ranging from
    1 mm2 to 100 mm2 depending on the operating frequency (mmWave/THz-band). Owing
    to the sub-wavelength size of their elements, the plasmonic reflectarrays are
    able to reflect signals in non-conventional ways, which include controlled reflections
    in non-specular directions as well as reflections with polarization conversion
    [133]. In order to adapt to dynamic frequency operation, achieve various levels
    of directivity, and allocate multiple beams, the aperture of plasmonic reflectarray
    antenna can be controlled mechanically through folding, splitting, or combining
    in a 3D space. Existing prior art using origami antennas works well in systems
    using a single metal antenna, as reported in [134], [135]. However, to achieve
    reconfigurable continuous aperture antenna arrays, plasmonic reflectarrays offer
    a higher degree of freedom with the compactness of unit element distribution.
    On the other hand, electronically-controlled reconfigurable antenna arrays are
    envisioned by leveraging the tunability of plasmonic antennas. In particular,
    one of the relevant properties of graphene-based plasmonic nano-antennas is the
    possibility to change their resonant frequency by utilizing a small voltage to
    modify their Fermi energy [136]. The possibility to tune an antenna (or group
    of antennas) at different frequencies without any mechanical modification (as
    opposed to other multi-band antenna arrays that utilize MEMS or NEMS to create
    origami type structures [137]) enables beamforming not only across space but also
    across frequencies. D. Open Problems The biggest hurdle to be overcome lies in
    the implementation of an integrated ultra-broadband hybrid front-end that is capable
    of sensing and communication from the RF to the THz bands, over a target distance
    of a few hundred meters. Meeting this multidisciplinary challenge requires us
    to: (i) close the THz gap by developing new device technologies, (ii) design and
    integrate re-programmable circuitry, interconnects and antennas that can support
    all-spectrum operation, (iii) develop new material integration and packaging techniques
    to satisfy the electrical, thermal and EMI requirements of disparate bands, and,
    (iv) develop scalable all-spectrum communication using the front-ends. SECTION
    VIII. Ambient Backscatter Communications In the realm of IoT, sensors are expected
    to function in various environments with long-lasting battery life. Solutions
    such as radio frequency identification (RFID) utilize the backscatter technique
    to modulate and reflect RF signals instead of generating them, which can achieve
    a significant degree of energy saving. However, existing modulated backscatter
    solutions have stringent requirements in terms of the proximity between the backscatter
    transmitter and the RF source, due to the attenuation of the signal over long
    distances. Besides, the modulated backscatter transmitters are passive, which
    means that they cannot transmit data without requests initiated by backscatter
    receivers [138]. Furthermore, the issue of self-interference may arise when the
    backscatter receiver and RF sources are co-located. Hence, in order to achieve
    better energy efficiency with a higher degree of flexibility and scalability,
    new solutions are required in the 6G IoT network. Currently, with more small cells
    being deployed in outdoor and more access points in indoor environments, the RF
    signals are covering a wide range of surroundings, and can be considered as a
    resource to be utilized by secondary radio links without requiring extra power.
    The system that employs such a technique is called an “ambient backscatter communication
    system”. In an ambient backscatter communication system, transmitters can harvest
    the surrounding and continuous electromagnetic waves radiated by TV towers, base
    stations, as well as access points, use simple circuits for modulation, and reflect
    them towards receivers. There is no need for dedicated spectrum bands for such
    ambient backscatter transceivers to operate, nor complex electronic components
    (e.g., analog-to-digital converters) to process signals. A. Operation Principles
    of Backscatter Communications In general, as the name suggests, backscatter communication
    systems reflect signals impinged on a backscatter transmitter in the direction
    of the signals’ origin, and since it is not a perfect specular reflection, the
    signals are scattered within a certain angular range of the environment. A backscatter
    communication receiver within the range can thus pick up the signals. In particular,
    backscatter communications have three variations in terms of architecture, which
    are monostatic, bistatic, and ambient backscatter communications, respectively.
    Here we briefly explain the first two types and then focus on the last one. As
    the most commonly adopted backscatter communication approach with widely-used
    RFID applications, monostatic backscatter communication systems have the simplest
    setup, which consists of a backscatter transmitter and a reader. The reader has
    both an RF signal source and a backscatter receiver embedded with a switch to
    change the operation mode. Once the receiver sends out a request, the RF source
    activates the backscatter transmitter, which then modulates and reflects the EM
    waves impinged on it back to the receiver, as shown in Figure 9. Such a design
    is mainly used for short-range RFID applications [138]. Nonetheless, two drawbacks
    of the monostatic backscatter communication architecture are (i) the reader cannot
    perform full duplex communication due to the switch mechanism, and (ii) the signals
    experience round-trip path loss being sent from the reader to the transmitter
    and then reflected back to the reader. FIGURE 9. Illustration of backscatter communication
    systems. Show All On the contrary, in the bistatic backscatter communication architecture,
    the RF source and receiver are separated, as shown in Figure 9, which provides
    higher flexibility in the spatial domain. With multiple RF sources and backscatter
    transmitters well placed, the serving range can be remarkably extended compared
    to the monostatic backscatter scenario. Despite this improvement, it is more costly
    for bistatic backscatter communication systems to operate in real networks, since
    they require RF sources and transmitters to be well-placed so as to achieve desired
    performance, and most of the times this condition can be difficult to satisfy,
    especially in a sophisticated network environment, such as an indoor office or
    dense urban scenarios. B. Mechanism of Ambient Backscatter Communications Different
    from the monostatic backscatter device where the transmitting and receiving components
    are separately located and the RF source is co-located with the receiver, devices
    of ambient backscatter communication systems consist of both the transmitter and
    receiver. Additionally, distinct from bistatic backscatter communications, ambient
    backscatter communications do not require dedicated RF sources to provide exclusive
    services, which can reduce infrastructure and maintenance expenditure significantly.
    Therefore, the ambient backscatter communications provide the most energy-efficient
    solution for sensors in the IoT network in 6G. Specifically, in one proof-of-concept
    study for utilizing the always-on radio signals for ambient backscatter communications
    reported in [139], TV signals serve as the RF source, which can be amplitude and
    sometimes frequency-division modulated. In the ambient backscatter transmitter
    design, a simple switch consisting of a transistor and connected to the antenna
    can be used to modulate the impedance of the antenna: a mismatch of impedance
    indicates a reflection mode of the impinging signals, whereas a matched impedance
    allows for the signal being absorbed by the antenna [139]. The power consumption
    of such 1-bit modulation of signals is minimal. At the receiver side, by demodulating
    the received sequence of “1” and “0”, signals can be successfully recovered. However,
    it is worth noting that since the reflected signals from the ambient environment
    already contain encoded information from the RF source system (e.g., cellular
    or TV networks), the receiver design should take into consideration how to extract
    the backscattered signals from the mixture. Besides the simplicity in transceiver
    implementation, ambient backscatter communications are not restricted to a single-band
    operation. In fact, the ambient backscatter transceivers can operate in the wide
    range of super high frequency (SHF) bands, covering Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and other
    bands [138]. C. Open Problems in Ambient Backscatter Communications Spectral and
    Energy Efficiency: Currently, the research and development of ambient backscatter
    communications is still in its infancy. As mentioned before, careful planning
    of backscatter devices is crucial for achieving good performance. Due to the randomness
    in IoT device deployment, current solutions fall behind in terms of the targeted
    spectral efficiency. Specifically, the randomly-located IoT devices should utilize
    ambient backscatter links to achieve a satisfying throughput while maintaining
    an extended transmission distance. Additionally, even though individual backscatter
    communication devices demonstrate good energy performance, an IoT network comprising
    hundreds or even thousands of such devices might still require optimization of
    energy efficiency on a system level. Protocol Design: Existing ambient backscatter
    communication systems are mostly used for dedicated application-specific purposes,
    and thus lack good compatibility with other wireless communication systems. Standardization
    and protocol design are necessary to formalize the key operation and management
    aspects of ambient backscatter communications, such as packet size, routing protocols,
    among others. SECTION IX. Internet of Space Things With CubeSats and UAVs The
    Internet of Space Things (IoST) is a spatial expansion of the Internet of Things
    which primarily focuses on terrestrial use cases. For future communication networks,
    this expansion is necessary for the following reasons: (i) the IoT relies heavily
    on existing infrastructure and hence lacks flexibility as well as scalability,
    (ii) global coverage is impossible using traditional IoT solutions, especially
    in remote areas including the North and South Poles, due to the imbalance of construction
    expenditure and service revenue, and (iii) limited heterogeneity and spectrum
    resources in the IoT network. To this end, IoST is envisioned as a ubiquitous
    cyber-physical system spanning ground, air, and space, with applications in monitoring
    and reconnaissance, in-space backhauling, and holistic data integration [140].
    More specifically, as shown in Figure 10, IoST consists of the ground station,
    customer premises, and on-Earth sensing devices which form the ground segment,
    and the CubeSats, UAVs, and near-Earth sensing devices that form the space segment.
    The ground-to-satellite links (GSLs) connect the IoST Hubs with CubeSats to exchange
    requests and data, and the inter-satellite links (ISLs) relay information to neighboring
    CubeSats, in both the same orbit as well as adjacent orbits. Further, the UAVs
    establish links with each other, as well as sensors and CubeSats to form a localized
    data aggregation layer. To this end, we note that UAVs are expected to feature
    heavily in the upcoming 3GPP Releases 16 and 17 [142]. Further, since the space
    segment forms a vital component of the system, research relating to the development
    of small satellites, or CubeSats [143], for use within IoST is of critical importance
    [140]. FIGURE 10. Illustration of the IoST [140]. Show All CubeSats are a set
    of miniaturized satellites with sizes ranging from 1U to 6U (a “U” is 10×10×10c
    m 3 ). Currently, CubeSats are being deployed for a variety of applications including
    Earth sensing [144], positioning, and IoT and machine-to-machine communications.
    Compared to traditional LEO satellites, CubeSats present a number of advantages
    relating to (i) lower costs and shorter development cycles and (ii) higher flexibility
    and scalability [141]. Normally the development cycles range from three to seven
    years for traditional LEO and GEO satellites and the costs are extremely high.
    Also, since the payloads are pre-determined in the LEO and GEO satellites from
    the period of development until deployment, it is difficult to reconfigure any
    component in the middle of the process. However, CubeSats’ development can be
    done in a remarkably shorter time using COTS components with much lower costs.
    This also guarantees that CubeSats are easily reconfigurable. To this end, we
    have recently proposed a new next-generation CubeSat hardware concept as shown
    in Figure 11 [141]. The proposed CubeSat design includes an all-new communications
    subsystem for seamless operation in a wide variety of frequency bands. More specifically,
    the novelty of our design concept is characterized by the presence of multi-band
    transceivers and antennas that are able to support wireless communications at
    microwave, mmWave, and THz frequencies as detailed in the following section. Through
    this unique CubeSat design, we can potentially achieve data rates in excess of
    100 Gbps [141]. FIGURE 11. Conceptual design of a next-generation CubeSat [141].
    Show All A. Multi-Band Communications Subsystem The primary motivation for a multi-band
    communications subsystem comes from the fact that existing CubeSats have limited
    communications capabilities, largely relying on spectrum ranging from the L- (1–2
    GHz) till the Ka- (26.5–40 GHz) band. There are two major drawbacks associated
    with this approach. First, the traditional frequency bands are becoming increasingly
    prone to congestion [145]. Second, the Tbps-level throughput required by IoST
    cannot be achieved with existing frequency bands. To overcome the spectrum scarcity
    and capacity limitations in current satellite networks, we have proposed the use
    of multiple frequency bands from RF to THz spectrum, in IoST [141]. The use of
    such frequencies has been made possible by advances in high-frequency device development
    [26], [146]. More specifically, as part of the multi-band communications subsystem,
    we have developed both multi-frequency transceivers as well as antenna systems,
    as described next. As shown in Figure 12, in our proposed multi-band transceiver,
    we use two complementary approaches, namely, an electronic frequency up-converting
    chain and an optical frequency down-converting chain, to generate signals at different
    frequencies. With regard to the electronics-based approach, the primary idea is
    to use frequency splitters in order to extract the intermediate frequencies for
    outputs. For example, as shown in Figure 12, the signal at frequency f 1 is considered
    as the intermediate output when producing signals at a higher frequency f 2 .
    FIGURE 12. The proposed all-spectrum signal front-end designs [141]. Show All
    On the other hand, the photonics-based approach involves the down-conversion of
    optical signals. As shown in Figure 12, multi-band signals are generated by heterodyning
    two input signals with a Mach-Zehnder modulator. The resulting RF signal has a
    frequency equal to the difference between the two inputs. The generated signal,
    along with the two input signals, serves as the final output. Distinct from the
    commonly used up-conversion and down-conversion techniques where intermediate
    frequency products are abandoned, our approach harvests them and utilizes them
    as part of the multi-band communication system. These multi-band frequencies can
    be assigned to the GSLs and ISLs dynamically to accommodate various service requirements.
    To this end, within IoST, the GSLs make use of the more robust microwave and mmWave
    frequencies, while high-capacity THz links form the ISLs. In addition to multi-band
    transceivers, CubeSats in the IoST are also equipped with multi-frequency antenna
    systems. In particular, as discussed in Section III, the use of THz links allows
    for very large antenna arrays that serve as the basis for massive MIMO and UM
    MIMO communication schemes. More specifically, we note that there exist multiple
    options when it comes to the design of multi-band antenna arrays. The first approach
    involves the use of NEMS, MEMS, and origami structures to create physically re-configurable
    antennas, wherein the size of the radiating elements can be changed physically
    with a view to adjust their resonant frequency. On the other hand, the second
    approach proposes the use of materials such as graphene to create electronically
    tunable nano-antenna arrays [147], [148]. In this case, the resonant frequency
    can be controlled by modulating the graphene Fermi energy or chemical potential.
    This allows for tuning of the antenna to resonate at different frequencies without
    physically changing its size, in contrast to the MEMS-based approach. B. System
    Constellation Design Within the context of IoST, an ideal constellation design
    is crucial to achieve true global coverage and satisfactory link performance.
    However, conventional LEO constellations are typically characterized by the presence
    of fewer than a hundred satellites, for example, the CubeSat-based IoT system,
    Astrocast, has a maximum of 64 satellites [149]. At the outset, the coverage and
    connectivity offered by such systems leaves much to be desired. Motivated by the
    need for improved coverage, reliable connectivity, and increased redundancy, mega-constellations
    of several hundred satellites have gained significant traction over the past year
    [150]. Mega-constellations provide several advantages over traditional constellations
    including but not limited to increased coverage density, improved connectivity,
    and higher redundancy. More specifically, constellation design typically involves
    solving for several inter-related parameters such as: (i) the apogee and perigee
    radii, (ii) the orbital eccentricity, (iii) the number of CubeSats per orbital
    plane, (iv) the number of orbital planes, and (v) the initial longitude of the
    ascending node, argument of perigee, and true anomaly of the CubeSats. While a
    fairly challenging problem in itself, the presence of an extremely large number
    of satellites further serves to complicate the system design. Consequently, the
    existing state-of-the-art constellation design frameworks are largely geared towards
    the design of systems with a few dozen satellites at best. To this end, we have
    proposed a highly-scalable and customizable constellation design framework that
    takes into consideration both coverage and connectivity parameters [151]. Through
    the use of novel metrics such as spherical Voronoi tessellation based coverage
    characterization and ISL feasibility-based connectivity parameters, we are able
    to demonstrate that the resulting IoST constellation achieves a performance level
    that is similar to existing state-of-the-art mega-constellations such as Starlink,
    while requiring only a quarter, i.e., less than 500, of the satellites [151].
    C. Network Management IoST encompasses a vast infrastructure spanning both the
    Earth as well as space. A complex network of this kind has much to benefit from
    fine-grained real-time control that is well suited for tackling the peculiarities
    of the space environment, namely temporal topological variation and long delays.
    Going beyond the traditional bent pipe nature of satellite communications systems,
    IoST makes extensive use of SDN and NFV to significantly improve network resource
    utilization, simplify network management, and reduce operating costs [140]. In
    a manner similar to the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) paradigm, IoST intends
    to deliver CubeSats-as-a-service, with promising results as shown in [140]. In
    particular, we have demonstrated that through the use of SDN, it is possible to
    achieve sub-second end-to-end latencies. More specifically with the domain of
    network management, IoST introduces the novel concepts of virtual CSI (vCSI) for
    joint optimal physical-link layer resource allocation, and stateful segment routing
    (SSR) for overcoming challenges associated with the high latency space segment.
    In particular, concerning the latter, IoST extends the traditional SDN paradigm
    by including support for state-based packet forwarding that takes into account
    the topological configuration of the network at any given instance of time, while
    the use of segment routing helps in the minimization of control traffic, in addition
    to a higher level of demand satisfaction and load balancing as demonstrated in
    [152]. Further, IoST also employs predictive algorithms to preemptively detect
    GSL outage events, which when coupled with gateway diversity result in the realization
    of proactive handovers that minimize handover interruption time. In addition,
    IoST proposes the use of containzeration [153] in CubeSats for achieving lightweight
    hardware virtualization without significant overhead. Going forward, we note that
    the aforementioned techniques will play a vital role in the realization of pervasive
    cyber-physical systems of this kind. SECTION X. Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communications
    In 5G wireless networks, massive MIMO communications have been tested and deployed
    at base stations (BSs) which are equipped with more than one hundred antenna elements
    to increase the antenna array gain and take advantage of the diversity gain. A
    related concept is network MIMO, which, instead of packing more than one hundred
    antenna elements at a single BS, forms a coordinated framework consisting of multiple
    BSs, each with multiple antennas. A coordination scheme of this kind can achieve
    spatial diversity by allowing a single user to be served by more than one BS at
    the same time, overcoming the disadvantage of bad channel conditions if only one
    BS is connected to the user, and eliminates inter-cell interference [154]. However,
    a detailed comparative study has shown that massive MIMO communication schemes
    outperform network MIMO with respect to end-user received signal strength and
    overall costs in configuration [155]. Going one step further, in order to effectively
    eliminate inter-cell interference caused by users located at cell boundaries,
    based on the ideas of distributed MIMO communications and coordinated multi-point
    (CoMP) communications, researchers have proposed the concept of cell-free massive
    MIMO communication. In a scheme of this kind, the originally densely-packed antenna
    array set with a few hundred elements at the BS is distributed in a fairly large
    area in the form of smaller sets with fewer than 10 antenna elements, while still
    serving a similar number of users in the same area [156]. As shown in Figure 13,
    the main difference between cell-free and classic massive MIMO communication systems
    is that instead of associating each user terminal to a cell with a BS equipped
    with a large number of antenna elements, it relaxes the restriction of cell boundaries,
    which can significantly reduce or even eliminate the inter-cell interference.
    Without cell boundaries, all BSs, or a subset of BSs, can serve users simultaneously
    in a coordinated manner. In coordination, the cell-free massive MIMO BSs can share
    with each other the data to be sent to users through fronthaul links. FIGURE 13.
    Cell-free massive MIMO in comparison with classic massive MIMO. Show All It has
    been shown that the BSs can use their local channel state information (CSI) to
    achieve satisfactory performance and avoid the excessive computation complexity
    associated with sharing global channel conditions with all BSs [157]. The local
    CSI can be estimated in the uplink channel in a time division duplex (TDD) mode.
    Then, precoding is performed based on the obtained channel information at the
    BSs, before data transmission in the downlink channel. The transmit power and
    precoding vector can be determined based on the geographic proximity of users
    to the BSs. Compared to the small-cell architecture in 5G, which consists of non-cooperative
    base stations that can serve up to 100 users per cell with a smaller area (e.g.,
    up to a 200-meter cell radius) and reduced power in signal transmission (e.g.,
    up to 10 Watts), a cell-free massive MIMO communication system achieves significantly
    better performance, since each user can be served by a dedicated access point.
    A reported study in [158] has demonstrated that the cell-free massive MIMO scheme
    improves 95%-likely per-user throughput by five times and by ten times under correlated
    shadow fading, with respect to the small-cell solution. More specifically, the
    same study has reported that when considering realistic channel conditions, including
    pilot contamination and imperfect CSI, cell-free massive MIMO systems demonstrate
    much higher throughput compared to small cells and, more importantly, are more
    robust to impacts such as shadow fading, non-coherence interference, as well as
    noise [158]. However, we also note the following challenges: (i) due to the issue
    of aliasing, channel estimation for signals received by different antenna elements
    is more complicated compared to that of ordinary massive MIMO communications,
    (ii) with the significantly increased synthesized aperture size, the range of
    near-field propagation grows larger, hence requiring a different channel model
    for characterizing the large- and small-scale channel parameters. A. Channel Characteristics
    of Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communication Systems It has been theoretically proven
    that as the number of antenna elements approaches infinity, adversarial channel
    effects, including inter-cell interference, small-scale fading, and others, will
    disappear [159]. In cell-free massive MIMO communications, such effects will also
    have a negligible impact on propagation channels. Specifically, channels under
    a coordinated scheme of this kind will satisfy the conditions of favorable propagation
    [160]. Favorable propagation conditions imply that the channel vectors between
    the BSs and UEs are orthogonal, so that the sum-rate can be maximized. This characteristic
    is most prominent in classic massive MIMO communications [161]. In cell-free massive
    MIMO systems, it has been shown that favorable propagation conditions can be achieved
    given that the number of APs is fairly large (with an approximate density of 1000/km2).
    B. Open Problems in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communications As the domain of cell-free
    massive MIMO communications is relatively new, there are several open problems
    that merit further investigation. Among them, we posit that coordination and optimization
    challenges will critically affect the entire system performance and future deployments.
    User Scheduling: Extensive studies have been conducted on channel characterization
    and capacity analysis. However, the prior art does not take into consideration
    scenarios involving networks with a large number of users to serve. In such cases,
    there might be an upper bound for the number of APs to serve a user in order to
    maintain an acceptable-level of average throughput. Current works assume that
    all users will be served simultaneously under the same frequency resource block.
    However, when the number of users grows to a threshold where they can no longer
    be served at the same time, a scheduling scheme that achieves fairness should
    be considered. Location Optimization of APs: Existing works in cellular networks
    draw heavily upon stochastic geometry where cell structures follow 2D Voronoi
    tessellation and geographically separated BSs that serve cell-edge users under
    the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) scheme to improve overall system efficiency
    and overcome inter-cell interference through scheduling [162], [163]. It is therefore
    crucial to optimize the placement of BSs under practical link-level constraints
    such as signal-to-interference ratio as well as success probability for individual
    links to enhance network fairness [164]. In cell-free massive MIMO, since no cell
    boundaries are assumed, system-level performance pertaining to locations of APs,
    random scatterers, as well as users should be thoroughly investigated and optimized.
    SECTION XI. Technologies for Beyond 6G Thus far, we have presented in great detail
    the key drivers that are expected to play an integral role in the next-generation
    of wireless networks. However, in addition to these, we also note the presence
    of several promising early-stage technologies that are tipped to revolutionize
    how we perceive data communications in the near future. To this end, in this section,
    we discuss three such promising paradigms, namely, the Internet of NanoThings,
    Internet of BioNanoThings, and quantum communications. A. Internet of NanoThings
    In addition to the need for more spectrum resources to accommodate a plethora
    of wireless devices and services, a variety of transformative wireless communications
    scenarios are also envisioned to become a reality in the near future. In particular,
    with the advent of wireless ubiquity, we note the existence of situations where
    electromagnetic waves do not yield acceptable performance or lack reachability
    due to hardware limitations, such as in high-salinity water or intravascular channels
    where the transmission range can be extremely short. In the aforementioned application
    scenarios for THz band communications, as the frequencies of operation increase,
    the wavelengths of signals fall into the nanometer range (i.e., 10−9 to 10−7 meter
    in size), thereby motivating studies on nano-network communications [165], [166].
    Different from those operating at lower frequencies in the microwave range, the
    devices and transceivers used in the Internet of NanoThings (IoNT) are in the
    scale of nanometers, and thus behave differently from classical wireless communication
    systems. Given the much smaller size, each nano-thing consumes much less energy
    and is envisioned to be self-powered (e.g., via vibrational energy harvesting
    using piezoelectric nano-generators [167]). Besides conducting signal transmission
    tasks, the nano-things can also perform basic processing and data storage, as
    well as enabling new nano-sensing capabilities with higher sensitivity. Current
    advancements in nanotechnologies provide several promising candidate materials
    with various dimensions for creating such nano-machines, including a thin strip
    of graphene named graphene nanoribbons, graphene in form of a three-dimensional
    (3D) roll named carbon nanotubes, and graphene spheres. Communications in the
    paradigm of nano-networks mainly falls under two categories, which are (i) encoded
    signal bits being carried with molecules, which follows a diffusion-based mechanism
    elaborated in Section XI-B1 and (ii) plasmonic radiation on metamaterial-based
    antennas including graphene and carbon nano-tubes operating in the THz band. These
    plasmonic antennas [136], [168]–[170] leverage the physics of Surface Plasmon
    Polariton (SPP) waves, i.e., confined EM waves resulting from the global oscillations
    of electrons at the interface of a conductor material and a dielectric material,
    to efficiently radiate at the target resonant frequency while being much smaller
    than the corresponding wavelength. This property allows them to be integrated
    in very dense arrays, beyond traditional antenna arrays. The ratio between the
    free-space wavelength λ and the SPP wavelength λ SPP is known as the plasmonic
    confinement factor, and depends on the plasmonic material properties and the operation
    frequency. The higher the confinement factor, the smaller the antennas and the
    higher the density in which they can be integrated. 1) Essential Components in
    the IoNT Similar to traditional communication networks, several key components
    are seen in IoNT [171]: Nano-nodes are the basic functional units in the nano-network,
    and have sizes ranging from 1 to 100 nanometers, and can form a cluster to forward
    and receive signals. A typical nano-node with full transceiving capability contains
    the following elements: a nano-antenna and a plasmonic nano-tranceiver based on
    graphene advancements to propagate SPP waves, a nano-processer with operating
    frequency close to 1 THz, nano-actuators, nano-sensors which can sense external
    force, gas molecules, and biological objects such as antigens and antibodies,
    a nano-memory which allows storage of a bit signal in a single atom, a nano-battery,
    and an energy nano-harvester which transfers energy to power other elements [172].
    Limited by the computation capabilities and battery life, the signals are mostly
    pulse-based for the easiness of detection and transmission. Nano-routers control
    the behavioral patterns of the nano-nodes, aggregate information, and determine
    the optimal paths for signals to be forwarded. The nano-routers are equipped with
    higher energy and computational resources. When a specific query is created from
    the command center, nano-routers need to select the optimal routes that can reach
    the nano-nodes to collect their data and report back. Due to the limited transmission
    range, a pulse-based signaling is preferred to assess the reachable range of nano-nodes
    in order to minimize outage probability and establish the desired routes. Gateways
    serve as the remote controller of the IoNT and connect over the internet to service
    providers. The gateways can be common smart devices such as smartphones and tablets,
    among others. In order to achieve a manageable network with hundred or even thousands
    of nano-nodes dissipated in sophisticated communication environments, gateways
    should devise a holistic approach in disseminating commands and queries, coordinating
    between possible collisions, and processing noisy data, which requires a drastically
    different network framework than the conventional network architecture. Based
    on the arbitrary pattern of the nano-nodes, potential solutions can be found with
    the assistance of artificial intelligence, which does not require pre-established
    model for prediction. It is worth noting that major device technology in the IoNT
    is still under design and development. Although a few types of individual components,
    such as nano-sensors, have been made available, it is estimated that a major paradigm
    shift for the IoNT is expected to occur in the second half of the 2020s. 2) Applications
    of the IoNT In the realm of IoNT, applications can be primarily found in body
    area networks and short-distance local environments. Three typical application
    scenarios are described as follows (also illustrated in Figure 14): Nano-Cameras:
    The nano-cameras are based on nano-photosensing and nanotechnology to sense, combine,
    and process light signals before transforming them into electric signals. This
    system includes nano-photodectors, nano-lens, nano-batteries, and nano-memories
    in order to achieve fine-resolution imaging and signal processing. The nano-cameras
    can be applied to a wide range of scenarios including but not limited to intravascular
    imaging and fracture detection in oil pipelines [171]. On-Chip Networks: With
    microchips getting more compact in dimension while the complexity of functionality
    grows, on-chip signal transmission has become significantly more challenging.
    Currently, issues relating to CPU scalability and efficient memory synchronization
    have driven research trends towards wireless network-on-chip (WNoC) solutions,
    which can replace wired connections on conventional chips and take advantage of
    short-range communication in the nano-network at THz-band frequencies [173]. Nano-robots
    for IoNT: The nano-robots in nano-networks can be deployed in environments such
    as nuclear power plants and oil pipelines which might be hazardous for humans
    to perform tasks but require high precision and do not allow massive drilling
    or digging over existing infrastructure. Under these circumstances, nano-robots
    can be dissipated to sense and collect data relating to chemical concentration,
    and fluid speed, among others. By forming ad-hoc networks, the nano-robots can
    aggregate and forward data packets to gateways in the IoNT. Nano-robots are also
    being widely researched in biomedical engineering fields. To this end, Section
    XI-B will delve into nano-robots for healthcare applications. FIGURE 14. Application
    scenarios of molecular communications in IoNT and IoBNT. Show All 3) Open Problems
    in the IoNT The significant size shrinkage brings three major challenges. The
    first one is power efficiency optimization. Even though nano-devices consume power
    at the level of microwatts when transmitting femtosecond long pulses, in order
    to cover an area of a few square meters such as an office or a meeting room, the
    energy consumption factors in as a major constraint in maintaining a satisfying
    overall network performance. New designs on duty cycles for nano-transceivers
    should be proposed and evaluated, as well as new clustering algorithms in order
    to group nano-transceivers in close proximity for adaptive operations. The second
    open issue is interference control, which has been extensively studied in classic
    wireless network scenarios. However, the conventional approaches cannot be directly
    applied to the IoNT realm, due to the higher density of nano-transceivers in space
    and pulse-based signal transmission schemes. Self-interference becomes the most
    prominent issue for nano-transceivers when full duplex mode is deployed and hence
    requires novel scheduling algorithms to mitigate this adversarial effect. Additionally,
    new modulation and coding schemes should be developed to fit the need of nano-devices
    on spectral and power efficiency while maintaining a low probability of crosstalk
    among links. The third challenge resides in the network protocols. Since the IoNT
    will foreseeably function in a manner that is drastically different from the IoT
    due to differences in channel conditions, limited scale of operation, as well
    as miniaturized devices, the protocol stack design still remains an open field
    for exploration. B. Internet of BioNanoThings for Health Applications Highly relevant
    to IoNT, with its unique characteristics and applications, is the concept of the
    Internet of BioNanoThings (IoBNT). First introduced in 2015, the IoBNT has garnered
    significant traction in its efforts to synergistically combine telecommunications
    with healthcare solutions [174]. The IoBNT is a network of molecules which can
    communicate with each other. The types of molecular communications include artificial
    cells which act as gateways to translate between different molecule types, or
    a bio-cyber interface which can convert molecular signals to electrical ones and
    transmit to external devices for further processing [175]. In applications relating
    to human healthcare, the IoBNT harbors many unique challenges and opportunities.
    First, the interdisciplinary research on both communications and data analytics
    can greatly facilitate the modeling of biological processes, including cancer
    cell formations and Alzheimer’s disease, and further design effective control
    measures for such diseases. Second, even though expressions of genetic codes at
    the cell- and organ-level can vary remarkably, in a manner analogous to various
    types of data applications in wireless networks, communication models can be developed
    and exploited to conceive a generally applicable health information framework.
    Third, the holistic network architecture envisioned in the IoBNT will integrate
    components at heterogeneous levels including within cells and among tissues, organs,
    as well as systems, before eventually connecting to the outside Internet for physicians
    to perform metric evaluations and propose treatment plans accordingly. However,
    healthcare solutions that are to be realized in such complicated biological and
    molecular environments should be built upon a solid understanding of the physics
    behind molecular communication and advanced statistical analysis tools in order
    to unveil the principles behind the seemingly random molecular movement. 1) Essential
    Communication Models in IoBNT Different from classic wireless communication channels
    based on the propagation of electromagnetic waves, molecular communication (MC)
    channels rely on the mechanism of molecular movement to transmit information.
    The main difference between an MC channel and the classical wireless channel is
    that the transmission medium presents different forms, such as fluids of several
    chemical compositions in blood vessels, plasma membranes of neurons, and so on.
    Based on the motion of molecules in such diverse mediums, end-to-end channel models
    have been developed to characterize the capacity, noise, and interference in various
    communication scenarios [176]–[178]. Particularly, in the diffusion-based MC model,
    information is encoded in various forms, for example, based on different concentration
    intensities and distinct release times of molecules. The nano-device acting as
    a transmitter emits such encoded molecules to the wireless molecular channel.
    At the receiver side, another nano-device decodes the signals based on the quantified
    received intensities or times of arrival, given that the channel remains stationary
    for the duration of transmission. In such transmissions, some molecules will get
    dispersed in the channel and will not be received by the target nano-devices,
    they are hence treated as noise, and channels with such residual molecules are
    characterized as channels with memory. For such channels, the theories of Fick’s
    diffusion and particle location displacement are used to characterize the channel
    capacity as a function of a collection of parameters, including the diffusion
    coefficient of the channel, the temperature, the distance between end-transceivers,
    and the bandwidth of the transmitted signal [178]. 2) IoBNT in Public Health Applications
    Late 2019 and 2020 have seen the novel coronavirus disease named COVID-19 spread
    worldwide, causing high fatalities and a plethora of other public health issues.
    More generally, such outbreaks, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome
    (SARS) in 2002, the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, the Ebola
    virus disease in 2014, and the seasonal influenza, raise questions about the manner
    in which public health systems should react to such epidemics and pandemics. The
    widespread havoc caused by pandemics calls for effective means to identify new
    viruses, understand their mechanisms of viral infection, and devise efficient
    tools for treatment and vaccination. In order to facilitate the development of
    antiviral and preventive solutions, researchers have looked into creating biosensors
    that can monitor the cleavage of proteases within infected cells [179]. Proteases
    are generated as a result of the cell being infected by the genome of coronavirus,
    which is a type of RNA virus. Other byproducts include synthesized polyproteins
    which can replicate and transcript to generate more RNAs, and structural proteins
    that can construct new virions [180]. Two types of proteases found in the coronaviruses
    that cause SARS and MERS (i.e., SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov) are papain-like protease
    and 3C-like protease. The biosensor, which is based on luciferase, is used to
    identify potential broad-spectrum coronavirus papain-like or 3C-like protease
    inhibitors. The SARS-CoV-2 virions that cause the COVID-19 disease have a diameter
    of 50–200 nanometers approximately [181], and infect the human respiratory system
    via human-to-human spread, in the form of droplets discharged when an infected
    person coughs or sneezes [182]. COVID-19 has thus far posed unprecedented challenges
    worldwide in testing, treatment, and vaccine development. The IoBNT is envisioned
    to have immense potential in the molecular diagnosis of emerging viruses of this
    kind. The nanosensors, which can be firefly luciferase-based or other reporter
    genes, can be used to examine the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
    in collected samples. Other tests include using bio-nano-sensors to identify antibodies
    from blood samples to examine if the person is infected. In terms of treatment,
    although no antiviral drugs are available for COVID-19 yet, studies on influenza
    treatment can shed light on how the IoBNT could assist in future solution development.
    A critical step for treatment is the antiviral intervention, which blocks the
    intracellular signaling pathways to prevent influenza viruses from replication.
    A reported solution preventing the virus from replication is to use engineered
    bacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli) to trap the Ebola virus [183]. In the reported
    work, the blood of a patient with the Ebola virus infection is transmitted to
    a microfluidic chamber tube outside the body which contains the engineered bacteria.
    The scattered bacteria can then achieve protein binding with the Ebola virus using
    chemical bind force and synthetic protein binding receptors [183]. More importantly,
    the IoBNT serves a unique role as a holistic solution to not only monitor limited
    types of cells (e.g., squamous epithelial cells from nasopharyngeal swabs for
    COVID-19 tests), but also across different tissues and systems. It is found that
    such coronaviruses can also cause damage to digestive and neurological systems
    [181], [184]. Hence, a series of connected bio-nano-things consisting of various
    types of engineered bacteria can operate simultaneously to improve test reliability
    and treatment efficiency. 3) Artificial Intelligence in IoBNT for Health Applications
    In the IoBNT network, different systems demonstrate a wide variation in characteristics,
    thereby requiring varied analytical approaches. For example, in cardiovascular
    systems, the speed of molecular transmission is determined by the speed of blood
    flow and heart rate, among other factors, which may vary per person; whereas in
    the nervous system, the time required to propagate information-carrying electro-chemical
    stimuli through neurons depends on the connectivity of synapses. In order to estimate
    the error rate and capacity, the existing diffusion-based MC model normally requires
    several channel parameters to formulate the model for computation. The generic
    modeling approach provides initial insights into the behavior of molecular signal
    transmission, however, recent advances in statistical learning, that utilize artificial
    intelligence, provide increasingly refined solutions for modeling sophisticated
    molecular information exchange processes. For example, in [77], a signal detection
    algorithm based on neural networks has been shown to achieve good performance
    without prior knowledge of the molecular channel, thus lending support to the
    use of statistical inference for characterizing molecular communication channels.
    Furthermore, a neural network-based nano-receiver design has been proposed in
    [185] which shows good bit error rate performance under the effect of inter-symbol
    interference. 4) Open Problems for IoBNT Currently, IoBNT primarily focuses on
    studies in the domains of physical layer channel modeling, capacity analysis,
    modulation and coding schemes, and nano-transceiver design. However, research
    gaps relating to the following aspects need to be overcome: Experimental Validation:
    The theoretical models of molecular communications should be validated under realistic
    channel environments, which include experimental testing. Traditionally, these
    experimental tests have posed high requirements on lab equipment and the nurturing
    process of cells and bacteria. While the procedures for such experiments should
    be strictly followed and executed, at times the cost for testing can be remarkably
    high. In such situations, simulations based on realistic assumptions serve as
    an alternative means, which have been commonly adopted in research. The convergence
    between analytical and experimental approaches should be a joint effors by researchers
    across fields in telecommunications, biomedical engineering, and signal processing.
    Data Storage and Management: The large data sets obtained from experiments or
    simulations can have many control variables which require efforts to manage and
    update. Open databases have become a popular trend for sharing raw data to benefit
    the entire research community for collaboration, and can be a foreseeable direction
    for research in the IoBNT. C. Quantum Communications As networks continue to evolve
    beyond 6G, they are expected to incorporate more spectrum, a larger variety of
    transceiver front-ends, higher complexity in processed signals, and stricter requirement
    on reliability, and therefore, it is expected that the computational requirements
    of wireless systems will also increase [186]. To this end, quantum computing has
    been widely recognized as a key enabling technology for realizing computationally
    complex systems [187]. Quantum systems are particularly useful for solving complex
    optimization problems. For example, in the optimal routing problem with multiple
    objectives, traditional methods, including the geographic routing algorithm, demonstrate
    significant complexities to yield optimal solutions, and less complex ones often
    sacrifice optimality [188]. It has been demonstrated that using quantum computing
    for such problems can efficiently reduce complexity while achieving optimality
    [189]. However, such computationally intensive tasks often require several hundreds
    of thousands or millions of interconnected quantum bits, and therefore cannot
    be performed on a single quantum chip. The need for interconnecting several chips
    of this kind has given rise to the concept of quantum communications. Quantum
    communications is thus indispensable for operating quantum systems at scale [190].
    More specifically, quantum communications is defined as the exchange of information
    that adheres to the laws of quantum mechanics, and offers several key advantages:
    (i) the capability of large-scale parallel computation, (ii) the ability to transfer
    data in a tamper-proof manner, and (iii) the potential to encode and transmit
    a large number of multiple data streams simultaneously. We begin our discussion
    of quantum communications by describing the following four postulates or rules
    that govern the operation of such systems [191]: Postulate 1 - The Quantum Bit:
    Within the context of classical communications, a binary value of either 0 or
    1 per bit is used to represent data. On the other hand, in quantum communications,
    the quantum bit, or qubit, contains the superposition of both logical values at
    the same time, of the form |Φ⟩= a 0 |0⟩+ a 1 |1⟩, (1) View Source where |Φ⟩ represents
    a two-dimensional vector, with the coefficients a 0 and a 1 being complex numbers,
    and 0 and 1 being the two logical values. Postulate 2 - The Quantum Register:
    Just like computing registers that are used to store multiple bits, quantum registers
    are used for storing qubits. However, unlike classical registers that are deterministic,
    the output of a quantum register is probabilistic, i.e., when reading or measuring
    the quantum register, a different value may be returned each time, thus presenting
    a major challenge in the implementation of quantum information exchange systems.
    Postulate 3 - Exponential Speed-up: Exponential speed-up is a key property of
    quantum information processing systems. We know that classical systems employ
    parallelization wherein multiple computing units process parallel streams of data
    simultaneously. On the other hand, in quantum systems, the entire input information
    is placed in a single quantum register, and a single quantum computing unit can
    process multiple register states simultaneously, thus achieving a significant
    reduction in the time required for computation. Postulate 4 - The Q/C Conversion:
    Since it is far easier to perceive information in terms of 0s and 1s, i.e., classical
    information, it becomes imperative to interpret the results of any quantum operation
    in the classical domain. To this end, the classical interpretation of (1) implies
    that, if we were to measure such a qubit, we would receive value 0 with probability
    p 0 =| a 0 | 2 and value 1 with p 1 =| a 1 | 2 . Closely related to the four postulates
    is the concept of entanglement [191]. Entanglement is a phenomenon in which the
    quantum states of two or more particles are described with reference to each other.
    Within this context, these particles exist in a shared state, and are referred
    to as entangled pairs. Any action on a particle within the entangled pair immediately
    affects all other particles within that pair, irrespective of the physical separation
    between them. For example, if a photon traveling through an optical fiber is entangled
    with another photon outside the fiber, the photon inside the fiber will experience
    the same effects as those experienced by the photon on the outside. In this case,
    entanglement serves as a source of noise in the quantum channel. Continuing our
    discussion of quantum channels, we note that classical information theory does
    not apply to these channels. Unlike traditional wireless communication channels
    where the large- and small-scale parameters are deterministic or can be stochastically
    characterized, the capacity of qubit carrying quantum channels is defined as the
    rate at which classical or quantum information increases with each use of the
    quantum channel [192]. Moreover, there exist several different types of capacities
    for quantum channels, including but not limited to the classical capacity, the
    quantum capacity, the private capacity, the entanglement assisted capacity, and
    the zero-error capacity. The classical and quantum capacities are the two most
    commonly used definitions. In particular, while the classical capacity measures
    classical information transmission over a noisy quantum channel, the quantum capacity
    represents the amount of quantum information, i.e., qubits, that can be transmitted
    through a noisy quantum channel. We refer the interested reader to [192] for additional
    insight into each of these channel capacity types. In the following, we discuss
    the different types of channels, data routing, and open problems within the domain
    of quantum communications. 1) Types of Channels Within the broader domain of quantum
    communications, we take into consideration the following types of channel, the
    dephasing channel and the depolarizing channel [193], [194]. The Dephasing Channel:
    The dephasing channel, also known as the phase damping or phase flip channel,
    applies a bit flip in the conjugate basis. The impact of the dephasing channel
    can be best described as equivalent to measuring the qubit in the computational
    basis and then forgetting the result of the measurement. A more detailed treatment
    of the nuances of the dephasing channel can be found in [193, §4]. The Depolarizing
    Channel: The depolarizing channel is often referred to the “worst-case scenario”
    and describes the fact that the qubit may be left unchanged with a probability
    1−p , with p ∈[0,1] , or that an error may occur with probability p . In this
    case, the error could be one of three types, with each being equally likely– the
    bit flip error, the phase flip error, or both. In the event of an error, it is
    assumed that the channel replaces the lost qubit with a maximally mixed state
    [194, §2], i.e, all states become equally likely. For example, the maximally mixed
    state with reference to (1) implies that a 0 = a 1 . 2) Quantum Communications
    Networks Quantum networks are key to the success of distributed quantum computing,
    and in turn rely on the ability to share quantum states between different quantum
    devices. However, unlike conventional networks that are based on the store-and-forward
    paradigm, quantum networks must adhere to the no-cloning theorem which prohibits
    making copies of an arbitrary quantum state [195]. In order to overcome this restriction,
    quantum networks rely on the concept of entanglement [196] described earlier,
    along with quantum teleportation. The process of quantum teleportation [197] leverages
    entanglement to transmit unknown quantum states between remote quantum devices,
    through remote entanglement distribution [198]. Further, as shown in Figure 15,
    we note the following physical entities that constitute quantum networks [190]:
    Quantum Nodes: These are the quantum devices that are interconnected to each other.
    Communication Links: These include both classical as well quantum links that interconnect
    the quantum nodes in the network. Entanglement Generator: This device is responsible
    for generating the entangled pairs that are distributed between the quantum nodes.
    Quantum Memories: These are primarily used for storing quantum states for the
    purpose of communication. Quantum Measurement Devices: Their primary function
    is the assessment of the generated entangled states. FIGURE 15. Physical entities
    associated with quantum networks [190]. Show All While the aforementioned entities
    play a vital role in enabling quantum networks, the process of quantum teleportation
    is affected by the exponential decay of communication rate with distance, which
    in turn is offset by the use of quantum repeaters. The routing problem then involves
    the selection of the optimal path from the source to the destination traversing
    one or more quantum repeaters resulting in a high-quality entanglement distribution.
    Further, the routing framework must also take cognizance of the fact that the
    physical mechanisms underlying quantum entanglement are stochastic, and that the
    passage of time leads to loss of entanglement between the entangled pair [198].
    Expanding upon this, in the following section, we delve into some of the major
    challenges faced by quantum networks today. 3) Open Problems and Major Challenges
    Given the vast differences between the classical and quantum domains, there are
    several fundamental research challenges, that are vital to the success of quantum
    networks, as detailed next. Quantum Error Correction: There are three major challenges
    faced by error correction techniques for qubits [199]. First, while classical
    error correction codes assume that data can be duplicated freely, the no-cloning
    theorem precludes the arbitrary duplication of quantum states. Second, since qubits
    are susceptible to both bit-flip and phase-flip errors, quantum error correction
    techniques need to be able to detect both error types simultaneously, unlike classical
    techniques that take only bit-flips into consideration. Third, there exists the
    possibility of wavefunction collapse [200] due to measurements on the qubits performed
    as part of the error correction procedure. Entanglement Distribution: Long distance
    entanglement distribution is a key challenge in the realization of quantum networks,
    impacting the physical, link, and network layers [196]. More specifically, at
    the physical layer, there is a need for quantum error correction techniques, while
    the no-cloning theorem necessitates a re-design of the link layer. At the network
    layer, novel quantum routing metrics are required to ensure optimal path selection.
    Deployment Challenges: Quantum computing devices require highly specialized data
    centers equipped with ultra-high vacuum systems and ultra-low temperature cryostats.
    Further, while quantum teleportation has been proposed as a means to realize quantum
    networks, it requires the integration of classical and quantum communication resources,
    which is a fairly complex problem in itself. SECTION XII. Tentative Timeline for
    6G Thus far, we have described the manner in which the evolution of societal needs
    will guide the transition from 5G to 6G, along with a plethora of new and upcoming
    use cases that will be best served by 6G. We have also discussed the tentative
    KPIs associated with 6G and the key enabling technologies that will play a vital
    role in achieving these next-generation KPIs, as summarized in Table 2. As shown
    in Figure 16, the increasing technological readiness and worldwide deployments
    of 5G systems have set the stage for a thoughtful discussion on the future of
    wireless communications. TABLE 2 A Brief Summary of the KPI Impacts and Open Problems
    Associated With Each Key Enabling Technology for 6G and Beyond FIGURE 16. Projected
    timeline for 6G and beyond systems. Show All While 3GPP standards over the next
    few years, up to and including Release 18 in 2024, are expected to primarily deal
    with 5G, the ITU has recently convened the Focus Group on Technologies for Network
    2030 (FG NET-2030) [201], to study the capabilities of networks for the year 2030
    and beyond. More generally, as we have seen in the preceding sections, each of
    the presented key technologies has witnessed significant traction in terms of
    research and development, laying the groundwork for the next generation of wireless
    communications. Both the National Science Foundation (NSF) through its Platforms
    for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) initiative [202] and the European Commission
    [203] are expected to play a major role in the development of 6G. At the same
    time, going beyond academia, we expect a significant rise in industry involvement
    in the development of these technologies over the next few years, culminating
    in key hardware and software technology demos by 2025, followed by full-scale
    6G testbeds in 2026 and beyond. We envision that these testbeds will serve as
    the perfect backdrop for showcasing the potential of 6G and demonstrating its
    suitability for use cases such as multi-sensory holographic teleportation, real-time
    remote healthcare, industrial automation, and smart infrastructure and environments,
    to name a few. SECTION XIII. Conclusion This paper surveys the key enabling techniques
    for the next generation of wireless communication networks, outlines their essential
    use cases, and provides a perspective on current as well as future research and
    development efforts. We envision that 6G and beyond wireless systems will be largely
    driven by a focus on wireless ubiquity, i.e., the unrestricted availability of
    high quality wireless access. To this end, we have highlighted the key enabling
    technologies that are vital to the success of 6G and beyond systems. By detailing
    both the operational nuances and open challenges associated with each, we not
    only hope to provide a detailed insight into the next frontier in wireless communications,
    but also encourage readers to play their part in the realization of the envisioned
    ubiquitous wireless future. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank B.

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    Get rights and content Abstract The overarching goal of this study was to map
    irrigated areas in the Ganges and Indus river basins using near-continuous time-series
    (8-day), 500-m resolution, 7-band MODIS land data for 2001–2002. A multitemporal
    analysis was conducted, based on a mega file of 294 wavebands, made from 42 MODIS
    images each of 7 bands. Complementary field data were gathered from 196 locations.
    The study began with the development of two cloud removal algorithms (CRAs) for
    MODIS 7-band reflectivity data, named: (a) blue-band minimum reflectivity threshold
    and (b) visible-band minimum reflectivity threshold. A series of innovative methods
    and approaches were introduced to analyze time-series MODIS data and consisted
    of: (a) brightness-greenness-wetness (BGW) RED-NIR 2-dimensional feature space
    (2-d FS) plots for each of the 42 dates, (b) end-member (spectral angle) analysis
    using RED-NIR single date (RN-SD) plots, (c) combining several RN-SDs in a single
    plot to develop RED-NIR multidate (RN-MDs) plots in order to help track changes
    in magnitude and direction of spectral classes in 2-d FS, (d) introduction of
    a unique concept of space-time spiral curves (ST-SCs) to continuously track class
    dynamics over time and space and to determine class separability at various time
    periods within and across seasons, and (e) to establish unique class signatures
    based on NDVI (CS-NDVI) and/or multiband reflectivity (CS-MBR), for each class,
    and demonstrate their intra- and inter-seasonal and intra- and inter-year characteristics.
    The results from these techniques and methods enabled us to gather precise information
    on onset-peak-senescence-duration of each irrigated and rainfed classes. The resulting
    29 land use/land cover (LULC) map consisted of 6 unique irrigated area classes
    in the total study area of 133,021,156 ha within the Ganges and Indus basins.
    Of this, the net irrigated area was estimated as 33.08 million hectares—26.6%
    by canals and 73.4z5 by groundwater. Of the 33.08 Mha, 98.4% of the area was irrigated
    during khariff (Southwest monsoonal rainy season during June–October), 92.5% irrigated
    during Rabi (Northeast monsoonal rainy season during November–February), and only
    3.5% continuously through the year. Quantitative Fuzzy Classification Accuracy
    Assessment (QFCAA) showed that the accuracies of the 29 classes varied from 56%
    to 100%—with 17 classes above 80% accurate and 23 classes above 70% accurate.
    The MODIS band 5 centered at 1240 nm provided the best separability in mapping
    irrigated area classes, followed by bands 2 (centered at 859 nm), 7 (2130 nm)
    and 6 (1640 nm). Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords MODISReflectanceIrrigated

    vegetation indices 1. Background and rationale The World Summit on Sustainable
    Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg (2002) declared water to be the most critical
    resource in the twenty-first century—with increasing demands and decreasing supplies.
    Irrigation is estimated to consume about 60% of the world''s diverted freshwater
    resources. In response to continued population growth (projected to rise from
    6 billion now to 8.3 billion in 2030) and increased calorific intake of food (to
    3000 calories per day per person from the current 2100; FAO, 2003), the demand
    for water for irrigation is forecast to grow. This is neither feasible, due to
    shortage of water resources in many parts of the globe nor desirable because of
    the negative environmental impacts of irrigation schemes. Improved water accounting
    is required to track agricultural and nonagricultural water use, particularly
    in irrigation. This will require mapping LULC and irrigated area classes on a
    near-continuous (e.g., every 8-day) basis. Most of the LULC classification efforts
    in the past three decades used single or a selected few remote sensing images
    (see Foody, 2002). Such classifications provide little or no information on the
    temporal dynamics of LULC classes, highly limiting their use in applications such
    as hydrological modeling and evapotranspiration estimations (DeFries & Los, 1999).
    In recent years, AVHRR pathfinder time-series images (e.g., DeFries et al., 1998,
    Loveland et al., 2000) have been used to capture temporal dynamics of LULC at
    global level. However, it is only recently that near-continuous (e.g., 8-day composites)
    time series images from sensors such as Moderate Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS)
    on board NASA''s Terra and Aqua satellites have allowed assessment of LULC dynamics
    and quantitative landscape characteristics (e.g., biomass, leaf area index) (Huete
    et al., 2002) in near real time. For example, using these datasets, vegetation
    in continuous streams are currently produced (http://glcf.umiacs.umd.edu/data/modis/vcf/).
    MODIS data are also known to provide a significant improvement in terms of quality
    relative to the heritage AVHRR data (Friedl et al., 2000). The advances in spectral,
    spatial, radiometric, and temporal resolutions of MODIS datasets () are further
    complimented by advances in cloud/haze removal algorithms, time compositing, and
    normalization of data into reflectance. It is well established that LULC and irrigated
    area maps of the present day require capturing quantitative dynamics over space
    and time (DeFries & Los, 1999, Foody, 2002, Huete et al., 2002) in order to enable
    them to be used more productively in studies such as hydrological modeling (Foody,
    2002), drought assessments (Thenkabail et al., 2004b), impact on biodiversity
    (Chapin et al., 2000), human habitability and climate change (Skole et al., 1994),
    global warming (Penner et al., 1992) and soil erosion (Douglas, 1983). The research
    described in this paper falls within the framework of the Global Irrigated Area
    Mapping (GIAM) project at IWMI (Droogers, 2002, Turral, 2002). The principal objective
    of GIAM is to map irrigated areas at different levels (global to local) and at
    different scales using satellite sensor data from various eras. Global LULC are
    essential to advancing most global change research objectives (Loveland et al.,
    2000). Regional and local LULC efforts must aim for a greater number of discrete
    classes of relevance to a wide variety of users (Thenkabail, 1999, Thenkabail
    & Nolte, 2003). Irrespective of the level at which the classes are mapped, it
    is essential to establish acceptable levels of accuracy (Thenkabail et al., 2004a)
    to avoid serious implications of land cover misclassification on, for example,
    global land surface models (DeFries & Los, 1999). In order to achieve this goal,
    GIAM uses datasets that include AVHRR (1 km to 10 km), SPOT Vegetation (1 km),
    MODIS (250–500 m), ASTER (15–90 m), ETM+ (15–30 m), TM (30 m), and IRS (5–23.5
    m). Irrigated classes form part of some of LULC mapping efforts (e.g., Loveland
    et al., 2000), but no special focus or importance was given to them, leading to
    a large percentage of mixed classes with natural vegetation. Primarily, there
    are non-remote sensing based studies on irrigated areas (e.g., Central Board of
    Irrigation and Power, 1989, Central Board of Irrigation and Power, 1994, Siebert,
    1999). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 2003, Framji et al., 1981–83,
    Siebert, 1999) of the United Nations estimates that about 20% of the arable land
    is irrigated at present with various scenarios of projected increases in the future,
    but provides no spatial map of where these areas are. Current estimated trends
    in irrigation development are generally derived from national agricultural statistics
    with many uncertainties about their accuracy. With the overall scope of the GIAM
    project as discussed in the previous paragraph in mind, we focus on mapping LULC
    with particular interest on irrigated areas in the Ganges and Indus river basin
    using MODIS data for year 2001–2002. The study will use multi-date, near-continuous,
    MODIS data, and adopt a series of innovative methods and procedures—the N-dimensional
    change vector analysis (CVA), new space-time spiral-curve techniques to assess
    subtle and not-so subtle quantitative changes over time and space, and evaluate
    the study using fuzzy classification accuracy assessment. Through these measures
    we plan to demonstrate a unique set of data, methods, procedures, and protocols
    for mapping irrigated areas. The Ganges and Indus basins (referred to as Indo-Gangetic)
    was selected for this study because it is one of the most densely populated and
    intensively cultivated areas of the world with irrigation forming a key role in
    food production. 2. Study area and the MODIS data The study area (see non-hatched
    area within the basin boundary in Fig. 1) covers 63% (133,071,400 ha) of the Indo-Gangetic
    plain (total area=211,224,444 ha). The study area was chosen based on the importance
    of the area for agriculture and irrigation and a need to map this area (Droogers,
    2002, Turral, 2002). The Ganges river basin originates in the Himalayan glaciers
    named Gangotri, about 4270 m above sea level. It has one of the most fertile lands
    and has a very high population density of about 530 persons per square kilometer.
    The river flows through 29 cities each with a population of over 100,000, 23 cities
    each with a population between 50,000 and 100,000, and about 48 towns (Aitken,
    1992, Ilich, 1996). The source of the Indus River is in Western Tibet in the Mount
    Kailas region at an altitude of 5500 m above sea level. The Indus basin comprises
    the Indus river, its five major left bank tributaries—the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi,
    Beas and Sutlej rivers—and one major right bank tributary, the Kabul (Khan, 1999).
    The catchments contain some of the largest glaciers in the world outside the Polar
    Regions (Meadows, 1999). The southwest monsoon or khariff season (June to October)
    is followed by northeast monsoon or Rabi season (November to February). The mean
    annual rainfall is about 2000 mm, of which approximately 70% occurs during the
    khariff season. The dry season (March–May) the highest temperatures vary between
    40 and 45 °C. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. The study area within
    the Ganges and Indus basins. The un-hatched portion of the Ganges and Indus basins
    shown on an AVHRR image. The Z-scale shows scaled normalized difference vegetation
    index (SNDVI) for October 1990. In order to enable the study of the characteristics
    of land use and irrigation on a near- continuous basis, the 8-day composite MODIS
    images of year 2001, a rainfall normal year, and year 2002, which experienced
    rainfall deficit in terms of amount and distribution, were selected). One of the
    main goals of the study was to establish crop calendar for irrigated area crops
    as precisely as possible. The goal was to determine onset-duration-magnitude of
    the peak-senescence for each irrigated area class. As a result we need to use
    as frequent images as possible-leading us to use 8-day composites and apply cloud
    removal algorithm rather than use 32-day images with significantly lesser cloud
    issues. About 95% of the Ganges basin (total area 95,111,154 ha) and 37% of the
    Indus basin (116,113,290 ha), were covered by 3 MODIS tiles (h24v06, h25v06, and
    h26v06; each tile of 1000×1000 km). The three tiles were mosaicked into a single
    contiguous tile by running batch scripts in ERDAS Imagine 8.6 from which the areas
    within the Ganges and Indus basins were delineated (Fig. 1). 3. Methods and techniques
    3.1. Mega file: multitemporal MODIS data for Ganges and Indus river basins In
    this study, we use the MOD09 product, with 7 of the 36 MODIS 500 m bands. The
    MOD09 is computed from MODIS level 1B land bands 1–7 (centered at 648 nm, 858
    nm, 470 nm, 555 nm, 1240 nm, 1640 nm, and 2130 nm). The product is an estimate
    of the surface reflectance for each band as it would have been measured at ground
    level if there was no atmospheric scattering or absorption (Vermote et al., 2002).
    The original MODIS data are acquired in 12-bit (0–4096 levels), and are stretched
    to 16-bit (0–65,536 levels). Dividing these data by 100 will make them comparable
    to laboratory spectra in the 0–100% range. The long time series analysis of MODIS
    data requires construction of mega datasets that involve hundreds of bands. Altogether
    294 bands (42 images×7 bands) from 21 images from year 2001 and 2002 were formulated
    into a single mega file of approximately 7 GB. A separate 42-band NDVI mega file
    (one NDVI band for each date) was also created. The single mega file facilitate
    (a) analyzing the time series in their entirety (e.g., they perform unsupervised
    classification of 294-band data and determine how classes change in magnitude
    and direction over space and time) and (b) tracking quantitative changes at any
    level in near-continuous mode (e.g., NDVI variations at pixel or entire study-area
    level in 8-day time interval). Performing analysis on 10 s or 100 s of images
    of individual dates is too cumbersome, leads to repetitive work, hard to keep
    track of class number changes for a given pixel, and just leads to chaos of handling
    too many files. In comparison mega file offers a single file of data, a single
    file of output, and provide temporal variations for every pixel in quantitative
    terms (e.g., NDVI dynamics over time). 3.2. Cloud removal algorithm The Indo-Gangetic
    basin is subject to the effects of the oscillating Sub-Tropical Convergence Zone
    (www.srh.weather.gov). These effects include the monsoon (June–September), which
    brings extensive cloud cover and heavy rains. During this season, there is a great
    change in the vegetation cover, rapid change in its dynamics and biomass accumulation.
    In order to retain the maximum number of time series images during this period
    we (a) retained all images with <5% cloud cover and (b) developed a cloud-masking
    algorithm so as to eliminate areas of cloud cover and retain the rest of the image
    as is. Of 42 images, 8 images had 25–40% cloud cover which also implies that 60–75%
    of 133 million hectare study area is cloud-free. Our attempts to use MODIS quality
    control layers and flags were not successful and resulted in several difficulties.
    These include: (a) cloud vs. snow vs. desert sand vs. aerosol confusion: as a
    result of this often Himalayan seasonal snow was removed as cloud; (b) over-correction
    issue: over correction by quality control flags lead to significantly low reflectance
    values which in turn effected temporal NDVI profiles; and (c) “blocky” effects:
    applying quality flags lead to “blocky” effects in the images probably as a result
    of original quality flags being performed at 1-km pixel size which seemed to cause
    “blocky/noisy” effects in 500-m pixels (four 500-m pixels in one 1-km pixels).
    In fact, we were able to establish a more consistent, smooth, and stable NDVI
    profiles from the MODIS cloud removal algorithm specially developed in this study
    rather than use MOD09 QC layers. 3.2.1. Cloud algorithm: statistical characteristics
    Clouds have unique spectral characteristics with consistently high reflectivity
    in all visible and NIR wavebands, but are quite often mixed with snow and desert
    backgrounds—the other two highly reflective classes. To establish clear statistical
    characteristics for clouds, we obtained sample spectra from 350 locations for
    clouds, 240 locations for snow and 180 locations for deserts. When the means,
    minima and maxima of spectra for the clouds, snow and desert were plotted the
    results showed there were 2 excellent possibilities for separating most of the
    clouds. 3.2.1.1. Blue band minimum reflectivity threshold for cloud When we use
    minimum blue band reflectivity of 21% or above (a) all clouds get removed, (b)
    much of snow gets removed and (c) none of the desert gets removed. A simple algorithm
    for cloud removal in ERMapper (ERMapper, 2004) was: (1) Where, i3 is MODIS band
    3 (blue band). The algorithm assigns null values to all cloud areas. 3.2.1.2.
    Visible band minimum reflectivity threshold for cloud The minimum reflectivity
    of clouds in the MODIS visible bands (bands 3, 4, and 1), provide the best separability
    in which almost all clouds gets removed. The algorithm for cloud removal, using
    this approach with MODIS visible bands 3 (blue), 4 (green), and 1 (red) was (2)
    However, when using this approach much of snow and a significant portion of the
    desert also get removed. This is not a problem, since we have several other time
    series images where snow and desert data exist in their entirety. So clouds were
    removed using Eq. (2), but snow and desert areas were retained in their entirety,
    based on non-cloudy images. The results of cloud removal have been illustrated

    was developed to remove cloud from MODIS data. The figures above show the cloud
    removal capability of the algorithms. 3.3. Normalization of temporal variability
    The MODIS reflectance product has gone through a rigorous atmospheric correction
    scheme based on the 6S radiative transfer code for normalizing for molecular scattering,
    gaseous absorption and aerosols that affect the top of the atmosphere (TOA) signal
    (see inter alia Vermote et al., 2002). Aerosol effects are known to remain uncorrected
    even after long compositing periods (e.g., a month) (Vermote et al., 2002) so
    such effects in 8-day time intervals are significant. It would be desirable to
    do further corrections for these effects, for which we found a time-invariant
    location in the Rajasthan desert, calculated mean values of each band for each
    of the 42 images for this time-invariant location, determined the calibration
    coefficient of each band for each date by dividing its reflectance by the mean,
    and then normalized images of each date by multiplying using calibration coefficients.
    3.4. Image processing and interpretation A summary of the image processing and
    interpretation undertaken in this research is provided in Fig. 3. The basis of
    the work stems from unsupervised classification of all bands in the mega file,
    followed by various innovative refinements in class membership using techniques
    derived from RED-NIR and time series signatures, which are discussed in more detail
    in the section on Results and discussion. Ground-truth data have therefore been
    a crucial element in the process and are described in the next section. Download

    We adopted a hierarchical classification system based on modified Anderson classification
    (Anderson et al., 1976). For example, if a class does not belong to rice (class
    A) or sugarcane (class B) it will fall into a higher category of irrigated croplands
    (classes A and B). 4. Ground-truth data Ground truthing was conducted during October
    1–22, 2003 to coincide with the peak khariff (monsoonal rainy season from June
    to October) conditions. For such a large area as the Ganges and Indus basins,
    random or systematic sampling is unrealistic and costly (Muchoney & Strahler,
    2002). Therefore, the sampling was stratified by access through roads and foot
    paths and randomized by locating sites every few minutes of the drive. The MODIS
    data require a minimum sampling unit of 500 m×500 m, which in itself is inadequate.
    A larger sampling unit is desired, but was quite impractical in the field. The
    approach we adopted was to look for contiguous areas of homogeneous classes within
    which to sample (see Thenkabail, 2003, for sampling LAI), taking a representative
    area of 90 m×90 m. Class labels were assigned in the field, using a system that
    allows merging to a higher class or breakdown into a distinct class, based on
    the land cover percentages taken at each location. In all, about 6500 km were
    covered to gather data from 196 sample locations (Fig. 4). The precise locations
    of the samples were recorded by GPS in the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
    and the latitude/longitude coordinate system with a common datum of WGS84. The
    sample size per class varied from 8 to 37 and the ideal target of 50 samples (Congalton,
    1988) was infeasible due to limitations in resources. Download : Download full-size

    here are representative photos (a–e) of 6 unique irrigated area classes (classes
    21–26) and representative photos (f–h) of 3 forest classes (classes 27–29). The
    data were organized in proprietary image processing and GIS formats with accompanying
    metadata so that they could be co-located with the unsupervised classification
    (e.g., Fig. 4). 5. Results and discussion 5.1. Unsupervised classification To
    begin with, unsupervised classification was performed on the mega file (UC-MF)
    using an ISODATA statistical clustering algorithm for multidimensional data (ERDAS,
    2004). Initially, 100 classes were obtained as a starting block for further refinement
    and analysis. The UC-MF provides a substantial within-class variance (Friedl et
    al., 2000, McIver & Friedl, 2002) that is essential to map classes within a theme
    (e.g., different types of irrigated-area classes). The sample size of the field-plot
    data was insufficient for certain classes to make the supervised classification
    robust. Hence unsupervised approach backed by RED-NIR plots (5.2 RED-NIR Plots
    for single dates (RN-SDs), class identification and labeling, 5.3 RED-NIRs for
    multi-dates (RN-MD)), ground truth data (4 Ground-truth data, 5.4 LULC classes
    and their linkage with land cover (LC) percentages: class labeling and area calculations),
    temporal NDVI plots (Section 5.9), and space-time spiral curves (Section 5.10)
    were used. 5.2. RED-NIR Plots for single dates (RN-SDs), class identification
    and labeling The spectral properties of the 100 classes obtained through UC-MF
    were analyzed, based on their distribution in brightness–greenness–wetness (BGW)
    RED-NIR feature space. The distributions of a selection of the 100 unique spectral
    classes for May 2001 are illustrated in Fig. 6. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. RED-NIR single dates (RN-SDs) plot of 100 unsupervised classes.
    The 100 unsupervised classes are plotted taking mean class reflectance in MODIS
    band 1 (red) and band 2 (NIR). The classes are shown in brightness–greenness–wetness
    (BGW) feature space and their preliminary class names identified for further investigations
    during ground truthing. Similar to figure shown above RN-SDs were plotted for
    each of the 42 dates. All classes were identified and labeled, based on their
    position in the BGW RED-NIR feature space, use of higher-resolution images (Geocover
    Landsat TM MrSid images), NDVI thresholds at different time periods and ground
    truth information (e.g., Fig. 4, Fig. 5). All of the information was used in the
    hierarchical class labeling process that led to the reduction of the 100 classes
    to the final 29 classes. The pure pixels (the brightest, the greenest and the
    wettest) are at the edges of the triangle (spectral angle). Most pixels are some
    combination, linear or nonlinear of these purest pixels. Brightness is represented
    by albedo (approximately the mean of the red and NIR reflectances) and the greenness
    by the difference between NIR and red bands. The brightness–greenness space is
    just a 45° clockwise rotation of the red and NIR space. Tree canopies and hills
    have deeper shadows compared with crops making tree classes to cluster in the
    wetness–greenness areas compared to the crop classes clustering in the brightness–greenness
    area (see Fig. 6). 5.3. RED-NIRs for multi-dates (RN-MD) The 42 separate TC SDs,
    one for each MODIS image, were plotted together to observe and interpret classes.
    We found that it was more useful to juxtapose RED-NIR plots of multiple dates
    (RN-MDs) in a single plot (e.g., Fig. 7) in order to arrive at the final 29 classes
    (Table 1). The TC MDs capture both the direction and magnitude of change in time
    and space. The change angle (θ) and change magnitude (M) were computed using equations
    (Zhan et al., 2002): (3) (4) where θ=change direction or angle; M=change magnitude;
    Δλred=red reflectance at time 2-red reflectance at time 1; ΔλNIR=NIR reflectance
    at time 2-NIR reflectance at time 1; arctan=arc tangent; Sqrt=square root Download

    analysis of 29 unsupervised classes. First the 100 unsupervised classes shown
    in Fig. 6 are reduced to 29 classes after a rigorous analysis including RN-SDs,
    ground truth, vegetation index signatures, RN-MDs, and others (e.g., geo-cover
    TM images). Here, we illustrate the magnitude and direction of change of each
    of the 29 LULC classes over time using RN-MDs taking a driest month (May), a wettest
    monsoon month (September), and a second Rabi cropping month (January) during year
    2002. RN-MDs were also initially plotted for all 100 classes. These plots are
    also done for year 2001 and for other dates in both years. Table 1. LULC and irrigation

    are determined by multiplying LULC areas obtained from MODIS images with LC percentages
    of each class determined during ground-truthing. We investigated the dynamics
    of the classes in three key seasons: rabi peak in January, summer in May, and
    monsoonal peak in September (Fig. 7). The connectivity of the vectors of three
    distinct classes during the three dates is illustrated in Fig. 7. Class 8 is barren
    land and remains near the soil line during all three seasons (Fig. 7). In contrast,
    class 17 is rain-fed agriculture with rangelands and is close to soil line on
    the bright side of BGW feature space between khariff and rabi seasons. During
    the khariff peak (September) and rabi peak (January), class 17 is in the greenness–brightness
    area. Class 22 is irrigated and has high greenness during September, mid-way in
    the greenness–wetness feature space in January, and only comes anywhere nearer
    the soil line during the summer month of May. The availability of time series
    images has provided an opportunity to define irrigated areas and other LULC classes
    (e.g., rainfed agriculture) based on their seasonal or multi-seasonal dynamics.
    The phenological information contained in these multi-temporal images significantly
    contributes to land cover classification, further confirming the similar results
    by Dymond et al. (2002), Jensen (2000) and Schriever and Congalton (1995). 5.4.
    LULC classes and their linkage with land cover (LC) percentages: class labeling
    and area calculations A total of 29 LULC classes (Table 1, Fig. 8) were mapped
    which showed clear spectral separability on one or more single dates (e.g., Fig.
    6), and/or one or more multiple dates (e.g., Fig. 7), and/or over a near-continuous
    time interval (e.g., Fig. 9a and b). The total study area within the Ganges and
    Indus basins was 133,021,156 ha (Table 1) where there was a high degree of irrigation
    (e.g., see classes 21–26 in Fig. 8 and Table 1). Class 30 was data noise that
    amounted to 0.5% of the total study area and, hence, was negligible. Download

    each of 7 bands, during 2001 and 2002). The study area covers 63% of the Ganges
    and the Indus basins. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. MODIS NDVI signatures
    over time. With the availability of near-real-time MODIS data it is possible to
    develop LULC spectral signatures over time. (a) Illustrates MODIS NDVI signatures
    for 8 spectrally distinct classes over 2 years. The classes are spectrally separable,
    distinctly, from each other at one time or the other. (b) Illustrates MODIS NDVI
    signatures for 6 spectrally close irrigated area classes over 2 years. Time series
    MODIS data enables separability even within close classes at one time or the other.
    The LULC name is based on predominance of a particular land cover. For example,
    the name for class 27 is “Forests (Himalayan): Mature.” The land cover (LC) of
    this class is dominated by mature forests (31.7%, see Table 1), which occur along
    the Himalayan mountains. The trees were 20+ years and hence classified as mature.
    Similarly, class 18 was labeled “rain-fed crops” since this was an intensely cropped
    area class that is heavily dependent on seasonal rains. The ability to map a large
    number (29) of classes (Fig. 8) even at 500 m spatial resolution, demonstrates
    the strength of the 7-band near continuous MODIS data and attests to the improved
    sensitivity of this instrument compared to earlier sensors. Even within an irrigated
    area class, 6 distinct classes (classes 21–26 in Table 1) were spectrally and
    temporally differentiated (Fig. 9b). 5.5. Irrigated area, rice area and cropped
    area estimates Each LULC class is a composite of several LC types (see Table 1).
    For example, in class 22, cultivated areas (61.6%) dominate but there are significant
    other LC types that include other land cover (11.4%), trees (11.2%), shrubs (8.4%)
    and grasses (7.5%) (Table 1). Of the cultivated areas, 31.6% is rice crop—the
    single major crop of the class. Sugarcane was the next major crop although statistics
    of sugarcane are not shown in Table 1. Precise estimates of various thematic areas
    within classes were calculated as follows (see Table 1): Using the same approach,
    there were 504,877 ha (8.4%) of shrubs, 450,489 ha (7.5%) of grasses, 372,7321
    ha (61.6%) of cultivated areas and 688,991 ha (11.4%) of other areas. The rice
    crop alone totaled 1,910,369 ha (31.6%). We propose the above approach to area
    calculations since it takes into account sub-pixel composition of the pixels.
    Let us take the example of irrigated area class 21 which has a total area of 3,150,616
    ha (Table 1). Every pixel of this class is irrigated, but at different degree—some
    pixels are 100% irrigated and some 50% and some others a different proportion.
    In order to calculate exact area under irrigation for this class, we will need
    to perform sub-pixel decomposition. We adopt a fairly straightforward approach
    based on land cover (LC) composition for the class based on ground truth data.
    The accuracy of this approach increases with sample size for the class. Since
    we have fairly large sample size locations for each class we feel confident that
    our area estimates are reasonable. Normally, most studies take non-decomposed
    pixel areas as actual areas of a particular land use class. Field data on “watering
    source” (column 5 of Table 1) was used to define classes as irrigated, rain-fed,
    rain-fed with supplemental irrigation and flooded or wetland cultivated. Classes
    21, 22 and 24 were canal irrigated and classes 23, 25 and 27 were tube-well irrigated.
    The same approach described in the previous paragraph was used to estimate the
    irrigated areas in each class wherein the total area is multiplied by LC percent
    for crops in class 21 through 27 (since these classes are exclusive irrigated
    agriculture). For example, the irrigated area resulting in a total irrigated area
    of 33,084,536 ha (24.9% of the total study area). Of this, canal irrigated area
    was 8,793,899 ha (6.6% of the total area of the study of 133,021,156 ha) compared
    the tube-well supplied area of 24,290,637 ha (18.3% of the total area). The cropland
    LCs of classes 23, 25, and 27 were exclusively tube-well irrigated. The cropland
    LCs of classes 21, 22, and 24 were overwhelmingly canal irrigated, but has some
    very minor tube well irrigated mix that we ignore. There were 12,345,432 ha (9.3%
    of the total area of the study) of rain-fed areas with substantial supplemental
    irrigation of one sort or another. A significant portion, 3,047,267 ha (2.3%)
    incorporated wetland cultivation. Purely rain-fed dryland cropping was estimated
    at 13,463,277 ha (10.1%). Rice is grown not only in the 6 irrigated classes 21–26,
    but also in other classes albeit only to some extent. Specific LC percentages
    of rice crop within LULC classes 13–29 were used to estimate the total rice area
    of 27,998,763 ha (21% of the total study area) (Table 1). The total cultivated
    land area in the study region is 61,940,511 ha (46.6% of the total area). Classes
    1–12 have almost no area under cultivation or irrigation and occupy 18.6% of the
    total area. LC percentages were not measured on the ground, as these classes are
    relatively pure (e.g., LULC classes composed one predominant LC type) and also
    rather inaccessible. These classes were identified, based on their spectral characteristics,
    GeoCover Landsat TM images, their geographic location and from numerous other
    sources of data (e.g., USGS LULC classification, Loveland et al., 2000). It is
    important to note that the precise class areas presented in Table 1 were applicable
    to the khariff season only, as LC percentage data were not available for other
    seasons. We adopted a unique strategy to determine intensity of irrigation in
    different seasons. The maximum monthly NDVI composite images for different seasons
    were masked out taking the spatial extent of irrigated areas of classes 21 through
    26. The masked areas for different months in the seasons were then classified
    and areas irrigated and fallow were determined based on their seasonal NDVI dynamics.
    The classes will cluster based on NDVI dynamics. A class with high degree of irrigation
    (say 90–100% of pixel areas are irrigated) will have a higher NDVI threshold over
    2–4 months of a growing season relative to a class with a low degree of irrigation
    (say 20–30% of pixel areas are irrigated). Based on this approach, we determined
    98.4% of this area during Khariff (June–October), 92.5% during Rabi (November–February),
    but only 3.5% all through the year or continuous (apart from Khariff and Rabi,
    also in March–May) cropping. 5.6. Cropping pattern The cropping pattern of classes
    13–29 are given in Table 2 for khariff and rabi. In some cases, there is a short
    interim season between rabi and khariff when summer crops are grown if water is
    available, and according to ground survey these are the same combinations as for
    khariff. The irrigated area classes, 21–26, have either rice or sorghum as main
    crops during khariff and, where applicable, in summer. The cropping mix in rabi
    is generally wheat-sugarcane or wheat-barley. The main rain-fed crops, classes
    17 and 18, have sorghum-millet in khariff, but change to wheat-barley in rabi
    (Table 2). During the field work, the authors were accompanied by highly knowledgeable
    local agricultural experts from the Indian National systems (see Acknowledgements)
    who were instrumental in determining rabi and summer crops at each field plot
    location, at times involving interview with local farmers. Table 2. Cropping pattern

    comparison with other studies The results of this study were compared with: (a)
    USGS study using monthly AVHRR 1-km NDVI time series from April 1992 to March
    1993 (Loveland et al., 2002), and (b) global land cover (GLC) for year 2000 using
    monthly SPOT 1-km data (Belward et al., 2003). In the GLC2000 study, data from
    the 4 spectral bands of the SPOT sensor were used: blue (0.43–0.47 μm), red (0.61–0.68
    μm), infrared (0.78–0.89 μm) and shortwave infrared (1.58–1.75 μm). In the entire
    study area, the combined irrigated and supplemental irrigated areas mapped using
    2001–2002 MODIS data in this study showed an increase of 13.4% to 45,429,968 ha,
    compared with the USGS figure of 40,046,229 ha (Table 3). The GLC2000 irrigated
    areas (72,614,135 ha) did not tally with our study. This is because GLC has 2
    irrigated area classes (class 32 and 33) with a contrasting definition. Class
    32 is irrigated with intensive agriculture, which is similar to our irrigated
    area classes. Almost all of the spatial distribution of this class fell within
    our irrigated-area classes. However, the GLC2000 class number 33 (irrigated agriculture)
    with 38.4 million hectares is a predominantly rain-fed with some irrigated. Almost
    all of our rain-fed classes, 17 and 18, fall within this class 33. In addition,
    classes we identified as rangelands and some of the forests are also labeled irrigated
    agriculture by GLC200. Table 3. Irrigated area comparisons between different studies

    to show how the irrigated areas are estimated for Ganges river basin by various
    studies using remote sensing datasets of wide range of characteristics. The results
    of this study performed at 500-m were compared with AVHRR and SPOT classifications
    performed at 1-km scale. The USGS AVHRR study use 2 broad bands (band 1 and 2),
    The GLC SPOT study used 4 broad bands (2 visible and 2 SWIR). This study used
    7 narrow bands (4 visible, 2 NIR and 2 SWIR). Thereby, differences in LULC or
    irrigated areas are often as a result of factors such as data types, class definitions,
    level at which the classes are mapped, analysis methods and techniques, and resources
    spent on analysis and classification schemes rather than change per se. 5.8. Tree
    cover, shrub and grass cover in the basin The tree shrubs and grasses are predominant
    in classes 27 to 29. But often, other classes have a significant percentage of
    one of these cover types. For example, 11.16% of the land cover in irrigated-area
    class 22 was trees as a result of agroforests forming part of the cropping system.
    Using the tree, shrub and grass percentages of all classes we found there was
    4,803,355 ha (or 3.6% of the total area) of trees, 7,645,397 ha (5.7%) of shrubs,
    and 12,524,211 ha (9.4% of grasses) in the study area. 5.9. Class signatures,
    NDVI-reflectivity thresholds, and onset-peak-senescence-duration of crops The
    class signatures of NDVI (CS-NDVI) are unique time series of a class using NDVI
    or spectral reflectivity in individual wavebands. It is not possible to have temporal
    signatures when single date or a few date images are used as is often the case
    with most LULC studies. The set of NDVI class signatures is shown in Fig. 9a and
    b for classes mapped in Fig. 8. Threshold NDVIs and NDVI signatures over time
    help us determine the onset and duration of cropping seasons (rabi and khariff),
    the intensity of cropping in drought and normal years and the end of a cropping
    season. MODIS CS-NDVI signatures are presented and discussed for a set of distinct
    classes (Fig. 9a) and thematically similar classes (Fig. 9b). The NDVI of forest
    class 27 never falls below 0.5 on any date throughout a year and across years
    (Fig. 9a). The agricultural lands in wetlands (class 5) have a moderately high
    NDVI throughout the year as a result of continuous soil moisture availability.
    The rainfed agriculture (class 18 in Fig. 9a) shows the dramatic differences in
    NDVI dynamics during the normal year (2001) vs. drought year (2002). During the
    normal year, the NDVI for Khariff season steeply raises from Julian day 160, reaches
    peak NDVI of 0.25 and then starts falling reaching low values again around Julian
    day 300. In contrast, during 2002 the NDVI never rose above 0.2 and near complete
    crop failure is obvious relative to NDVI dynamics of 2001. Rangeland class 15
    has a sharp NDVI increase from about 0.25 during the driest period to little over
    0.6 during the monsoon from June to October. During khariff, this is a class with
    rise in NDVI almost similar to that of irrigated-area class 21. However, the 2
    classes are distinctly separate during other periods. As expected, the desert
    class has a near-flat NDVI across the year. The temporal signatures of the six
    irrigated classes are plotted in Fig. 9b. Irrigated class 21 peaks on day 49 (rabi
    crop peak), reaches the lowest biomass around day 129 (dry season, low), and reaches
    peak again around day 249 (khariff, crop peak). The cycle is remarkably similar
    for both 2001 and 2002 (see Fig. 9a). For example, the rabi crop peak green period
    or critical growth phase was around Julian day 57 during 2001 and day 49 during
    2002. Senescence begins around day 89 during year 2001 and day 81 during year
    2002. Based on these results, the nominal crop duration from sowing to harvest
    during khariff is (Fig. 9a) 180 days (Julian day 153–333 days), rabi is 142 days
    (from day 333 of 1 year to the next year Julian day 110), and a short dry season
    of no cropping for 43 days (days 110–153). The six irrigated-area classes are
    identified by subtle differences between these classes. Most of these classes
    were dominated by rice and other irrigated crops during khariff. Crop vigor, biomass
    levels and percent area cultivated are comparable at certain times of the year,
    but not at other times (Fig. 9b). In spite of many similarities, the classes often
    provide significantly different NDVI signatures (Fig. 9b) at one time or another
    during a year. There are several reasons for this. The first is the type of land
    cover within and between these classes. Class 22, for example, is found mainly
    along the Indus river basin, is heavily irrigated and flooded (31% water) or moist
    throughout the year, suppressing NDVI substantially. The presence of flooding
    or wet soils may result in substantial absorption in near-infrared leading to
    low NDVI throughout the season. Irrigated land accounts for 85% of all cereal
    grain production (mainly rice and wheat), all sugar production and most of the
    cotton production (Khan, 1999). Class 21, for example, is basically dryland that
    is irrigated whereas other classes like 22 exhibit higher moisture levels. The
    NIR reflectance in drier lands with vigorous vegetation is substantially higher
    than the NIR reflectance in irrigated areas with substantial moisture or water
    logging. The second is that differences occur in LC percentages within and between
    classes. Class 26, for example, has about 20% more rice than class 21 (Table 1).
    Class 21 has greater percentage of other crops including sugarcane. The third
    is that the differences in irrigated classes 21–26 can also be attributed to differences
    in the cropping calendar between these classes. The threshold MODIS NDVI limits
    of the class are time-dependent (e.g., Fig. 9a and b). For example, in class 21,
    the threshold NDVI range during Julian days 1 to 81 was (a) 0.62 to 0.75 during
    2001 and (b) 0.53 to 0.77 during 2002. No other class has such a high threshold
    MODIS NDVI. But these fall drastically in summer when the NDVI thresholds for
    Julian days of 113 to 153 were (a) 0.23 to 0.27 during 2001 and (b) 0.2 to 0.24
    during 2002. The pattern of very high NDVI during crop growing seasons and low
    NDVIs between crop seasons is a characteristic of the irrigation classes in the
    Ganges and Indus basins. Classes 22 and 25 are the only classes with relatively
    high NDVI during summer as a result of the presence of significant agroforests
    (11.2%, listed under forests in Table 1) in class 22 and significant summer cropping
    (17.5%, listed under other land covers in Table 1) in class 25 as a result of
    the availability of water or moisture. All classes have a distinct cropping calendar,
    onset-peak-senescence cycle and the biomass magnitudes. In stark contrast to irrigated-area
    classes, the rain-fed class 18 (Fig. 9a), has a MODIS NDVI around 0.15 throughout
    the year 2001 with an NDVI between 0.2 and 0.28 during days 185–249 with a peak
    around day 209 (Table 3, Table 4). During 2001, NDVI of rain-fed class 17 rises
    to a peak of 0.46 on day 209 with values of 0.35 on day 185 and 0.39 on day 249.
    During the rest of the year, the NDVI of class 17 is between 0.2 and 0.3. During
    2002, the rains failed and as a result the NDVI of classes 17 and 18 never rose
    above 0.33 and 0.17, respectively, indicating a severe drought situation in rain-fed
    areas. The irrigated classes were not affected by the drought of 2002, hence a
    similar pattern of MODIS NDVI magnitudes, durations, and onset-peak-senescence
    cycles was maintained as in 2001 (Fig. 9b). Table 4. Fuzzy classification accuracy

    4.8 3.0 The quantitative FCAA was performed on all MODIS derive LULC classes were
    determined using ground truth point data, observations marked on maps and images
    during field visit, geo-cover Landsat TM images, and, rarely, land use maps from
    other sources. 5.10. Space time spiral curves (SC-STs) The space-time spiral curves
    (ST-SCs) (Fig. 10a and b) are introduced as an innovative approach to represent
    and track near continuous changes in class behavior over time and space. The dynamics
    of five classes are shown in a 2-dimentional feature space using MODIS class reflectivity
    in Fig. 10a. In most cases, classes have their own “territory” and mostly move
    around within it. In Fig. 10a the rain-fed class is in “brightness territory,”
    the irrigated class in “greenness territory” and the water class in “wetness territory.”
    ST-SCs depict change over time and capture the magnitudes of change no matter
    how subtle (e.g., an incremental increase in leaf area) or dramatic (e.g., clear-cut
    forests), temporary (e.g., senescing crop) or more permanent (e.g., built-up areas
    in place of agricultural lands). The classes shown in Fig. 10a rarely overlap
    one another, providing an excellent opportunity to separate classes on most dates.
    SC-STs tell us when two classes have similar spectra and when they are most separable.
    In contrast, the irrigated-area classes significantly overlap one another on most
    dates (Fig. 10b) since these classes are spectrally close to one another. However,
    there are one or more dates when a given class is separable spectrally from other
    classes. For example, on day 209 all six classes have a unique place in the 2-d
    FS as shown in SC-ST (Fig. 10b) and, similarly, on day 153. Download : Download

    and (b) 6 spectrally similar irrigated area classes. As the spectral properties
    of classes change over time, we can observe dates on which 2 or more classes spectral
    intersect (no spectral separability) or stay spectrally separate highlighting
    the near-continuous interval multi-temporal data in LULC studies. 5.11. Performance
    of MODIS spectral wavebands in irrigated area mapping The best wavebands for irrigated
    area mapping were determined using 3 distinct methods. First, the class signatures
    based on multiple band reflectivity (CS-MBR) of 7 MODIS bands were used to see
    spectral differentiation of close classes such as irrigated area classes 21–26
    (see Fig. 11). The greatest difference in reflectivity between the six irrigated
    classes was found in MODIS band 5. The results were consistent across dates, confirming
    the utility of this band in separating spectrally close irrigated-area classes.
    This band centered on 1240 nm is a unique 20 nm-wide narrow-band not found in
    satellite sensors currently orbiting the globe except MODIS and Hyperion, aboard
    the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    11. Multi-band reflectivity signatures (MB-RS) is separating closely related irrigated
    area classes. In order to separate closely related classes such as 6 irrigated
    area classes we use the spectral strength of 7 MODIS bands. For example, the MODIS
    band 5 (centered at 1240 nm) is a unique band in any satellite sensor and this
    provides maximum separability in 6 closely related irrigated area classes. Second,
    multiband feature space plots (MB-FSP; Fig. 12a–e) were used to determine class
    separability. Closely related irrigated-area classes 21–26 were used in the test
    in order to determine whether the use of multiple wavebands help separate them.
    There is good evidence that classes 23 and 25 (which were close to each other
    in band 1 vs. band 2 (Fig. 12a) prove to be distinct when band 2 and band 7 (Fig.
    12b), band 6 vs. band 7 (Fig. 12c), and band 2 vs. band 3 (Fig. 12d) are plotted.
    The results generally support the use of multiple wavebands in irrigated-area
    mapping and highlight the importance of bands 2, 7, 6 and 3 in that order. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Multi-band bispectral plots (MB-BP) for separating
    closely related irrigated area classes. Spectra of different combinations of MODIS
    bands were plotted in 2-dimensional feature space to evaluate class separability
    of 6 irrigated area classes. There is remarkable improvement in class separability
    of 2 classes. Some classes like 23 and 25 that were close to each other when band
    1 (red) vs. band 2 (NIR) are plotted (a) show distinct separability when 2 mid-infrared
    bands, band 6 vs. band 7, are used (c). Third, we determined the frequency of
    occurrence of least redundant bands (FO-LRB) in irrigated area mapping. Correlations
    for 7 band (λ1) by the 7 band (λ2) matrix (see Thenkabail et al., 2004a, Thenkabail
    et al., 2002) were established for each class taking all 42 dates into account
    and it was found that the higher the correlation between bands greater the redundancy
    and vice versa. In each correlation matrix, we plotted and looked for the lowest
    R2 values (least redundancy) between two bands. Thus, the two-band combinations
    providing the three lowest R2 values were recorded for all classes. Similar plots
    and selections of bands for each of the 42 classes were carried out. The NIR band
    2 occurred most frequently (over 25% of the time), followed by the two shortwave
    infrared (SWIR) bands 7 and 6. This means that MODIS band 2 is most useful in
    LULC classifications followed by SWIR bands 7 and 6, further supporting the results
    from the previous section. The SWIR bands are subjected to less attenuation due
    to atmospheric water (Kerber & Schutt, 1986) and more strongly correlated with
    biophysical properties of vegetation than the visible and NIR wavelengths (Foody
    et al., 1996). 6. Fuzzy classification accuracy assessment (FCAA) Relative classification
    accuracies (Table 4) were evaluated using a fuzzy approach (Mickelson et al.,
    1998, Woodcock & Gopal, 2000). Error matrix accuracies are deterministic (correct
    or wrong; yes or no) whereas the accuracy in this study is based on a fuzzy (absolutely
    correct, mostly correct, correct, incorrect, mostly incorrect, and absolutely
    incorrect) approach. When there is no simple “yes/no” answer, but a scaled approach
    to error/accuracy assessments, the method is referred to as “fuzzy”. FCAA procedure
    begins with overlaying the 300 independent ground-truth data points (Fig. 4) on
    the 29 classes (Fig. 8). Great care was taken to avoid misregistration problems
    between field plot data, Landsat high resolution imagery, and coarse resolution
    MODIS imagery when performing fuzzy classification approach. This was done by
    collecting field plot data from highly representative locations for each of the
    29 classes. All 300 independent points were selected with care to avoid uncertainties
    and ambiguities. The sites were selected by driving in the vehicle; marking coordinates
    using a GPS, and recording distances in vehicle odometer. The 300 locations were
    very large homogeneous areas of at least 3×3 pixel areas representing one of the
    29 classes. Actual LULC data available from the 3×3 pixel area gathered during
    ground truthing were compared with classes mapped. A quantitative approach to
    FCAA was adopted. At each point, if 9 pixels out of 9 pixels in the LULC map matched
    exactly with ground-truth data then we called it “absolutely correct.” Similarly,
    the criterion adopted was: mostly correct (75–99% correct), correct (51–74% correct),
    incorrect (24–50% correct), mostly incorrect (1–24% correct) and absolutely incorrect
    (0% correct). Using this approach we established a fuzzy classification criterion
    for all points within each class with sample sizes for each class varying between
    8 and 40. These results were used to derive a final single fuzzy classification
    criterion for each class (Table 4). For example, in class 26 there were 23 ground-truth
    locations, each of 3 by 3 pixel area for a total of 207 pixels. Of these, 108
    pixels (52%) were absolutely correct, 63 pixels (32%) were mostly correct and
    36 (17%) correct. Overall, the FCAA established that the 29 classes were accurate
    from 56 to 100%—17 classes from 80% to 100%, 6 classes from 70% to 80%, and 6
    other classes from 56% to 70% accurate. A high degree of classification accuracy
    was observed when a large number of classes are mapped and this highlights the
    value of using time-series multiple band MODIS data in contrast to low levels
    of accuracy, 16–54%, reported for AVHRR data (e.g., Friedl et al., 2000, Strahler
    et al., 1999). Fuzzy logic also allows a qualitative understanding of the impact
    of misclassification (Muchoney & Strahler, 2002). A misclassification of classes
    other than irrigated areas is more acceptable in this study, since we wish to
    determine irrigated area and intensity. Intermixing between forest classes or
    an irrigated-area class intermixing with another irrigated-area class is more
    acceptable than an irrigated-area class getting mixed with forests. The six irrigated-area
    classes, 21–26, had an accuracy (in %) of 100, 75, 84, 56, 79 and 100. Only class
    24 had a low accuracy of 56%, but it mixed almost only with the other five irrigated
    classes. The forest classes 28 and 29 had a low accuracy, also, mainly due to
    intermixing between the two classes. In the International Geosphere Biosphere
    Programme''s Data and Information System (IGBP-DIS) global land cover data, nearly
    60% of the problems addressed in the post-classification process for the set arose
    from confusion between natural vegetation and agriculture (Loveland et al., 1999).
    Similar issues arose with MODIS data (Friedl et al., 2000). 7. Conclusions This
    study proposed and implemented a suite of techniques and methods for mapping irrigated-area
    and other LULC classes at river-basin level using near-continuous time-series
    (8-day) MODIS 7-band reflectance data. The study espoused a new unique approach
    to time-series MODIS data analysis that begins with a single 7-GB mega file dataset
    of 294 bands (42 images of 7-bands each) for Ganges and Indus basins during year
    2001 and 2002. The study resulted in mapping a large number (29) of classes (Fig.
    8, Table 1), yet maintaining high levels of accuracy (56–100% with most classes
    accurate between 80% and 100%; Table 4). The study highlighted the use of FCAA
    technique in coarse resolution data accuracy assessments. A new powerful concept
    of space-time spiral curves (ST-SCs), which quantitatively tracks subtle and not-so-subtle
    changes of spectral reflectivity of irrigated and LULC classes in the 2-dimensional
    feature space (2-d FS) near-continuously over time was introduced. The ST-SCs
    establish the space-time domain of each class, demarcate the precise “territory”
    in which a particular class roams over time in a 2-d FS, and identify the date/s
    on which a class is best separable from other classes. A suite of methods and
    techniques were found most useful and adopted in detailed irrigated-area and LULC
    mapping. These included: (a) RED-NIR brightness–greenness–wetness (BGW) plots
    for single dates (RN-SDs), (b) RED-NIR BGW plots for multiple dates (RN-MDs),
    (c) class signatures based on NDVI (CS-NDVI) for near-continuous time interval,
    (d) class signatures based on multiple band reflectivity (CS-MBR) involving all
    7 MODIS bands, and (e) multiband feature space plots (MB-FSP). The 2-d FS plots
    can be created for any 2-band combination of the 7-MODIS bands and for all 42
    dates of MODIS images. The threshold NDVI and/or spectral reflectivity in various
    wavebands gathered near-continuously for each classes helped in determining: (i)
    onset of a cropping seasons (e.g., rabi and khariff), (ii) duration of the cropping
    seasons like khariff and rabi, (iii) intensity of the crops during different seasons
    and years (e.g., drought vs. normal years), (iv) timing of peak growth and (v)
    beginning of senescing leading to harvest. Phenology also played a key role in
    establishing class separability for these classes. The methods and techniques
    are generic and can be applied to other remote sensing datasets and at global
    to local levels of study. The above suite of methods and techniques demonstrated
    an ability to map: (1) distinct categories of irrigated areas (see class 21–26
    in Fig. 8a) at high degree of confidence (see Table 4), (2) assess cropping intensities
    during different seasons (e.g., Khariff, Rabi, Summer) and (3) estimate ratio
    of surface:ground-water irrigation. The study helped establish the strengths of
    the high-dimensionality (temporal, spectral, spatial and radiometric domain) of
    MODIS data along with substantial investment of time and resources for ground-truthing
    in mapping irrigated areas. A total of 24.9% (or 33.08 Mha) of the study area
    (133.21 Mha) in Ganges and Indus basins was irrigated—98.4% of this area during
    Khariff, 92.5% during Rabi, but only 3.5% all through the year or continuous cropping.
    The ratio of canal:ground-water irrigated was 26.6%:73.4% (of total irrigated
    area of 33.08 Mha). Other cultivated areas were: 13.46 Mha for rainfed, 12.35
    Mha for rainfed with supplemental irrigation, and 3.05 Mha of wetland or flooded
    irrigation. Overall, 46.6% of the study area (or 61.94 Mha) was cultivated (irrigated+rainfed).
    The results support the use of multiple wavebands in irrigated-area mapping with
    MODIS band 5 centered at 1240 nm providing the best separability, followed by
    bands 2 (859 nm), 7 (2130 nm), 6 (1640 nm) and 3 (648 nm). Acknowledgements We

    rights and content Abstract Since January 2008, the U.S. Department of Interior
    / U.S. Geological Survey have been providing free terrain-corrected (Level 1T)
    Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data via the Internet, currently
    for acquisitions with less than 40% cloud cover. With this rich dataset, temporally
    composited, mosaics of the conterminous United States (CONUS) were generated on
    a monthly, seasonal, and annual basis using 6521 ETM+ acquisitions from December
    2007 to November 2008. The composited mosaics are designed to provide consistent
    Landsat data that can be used to derive land cover and geo-physical and bio-physical
    products for detailed regional assessments of land-cover dynamics and to study
    Earth system functioning. The data layers in the composited mosaics are defined
    at 30 m and include top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, TOA brightness temperature,
    TOA normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the date each composited pixel
    was acquired on, per-band radiometric saturation status, cloud mask values, and
    the number of acquisitions considered in the compositing period. Reduced spatial
    resolution browse imagery, and top of atmosphere 30 m reflectance time series
    extracted from the monthly composites, capture the expected land surface phenological
    change, and illustrate the potential of the composited mosaic data for terrestrial
    monitoring at high spatial resolution. The composited mosaics are available in
    501 tiles of 5000 × 5000 30 m pixels in the Albers equal area projection and are
    downloadable at http://landsat.usgs.gov/WELD.php. The research described in this
    paper demonstrates the potential of Landsat data processing to provide a consistent,
    long-term, large-area, data record. Previous article in issue Next article in

    1. Introduction The Landsat satellite series, operated by the U.S. Department
    of Interior / U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat project, with satellite development
    and launches supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),
    represents the longest temporal record of space-based land observations (Williams
    et al., 2006). Until recently the primary limitations to using Landsat data have
    been the cost and availability of data, which have precluded continental to global
    scale Landsat studies (Hansen et al., 2008). In January 2008, NASA and the USGS
    implemented a free Landsat Data Distribution Policy that provides Level 1 terrain
    corrected data for the entire U.S. Landsat archive, over 2.2 million globally
    distributed Landsat acquisitions, at no cost via the Internet. Landsat acquisitions
    with a cloud cover of less than or equal to 40% are processed and made freely
    available as they are acquired, and users may request any other scene in the U.S.
    Landsat archive to be processed and made available via the Internet at no cost.
    Free Landsat data will enable reconstruction of the history of the Earth''s land
    surface back to 1972, with appropriate spatial resolution to enable chronicling
    of both anthropogenic and natural changes (Townshend & Justice, 1988), during
    a time when the human population has doubled and the impacts of climate change
    have become noticeable (Woodcock et al., 2008). The Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic
    Mapper Plus (ETM+) is the most recent in a series of Landsat sensors that acquire
    high spatial resolution multi-spectral data over an approximately 183 km × 170
    km extent, defined in a Worldwide Reference System of path (groundtrack parallel)
    and row (latitude parallel) coordinates, with a 16 day revisit capability (Williams
    et al., 2006). Every Landsat overpass of the conterminous United States (CONUS)
    is acquired by the U.S. Landsat Project, providing 22 or 23 acquisitions per year
    per path/row (Ju & Roy, 2008). The Landsat project does not acquire every acquisition
    globally due to ground system processing and archiving constraints (Arvidson et
    al., 2006). Cloud cover reduces the number of Landsat surface observations; for
    example, the annual mean Landsat ETM+ cloud cover for the CONUS and global scenes
    stored in the U.S. Landsat archive is about 40% and 35% respectively (Ju & Roy,
    2008). In addition, in May 2003 the ETM+ scan line corrector (SLC) failed, reducing
    the usable data in each Landsat ETM+ SLC-off scene by 22% (Storey et al., 2005,
    Maxwell et al., 2007). Arguably, the utility of Landsat data for long-term and/or
    large-area monitoring has not been fully assessed; to date, the majority of the
    data in the U.S. Landsat archive have not been used in applications science. A
    number of regional, continental and global Landsat data sets have been generated
    however. Regional mosaics of Landsat imagery are increasingly being developed
    to meet national monitoring and reporting needs across land-use and resource sectors,
    for example, in Canada (Wulder et al., 2002) and the Congo basin (Hansen et al.,
    2008). Large volume Landsat processing was developed by the Landsat Ecosystem
    Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) that processed over 2100 Landsat
    Thematic Mapper and ETM+ acquisitions to provide wall-to-wall surface reflectance
    coverage for North America for the 1990s and 2000s (Masek et al., 2006). More
    recently, a Landsat mosaic of Antarctica was generated from nearly 1100 Landsat
    ETM+ austral summer acquisitions (Bindschadler et al., 2008). At global scale,
    the Global Land Survey decadal Landsat data set provides relatively cloud-free
    acquisitions selected for each path/row from the 1970s, 1990s and 2000s (Tucker
    et al., 2004). These data sets are composed of single date manually selected Landsat
    acquisitions. With the advent of free Landsat data it becomes feasible to apply
    temporal compositing approaches to multi-temporal Landsat acquisitions of the
    same path/row. Compositing procedures are applied independently on a per-pixel
    basis to gridded satellite time series data and provide a practical way to reduce
    cloud and aerosol contamination, fill missing values, and reduce the data volume
    of moderate resolution global near-daily coverage satellite data (Holben, 1986,
    Cihlar et al., 1994). Thus, instead of spatially mosaicing select relatively cloud-free
    Landsat acquisitions together (Zobrist et al., 1983), all the available multi-temporal
    acquisitions may be considered, and at each gridded pixel the acquisition that
    satisfies some compositing criteria selected. In this way, the Global Land Survey
    (GLS) 2005 Landsat ETM+ data set is generated by compositing up to three circa
    2005 low cloud cover acquisitions per path/row (Gutman et al., 2008). Recently,
    Lindquist et al. (2008) examined the suitability of the GLS data sets compared
    to more data intensive Landsat compositing methods (Hansen et al., 2008) and showed
    that over the Congo Basin compositing an increasing number of acquisitions reduced
    the percentage of SLC-off gaps and pixels with a high likelihood of cloud, haze
    or shadow. Similar observations have been observed for compositing moderate and
    coarse spatial resolution satellite data (Holben, 1986, Cihlar et al., 1994, Roy,
    2000). In this paper we describe the generation of Landsat ETM+ composited mosaics
    of the CONUS for December 2007 to November 2008. The composited mosaics are designed
    to provide consistent Landsat data that can be used to derive land cover and geo-physical
    and bio-physical products needed for detailed regional assessments of land-cover
    dynamics and to study Earth system functioning (Gutman et al., 2008, Wulder et
    al., 2008). The composited mosaics are generated on a monthly, seasonal, and annual
    basis to provide data that capture temporal surface variations. The compositing
    approach is designed to preferentially select valid land surface observations
    with minimal cloud, snow, and atmospheric contamination; consequently the composited
    mosaics are not appropriate for Landsat studies of cloud, snow or the atmosphere.
    The processing steps and data products are informed by our MODIS Land processing,
    quality assessment and validation experience (Justice et al., 2002). The processing
    approach is intentionally designed to facilitate automated processing with minimal
    human intervention, including the requirement for composited mosaics to be updated
    regardless of the chronological order of the Landsat acquisition and processing
    dates, and to provide processing in near-real time i.e., updating composited mosaics
    shortly after the Landsat data are acquired. Information on how to obtain the
    composited mosaic products and further research is described. 2. Input web-enabled
    level 1T Landsat ETM+ data The Landsat data made freely available by the U.S.
    Landsat project are sometimes called “web-enabled” data as they are made available
    via the Internet. These data are nominally processed as Level 1 terrain-corrected
    (L1T) data. The L1T data are available in GeoTIFF format in the Universal Transverse
    Mercator (UTM) map projection with World Geodetic System 84 (WGS84) datum which
    is compatible with heritage GLS and Landsat MSS data sets (Tucker et al., 2004).
    The Level 1T processing includes radiometric correction, systematic geometric
    correction, precision correction using ground control chips, and the use of a
    digital elevation model to correct parallax error due to local topographic relief.
    The L1T geolocation error in the CONUS is less than 30 m even in areas with substantial
    terrain relief (Lee et al., 2004). While most web-enabled Landsat data are processed
    as L1T (i.e., precision and terrain-corrected), certain acquisitions do not have
    sufficient ground control or elevation data necessary for precision or terrain
    correction, respectively. In these cases, the best level of correction is applied
    and, over the CONUS, the data are processed to Level 1G systematic (L1G) (WWW1).
    The product file metadata notes if the acquisition was processed to L1T or L1G.
    Landsat acquisitions with cloud cover less than or equal to 40% are processed
    and made freely available as they are acquired, and users may request any other
    scene in the U.S. Landsat archive to be processed and made available at no cost
    via the Internet. Initially, the U.S. Landsat project implemented a 20% cloud
    cover threshold but this was increased to 40% in October 2008 after a processing
    load analysis and in response to requests from the user community including from
    this research project. In, addition, the U.S. Landsat project bulk processed all
    the CONUS ETM+ acquisitions with less than 40% cloud cover acquired from May 2007
    to October 2008 in support of this project. The cloud cover of each ETM+ acquisition
    is estimated operationally by the automatic cloud cover assessment (ACCA) algorithm
    during the archiving process (Irish et al., 2006). Fig. 1 shows the CONUS study
    area, defined by 459 Landsat path/row coordinates, covering about 11,000,000,000
    30 m land pixels. All the web-enabled Landsat ETM+ data acquired over the study
    area for a 12 month period from December 2007 to November 2008 were obtained.
    A total of 6959 acquisitions were copied by dedicated file transfer protocol from
    the U.S Landsat project to computers at the Geographic Information Science Center
    of Excellence, South Dakota State University. Of the 6959 acquisitions, 438 (6.3%)
    were found to be processed as L1G and not as L1T. Fig. 2 shows histograms of the
    ACCA cloud cover percentage for the 6521 L1T (left) and the 438 L1G (right) acquisitions.
    The acquisitions that were processed as L1G have markedly higher cloud cover (mean
    61%) compared to those processed as L1T (mean 18%). This is expected as higher
    cloud cover reduces the number of available ground control chips needed in the
    L1T processing, although a minority of acquisitions processed as L1T also have
    high cloud cover. The locations of acquisitions that had less than 20% ACCA cloud
    cover but that were processed to L1G are illustrated in Fig. 1 (black filled circles).
    For all 105 of these the availability of ground control chips and/or the reliability
    of the ground control matching algorithm was compromised for reasons other than
    cloud cover: 100 acquisitions were of 10 coastal water path/row locations where
    land ground control was less available, another (path 30, row 27) was extensively
    contaminated by snow reducing the availability of ground control, and four were
    at the same location in Kansas (path 30, row 34) where there is extensive center-pivot
    irrigation (Wardlow et al., 2007) that are thought to confuse the matching algorithm.

    Table 1 summarizes the number, ACCA cloud cover, and seasonal distribution of
    acquisitions in the U.S. Landsat project archive. The number of acquisitions in
    the archive is about the same in each season (Table 1, column 2), but because
    of the higher cloud cover in winter and spring, fewer acquisitions were available
    with less than 40% ACCA cloud cover than in summer and autumn (Table 1, column
    3). All the available web-enabled acquisitions processed to L1T were used for
    the research (Table 1, column 4). The 438 acquisitions processed to L1G were discarded
    and only the remaining 6521 acquisitions processed to L1T were used in order to
    maximize the Landsat geolocation and so compositing accuracy (Roy, 2000). A total
    of 734 L1T acquisitions had higher than 40% ACCA cloud cover reflecting high cloud
    cover acquisitions ordered by the user community. The high degree of cloud contamination
    in some of the L1T acquisitions was not considered important however because it
    was expected that cloudy pixels would be removed by the compositing process. Table

    of atmosphere reflectance, brightness temperature, vegetation index, and band
    saturation computation The spectral radiance sensed by each ETM+ detector is stored
    as an 8-bit digital number (Markham et al., 2006). The digital numbers should
    be converted to radiance (units: W m−2 sr− 1 μm− 1), to minimize changes in the
    instrument radiometric calibration, and then converted to top of atmosphere reflectance
    to minimize remote sensing variations introduced by variations in the sun–earth
    distance, the solar geometry, and exoatmospheric solar irradiance arising from
    spectral band differences (Chander et al., 2009). This is particularly important
    for applications that use Landsat data acquired over large areas or long time
    periods. The conversion of the radiance sensed at the Landsat reflective and thermal
    wavelengths to reflectance (unitless) and brightness temperature (units: Kelvin)
    respectively provides data that has physical meaning and, for example, can be
    compared with laboratory and ground based measurements, model outputs, and data
    from other satellite sensors (Masek et al., 2006), and importantly provides data
    that can be used to derive geo-physical and bio-physical products (Justice et
    al., 2002). In this research all the Landsat ETM+ bands were used, except the
    panchromatic band, i.e., the bands used were the 30 m blue (0.45–0.52 μm), green
    (0.53–0.61 μm), red (0.63–0.69 μm), near-infrared (0.78–0.90 μm), and the two
    mid-infrared (1.55–1.75 μm and 2.09–2.35 μm) bands, and the 60 m thermal (10.40–12.50
    μm) low and high gain bands. The L1T 8-bit digital numbers were converted to spectral
    radiance using sensor calibration gain and bias coefficients derived from the
    ETM+ L1T file metadata (Chander et al., 2009). The radiance sensed in the Landsat
    reflective wavelength bands, i.e., the blue, green, red, near-infrared, and the
    two mid-infrared bands, were converted to top of atmosphere reflectance using
    the standard formula as: (1) where ρλ is the top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance
    (unitless), Lλ is the TOA spectral radiance (W m− 2 sr− 1 μm− 1), d is the Earth–Sun
    distance (astronomical units), ESUNλ is the mean TOA solar spectral irradiance
    (W m− 2 μm− 1), and θs is solar zenith angle at the center of the Landsat acquisition
    (radians). The quantities ESUNλ and d are tabulated by Chander et al. (2009) and
    θs is calculated from the solar elevation angle stored in the ETM+ L1T file metadata.
    The TOA reflectance computed as [1] is the TOA bi-directional reflectance factor
    and can be greater than 1, for example, due to specular reflectance over snow
    or water under certain solar and viewing geometries (Schaepman-Strub et al., 2006).
    In addition, due to instrument artifacts not accommodated for by the calibration,
    the retrieved TOA reflectance can be negative, for example, over water bodies.
    The 30 m TOA reflectance for each reflective band were stored as signed 16-bit
    integers after being scaled by 10,000, in the same manner as the MODIS surface
    reflectance product (Vermote et al., 2002). The normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) is a commonly used vegetation index, derived as the near-infrared
    minus the red reflectance divided by their sum (Tucker, 1979), and is used in
    maximum NDVI compositing to preferentially select pixels with reduced cloud and
    atmospheric contamination (Holben, 1986). The 30 m TOA NDVI was computed from
    the TOA red and near-infrared Landsat reflectance and stored as signed 16-bit
    integers after being scaled by 10,000, in the same manner as the MODIS NDVI product
    (Huete et al., 2002). The radiance sensed in the Landsat low and high gain thermal
    bands were converted to TOA brightness temperature (i.e., assuming unit surface
    emissivity) using the standard formula as: (2) where T is the 10.40–12.50 μm TOA
    brightness temperature (Kelvin), K1 and K2 are thermal calibration constants set
    as 666.09 (W m− 2 sr− 1 μm− 1) and 1282.71 (Kelvin) respectively (Chander et al.,
    2009), and Lλ is the TOA spectral radiance. This equation is an inverted Planck
    function simplified for the ETM+ sensor considering the thermal band spectral
    responses. For convenience for the subsequent processing, and subsequent product
    use, the two 60 m brightness temperature thermal bands were resampled to 30 m
    to provide the same image spatial dimensions as the 30 m TOA reflectance bands.
    The upper-left 60 m L1T pixels are co-registered at the pixel centers (WWW2).
    Consequently, the even-numbered row and column 30 m pixels fall within the 60
    m pixels and so were assigned the 60 m pixel brightness temperature values. The
    odd-numbered 30 m pixels have centers on the boundaries of two neighboring 60
    m pixels, and their pixel values were systematically obtained from the nearest
    60 m pixel with a smaller row and/or column number. The 30 m low and high gain
    TOA brightness temperature data were stored as signed 16-bit integers with units
    of degrees Celsius by subtracting 273.15 from the brightness temperature and then
    scaling by 100. The Landsat ETM+ calibration coefficients are configured in an
    attempt to globally maximize the range of land surface spectral radiance in each
    spectral band (Markham et al., 2006). However, highly reflective surfaces, such
    as snow and clouds, may over-saturate the reflective wavelength bands, with saturation
    varying spectrally and with the illumination geometry (solar zenith and surface
    slope) (Cahalan et al., 2001, Dowdeswell and Mcintyre, 1986, Bindschadler et al.,
    2008). Similarly, hot surfaces may over-saturate the thermal bands (Flynn & Mouginis-Mark,
    1995), and cold surfaces may under-saturate the high gain thermal band (WWW3).
    Over and under-saturated pixels are designated by digital numbers of 255 and 1
    respectively in the L1T data. As the radiance values of saturated pixels are unreliable,
    a 30 m 8-bit saturation mask was generated, storing bit packed band saturation
    (1) or unsaturated (0) values for the eight Landsat bands used in this study.
    4. Cloud masking It is well established that optically thick clouds preclude optical
    and thermal wavelength remote sensing of the land surface but that automated and
    reliable satellite data cloud detection is not trivial (Kaufman, 1987, Platnick
    et al., 2003). Recognizing that cloud detection errors, both of omission and commission,
    will always occur in large data sets, both the Landsat automatic cloud cover assessment
    (ACCA) algorithm and a classification tree based cloud detection approach were
    implemented. 4.1. Automatic cloud cover assessment (ACCA) cloud detection The
    U.S. Landsat project uses the ACCA algorithm to estimate the cloud content of
    each acquisition (Irish, 2000, Irish et al., 2006). The percentage of pixels that
    are flagged as cloudy are stored as metadata (e.g., Fig. 2). The ACCA takes advantage
    of known spectral properties of clouds, snow, bright soil, vegetation, and water,
    and consists of twenty-six filters/rules applied to five of the ETM+ bands (Irish
    et al., 2006). The primary goal of the algorithm is to quickly produce scene-average
    cloud cover metadata values, that can be used in future acquisition planning (Arvidson
    et al., 2006), and that users may query as part of the Landsat browse and order
    process. The ACCA was not developed to produce a “per-pixel” cloud mask; despite
    this, the ACCA has an estimated 5% error for 98% of the global 2001 ETM+ acquisitions
    archived by the U.S. Landsat project (Irish et al, 2006). A copy of the ACCA code
    was obtained and applied to every Landsat ETM+ acquisition to produce a 30 m per-pixel
    cloud data layer, stored as an unsigned 8-bit integer where 0 = not cloudy, 1
    = cloudy, and 255 = fill value denoting missing data in any of the Landsat bands.
    4.2. Classification tree cloud detection The state of the practice for automated
    satellite land-cover classification is to adopt a supervised classification approach
    where a sample of locations of known land-cover classes (training data) is collected.
    The optical and thermal wavelength values sensed at the locations of the training
    pixels are used to develop statistical classification rules, which are then used
    to map the land-cover class of every pixel. Supervised classification tree approaches
    have been applied to Landsat data to identify cloud contaminated pixels (Hansen
    et al., 2008). Classification trees are hierarchical classifiers that predict
    categorical class membership by recursively partitioning data into more homogeneous
    subsets, referred to as nodes (Breiman et al., 1984). They accommodate abrupt,
    non-monotonic and non-linear relationships between the independent and dependent
    variables, and make no assumptions concerning the statistical distribution of
    the data (Prasad et al., 2006). Bagging tree approaches use a statistical bootstrapping
    methodology, whereby a large number of trees are grown using random subsets of
    the training data, to reduce over-fitting and improve predictive ability (Breiman,
    1996). Conventionally multiple bagged trees are used to independently classify
    the satellite data and the multiple classifications are combined using some voting
    procedure. In this study we developed a single parsimonious tree from multiple
    bagged trees so that only one tree was used to classify the Landsat data, reducing
    the computational overhead. Supervised classification approaches require training
    data. A global database of Landsat Level 1G and corresponding spatially explicit
    cloud masks generated by photo-interpretation of the reflective and thermal bands
    were used. This database was developed to prototype the cloud mask algorithm for
    the future Landsat Data Continuity Mission (Irons & Masek, 2006). The Landsat
    interpreted cloud mask defines each pixel as thick cloud, thin cloud, cloud shadow
    or not cloudy. We reconciled these interpreted cloud states into cloud (i.e.,
    thick and thin cloud) and non-cloud (i.e. cloud shadow and not cloudy states)
    classes. In addition, to avoid mixed pixel cloud edge problems, the cloud labeled
    regions were morphologically eroded by one 30 m pixel and not used (Serra, 1982).
    A 0.5% sample of training pixels was extracted randomly from each Landsat scene,
    where data were present and not including the cloud boundary regions. A total
    of 88 northern hemisphere Landsat scenes acquired in polar (19 acquisitions),
    boreal (22 acquisitions), mid-latitude (24 acquisitions) and sub-tropical latitudinal
    zones (23 acquisitions) were sampled. The Landsat Level 1G data were processed
    to TOA reflectance, brightness temperature and the band saturation flag computed
    as described in Section 3. Only pixels with reflectance greater than 0.0 were
    used. A total of 12,979,302 unsaturated training pixels and 5,374,157 saturated
    training pixels were extracted. After some experimentation it became apparent
    that it was necessary to develop two classification trees; one for saturated training
    data and the other for the unsaturated training data. Saturation occurs in any
    of the reflective ETM+ bands, and also for the high gain thermal wavelength band
    which may over- or under-saturate typically when pixels contain illuminated thick
    cumulonimbus cloud, illuminated snow, or sunglint over water. The saturated TOA
    reflectance and brightness temperature values were unreliable but still provided
    information that could be classified. Consequently, better cloud non-cloud discrimination
    was afforded by classifying the saturated and unsaturated pixels independently.
    For both the saturated and unsaturated classification trees, all the 30 m TOA
    reflective bands were used, except the shortest wavelength blue band which is
    highly sensitive to atmospheric scattering (Ouaidrari & Vermote, 1999). For both
    trees, the low gain thermal band was also used. The high gain thermal band was
    not used because it under-saturated or over-saturated frequently over the wide
    surface brightness temperature range of the CONUS e.g., from winter snow covered
    surfaces to hot summer desert surfaces. The unsaturated classification tree also
    used reflective band simple ratios similar to those used by ACCA. The saturated
    classification tree did not use band ratios as they could not be computed when
    one or both bands in the ratio formulation were saturated. Twenty five bagged
    classification trees were generated, running the Splus tree code on a 64 bit computer,
    each time, 20% of the training data were sampled at random with replacement and
    used to generate a tree. Each tree was used to classify the remaining (“out-of-bag”)
    80% of the training data, deriving a vector of predicted classes for each out-of-bag
    pixel. In this way, each training pixel was classified 25 or fewer times. The
    most frequent predicted class (cloud or non-cloud) for each training pixel was
    derived; and used with the corresponding training data to generate a single final
    tree, i.e. the final tree was generated using approximately 25 × 0.8 × n training
    pixels, where n was either the 12,979,302 unsaturated training pixels or the 5,374,157
    saturated training pixels. To limit over-fitting, all the trees were terminated
    using a deviance threshold, whereby additional splits in the tree had to exceed
    0.02% of the root node deviance or tree growth was terminated. The final unsaturated
    and saturated classification tree was then used to classify every Landsat pixel
    according to its saturation status. The 30 m cloud classification result was stored
    as an unsigned 8-bit integer where 0 = not cloudy, 1 = cloudy, 2 = not cloudy
    but adjacent to a cloudy pixel, 200 = could not be classified because of negative
    reflectance, and 255 = fill value denoting missing data in any of the Landsat
    bands. 5. Reprojection, resampling and tiling The L1T data are defined in the
    UTM projection which is defined in zones, each 6° of longitude in width and centered
    over a meridian of longitude, with ten zones encompassing the CONUS (Snyder, 1993).
    Consequently, after each Landsat ETM+ L1T acquisition was processed (3 Top of
    atmosphere reflectance, brightness temperature, vegetation index, and band saturation
    computation, 4 Cloud masking), the 30 m TOA reflective bands, TOA NDVI, TOA brightness
    temperature bands, band saturation mask, and the two cloud masks were reprojected
    from the L1T UTM coordinates into a single continental map projection. The high
    Landsat L1T data volume restricts provision of multiple product instances in different
    map projections, even though users will inevitably prefer different projections
    (Teillet et al., 2000). The Albers Equal Area projection was selected as it is
    suitable for large areas that are mainly east–west oriented such as the CONUS
    (Snyder, 1993), and was defined with standard parallels 29.5°N, 45.5°N and central
    Meridian 96°W to provide heritage with the USGS EROS National Land Cover Database
    (Homer et al., 2004, Chander et al., 2009a). As there are about 11,000,000,000
    30 m Landsat pixels covering the CONUS study area it is not physically possible
    to store the reprojected Landsat 30 m data in a single file. The largest file
    size achievable is limited by the amount of addressable memory on a user''s personal
    computer, usually conservatively considered to be a 32 bit computer with a maximum
    file size of 2 GB. To ensure manageable file sizes, the 30 m Landsat data were
    reprojected into 501 fixed Albers tiles where each tile was composed of 5000 ×
    5000 30 m Landsat pixels. This tile dimension (number of rows and columns) is
    smaller than the dimensions of individual L1T ETM+ acquisitions. The Landsat ETM+
    pixels were allocated to the Albers coordinate system using the inverse gridding
    approach, sometimes known as the indirect method (Konecny, 1976). In this approach
    the center coordinates of each Albers 30 m pixel are mapped to the nearest pixel
    center in the Landsat data, and the ETM+ processed data for that pixel are allocated
    to the Albers output grid. This processing approach is computationally efficient
    and geometrically is the equivalent of nearest neighbor resampling (Wolfe et al.,
    1998). The General Cartographic Transformation Package (GCTP) developed by the
    USGS and used to develop a number of applications including the MODIS global browse
    imagery (Roy et al., 2002) and the MODIS Reprojection Tool (WWW4) was used to
    transform coordinates between the UTM and Albers map projections. The GCTP is
    computationally expensive. Consequently, a sparse triangulation methodology was
    used where the GCTP was invoked to project Albers 30 m pixels to UTM coordinates
    only at the vertices of triangles, and Albers 30 m pixel locations falling within
    the triangles were projected to UTM coordinates using a simplicial coordinate
    transformation (Saalfeld, 1985). In this approach, any point (px, py) in a triangle
    with vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) can be represented by three simplicial
    coordinates (s1, s2, s3) defined as: (3) where: Given a point (px,py) defined
    in Albers coordinates the corresponding location in UTM coordinates is: (4) where
    (x1′, y1′), (x2′, y2′), (x3′, y3′) are the coordinates of the triangle vertices
    in UTM calculated by projecting the corresponding Albers triangle vertices (x1,
    y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) using the GCTP. A regular lattice of triangles was defined
    by bisecting squares with side lengths of 450 m (i.e., fifteen 30 m pixels) defined
    from the northwest origin of the Albers coordinate system so there in each square
    there were two triangles with different topologies. This approach is computationally
    efficient as the GCTP is only called for each triangle vertex and the coefficients
    a, b, c and t are computed only once for each triangle. The maximum coordinate
    difference between the simplical interpolation and GCTP projected coordinates,
    occurs at the triangle centers, and for the CONUS study area is less than 1 cm
    east–west and north–south. 6. Compositing and composited mosaic format Compositing
    was developed originally to reduce residual cloud and aerosol contamination in
    AVHRR time series to produce representative n-day data sets (Holben, 1986). Compositing
    procedures either select from colocated pixels in different orbits of geometrically
    registered data the pixel that best satisfies some compositing criteria, or combine
    the different pixel values together. Compositing criteria have included the maximum
    NDVI, maximum brightness temperature, maximum apparent surface temperature, maximum
    difference in red and near-infrared reflectance, minimum scan angle, and combinations
    of these (Roy, 2000). Ideally, the criteria should select from the time series
    only near-nadir observations that have reduced cloud and atmospheric contamination.
    Composites generated from wide field of view satellite data, such as AVHRR or
    MODIS, often contain significant bi-directional reflectance effects caused by
    angular sensing and illumination variations combined with the anisotropy of reflectance
    of most natural surfaces and the atmosphere (Gao et al., 2002, Roy et al., 2006).
    Compositing algorithms that model the bi-directional reflectance have been developed
    to compensate for this problem and combine all valid observations to estimate
    the reflectance at nadir view zenith for some consistent solar zenith angle (Roujean
    et al., 1992, Schaaf et al., 2002). This approach does not provide a solution
    for compositing thermal wavelength satellite data, and is not appropriate for
    application to Landsat data as the comparatively infrequent 16 day Landsat repeat
    cycle and the narrow 15º Landsat sensor field of view do not provide a sufficient
    number or angular sampling of the surface to invert bi-directional reflectance
    models (Danaher et al., 2001, Roy et al., 2008). Consequently, in this research,
    compositing based on the selection of a “best” pixel over the compositing period
    was implemented. Composited mosaics of the CONUS were generated on a monthly,
    seasonal and annual basis for December 2007 to November 2008. The compositing
    criteria were focused on selecting valid surface observations with minimal cloud,
    snow and atmospheric contamination. Initially, a simple selection over the compositing
    period of interest (month, season, year) of pixels that were not missing due to
    temporal Landsat acquisition gaps or SLC-off gaps, and that were not flagged as
    cloudy by the ACCA or classification tree cloud masking algorithms was attempted.
    This did not provide visually coherent composites, due to the incidence of saturated
    pixels, pixels that were contaminated by atmospheric aerosols, pixels that contained
    sub-pixel cloud and cloud edges, and the unresolved problem of how to select from
    several observations of the same pixel that were not missing and not flagged as
    cloudy. Consequently, the compositing approach was refined and incorporated the
    heritage maximum NDVI and maximum brightness temperature compositing criteria
    as clouds, snow and aerosols typically depress NDVI and brightness temperature
    over land surfaces (Holben, 1986, Cihlar et al., 1994, Roy, 1997). The maximum
    NDVI compositing criterion was selected as the primary compositing criterion,
    rather than the maximum brightness temperature criterion, because among cloud-free
    observations it preferentially selects vegetated observations and arguably the
    majority of terrestrial Landsat applications are concerned with vegetation. We
    observed however that for certain low vegetation covers, including certain dark
    and bright soils, water and snow, that the top of atmosphere (TOA) NDVI of a cloud
    could be higher than the TOA NDVI of the cloud-free surface. The sensitivity of
    NDVI to the brightness of soil beneath vegetation canopies (Huete, 1988) and to
    atmospheric effects (Liu & Huete, 1995) is well established. Consequently, a pixel
    was considered as “unvegetated” if NDVI < 0.09 AND 2.09–2.35 μm TOA reflectance
    < 0.048. These two thresholds were derived empirically. When there were “unvegetated”
    pixels the maximum brightness temperature compositing criterion was used, as cloud
    brightness temperatures tended to be lower than the cloud-free brightness temperature.
    The low gain 10.40–12.50 μm TOA brightness temperature was used as it has a wider
    range than the high gain TOA brightness temperature and does not saturate (Chander
    et al., 2009). For compositing purposes only, a pixel was considered saturated
    if either the red or near-infrared TOA reflectance was saturated as the NDVI is
    unreliable when one or both of these bands are saturated. The ACCA and classification
    tree cloud masks were used to complement the maximum NDVI and maximum brightness
    temperature criteria and to provide a more reliable differentiation between clouds
    and the land surface. These two cloud masks did not always agree, but it was not
    possible to quantitatively evaluate their relative omission and commission errors
    as a function of different clouds and background reflectance and brightness temperature.
    Consequently, a pixel was considered as cloudy if both the ACCA and the Classification
    Tree algorithms detected it as cloud, as uncertain cloud if only one algorithm
    detected it as cloud, or as non-cloudy if both algorithms detected it as non-cloud.
    Table 2 summaries the compositing logic; each row reflects a comparison of two
    acquisitions of the same pixel. If the criterion in a row is not met then the
    criterion in the row beneath is used and this process is repeated until the last
    row. This implementation enables the composites to be updated on a per-pixel basis
    shortly after the input ETM+ data are processed and regardless of the chronological
    processing order. For example, after 16 days the same Albers pixel location may
    be sensed again, and the compositing criteria are used to decide if the more recent
    ETM+ pixel data should be allocated to overwrite the previous data. For each composited
    Albers pixel, the 30 m TOA reflective bands, TOA NDVI, TOA brightness temperature
    bands, band saturation mask, and the two cloud masks are stored. In addition,
    the day of the year that the selected pixel was acquired on, and the number of
    different valid acquisitions considered at that pixel over the compositing period,
    are stored. Table 2. Compositing criteria used to compare two acquisitions of
    a pixel, the criteria are considered in decreasing priority until a selection
    is made (see text for further details). Priority Compositing criteria 1 If either
    fill: select non-fill 2 If either saturated: select unsaturated 3 If both saturated:

    if it has greater brightness temperature or greater NDVI, else select cloudy 6

    brightness temperature or greater NDVI, else select uncertain cloud 7 If either
    “unvegetated”: select the one with greatest brightness temperature 8 Select the
    one with greatest NDVI Table 3 summarizes the file format of the monthly, seasonal
    and annual composited mosaics. These data are stored in Hierarchical Data Format
    (HDF). HDF is a data file format designed by the National Center for Supercomputing
    Applications to assist users in the storage and manipulation of scientific data
    across diverse operating systems and machines. For example, it is used to store
    the standard MODIS Land products (Justice et al., 2002). Each composited mosaic
    pixel has 14 bands (termed HDF science data sets) storing the information described
    in Table 3 and in the text above. The different HDF science data sets are stored
    with appropriate data types, and HDF internal compression, to reduce the file
    size. A 5000 × 5000 tile is typically 240 MB and the total size of the 501 tiles
    defining a monthly, seasonal or annual composited mosaic is about 110 GB. Table

    generated from the composited mosaics to enable synoptic product evaluation with
    reduced data volume (Roy et al., 2002), and with the expectation that the browse
    imagery could be used for Internet data ordering. CONUS browse images were generated
    in the JPEG format with fixed contrast stretching and color look-up tables to
    enable consistent temporal comparison. The browse images were generated using
    the median pixel values falling in a given window size (Boschetti et al., 2008)
    defined with dimensions set as an integer multiple of the 30 m Albers pixels.
    For example, a 17 × 17 30 m pixel window size produces a browse with approximately
    500 m resolution. Browses were generated from the monthly, seasonal and annual
    composites using the same window size. Single band browses of a science data set
    of interest (Table 3) were generated using the median value of the pixel values
    falling in a given window. In addition, true color reflectance browses were generated
    from the TOA red, green, and blue reflectance data, selecting within each window
    the pixel with the median red reflectance and the corresponding blue and green
    reflectance values for that pixel. In this way, the reflectance for the same pixel
    is obtained which produces a more coherent true color reflectance browse than
    selecting the median reflectance values for each wavelength independently. The
    red reflectance was used as the “master” since it is less sensitive to atmospheric
    contamination than shorter wavelength blue and green reflectance (Ouaidrari &
    Vermote, 1999). In the results shown in the next section browse images were computed
    ignoring pixels flagged as cloud. 8. Results and preliminary assessment 8.1. Cloud
    It is difficult to definitively validate cloud detection algorithms (Irish et
    al., 2006, Platnick et al., 2003). Consequently, the ACCA and Classification Tree
    cloud masks were compared statistically and also by visual inspection. The Classification
    Tree cloud mask was generated using unsaturated and saturated ETM+ L1T data; 12,979,302
    unsaturated training pixels were used to generate a single tree defined by 1595
    nodes that explained 98% of the tree variance, and 5,374,157 saturated training
    pixels generated a tree of 188 nodes that explained 99.9% of the tree variance.
    Despite these high levels of explanation, it is recognized that supervised classification
    approaches are only as good as the quality of the training data and the degree
    to which the training data are representative. Although every attempt was made
    to use a large well distributed high quality training data set (Section 4.2) the
    suitability of the training data used to develop the saturated and unsaturated
    classification trees is unknown, especially considering the diverse and temporally
    variable landscapes and clouds of the CONUS. Fig. 3 shows scatterplots of the
    percentage of each Landsat L1T acquisition flagged as cloudy by the classification
    tree and by ACCA. Each point corresponds to the cloud percentage derived by counting
    the number of cloud labeled 30 m pixels in the L1T acquisition divided by the
    number of non-missing 30 m pixels. The figure illustrates scatterplots for the
    548 and 654 L1T CONUS acquisitions sensed in January 2008 (left) and July 2008
    (right) respectively. Simple linear regression lines are shown superimposed; the
    two cloud masks at this reporting scale have better correspondence in July (R2
    = 0.88) than in January (R2 = 0.66). For both January and July the classification
    tree underestimates the CONUS cloud cover relative to ACCA (regression line slopes
    of 0.73 and 0.90 respectively). It is established that ACCA may misclassify snow
    as cloud, particularly under low solar illumination (Irish et al., 2006), and
    this may explain the poorer correspondence between the cloud masks in January
    (Fig. 4, left) when a substantial proportion of the CONUS is snow covered and
    when the Landsat solar zenith angles are higher than in summer. Download : Download

    column illustrates the Classification Tree cloud mask. Colors illustrating the
    cloud masks are: blue: cloud detected, black: no cloud detected, gray: fill value

    33.1332°), bottom row subset: January 24, path 33, row 27 (scene center longitude
    − 101.8852°, latitude 47.4056°). Scatterplots of the sort illustrated in Fig.
    3 may be misleading in that similar cloud proportions may be reported by both
    algorithms but with the clouds mapped at different locations within the Landsat
    L1T acquisition. As a confidence check, Fig. 4 shows three 450 × 600 30 m spatial
    subsets of L1T January 2008 acquisitions. The left column illustrates the 30 m
    true color TOA reflectance and the middle and right columns show the ACCA and
    Classification Tree cloud classification results respectively. These three subsets
    were extracted from scenes with cloud cover percentages highlighted by the large
    black dots in Fig. 3 (left). The top row of Fig. 4 shows a subset of an acquisition
    in which the ACCA and the Classification Tree cloud cover agree at the scene level
    (12%). The middle and bottom rows of Fig. 4 illustrate subsets where the ACCA
    and Classification Tree scene level cloud cover percentages are the most different
    among all the January acquisitions. The top row of Fig. 4 illustrates a subset
    in Alabama acquired January 13th 2008 with no apparent snow cover. Locally, both
    cloud masks capture the general pattern of cloud evident in the TOA true color
    reflectance and it is not possible to state which cloud mask is performing better.
    The middle row illustrates a subset in California acquired January 7th 2008 with
    isolated thick clouds and with thin clouds which completely obscure the land surface.
    The ACCA detected the thick clouds but failed to detect the thin cloud, while
    the Classification Tree more correctly labeled the majority of the scene as cloud.
    The bottom row illustrates a subset acquired over a snow-covered landscape in
    North Dakota acquired January 24th 2008. The ACCA misclassified the snow as cloud
    while the Classification Tree cloud mask did not. Despite this evidence that the
    Classification Tree may be more reliable than the ACCA, we combined both cloud
    masks in the compositing procedure to provide a conservative cloud assessment
    used by the compositing procedure (Section 6). 8.2. Monthly, season and annual
    composited mosaics Monthly, seasonal and annual composites were generated from
    the 6521 L1T acquisitions processed in the manner described in the previous sections.
    The standard seasonal definition adopted by the climate modeling community is
    used where winter is defined by the months: December, January and February (Ju
    & Roy, 2008). Fig. 5 illustrates for the CONUS study area, the median temporal
    frequency of Landsat L1T acquisitions in 17 × 17 30 m pixel bins (i.e. ~ 500 m)
    over the 12 month study period. The majority of the CONUS path/row locations have
    10 or more acquisitions processed to L1T over the year; however, in cloudy regions
    including the Pacific Northwest, and the Great Lakes, less acquisitions are available;
    conversely, in the arid, less cloudy, southwest up to 55 acquisitions are available.
    These patterns have been observed previously (Ju & Roy, 2008). The maximum number
    of overpasses of a path/row per year is 23 but the number of acquisitions may
    be greater because of overlapping acquisitions along the same path and between
    adjacent paths. Adjacent Landsat paths are sensed with a seven day time difference
    and the L1T acquisitions acquired in the same row overlap in the across-track
    direction. Overlapping acquisitions occur along the same path because of the way
    the L1T data are generated and not because the same location is sensed twice on
    orbit. We retain these overlapping pixels however as the calibration coefficients
    and the scene center solar geometry can be different between consecutive L1T acquisitions
    along the same path. Download : Download high-res image (1003KB) Download : Download

    images of the monthly composited mosaics have evident holes (Fig. 6) that are
    due to the unavailability of L1T acquisitions at path/row coordinates with less
    than 40% ACCA cloud cover. Geographically, the incidence of holes tends to be
    higher in more cloudy regions near the Great Lakes and the U.S.–Canada border
    and lower in the Southwest, which is related to cloud distributions at the time
    of Landsat overpass (Ju & Roy, 2008). Some path/row coordinates have greater than
    40% ACCA cloud cover reflecting additional acquisitions ordered by the user community,
    confusing this pattern. Monthly variations in the greenness of the vegetation
    are evident, with a characteristic wave of growth moving northward across the
    CONUS in the early spring and with differences in the timing of growth between
    agricultural and natural vegetation, for example, in and around the Mississippi
    valley. Vegetation senescence, particularly in the deciduous forests on the Eastern
    sea-board may also be apparent, where the leaf chlorophyll responsible for the
    green reflectance of the leaves throughout the spring and summer reduces in the
    autumn and the yellow-red reflectance of other leaf pigments begin to dominate
    in November. These vegetation patterns have been observed with coarser spatial
    resolution MODIS true color reflectance composites (Schaaf, 2007). The spatio-temporal
    distribution of snow is also evident in the monthly composited mosaics, with snow
    predominating in the Northern states and over the Rocky mountains in the winter
    and spring. Cloud contamination looks the same as snow in the visible bands illustrated
    and is most obviously present when there was only one cloudy L1T acquisition,
    for example, December, over southern Texas. The seasonal and annual composited
    mosaics (Fig. 7, Fig. 8) have considerably fewer holes and clouds than the corresponding
    monthly composites. The seasonal composited mosaics still retain some clouds,
    primarily in the winter, spring and autumn where there were only a small number
    of cloud-free L1T observations over the 3 month period. In addition, errors in
    the ACCA and Classification Tree cloud masking algorithms lead to incorrect selection
    of cloudy pixels in the seasonal mosaics although these are not apparent in the
    browse imagery. There are a small number of holes in the winter, spring and autumn
    seasonal composited mosaics where there were no L1T acquisitions over the 3 months
    (Fig. 7). The annual composited mosaic has no missing acquisitions and less apparent
    cloud contamination over the land (Fig. 8). Table 4 quantifies the percentage
    of 30 m pixels in each CONUS composited mosaic that are missing and flagged as
    cloudy by the two cloud masks. There are a greater percentage of composited missing
    and cloudy pixels in winter than in the other seasons which is due to the greater
    winter cloudiness at the Landsat overpass time (Ju & Roy, 2008). The Landsat ETM+
    L1T processing and compositing is working correctly as increasing the compositing
    period from monthly, to seasonal, to annual periods, reduces the percentage of
    cloudy and missing pixels (Table 4). The percent cloud was computed by dividing
    the number of cloud flagged pixels by the number of valid pixels without “Fill”
    values (Table 3). The ACCA cloud cover in the winter, spring, summer and autumn
    seasonal CONUS composited mosaics were 13.0%, 3.8%, 1.4%, and 1.8% respectively
    (Table 4), i.e., lower than the equivalent 25%, 17%, 15% and 15% mean seasonal
    ACCA cloud cover percentages of the input L1T data used to generate the composited
    mosaics (Table 1, column 4). The Classification Tree underestimated the CONUS
    cloud cover relative to ACCA in the input L1T January and July data (Fig. 3) and
    this difference was generally maintained for the composited mosaics (Table 4).
    The annual composited mosaic Classification Tree cloud cover (0.21%) and the annual
    composited mosaic ACCA cloud cover (0.19%) were significantly lower than the 18%
    mean annual ACCA cloud cover of the input L1T data (Table 1, column 4). Table

    percentage of 30 m pixels in each CONUS monthly and seasonal composited mosaic
    that are missing relative to the CONUS annual composited mosaic. As the number
    of L1T acquisitions composited is increased, the percentage of missing data should
    decrease monotonically because the spatial phase of the SLC-off gaps is not constant
    between acquisitions of the same path/row (Lindquist et al., 2008). The percent
    missing statistics reported in Table 4 were computed for each monthly and seasonal
    composited mosaic by counting the number of “Fill” values in the composited mosaic
    occurring where there was no “Fill” value in the annual mosaic, divided by 10,838,923,633
    (the number of annual mosaic pixels without “Fill” values). The monthly composites
    had a variable percentage of missing data from 11% (July) to 28% (December) reflecting
    the seasonal variability of L1T acquisitions with 40% or less cloud cover, and,
    as expected, the percentage of missing pixels in the seasonal composites was much
    less than in the monthly composites, at most 1.8% in the Winter seasonal composited
    mosaic (Table 4). The illustrated monthly, seasonal and annual composites exhibit
    across-track reflectance variations and discontinuities between adjacent paths.
    It is unclear what proportion of this effect is due to the surface or the atmosphere,
    although we note that even if the Landsat data were atmospherically corrected,
    solar zenith variations will remain (Roy et al., 2008). It is established that
    for wide field of view sensor data, such as MODIS or AVHRR, reflectance anisotropy
    can result in the maximum NDVI compositing selection of a pixel with high NDVI
    caused by directional rather than reduced atmospheric effects (Cihlar et al.,
    1994, Meyer et al., 1995, Gao et al., 2002). The Landsat ETM+ sensor, with its
    comparatively narrow field of view, is not as severely affected, but Landsat directional
    reflectance effects have been documented and research on methods to minimize these
    effects undertaken (Danaher et al., 2001, Toivonen et al., 2006, Hansen et al.,
    2008, Roy et al., 2008). In addition, all compositing procedures implicitly assume
    that the surface state remains static, and so increasing the compositing period
    increases the incidence of temporal biases associated with violating this assumption
    (Roy et al., 2006). This may cause adjacent pixels to be sensed from the beginning
    or the end of the compositing period. The maximum NDVI compositing criterion,
    leads to the preferential selection of the greenest dates over the compositing
    period (Roy, 1997, Roy, 2000). This is apparent in Fig. 9 which shows the day
    of the year that the 12 month annual composited mosaic pixels were selected on.
    The majority of the CONUS annual composited mosaic pixels were selected in the
    summer June–August months when NDVI is maximal. However, some path/row coordinates
    in the annual composite have fewer acquisitions (Fig. 5) confusing this pattern,
    and temporal variations driven by phenological variations are also apparent, for
    example, the Southwest and certain high altitude mountains have later September–November
    peak NDVI, and regions in the southern states have peak NDVI in the winter months
    (Fig. 9). In the monthly composites this compositing timing bias is less apparent
    and is illustrated in the next section. Download : Download high-res image (970KB)

    annual composited mosaic. Each pixel shows the day of the year that the reflectance
    illustrated in Fig. 8 was sensed on. 8.3. Phenology To further check that the
    processing was performing correctly, the temporal coherence of the top of atmosphere
    NDVI stored in the 12 monthly composites was examined. Fig. 10 shows the monthly
    top of atmosphere NDVI values from December 2007 to November 2008 extracted at
    four 30 m pixel locations. These four sites represent different surface phenologies
    and three of them are well studied in the literature. The NDVI values in successive
    months are not necessarily multiples of 16 days apart because of overlapping acquisitions
    (Fig. 5). The absence of NDVI values in some months, occurring at all the sites
    except the White Sands site, is due to the unavailability of L1T data with less
    than 40% cloud cover. The phenological curves illustrated in Fig. 9 are consistent
    with the broad patterns of phenology reported in the literature. The Harvard Forest
    site is in Massachusetts (42.5360°N, 72.1729°W) in a temperate deciduous broad-leaf
    forest with high NDVI (~ 0.8) in May–September and rapid phenological change in
    the spring (March–April) and autumn (October–November) (Schwartz et al., 2002,
    Fisher and Mustard, 2007). The FIFE (First International Satellite Land Surface
    Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment) site is a grassland site (39.1097°N,
    96.5225°W) near Manhattan, Kansas (Sellers et al., 1992). The grassland NDVI trend
    is similar to that of Harvard Forest, but with a shorter growing season and lower
    NDVI. The Los Angeles site (34.5000°N, 118.6000°W) is a shrubland site in Los
    Angeles county, California (Dennison et al., 2005). The NDVI clearly shows the
    typical wet winter–spring and dry summer–autumn seasons of the Mediterranean Californian
    climate. The White Sands Missile Range site (32.9190°N, 106.3510°W) is an arid
    desert site devoid of vegetation and commonly used for satellite sensor radiometric
    calibration (Thome, 2001). Consequently, the NDVI is consistently low all year
    around. Only four sites are shown here due to space constraints and they by no
    means represent the full range of CONUS surface phenology (Morisette et al., 2009)
    but illustrate the potential of the monthly composited mosaic data for time series
    monitoring at 30 m resolution. Download : Download high-res image (257KB) Download

    a new era for utilizing Landsat data; users are no longer restricted by data costs
    to selection of acquisitions with low cloud cover, rather, with the advent of
    free Landsat data it becomes feasible to analyze and process long-term and/or
    large-area Landsat data sets. For example, a total of 6521 Landsat acquisitions
    were used to generate the monthly, seasonal and annual composited mosaics of the
    CONUS described in this paper; this data volume would have cost nearly four million
    US dollars when each Landsat acquisition was priced at six hundred dollars (Reichhardt,
    2002). The research described in this paper represents preliminary results of
    a project with the goal of providing consistent continental scale 30 m Landsat
    long-term data records. Such data records are needed to monitor land-cover change
    and study Earth system functioning (Gutman et al., 2008, Wulder et al., 2008)
    and may provide a high spatial resolution analogue to the moderate and coarse
    spatial resolution land products generated from the MODIS and AVHRR data streams
    (Justice et al., 2002, Tucker et al., 2005). The generation of long-term Landsat
    data records, for example from 1972 to present, and at continental to global scale,
    is technically feasible using the approach described in this paper but will be
    constrained primarily by Landsat data access and the ability to calibrate and
    geolocate the data in a consistent manner. The challenges to obtaining such consistently
    processed data are not inconsiderable, as the Landsat data reside in different
    international archives with different formats, documentation, and processing.
    The planned Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) will provide an opportunity
    to continue the development of such a long-term large-area data record. The Landsat
    ETM+ processing described in this paper was necessarily designed to enable large
    volume processing. The processing steps included conversion of digital numbers
    to calibrated radiance to top of atmosphere reflectance and brightness temperature,
    per-band radiometric saturation identification, cloud screening, reprojection,
    and compositing. Increasing the compositing period from monthly, to seasonal,
    to annual periods, reduced the percentage of cloudy and missing pixels. Using
    more Landsat 7 ETM+ acquisitions, and also acquisitions from the Landsat 5 Thematic
    Mapper, would further reduce the incidence of missing and cloudy pixels. The monthly,
    seasonal and annual composited mosaic products qualitatively capture CONUS spatio-temporal
    surface variations and expected land surface phenology. Reflectance discontinuities
    remain in the composited mosaics due to factors including the impact of the atmosphere
    and residual clouds, bi-directional reflectance effects associated with variations
    in solar illumination and observation angles, the unavailability of L1T acquisitions
    at path/row coordinates with greater than 40% ACCA cloud cover, and the sensitivity
    of the compositing procedure to these effects. Future research is needed to more
    fully characterize these effects and to implement systematic atmospheric correction
    and radiometric/BRDF normalization, for example, by a fusion of information from
    contemporaneous MODIS Terra data (Roy et al., 2008). The composited mosaic data
    products described in this paper, and software tools to utilize them, are being
    made available via the Internet from the U.S. Landsat Project at http://landsat.usgs.gov/WELD.php.

    versions with refined processing will be provided. Acknowledgements This Web-enabled

    Seasonal agricultural drought monitoring systems, which rely on satellite remote
    sensing and land surface

    models (LSMs), are important for disaster risk reduction and famine early warning.
    These systems require

    the best available weather inputs, as well as a long-term historical record to
    contextualize current

    observations. This article introduces the Famine Early Warning Systems Network
    (FEWS NET) Land Data

    Assimilation System (FLDAS), a custom instance of the NASA Land Information System
    (LIS) framework.

    The FLDAS is routinely used to produce multi-model and multi-forcing estimates
    of hydro-climate states

    and ﬂuxes over semi-arid, food insecure regions of Africa. These modeled data
    and derived products, like

    soil moisture percentiles and water availability, were designed and are currently
    used to complement FEWS

    NET’s operational remotely sensed rainfall, evapotranspiration, and vegetation
    observations. The 30+ years

    of monthly outputs from the FLDAS simulations are publicly available from the
    NASA Goddard Earth

    Science Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) and recommended for use
    in hydroclimate

    studies, early warning applications, and by agro-meteorological scientists in
    Eastern, Southern, and

    Western Africa.

    Background & Summary

    Using rainfall and other meteorological inputs (temperature, humidity, radiation,
    and wind), the Famine

    Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS)
    produces multi-

    model and multi-forcing estimates of hydro-climate conditions such as soil moisture,
    evapotranspiration,

    and runoff. The FLDAS system was created under a NASA Applied Sciences Program
    Water Resources

    grant as a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources
    Observation and

    Science (EROS) Center, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), and the University
    of California

    Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazards Group (CHG). The FLDAS variables are relevant
    to agricultural

    and water resource monitoring and are used to produce indices, like soil moisture
    percentiles, that show

    how current hydrologic extremes compare to conditions observed over the past 30+
    years. Within FEWS

    NET, FLDAS outputs are combined with remotely sensed estimates, ground observations,
    and reports

    from the ﬁeld to identify potential food security crises. FEWS NET reports1,2
    regarding the 2015 Ethiopia

    Drought and 2015–16 Southern Africa drought are examples of this approach. Using
    multiple sources of

    information typiﬁes the FEWS NET ‘convergence of evidence’ framework3 for characterizing
    agricultural

    conditions and providing early warning for food emergencies.

    The ideal gridded land surface model (LSM) dataset for food and water security
    monitoring would be

    (1) driven by a rainfall product that performs well over data sparse food insecure
    regions; (2) available

    over a long historical record and near-real time for contextualizing current events
    and initializing

    forecasts; and (3) useful for both the drought monitoring and hydrological science
    communities by

    providing estimates of land surface states and ﬂuxes that can be used to further
    our understanding of

    drought dynamics and impacts. At present, the Global Land Data Assimilation System
    (GLDAS)4 does

    provide a suite of outputs at 1-month latency over a global domain, but relies
    on global rainfall products

    (speciﬁcally CMAP5 and Princeton6) that have not been optimized for data sparse,
    food insecure regions.

    From the drought monitoring community there are existing efforts like Africa Flood
    and Drought

    Monitor (ADFM)7. There are also global efforts: the Global Integrated Drought
    Monitoring and

    Prediction System (GIDMaPS)8, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Global
    Information

    and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture (GIEWS), and the Global Drought
    Information

    System Portal9. To complement these efforts and better meet the needs of food
    and water security

    monitoring, the FLDAS provides (1) ﬂexible use of different forcing products,
    including FEWS NET

    operational rainfall, (2) multiple land models, (3) routine evaluation, and (4)
    rapid and convenient data

    distribution. By relying on standard FEWS NET rainfall inputs FLDAS maintains
    consistency between

    the different FEWS NET drought metrics. This allows FEWS NET and FEWS NET partners
    to better

    harness the expertise of agro-climate scientists and food security analysts. This
    spatially distributed

    (African, American, and European) team of experts can provide feedback on the
    relationship between

    ﬁeld observed crop conditions, remotely sensed, and modeled hydro-meteorological
    variables.

    FLDAS’s capacity to use different land models, rainfall, and meteorological inputs
    allows FEWS NET

    to bracket model- and forcing-related uncertainty. FLDAS’ provision of physically
    meaningful

    quantitative information (e.g., runoff) can also be used to better characterize
    hydrologic drought and

    water availability. This is important given that water insecurity may often exacerbate
    food insecurity.

    Finally, this dataset (as highlighted in the Usage Notes section) can be used
    in conjunction with remotely

    sensed estimates e.g., evapotranspiration, to make effective characterizations
    of agricultural drought

    conditions and provide routine drought evaluations. An additional feature of the
    FLDAS is that these data

    can be visualized using the Giovanni online tool10 (http://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/)
    or

    downloaded from the NASA Godard Earth Sciences Data and Information Service Center
    (GES DISC),

    allowing researchers to ask questions and explore FLDAS outputs. Subsets of this
    data can also be

    easily compared with other indicators using the Early Warning eXplorer (http://ewx.chg.ucsb.edu:8080/

    EWX/index.html), and downloaded from the USGS FEWS NET Data Portal (http://earlywarning.usgs.

    gov/fews).

    Figure 1 shows the NASA Land Information System (LIS) framework’s11,12 customized
    instance

    of FLDAS with three main components: (1) meteorological and parameter inputs,
    (2) LSMs, and

    (3) post-processing for evaluation, calculation of drought indices, and archiving
    over three domains in

    Africa. Table 1 provides more speciﬁcs about the FLDAS speciﬁcations. In this
    Data Descriptor’s

    Methods section, we explain in detail the FLDAS LSMs and their parameters, meteorological
    inputs,

    FLDAS model conﬁguration and outputs, and LIS software code availability. The
    Data Records section

    provides details about the FLDAS monthly archive and repository. The Technical
    Validation section

    includes FLDAS comparisons with reference rainfall, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration
    datasets.

    We conclude with Usage Notes, which describes the FLDAS data and the interactive
    NASA Giovanni

    data interface, applied in different ways to assess the 2015–16 Southern Africa
    drought.

    Methods

    Most livelihood systems monitored by FEWS NET are based on subsistence agriculture
    and pastoralism,

    and consequently are vulnerable to hydroclimatic extremes, especially drought.
    For this reason, weekly

    assessments of growing season conditions are made using the latest monitoring
    and weather forecast

    products from NASA, USGS, UCSB CHG and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

    (NOAA). Remote sensing estimates of precipitation, vegetation, and snow are operationally
    ingested by

    USGS and UCSB CHG from NASA and NOAA and used to make a variety of information
    products,

    www.nature.com/sdata/

    SCIENTIFIC DATA | 4:170012 | DOI: 10.1038/sdata.2017.12

    2

    including mapped estimates of anomalous precipitation, vegetation, crop water
    satisfaction, soil moisture,

    snow cover, snow water equivalent, runoff, and stream ﬂow. The FLDAS was created
    to help streamline

    and add consistency to this process. It includes the domains, data streams, and
    monitoring requirements

    associated with food security assessment in data-sparse, developing countries
    in Africa. The goal is to

    make more effective use of limited available hydroclimatic observations through
    the LIS framework’s data

    management and modelling capabilities.

    NASA LIS

    The NASA LIS framework is designed for high performance terrestrial hydrologic
    modelling, with

    development led by the Hydrological Sciences Laboratory at NASA Goddard Space
    Flight Center (GSFC).

    LIS is structured to enable community sharing, the reuse of modelling tools and
    data resources, and

    promote transitioning the latest Earth science research into operations. Speciﬁcally,
    the LIS framework

    includes the Land Data Toolkit preprocessor, the Land Information System core
    modules, and Land

    Veriﬁcation Toolkit post processor. The LIS framework is the software that underpins
    the FLDAS, and,

    similarly, is used in other successful products like the NASA Global Land Data
    Assimilation System

    (GLDAS)4 and the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS)13. As an
    instance of the

    LIS, FLDAS uses speciﬁc features from each of these components, which we will
    explain in more detail.

    The LSMs in FLDAS require a large suite of time-invariant and climatological land
    surface parameters

    such as vegetation, soils and topography, among others (Table 2). The Land Data
    Toolkit (LDT; http://lis.

    gsfc.nasa.gov/documentation/ldt) is a data pre-processing environment for different
    LSMs that enables

    speciﬁcation of these parameters (Fig. 1).

    Routine evaluation of the FLDAS outputs is conducted using the Land Veriﬁcation
    Toolkit (LVT)14

    (Fig. 1), which supports both direct comparisons of the model outputs against
    independent (ground/

    Figure 1. Schematic of the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land

    System (FLDAS). The Land Data Tool Kit (LDT) is used to pre-process FLDAS landcover
    parameters from the

    IGPB and UMD classiﬁcation derived from the MODIS and AVHRR instruments, respectively.
    If required to

    solve energy balance equations, LDT transforms daily RFE2 and CHIRPS rainfall
    into sub-daily inputs for the

    land surface models. Additional meteorological inputs are from GDAS and MERRA-2.
    FLDAS includes

    Noah3.3, VIC4.1.2 and GeoWRSI models, which are run over three domains in Africa,
    and produce estimates

    of hydrologic states like soil moisture (SM) and ﬂuxes like runoff (RO), evapotranspiration
    (ET) and

    streamﬂow. Model outputs are used as inputs to the Land Veriﬁcation Toolkit (LVT)
    for evaluation or

    generation of drought indices. Evaluation includes remotely sensed ET anomalies
    from the Operational

    Simpliﬁed Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model, soil moisture from the European
    Space Agencies Climate

    Change Initiative (CCI-SMv2.2) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
    (NDVI), as well as in-situ

    observations from the Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC). FLDAS routinely computes
    soil moisture

    percentiles, and has capabilities to compute the Standardized Precipitation Index
    (SPI), Standardized Soil

    Water Index (SSWI) and others. Monthly FLDAS outputs are available via the UC
    Santa Barbara Early

    Warning eXplorer (EWX), and different NASA Goddard Earth Science Data and Information
    Services Center

    FLDAS land surface models and parameters

    VIC.

    The Variable Inﬁltration Capacity (VIC)16 spatially distributed macroscale hydrology
    model has

    been widely used at global and regional scales and has been demonstrated to accurately
    capture the

    hydrology of different regimes17–19. The inclusion of VIC version 4.1.2 (VIC4.1.2)
    in the FLDAS was

    intended to promote interactions between research and applications. It is the
    main water balance model

    used by the Princeton Africa Flood and Drought Monitor7 and has been introduced
    to FEWS NET for

    seasonal hydrologic forecasting applications20. In contrast to these applications,
    however, FLDAS uses

    VIC4.1.2 in energy and water balance mode. The purpose of this is to better represent
    surface ﬂuxes in

    environments where evapotranspiration (ET) is a greater proportion of rainfall
    than runoff. The water

    balance simulation mode, run at a daily time step, does not solve the energy balance,
    eliminates the

    ground heat ﬂux solution, and assumes that the surface temperature is equal to
    the air temperature. In

    contrast, the energy and water balance simulation mode, run at a sub-daily time
    step, closes the energy

    balance though an iterative process that adjusts surface temperature and surface
    energy ﬂuxes (sensible

    heat, latent heat, ground heat, outgoing long wave radiation) to balance incoming
    radiation. There is a

    comparison of VIC simulation modes for the Rhine River21 and additional explanation
    and comparisons

    can be found as a technical note on the University of Washington VIC website http://www.hydro.

    washington.edu/Lettenmaier/Models/VIC/Documentation/TechnicalNotes/Modes.shtml.

    Evapotranspiration in VIC4.1.2 (and Noah3.3) includes three components: canopy-intercepted

    evaporation,

    transpiration

    from

    vegetation

    canopies,

    and

    evaporation

    from

    bare

    soil.

    Total

    evapotranspiration is the sum of these components, weighted by respective land
    surface coverage

    fractions.

    In VIC4.1.2, reference ET (RefET) is calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation.
    Canopy

    transpiration is calculated by scaling RefET with canopy resistance. Canopy-intercepted
    evaporation is

    calculated by scaling RefET with the canopy architectural resistance for humidity
    and the aerodynamic

    resistance for heat and water. The bare soil, or direct, evaporation is calculated
    by scaling RefET by

    current soil moisture conditions, wilting point soil moisture, and ﬁeld capacity.

    In VIC4.1.2, the surface runoff is determined by subtracting the precipitation
    and the inﬁltration

    capacity of the top (0–10 cm) soil layer. The subsurface runoff is computed as
    a nonlinear stepwise

    function of excess soil moisture from the bottom soil layer, as ﬁrstly introduced
    in the Arno model

    formulation22.

    VIC4.1.2 parameter inputs (Table 2) include soil textures and bulk density23,
    and soil characteristic

    curve parameters24, monthly climatology leaf area index25, the University of Maryland
    landcover

    Noah.

    The Noah Land Surface Model28 is a four soil-layer water and energy balance LSM.
    It is a widely

    used model by both operational and research communities. For example, Noah is
    the operational LSM in

    the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) weather, climate
    and data

    assimilation systems and at the US Air Force 557th Weather Wing. There are a number
    of examples

    of Noah being used over different domains in Africa, e.g., West Africa29,30, Volta
    Basin31, East Africa32,33

    and coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for West Africa34
    and Kenya35.

    The FLDAS uses the Noah LSM version 3.3 (ref. 36). Later versions of Noah have
    been implemented in

    LIS and may be used in the future if the model physics, or other features are
    determined to improve water

    and energy balance estimates for FEWS NET domains of interest.

    Like VIC4.1.2, Noah3.3’s total evapotranspiration is the sum of canopy intercepted
    water evaporation,

    transpiration from vegetation canopies, and evaporation from bare soil, weighted
    by respective land

    surface coverage fractions. Different from VIC4.1.2, Noah3.3’s potential evapotranspiration
    (PET) is

    calculated using the Penman approach, which assumes saturated ground surface and
    no canopy

    resistance. Transpiration is calculated by scaling PET with solar radiation, vapor
    pressure deﬁcit, air

    temperature and soil moisture. Evaporation of canopy-intercepted water is calculated
    by scaling PET by

    intercepted canopy water content and the maximum canopy capacity. The bare soil
    evaporation is

    calculated by scaling PET by a factor of current soil moisture availability.

    In Noah3.3, Surface runoff is computed using a two-layer conceptual approach developed
    by Schaake

    et al.37 from the Simple Water Balance (SWB) model. The upper layer is a shallow
    bucket that produces

    surface runoff from excess precipitation when there is no soil moisture deﬁcit.
    Subsurface runoff is

    produced as gravitational drainage from the bottom soil layer, which is calculated
    using Darcy’s equation.

    FLDAS-Noah3.3 parameter inputs (Table 2), include the NCEP modiﬁed International
    Global

    Biosphere Project (IGBP)38,39 landcover map from the MODerate resolution Imaging
    Spectrometer

    (MODIS) landcover classiﬁcation, monthly minimum and maximum greenness fraction40,
    and albedo

    maps41. These data, as well as hybrid STATSGO/FAO soil texture data sets, and
    vegetation and soil

    parameters tables are maintained by the Research Application Laboratory (RAL)
    and are available at

    http://www.rap.ucar.edu/research/land/technology/lsm.php.

    Meteorological inputs

    FLDAS models use FEWS NET speciﬁc rainfall products, but also require additional
    meteorological

    inputs (e.g., temperature, humidity, radiation, and wind). To generate low-latency
    products FLDAS uses

    NOAA Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS)42 3-hourly meteorological inputs available
    from

    2001-present ato1-day latency. For a longer historical record FLDAS uses NASA’s
    Modern Era

    Reanalysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2)43 (1979-present)
    1-hourly products with

    a two-week latency.

    Rainfall, as mentioned earlier, and described in detail later, is the most important
    input to the FLDAS.

    Temperature is also particularly important for both the water and energy balance.
    MERRA-2 provides a

    long record, sub-daily time step and has been shown to agree well, in terms of
    daily and annual bias

    (0–1 K) with CRU44 temperature estimates43. We compared monthly MERRA-2, GDAS
    and GLDAS

    temperature estimates (2001–2010, not shown) over our Southern, Eastern and Western
    Africa domains

    and found that all three products are well correlated (r >0.7). However, GDAS
    has a noticeable low bias

    (about 1 K) until ~2007 compared to MERRA-2 and GLDAS temperature ﬁelds. From
    2007-present,

    MERRA-2 and GDAS temperatures continue to be well correlated and have a similar
    mean.

    RFE2.

    The African Rainfall Estimation version 2.0 (refs 5,45) (RFE2) rainfall product
    is from the

    NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC). RFE2 is derived from satellite (infrared
    and microwave)

    observations and blended with World Meteorological Organization Global Telecommunication
    Stations

    (GTS) data. It is available from 2000 to present at 0.1° latitude/longitude (approximately
    10 km2) at a

    1-day latency (Table 3). Examples of RFE2 evaluation have been conducted for Burkina
    Faso46,

    Western Africa47–49, Mozambique50, the Nile Basin51, and Eastern and Southern
    Africa52,53. In addition

    to research applications, FEWS NET analysts use RFE2 operationally to track weather
    hazards on a

    weekly basis. More information is available at the CPC International Desk website
    under ‘Africa’

    (http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/international/africa/africa.shtml).

    CHIRPS.

    The Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS)54 dataset
    is an

    IR-station blended rainfall product that has been bias-corrected with monthly
    station climatologies, i.e.,

    CHPclim55. CHIRPS is available at the daily, pentadal (~5-day), dekadal (~10-day),
    and monthly time

    step, quasi-global (60S-60N), 0.05 degrees spatial resolution (Table 3) designed
    for drought monitoring.

    CHIRPS is released about 2-weeks after then end of the previous month (i.e., August
    1–31 daily CHIRPS

    is available on September 15th). CHIRPS has been evaluated for Burkina Faso46,
    Mozambique50, the Nile

    Basin51, and continental Africa54. On-going evaluations can be found at the UCSB
    Climate Hazards

    Group website (http://chg.ucsb.edu).

    Sub-daily disaggregation of rainfall

    For agricultural drought monitoring applications daily, dekadal, and monthly rainfall
    totals are favoured

    by decision makers56. In contrast, the LSMs that solve both the energy and water
    balance are run at

    hourly or ﬁner time steps (e.g., Noah3.3 at 30-minutes and VIC4.1.2 at 1-hour),
    requiring sub-daily

    rainfall inputs. To meet the needs of these LSMs, we developed a new module using
    the Land Data

    Toolkit (LDT) pre-processor to temporally disaggregate the daily RFE2 and CHIRPS
    rainfall, using an

    approach similar to the North American LDAS (NLDAS) precipitation downscaling
    method57. For this

    approach, we assume that the ﬁner timescale, reference dataset, e.g., 3-hourly
    GDAS precipitation,

    represents an accurate diurnal cycle. First we derive sub-daily (e.g., 3-hourly)
    disaggregation weights that

    represent the proportion of the 24-hour total precipitation that fell during the
    sub-daily period. If the

    total is zero in a area of non-zero precipitation then uniform weighting spreads
    precipitation evenly

    throughout the day. The daily rainfall is then multiplied by the weights to arrive
    at the temporally

    disaggregated ﬁelds. Since the reference dataset is only used to derive the disaggregation
    weights the daily

    summation preserves the total from the daily rainfall product. This new sub-daily
    time series is then used

    as the ﬁnal FLDAS precipitation input. Future work, particularly that involves
    higher spatial and

    temporal applications of FLDAS outputs, should explore the accuracy of the sub-daily
    rainfall

    distribution of a reference dataset.

    FLDAS model conﬁguration and outputs

    Meteorological inputs provided in their native resolution often do not match the
    spatial and temporal

    resolution of other datasets, or the resolution at which the user wishes to run
    the model. One of the

    important features of the LIS framework is its ability to match spatial and temporal
    grids at runtime. We

    have speciﬁed the LIS model spatial resolution to match the 0.1° × 0.1° RFE2 and
    CHIRPS rainfall inputs.

    However, the MERRA-2 has horizontal resolution of 0.5° latitude × 0.625° longitude,
    and the GDAS grid

    varies over time and is currently at approximately 0.2° (Table 3). We have chosen
    a bilinear interpolation

    option in LIS to spatially downscale non-precipitation ﬁelds. Using the method
    developed by the

    NLDAS57, the Noah-GDAS experiments have an environmental lapse-rate correction
    applied to surface

    pressure, humidity and downward longwave radiation. At the time of writing, VIC4.1.2
    and MERRA-2

    experiments did not have this capability. While this introduces some error, the
    implications for the 0.1

    degree Africa domain are relatively minor compared to regions with steep topography
    and ﬁner spatial

    resolution. Future versions of the VIC-GDAS and Noah-MERRA-2 experiments will
    include the

    topographic adjustment. All of the sub-daily inputs are linearly interpolated
    to 30-minute and 1-hour

    model timesteps for Noah3.3 and VIC4.1.2, respectively. Table 4 lists the routine
    FLDAS outputs and

    their units. At the time of writing, both FLDAS_A (RFE2+GDAS; Data Citation 1–6)
    and FLDAS_C

    (CHIRPS+MERRA-2; Data Citation 7–11 and Data Citation 12) outputs are updated
    on the NASA GES

    DISC once a month (see Data Records).

    Soil moisture percentiles

    Soil moisture percentiles are indicators of deﬁcits or excesses of land moisture
    states relative to historical

    distributions. The percentiles are calculated using the Land Veriﬁcation Toolkit
    (LVT)14 using soil

    moisture outputs from Noah3.3 and VIC4.1.2 simulations. First, the soil moisture

    Technical Validation

    Development of high quality hydro-meteorological data sets and conducting evaluations
    of these datasets

    is inherently challenging over data sparse regions. Product development continues
    to improve through

    improved sensors, algorithms and data fusion efforts. For product evaluation FEWS
    NET relies on a

    convergence of evidence approach—the use of multiple inputs, and by transforming
    rainfall inputs into

    estimates of, for example, soil moisture and evapotranspiration. With that, we
    are increasing the

    opportunities for comparison with other products like remotely sensed microwave
    soil moisture and

    remotely sensed thermal-ET. Evaluation is an on-going process as new products
    are developed, and

    different applications require different metrics—e.g., some products may be better
    for drought

    monitoring, while others for ﬂood forecasting.

    Rainfall input evaluation

    In addition to the precipitation evaluations mentioned previously (Methods; Meteorological
    Inputs), we

    compare here RFE2 and CHIRPS (2001–2010) to a reference dataset: the Global Precipitation

    Climatology Centre (GPCC) gridded monthly station product59,60.

    Following the methods in Funk et al.54, metrics are computed on a per-pixel basis
    for the rainy-season

    (deﬁned as the three-wettest months). Using GPCC as the reference dataset, we
    computed the

    Pearson correlation coefﬁcient61, bias ratio (Bias = Σ Input_rainfall/ΣGPCC) and
    mean absolute error

    (MAE = (1/N Σ|(Input_rainfall—GPCC)|)). Figure 2a,b show similar spatial patterns
    and magnitude for

    CHIRPS and RFE’s correlation with GPCC. RFE2 has higher correlations in southern
    and western Africa,

    while CHIRPS shows higher correlations in Ethiopia. Figure 2c,d show bias ratio,
    with CHIRPS tending

    to have a neutral or wet bias compared to GPCC, while RFE2 has a dry bias over
    eastern Africa and a wet

    bias over parts of the Sahel. Figure 2e,f show similar patterns in mean absolute
    error (mm per 3-month

    accumulation), with CHIRPS having less error in Ethiopia, and parts of Kenya,
    Tanzania, Mozambique,

    Zambia, and Niger. While RFE2 has less error in eastern South Africa and Zimbabwe,
    correlations tend to

    be lower over the humid forests of central Africa, which is important for broader
    applications, but this is

    not a domain included in routine FEWS NET drought monitoring. This lower correlation
    may be due to

    CHIRPS being an IR-only (no routine microwave inputs) product, a necessary prerequisite
    for its long

    period of record. The ﬁxed cloud detection threshold used in the CHIRPS might
    be another factor,

    resulting in poor detection of warm rainfall events in humid areas of the tropics
    and sub-tropics.

    Soil moisture and evapotranspiration validation results

    We compared monthly estimates of FLDAS-simulated soil moisture and evapotranspiration
    to equivalent

    remotely sensed observations using pixel-wise anomaly correlation.

    For the soil moisture comparison we used the European Space Agency’s Climate Change
    Initiative soil

    moisture version 2.2 (CCI-SMv2.2)62–64, which is a merged passive and active microwave
    estimate of

    near-surface soil moisture (1979–2015). In general, we ﬁnd that soil moisture
    estimates derived from

    CHIRPS (using either Noah3.3 or VIC4.1.2) have higher monthly anomaly correlation
    with CCI-SMv2.2

    than those derived from RFE2 rainfall inputs. The reason for this will require
    further research, but we

    hypothesize that the cause is related to the use of country-speciﬁc station data
    for bias correction in

    CHIRPS while no such station data is used in RFE2. We also found that Noah3.3
    soil moisture has higher

    correlations with CCI-SMv2.2 than that of VIC4.1.2. These results are consistent
    with previous work over

    East Africa by McNally et al.65, and work comparing Noah and VIC in the U.S. (ref.
    66). We also

    stratiﬁed correlations by vegetation type, and found particularly low correlations
    in pixels classiﬁed as

    permanent wetland. This can be attributed to microwave soil moisture retrievals’
    ability to detect

    persistent wetness, while wetlands are not represented in FLDAS models. Figure
    3a–c show anomaly

    correlations between monthly Noah3.3+CHIRPS+MERRA-2 soil moisture (0–10 cm) and
    CCI-SMv2.2

    soil moisture for the years 1992–2015. We used this time period based on analysis
    performed in East

    Africa by McNally et al.65 Considering all months (Jan-Dec) Eastern and Southern
    Africa are well

    correlated (r > 0.5) while correlation is less (r = 0.3–0.5) in Western Africa.
    We found that the modeled

    and observed seasonal cycles (start of season, peak, recession) were sometimes
    out-of-phase, likely because,

    as other studies have found, the default Noah LSM soil parameterization is not
    optimal for representing

    runoff and soil moisture dynamics in West Africa34. Data users should note that
    we found improved

    correlations when the analysis is conducted on individual months, particularly
    during the rainy season.

    For ET evaluations we used ET anomaly estimates from the Operational Simpliﬁed
    Surface Energy

    Balance67 (SSEBop) model. The SSEBop product provides percent of normal (PON)
    ET anomalies using a

    2003–2013 baseline and is updated once a month, which is important for routine
    comparisons with

    FLDAS. Using the same 10-year baseline, we computed the PON for each month with
    the FLDAS ET

    products and then performed pixel-wise anomaly correlation. We show anomaly correlations
    of the

    Noah3.3+CHIRPS+MERRA-2 estimated ET. There are moderate correlations (r = 0.4–0.75)
    in East

    and (c) Western Africa

    domains. Regions with no vegetation are masked in the FLDAS estimates, and regions
    with dense vegetation

    are masked in the CCI-SMv2.2.

    Africa (Fig. 4a) and Southern Africa (Fig. 4b), however, in West Africa correlations
    between these two

    products were relatively low (ro0.5) (Fig. 4c). Similar correlations were found
    with VIC ET anomalies.

    For further investigation we computed 1-month lagged rank correlation of FLDAS
    ET’s and MODIS

    NDVI (not shown) and found high correlations (r > 0.7) for vegetated pixels. Inspection
    of the SSEBop

    time series at sparsely vegetated pixels in Niger and Senegal showed ‘jumpy’ behaviour
    (e.g., long periods

    at 100% of normal with spikes to 250%), suggesting that energy balance characteristics
    of parts of the

    West Africa domain may result in instability of SSEBop PON algorithm. Similar
    to the soil moisture

    comparisons, correlations for individual months tended to be higher during the
    rainy season

    (not shown). Additional investigation is needed to further explain the contribution
    of both the LSM

    model physics and SSEBop datasets to low correlations in West Africa.

    compute a variety of drought indicators make FLDAS suitable for assessing agricultural
    and hydrologic

    drought conditions. We demonstrate how FLDAS can be used to support humanitarian
    relief efforts and

    put current water availability conditions in historic context. Southern Africa
    is known to be vulnerable to

    El Niño-induced hot and dry conditions68. Two consecutive dry years are threatening
    hydropower and

    irrigation schemes that have been critical for advancing development in the region69.
    CHIRPS rainfall and

    FLDAS-derived estimates of water availability anomalies have been used to illustrate
    the extent and

    severity of the Southern Africa 2015–16 drought1. In this sample application of
    FLDAS we

    i) compare how remotely sensed and modeled ET anomalies represent the extent of
    the drought in

    February 2016; ii) compare the FEWS NET operational drought index with soil moisture
    percentiles

    derived from FLDAS; iii) show how FLDAS experiments represent water availability
    over short and long

    time scales; and iv) show how FLDAS outputs can be accessed via GIOVANNI for user-friendly
    data

    interaction.

    Context—2015–2016 Southern Africa drought

    Southern Africa relies on agriculture for food and income and reservoirs for hydropower
    production,

    municipal water supplies, and irrigation. The strong El Niño conditions in 2015
    resulted in a late start to

    the Southern Africa rainy season, high temperatures, and below average rainfall
    totals. These severe

    drought conditions across the region negatively impacted crop and pasture growth1.
    While not an El

    Niño year, the 2014–15 season was characterized by anomalous dryness with low
    seasonal rainfall totals

    that negatively impacted crop growth and reservoir storage70.

    Comparison with operational ET estimates

    First, we compare SSEBop and FLDAS ET anomalies (Data Citation 8) for February
    2016 (Fig. 5). The

    broad spatial patterns from the two products agree in the extent and severity
    of the dry conditions. Both

    ET anomaly estimates show strong ET deﬁcits in central South Africa, Swaziland,
    Lesotho, southern

    Mozambique, southern Madagascar, south east Zambia, and western Botswana. Both
    estimates also show

    normal or above normal ET in Northern Mozambique, Tanzania, and southern Kenya.
    Given that these

    ET anomalies are derived from independent estimates, analysts can have conﬁdence
    in the direction of

    the anomaly in locations where the products agree, consistent with FEWS NET’s
    convergence of evidence

    approach. However, the two estimates do not agree in all locations. Eastern Botswana,
    for example, is a

    crop-growing region where SSEBop shows strong deﬁcits while FLDAS ET shows positive
    anomalies. In

    this case, analysts would consider additional sources of evidence, like NDVI,
    rainfall totals, and ﬁeld

    reports. For example, the GEOGLAM Early Warning Crop Monitor, which convenes international

    experts to discuss different data sources, concluded in a February report that
    sorghum growing

    conditions were poor in Eastern Botswana71. Positive anomalies in FLDAS ET could
    be attributed to

    errors in rainfall inputs, or the ET parameterization’s relative lack of sensitivity
    to temperature inputs.

    Future work could use both of these datasets to explore the relative roles of
    temperature and rainfall in

    drought.

    Rainfall derived agricultural drought indicators

    We next show two agricultural drought indictors, derived from rainfall, that provide
    insight into the

    overall performance of the 2015/16 growing season. First, 2016 End-of-Season (EOS)
    Water Requirement

    Satisfaction Index (WRSI) (Fig. 6a), computed with CHIRPS rainfall and USGS EROS
    reference ET72,

    where actual ET was consistently less than reference ET, indicating that there
    was widespread failure or

    no start of season across Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Southern Mozambique.
    The late or

    complete lack of start to the rainy season was anticipated to (and did) have severe
    negative consequences

    for agricultural outcomes70. Figure 6b is a drought classiﬁcation based on February
    Noah3.3+CHIRPS

    and was computed with

    drought is 20–30th

    percentile, abnormally dry is 30–45th percentile, normal is > the 45th percentile.

    conditions for at least

    2 years, which is impacting reservoir water supplies.

    Africa, southern Madagascar, Swaziland, and southern Malawi. February soil moisture
    percentiles,

    however, also reﬂect that Southern Africa monthly rainfall totals were average
    for January and February.

    The EOS WRSI metric, on the other hand, is designed to reﬂect deﬁcits during critical
    periods, like the

    crop sowing period in December, which was very dry. These differences in the seasonal
    representation

    explain why the EOS WRSI and February soil moisture percentiles show different
    spatial patterns, despite

    being driven by the same rainfall inputs.

    Water availability

    To characterize water availability during the Southern Africa 2015–16 drought
    we compute the

    Standardized Runoff Index (SRI)73 with FLDAS runoff. The SRI is calculated by
    ﬁrst ﬁtting a gamma

    distribution to a given historical time series of runoff (the historical time
    series at each pixel). Probability

    values are then calculated from the gamma distribution function for each value
    in the time series. Finally,

    the SRI for each probability value is computed (using SciPy stats.norm.ppf) as
    the inverse cumulative

    distribution function of a standard normal distribution. The SRI values obtained
    will approximately have

    zero mean and unit standard deviation. The one-month SRI-1 considers conditions
    of the current month

    (April 2016) while the 24-month SRI categorizes conditions for the current and
    previous 23 months. The

    map of one-month SRI (Fig. 7a) indicates that runoff is 0.5 to 3 deviations below
    average across much of

    the domain. The one-month time scale is relevant to the growing season of a rainfed
    crop and has a

    spatial pattern as similar to the evapotranspiration anomalies, drought classiﬁcation
    based on soil

    moisture percentiles, and the WRSI. Water supply reservoirs, on the other hand,
    are designed to store

    water between rainy seasons to provide stable supply for different uses such as
    irrigation, hydropower,

    and municipal uses like drinking and sanitation. A longer-term index is more appropriate
    for

    characterizing how these needs may be impacted by (hydrological) drought. The
    24-month SRI (Fig. 7b)

    shows that water reserves were likely impacted in Lesotho, Swaziland, South Africa,
    central and northern

    Lake Kariba

    Maputo Basin

    runoff

    show that 2015 is at or near record low levels experienced in 2004–05 and 1994–95.
    The RFE2+GDAS forced

    runs also shows low runoff in 2015 despite its relatively short record (2001-present)
    with respect to the

    24-month integration period.

    Mozambique, as well as Malawi and Zimbabwe. This interpretation of the SRI-24
    corresponds well with

    reported74 extremely low reservoir levels across the region.

    Time series of SRI-24, spatially averaged over the Zambezi basin above the Kariba
    reservoir (Fig. 8a)

    (west of 28.76 E) and the Maputo Basin, shared by Swaziland, South Africa and
    Mozambique (Fig. 8b),

    further demonstrates that 2015–16 ranks as one of the lowest runoff years in the
    past 30 years,

    comparable to severe droughts in 1994–95 and 2004–05. These time series also demonstrate
    the utility of

    FLDAS multiple-model and multiple-forcing features. In general the Noah3.3 and
    VIC4.1.2 runoff

    generated from the same forcings strongly agree (Fig. 8a,b) suggesting, for relative
    comparisons of runoff

    based drought indicators in this region, that model differences contribute negligible
    uncertainty.

    However, differences in the forcings, can result in considerable differences in
    SRI both from contributing

    data (e.g., CHIRPS has more ground observations and bias correction, RFE2 includes
    microwave

    retrievals) as well as the length of the record. For example, the RFE2+GDAS record
    does not include the

    1994–95 drought. Caution should also be used with aggregating over 24-months with
    the relatively short

    2001–2016 record. With respect to forcing data, continued evaluation, e.g., with
    respect to streamﬂow

    observations, can provide information regarding the accuracy of the input datasets.

    Data visualization with NASA’s Giovanni

    The NASA GES DISC provides tools for data exploration and visualization through
    the Giovanni

    interface (Fig. 9a). This allows users to explore the data before downloading
    and analysing on their own

    machines. This example selects rainfall and air temperature from a domain in Southern
    Africa (Fig. 9b)

    that was impacted by the 2015–16 drought. We selected a spatial average and time
    series of December

    conditions from 1982–2015. Plots can be generated and downloaded as image ﬁles
    (for example, .png,

    .jpeg, or .pdf) for individual variables, or the data from the plot can be downloaded
    and imported into a

    program of the user’s choice. Figure 10 shows a drought index (rainfall—temperature)
    plotted in rank

    order to visualize agrometerological conditions during the critical month of December
    (1982–2015). 2015

    had the combined hottest and driest conditions on record, while 2007 had the combined
    coolest and

    wettest conditions.

    Summary

    The FLDAS dataset presented here has been designed for drought monitoring in Africa
    where it is

    essential to (1) compare different modelled and remotely sensed datasets for accurate
    characterization of

    droughts, and (2) place current conditions in historical context for humanitarian
    decision support. While

    similar to other global land modelling or Africa drought monitoring systems, the
    FLDAS uses operational

    (RFE2) and research (CHIRPS) FEWS NET precipitation products to provide both low
    latency and

    research quality estimates, respectively. Meanwhile, choice of evaluation methods
    and derived drought

    indices are guided by the needs of food and water security analysts. Moreover,
    being an instance of the

    NASA LIS framework affords the potential to leverage other hydrological research
    and software

    development projects. In particular, soil moisture data assimilation and seasonal
    forecasting capabilities

    are being developed for several LIS-based projects that may beneﬁt FLDAS in the
    future. While

    improvements to FLDAS are already being made, e.g., improved latency to better
    track conditions as they

    are evolving, the current data products are well suited for characterizing the
    spatial extent and providing

    historical context to drought conditions.

    10 July 2015 PDF Split View Cite Permissions Share Abstract Plants are affected
    by complex genome×environment×management interactions which determine phenotypic
    plasticity as a result of the variability of genetic components. Whereas great
    advances have been made in the cost-efficient and high-throughput analyses of
    genetic information and non-invasive phenotyping, the large-scale analyses of
    the underlying physiological mechanisms lag behind. The external phenotype is
    determined by the sum of the complex interactions of metabolic pathways and intracellular
    regulatory networks that is reflected in an internal, physiological, and biochemical
    phenotype. These various scales of dynamic physiological responses need to be
    considered, and genotyping and external phenotyping should be linked to the physiology
    at the cellular and tissue level. A high-dimensional physiological phenotyping
    across scales is needed that integrates the precise characterization of the internal
    phenotype into high-throughput phenotyping of whole plants and canopies. By this
    means, complex traits can be broken down into individual components of physiological
    traits. Since the higher resolution of physiological phenotyping by ‘wet chemistry’
    is inherently limited in throughput, high-throughput non-invasive phenotyping
    needs to be validated and verified across scales to be used as proxy for the underlying
    processes. Armed with this interdisciplinary and multidimensional phenomics approach,
    plant physiology, non-invasive phenotyping, and functional genomics will complement
    each other, ultimately enabling the in silico assessment of responses under defined
    environments with advanced crop models. This will allow generation of robust physiological
    predictors also for complex traits to bridge the knowledge gap between genotype
    and phenotype for applications in breeding, precision farming, and basic research.

    high-dimensional physiological phenotyping data Agriculture and the closely related
    field of applied plant science research face tremendous challenges in the future
    to feed the world population. The global population is expected to increase from
    ~6 billion in 2000 to >13 billion in 2100 (Tester and Langridge, 2010). In addition,
    as a consequence of global climate change, crop production is already now more
    frequently exposed to extreme weather, faces limited availability of water and
    nutrient resources, and will be restricted in tropical and subtropical regions
    by a decrease of the arable land area, estimated to be reduced by up to 21% of
    the currently available area (Zhang and Cai, 2011). In particular, drought and
    increased salinization of arable land could result in a 50% land loss by the year
    2050 in certain regions (Wang et al., 2003). Thus agriculture requires a second
    green revolution to accelerate breeding of novel climate-resilient varieties that
    satisfy the rising demand for food and the increased competition for crops as
    sources of bioenergy and fibre, and for other industrial purposes. The current
    use of the word ‘phenome’ refers to the phenotype as a whole (Soulé, 1967). The
    plant phenome is determined by the genome (G), environmental conditions (E), and
    their complex dynamic interactions (G×E) (Houle et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2014).
    Crop management (M) is an additional determinant of the phenotype. Thus, a plant
    phenotype in a specific agricultural system has finally to be considered as the
    result of the complex G×E×M interactions (Porter and Christensen, 2013) which
    are depicted in Fig. 1. Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of an organism to
    change its phenotype in response to changes in the environment, which is important
    in particular for sessile organisms such as plants. Thus fundamentally, the phenotype
    of an organism is a manifestation of a genotype’s interaction with the environment.
    The central challenge of modern genetic analysis is to understand the biological
    determinants of quantitative phenotypic variation. Understanding and exploiting
    this phenotypic plasticity in plant breeding thus is both challenging and important,
    in particular with crop plants being more frequently affected by extreme fluctuations
    in abiotic conditions due to global climate change. A compromise is needed between
    increasing the yield optimum while maintaining the yield stability. Fig. 1. Open
    in new tabDownload slide Schematic illustration of phenotypic plasticity, which
    describes the impact of the multifactorial environment (E) such as various abiotic
    and biotic parameters and management strategies (M) on alternative phenotypes
    derived from a constant genotype (G), represented by the response to a specific
    external signal. Common responses in the phenotype can thereby be used as robust
    external predictors of specific internal processes or states. The term ‘phenomics’
    was introduced in 1997 (Schork, 1997) and was defined in analogy to genomics—and
    the many other ‘omics’ technologies—as the systematic study of phenotypes at an
    organism-wide scale (Houle et al., 2010). Thus phenomics refers to the characterization
    of phenotypes via the acquisition of high-dimensional phenotypic data (Houle et
    al., 2010). With the establishment of non-invasive methods for plant phenotyping
    and their high-throughput application in large-scale, automated facilities since
    2009 (Finkel, 2009), phenomic technologies are applied in basic plant research
    and crop plant breeding, and are expected to relieve, in particular, the phenotyping
    bottleneck in breeding (Furbank and Tester, 2011). Whereas high-throughput phenotyping
    techniques were originally developed for controlled environments, their application
    in in-field phenotyping is receiving increasing attention (Araus and Cairns, 2014;
    Langridge and Reynolds, 2015). However, although phenomics is defined in analogy
    to genomics to progress towards the full characterization of the complete set
    of phenotypes of a genome, the analogy is misleading and this ultimate goal will
    remain hypothetical and elusive since phenotypes vary from cell to cell and from
    moment to moment, and therefore can never be completely characterized. This fact
    applies in particular to plants with a phenome that is greatly influenced by external
    factors through the G×E×M interactions. Therefore phenomics will always need to
    involve prioritizing what to measure and a balance between exploratory and explanatory
    goals. The plant phenotype is the set of structural, physiological, and performance-related
    traits of a genotype in a given environment. Thus phenotyping systems not only
    comprise the tools to perform phenotyping itself, but also comprise the means
    to grow plants in a certain environment, ranging widely from strictly controlled
    conditions in climate chambers to the natural environment in the field. Phenotyping
    systems can be described by the terms of throughput, resolution, and dimensionality
    (Dhont et al., 2013). In plant phenotyping systems, the throughput refers to the
    number of individual units at particular organizational levels within plants,
    or at the plant or canopy level, that can be analysed for a particular set of
    traits at a given time. High-throughput refers to automatized, non-invasive phenotyping
    systems that have a high capacity with respect to standardized data acquisition,
    processing, visualization, and feeding into integrated databases. The spatial
    resolution describes the level of separation of plants or plant organs, tissues,
    and cells into their elementary or organizational units used for the measurement
    of the plant trait, thus spanning the range from cell wall and plastids to the
    field. The temporal resolution indicates the separation into elementary time periods
    significant for plant processes and used for the measurement of plant traits,
    spanning seconds (e.g. stomatal conductance) to weeks and months (e.g. yield).
    Finally, dimensionality in plant phenotyping refers to the diversity of phenotypic
    traits measured at different spatial and temporal resolutions and in different
    categories, such as plant structure, physiology, and performance. In phenomics,
    dimensionality additionally includes the number of genotypes and the diversity
    of environmental conditions. Sequencing of multiple plant genotypes, novel genetic
    approaches, and advanced bioinformatics has given plant science researchers and
    breeders a variety of new tools to understand the molecular mechanisms and the
    underlying genetics. In the past decade, new cameras, sensors, and automatic mechanical
    devices such as drones (unmanned airborne vehicles, UAVs) have created unprecedented
    opportunities for fast, accurate, and precise non-destructive phenotyping of morphological
    and physical properties at the whole-plant and canopy level. To interpret high-dimensional
    phenotypic data, especially when they not only address morphological or growth
    parameters but also consider spatial and temporal dynamics of physiological data,
    a conceptual framework is needed. The concept of a genotype–phenotype map (Burns,
    1970; Gjuvsland et al., 2013) is a widely used metaphor for the multiple ways
    in which genomics information influences the phenotype of an organism (Houle et
    al., 2010). In this concept, the interaction of the genomic information (G) with
    external parameters (E, M) creates the internal phenotypic state that includes
    cellular, tissue, and physiological properties (Fig. 2). These internal phenotypes
    in turn shape the external phenotypes that can be more easily measured with high-throughput
    non-invasive techniques. Such a genotype–phenotype map is inaccessible without
    the detailed phenotypic data that allow these interactions to be studied. Despite
    great research efforts, a key challenge remains in narrowing down the knowledge
    gap between the genomic information and the apparent, external phenotype for complex
    traits. Such an example is the effort to breed drought-tolerant crop varieties;
    despite 20 years of worldwide research, the knowledge gap is still considered
    as far from being filled (Tuberosa et al., 2014). Fig. 2. Open in new tabDownload
    slide The position of physiology in integrating genotype, environment, management,
    and their intense interactions (G×E×M), which determines the internal phenotype
    as a link between the genotype and external phenotype. Physiology is therein a
    key interface between the genome and the plant phenotype which comprises multiple
    levels of information processing via the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome,
    as well as regulatory events. Correlation of the physiological status as the internal
    phenotype with the genetic background and external phenotypes can feed in to modelling
    approaches of cellular pathways and whole-plant models, allowing the identification
    and establishment of robust, external predictors. Such predictors can be used
    in practical applications of precision agriculture to change management services
    or as markers for breeding. The plant phenotyping methods applied currently to
    characterize plant phenomes still lag greatly behind our ability to characterize
    genomes. Although the measurement of physiological components has been recognized
    as being essential to predict gene-to-phenotype relationships (Yin et al., 2004;
    Dhont et al., 2013) and for crop improvement (Ghanem et al., 2015), and phenomics
    have even been suggested to be described as ‘high-throughput plant physiology’
    (Furbank and Tester, 2011), most of the currently used high-throughput approaches
    still focus on the external phenotype and, if at all, typically only indirectly
    assess physiological processes. However, cellular physiology forms a key interface
    between genotype and phenotype, describing the functioning of processes such as
    metabolic pathways and regulatory networks (Fig. 2). Notably, at the physiological
    level, the various abiotic and biotic factors of the multifactorial environment
    are integrated into the cellular responses that ultimately determine the quantitative
    and qualitative traits at the tissue, organ, and whole organism level. These processes
    can be monitored as an internal phenotype via physiological and biochemical parameters
    that ultimately determine the external phenotype, but the ability to increase
    the resolution is inherently limited by throughput. There is currently no common
    understanding in the generic use of the term ‘physiological phenotyping’. Despite
    the agreement on the importance of a physiological phenotyping approach in general,
    it will be important to consider and define the aspects of throughput, resolution,
    and dimensionality. Therefore, this opinion paper explores the need for implementation
    of physiological phenotyping into a holistic multidimensional phenomics approach
    across the scales, ranging from the cellular and organ level to whole plants and
    canopies, with particular implications on the methods still needed and already
    applied. This concept should be helpful to dissect complex phenotypic traits into
    specific physiological traits and should also contribute to understanding the
    mechanisms involved in the determination of phenotypic plasticity in a complex
    multifactorial environment. Current status and focus of non-invasive phenotyping
    To explore the current status of physiological phenotyping, the widely applied
    non-invasive phenotyping methods are discussed here. A number of reviews about
    the status and technique of phenotyping roots and the canopy in greenhouses, semi-field,
    and field have been published recently (Furbank and Tester, 2011; Fiorani et al.,
    2012; Fiorani and Schurr, 2013; Araus and Cairns, 2014; Li et al., 2014). Thus,
    only a brief general overview of currently applied and advanced technologies for
    remote sensing and non-destructive phenotyping is given, and summarized in Table
    1. The technologies are classified based on their dimensionality, measured variables,
    traits, and system limitations in general, and their potential is discussed for
    a multidimensional approach that also addresses the quantification of physiological
    parameters to describe plant functions. Table 1.Current technologies for the determination

    phenotyping based on non-destructive measurements in greenhouses and growth chambers
    are now operating at different institutions around the world (Furbank and Tester,
    2011; Fiorani and Schurr, 2013; Araus and Cairns, 2014; Chen et al., 2014; Li
    et al., 2014; Neilson et al., 2015) where large-scale testing of plant genotypes
    under different controlled environments and treatments is carried out. What is
    common for the testing facilities though is that experimental protocols often
    are limited to rosette plants and the main cereal species (Li et al., 2014; Neilson
    et al., 2015). However, newer studies such as that of Neilson et al. (2015) are
    focusing on expanding such protocols to include a larger range of crop species.
    Under field conditions, the approach of non-destructive high-throughput phenotyping
    is undergoing much research, with testing of different technologies and platforms
    (Comar et al., 2012; Busemeyer et al., 2013; Andrade-Sanchez et al., 2014). The
    challenge here is that field agro-ecosystems are complex with respect to phenology
    and physiology due to multiple biotic and abiotic factors. Therefore, it is notoriously
    difficult to implement systems for high-throughput phenotyping in field experiments,
    and a multidimensional approach is necessary (Araus and Cairns, 2014). Nevertheless,
    non-invasive sensor-based phenotyping is successfully integrated into physiological
    breeding programmes (Pask et al., 2012; Reynolds et al., 2012). Clearly, technological
    development has enabled the embedding of a large range of sensors and imaging
    systems to allow non-destructive proximal sensing of plants either as individuals
    or in populations. The most commonly applied sensor and imaging techniques are
    digital RGB (red–green–blue) imaging, spectroscopy, thermography, fluorescence,
    3D, by, for example, stereo cameras and LIDAR (light detection and ranging), real-time
    camera set-ups, and, to a lesser extent, tomography. All technologies listed in
    Table 1 have the potential for high-resolution sensing and imaging, enabling a
    multidimensional approach towards non-invasive phenotyping (Li et al., 2014).
    RGB imaging RGB imaging, based on visible light, is a relevant tool for morphological
    studies of plants from shoot emergence until the ground area is covered by the
    canopy. These tools possess very limited possibilities for studying physiological
    processes based on leaf and canopy biochemistry. RGB set-ups have been applied
    in several studies in greenhouses in 2D (Granier et al., 2006; Arvidsson et al.,
    2011; Golzarian et al., 2011) and 3D (Paproki et al., 2012), and in field experiments
    as proximal sensing (Bojacá et al., 2011; Hoyos-Villegas et al., 2014) and remote
    sensing from UAVs (Bendig et al., 2014). Also approaches to study roots under
    field conditions have utilized simple RGB camera techniques (Kristensen and Thorup-Kristensen,
    2004). Due to limitations of RGB systems, the focus in these studies has been
    restricted to imaging morphological traits related to yield, and only limited
    measurements of physiological processes with other systems have been included.
    Multispectral imaging Multispectral imaging includes the near-infrared range of
    the light spectrum and enables a more detailed analysis of plant and leaf biochemistry
    such as the composition of important pigments (e.g. chlorophyll and carotenoids)
    and water content in leaves, and to calculate a range of vegetation indices (VIs).
    Multispectral sensors and imaging systems have been utilized for these different
    purposes of calculating and evaluating specific indices in field experiments related
    to water content in leaves (Seelig et al., 2008; Gutierrez et al., 2010), evaluations
    of simple VIs to quantify biomass and nitrogen (Mistele and Schmidhalter 2008a,
    b; Cabrera-Bosquet et al., 2011; Svensgaard et al., 2014), and UAVs for plant
    stress detection (Berni et al., 2009, Rossini et al., 2013). Multispectral systems
    have inherent limitations due to the discrete spectral information that is measured,
    which limits the possibility to make complex studies of leaf and canopy biochemistry.
    Hyperspectral imaging Hyperspectral imaging includes the continuous spectrum in
    the entire visible and near-infrared region, and thus serves to make more complex
    studies of specific types of pigmentation, water, biochemical compositions, and
    VIs. Advanced multivariate statistics can be applied to study the continuous spectrum
    in these cases, thus potentially providing more information on crop physiology
    compared with multispectral set-ups. Hyperspectral imaging has been used in studies
    detecting plant diseases in both greenhouses and the field, which was extensively
    reviewed by Bock et al. (2010), and has more generally been applied in studies
    of biochemistry, quality, and yield of crops, as reviewed by Dale et al. (2013).
    Generally the spectral reflectance is greatly affected by illumination and canopy
    structure, and these types of measurements should be coupled with other sensor
    or imaging systems, or with physiological approaches (Berger et al., 2010). In
    outdoor conditions, the wind in particular and the background influence the optimal
    signal-to-noise ratio when measuring (Jones and Vaughan, 2010), and, especially
    in the case of hyperspectral imaging, data load as well as complexity in data
    analysis are also challenging factors (Fiorani and Schurr, 2013). Thermal imaging
    Thermal imaging has shown promising potential for studying surface temperatures
    at either the canopy or leaf level correlated to stomatal conductance, and can
    therefore be used to study plant stress such as drought in field plots with maize
    (Berni et al., 2009; Araus et al., 2012), and generally for stress responses induced
    by plant pathogens or salinity (Costa et al., 2013). Despite the rapid measurement
    of the indirect plant status of transpiration, thermal imaging is challenging,
    as the background temperature of soil, air temperature, wind, and humidity, as
    well as physiological changes, will influence canopy and leaf temperature measurements
    within short time frames; therefore, rigorous protocols for measurements as well
    as calibrations for background noise are crucial (Berni et al., 2009; Costa et
    al., 2013). Fluorescence imaging Fluorescence imaging can be a powerful tool to
    study plant stress. Chlorophyll fluorescence is linked to the photosynthetic apparatus
    and thus such measurements can serve to monitor and quantify how plants and leaves
    respond to biotic and abiotic stress. Fluorescence can be used to study simple
    chlorophyll emission, to assess photosystem II activity via pulse amplitude-modulated
    (PAM) fluorescence using saturating light pulses, or in measuring protocols using
    sun-induced fluorescence (Meroni et al., 2009; Gorbe and Calatayud, 2013). Fluorescence
    imaging has also been used in controlled conditions to study drought stress responses
    (Woo et al., 2008; Jansen et al., 2009) or fungal pathogen development in sugar
    beet (Chaerle et al., 2007). In field systems, solar-induced fluorescence imaging
    has been applied to UAV phenotyping for studies of fungal pathogens in olive trees
    (Calderon et al., 2013). Fluorescence imaging has similar inherent limitations
    to those for spectral imaging with regards to deep complex canopy structures,
    and are also affected by the available illumination, morphology, and wind under
    outdoor conditions. 3D reconstructions by lasers, stereo cameras, and time of
    flight cameras Generally, 2D imaging systems, whether based on RGB, multi/hyperspectral,
    thermal, or fluorescence principles, are inherently limited for studies of canopies
    due to the lack of deep structural information and the influence of plant structure
    in general. Therefore, 3D systems are implemented in field experiments to estimate
    biomass structures and plant height either as single sensor set-ups (Eitel et
    al., 2014), in simple multisensory set-ups (Thomsen and Schelde, 2010), or in
    advanced multisensory set-ups (Busemeyer et al., 2013; Deery et al., 2014). In
    controlled environments, 3D systems are used to make more detailed studies of
    plant morphology such as leaf angles and leaf surface (Kempthorne et al., 2015),
    and overall growth rates (Pengelly et al., 2010). There are general limitations
    to all types of 3D laser and imaging systems, such as plant movement and sun illumination
    under outdoor conditions, which can be controlled indoors. Also modelling and
    data processing are challenging when working with 3D imaging (Li et al., 2014).
    Tomography Tomography, such as X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems,
    is a technology under development for plant phenotyping, and is suitable to study
    internal structures of plants, roots, and soils (Li et al., 2014), and MRI also
    has great potential for studying dynamics of metabolites (Borisjuk et al., 2012).
    Despite the potential especially for root studies, tomography has to undergo a
    great deal of development to improve the signal-to-noise ratio due to non-root
    elements affecting measurements. Radiation from X-rays may also have a negative
    effect on the root itself. Finally, the technology itself cannot be considered
    high throughput due to the advanced imaging and analysis (Fiorani and Schurr,
    2013). In general, these new technologies are individually suitable for specific
    phenotypic measurements and may therefore serve relatively few purposes if used
    in single sensor set-ups, which therefore limits the overall phenological and
    physiological dimensionality (Chen et al., 2014), as also illustrated in Table
    1. Most of the available techniques described above are characterized by a high
    throughput, but the information about physiological processes is typically only
    indirectly assessed. Thus, only conclusions about the general physiological state
    will be possible. Integration of multiscale physiological phenotyping into a phenomics
    approach A range of non-invasive phenotyping methods, as described above, proved
    to be valuable in the functional characterization of genomic information both
    in controlled environments and under field conditions. However, the current application
    and evaluation of non-invasive phenotyping provides only a snapshot of an external
    phenotype at a certain time and within certain environmental conditions, typically
    only at the whole-plant or canopy level. Although the ultimate goal of whole-phenome
    analyses can never be completely achieved, an approximation is the gathering of
    multidimensional phenotypic data across temporal and spatial scales through a
    genuine physiological phenotyping approach. This approach will reverse the current
    development in basic science research to carry out more specialized research at
    smaller scales to an approach that links the various ‘omics’ approaches to agronomy
    and organismic biology. The simplest justification for phenomics is that the characteristics
    of organisms of greatest interest to most biologists and agronomists are phenotypes
    rather than genotypes. This is particularly relevant for applied plant science
    research since the final goals of any plant breeding programme are quantitative
    and qualitative trait phenotypes, with yield quality and stability being the most
    relevant traits. For practical applications in breeding, robust physiological
    traits are required that ideally allow us to recognize predispositions and provide
    the possibility for predictions and extrapolations at early developmental stages,
    which will allow integration of initial larger populations in screening programmes.
    Mapping the internal phenotype and phenotypic plasticity by physiological phenotyping
    Plant phenotypes are inherently complex since plants are, due to their sessile
    lifestyle, exposed to a constantly changing, multifactorial environment. They
    are unable to avoid the interaction and can only react to the wide range of biotic
    and abiotic factors at the level of physiology and through the synthesis of defence-
    or stress-related compounds. Traditionally plant physiologists cannot afford to
    carry out detailed experiments on complex traits with many genotypes, whereas
    geneticists working with many genotypes cannot afford to go into much physiological
    detail. Therefore, so far, phenotyping has been mostly concerned with mapping
    the external phenotype using a limited set of biophysical methods to assess physiological
    parameters mostly indirectly. The plant phenotype is determined by the complex
    interaction of the genetic information (G) with the multifactorial, abiotic and
    biotic environment (E), and, in the case of crop plants, an agricultural management
    regime (M) that modifies the environment in a defined way, including the applications
    of fertilizers, irrigation, and pest and weed control (Fig. 1). The key steps
    of the expression of the information encoded in the genome are the transcription
    into RNA (transcriptome) and translation into proteins (proteome) that determines
    the various cellular metabolites (metabolome). The interplay of enzymatic functions,
    structural components, regulatory networks, and flux through metabolic pathways
    determines the physiology of an organism. It is mainly at the level of physiology
    where the environmental factors and crop management are integrated into appropriate
    cellular reactions that result in the actual phenotype (Fig. 2). The plant physiology
    as a key interface between the genome and the phenotype integrates the various
    levels of regulation involved in the expression of the genetic information, including
    post-transcriptional, post-translational, and epigenetic mechanisms. Thus the
    physiology can be considered as the internal, biochemical phenotype that bridges
    the gap between genotype and external phenotype. Integration of a high-resolution
    physiological phenotyping approach with wet chemistry analyses at the cellular
    level into phenomics will therefore enable causal links between genotypes (G),
    external factors (E, M), and phenotypes to be traced. This will help to dissect
    the genetics of complex quantitative traits, particularly those related to yield,
    pathogen resistance, and abiotic stress tolerance, into defined physiological
    traits that can be more easily measured. The different non-invasive phenotyping
    techniques based on reflectance, fluorescence, and thermography indirectly already
    assess different components involved in physiological reactions (Table 1), so
    that they are also valuable in combination with the direct assessment of physiological
    processes at the cellular and tissue level. However, it will be important to validate
    fully the readout of the sensor-based instruments used to monitor the external
    phenotype with complementary physiological measurements and functional approaches
    under controlled conditions. An exception is the PAM chlorophyll fluorescence
    kinetics which not only allows the assessment of the functional integrity of the
    components of photosystem II, but also allows direct monitoring of the photochemical
    efficiency (Baker and Rosenqvist, 2004). Different parameters, such as Fv/Fm and
    non-photochemical quenching, are differentially affected by abiotic stress and
    provide useful markers for early, pre-symptomatic detection of heat stress and
    defining the degree of tolerance (Sharma et al., 2012, 2015). The value of this
    method can be increased further by implementation of improved measuring protocols
    and special light regimes, as well as by the use of advanced image analyses tools
    based on statistical analyses (Matouš et al., 2006; Berger et al., 2007). Thermal
    imaging indirectly estimates changes in stomatal conductance (gs) and/or transpiration,
    and was successfully used in a range of conditions and plant species to assess
    drought and heat stress responses and to screen for tolerant plants (Costa et
    al., 2013). Most physiological determinations at the cellular level are based
    on wet chemistry, and were originally established for a low number of samples
    (low throughput) and require extensive labour time for processing in the laboratory.
    Thus, a major challenge for the future will be to adopt them for at least semi-high
    throughput. A variety of regulatory mechanisms determine the steady-state level
    and biological activity of proteins, which increases flexibility and adaptability
    and shortens the time scale of information flow, enabling biological networks
    to take on new tasks and adjust to new conditions rapidly (Stitt and Gibon, 2014).
    Therefore, information about the abundance and—most importantly—the biological
    activity of proteins is essential to understand how individual genes function
    and how environmental impacts affect phenotypes. The use of liquid-handling robotics
    and down-scaling to a microplate assay format have dramatically improved throughput
    of activity measurements. A robot-based platform employing stopped assays coupled
    to secondary cycling reactions to amplify the products was established (Gibon
    et al., 2004), which now comprises a total number of 50 enzymes of carbohydrate
    and nitrogen metabolism (Sulpice et al., 2010). A remarkable reproducibility of
    enzyme activity profiles in tomato fruits grown under contrasting environments
    supports the tenet that enzyme activities are highly robust markers (Biais et
    al., 2014). A complex network analysis of enzyme activities and metabolite levels
    and their relationship to biomass has been performed with a large panel of Arabidopsis
    accessions (Sulpice et al., 2010). This study revealed that there was little correlation
    between enzyme activities and metabolites. Within a matrix containing 62 metabolites
    and 37 enzymes, allowing 2294 pair–pair correlations, there was only one significant
    correlation when the traits were compared on a protein basis, further supporting
    that enzyme activities are the more robust physiological markers. A simple, fast,
    and cost-effective alternative platform has been established for the determination
    of an activity signature comprised of 13 key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism
    enzyme in microtiter plates (Jammer et al., 2015). The latter approach is based
    on a unique extraction procedure, separation of soluble and cell-wall bound fractions
    followed by spectrophotometric kinetic activity assays which allow the quality
    control of the individual reactions and do not require the investment in a robotic
    system. The potential of the determination of distinct enzyme activity signatures
    as part of a physiological fingerprint with this method was shown for various
    organs and tissues from three monocot and five dicot model and crop species, including
    two case studies with external stimuli. Differential and specific enzyme activity
    signatures are apparent during inflorescence development and upon in vitro cold
    treatment of young inflorescences in the monocot ryegrass, related to conditions
    for doubled haploid formation. Likewise, treatment of dicot spring oilseed rape
    with an elevated CO2 concentration resulted in distinct patterns of enzyme activity
    responses in leaves (Jammer et al., 2015). The determination of three types of
    invertase activities shows the potential to discriminate between isoenzymes based
    on the subcellular localization and particular properties such as a differential
    pH optimum. Also a differential substrate or product regulation or differential
    inhibitor sensitivity could be integrated into such an approach to discriminate
    between isoenzymes. The approaches to determine enzyme activity profiles have
    concentrated so far on enzymes involved in primary metabolism. Notably similar
    approaches will also be needed for antioxidant and secondary metabolism. Since
    the sum of the steady-state levels of enzyme activities are a good approximation
    of the physiology of a cell, the determination of an enzyme activity signature
    is a robust marker for physiological phenotyping and a key component of a physiological
    fingerprint. Development of user-friendly platforms for instrumental analytics
    of small molecular weight compounds by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography
    (UHPLC) in combination with mass spectrometry also makes the determination of
    regulatory molecules and secondary metabolites feasible to be integrated into
    physiological phenotyping. Since phytohormones, as key regulators of growth, development,
    and stress responses, not only act alone but typically also act in changing combinations,
    the recently established determination of complex phytohormone profiles (Floková
    et al., 2014; Großkinsky et al., 2014) also needs to be considered for internal
    phenotyping. A combination of new measurement technologies for non-targeted analyses
    of metabolites and modelling approaches is bringing us closer to integrating metabolic
    behaviour with whole-plant physiology and growth (Ménard et al., 2013). Thus flux
    analysis also needs to be involved together with modelling of a range of plant
    systems that point to the importance of the supply of metabolic inputs and demand
    for metabolic end-products as key drivers of metabolic behaviour (Sweetlove et
    al., 2014). The integrative analyses of metabolite fingerprints and the determination
    of enzyme activity signatures, in combination with the application of validated
    sensor technologies, have the potential to contribute to the identification of
    novel breeding targets and the recognition of predispositions for specific traits
    that will become apparent only at later stages of development or in response to
    specific environmental factors. This would allow definition of predictors that
    will, with the use and application of advanced crop models, greatly facilitate
    and advance breeding progress. An alternative to the direct assessment of enzymes
    involved in metabolic processes or the determination of metabolites or signalling
    molecules is the determination of the abundance of related transcripts by microarray
    or RNA sequencing techniques. Although such an approach has the potential to provide
    valuable insights into regulatory networks, there is growing awareness that transcripts
    and protein abundance often poorly correlate (Stitt and Gibon, 2014) and that
    the correlations are even poorer for the enzyme activities that are actually the
    main determinants of physiological reactions. Integration of physiological phenotyping
    data into non-invasive signatures: plant physiology meets biophysics Despite advancements
    in the throughput of physiological measurements at the cellular level, it is not
    expected that they will be applicable in high-throughput screening. Thus it is
    the ultimate vision to link hyperscale, non-invasive imaging data to temporal
    and spatial dynamics of key physiological processes and DNA-based markers. Ultimately
    the integration of precision characterization of the internal phenotype at the
    organ and tissue level into high-throughput phenotyping of whole plants and canopies
    will be needed for high-dimensional physiological phenotyping across scales. This
    will allow breaking down complex traits, such as drought resistance, into individual
    components of physiological traits. Since the higher resolution of physiological
    phenotyping at the organ and cell level is inherently limited in throughput, the
    available high-throughput phenotyping methods need to be validated and verified
    across scales to be used as proxy for the underlying physiological processes.
    It is expected that ultimately this will also allow the use of high-throughput
    phenotyping as physiological phenotyping for predictive assessment of predispositions
    and elucidation of robust metabolic markers and fingerprints. This would finalize
    the transition from a yield- and morphology-based phenotyping to a phenomics approach
    with multidimensional, physiology-related trait measurements under consideration
    of complex environmental impacts to determine predictors to facilitate breeding.
    Integration and correlation of phenomics data by modelling the relationship between
    traits Advances in collecting phenotypic information facilitate the analysis of
    specific single or a few parameters. Simultaneous monitoring of multiple parameters
    and integration of the different phenotypic data collected can be used to obtain
    whole-plant phenotypes that could serve as a basis for phenome-wide association
    studies. Within such studies, but also in general, phenomic data should be correlated
    to known parameters derived from other approaches such as genomics or transcriptomics
    and related to physiological processes. Association and correlation of phenotypic
    data to data derived from other approaches can serve to create powerful prediction
    models and, in particular, the correlation of directly accessible external phenotypes
    to internal physiological phenotypes allows the establishment of non-invasive
    predictors that can easily be monitored. These correlations and associations can
    further facilitate the integration of biological functions and processes on different
    levels to create mechanistic models such as crop models used for up-scaling (Sadras
    and Richards, 2014). The use of advanced approaches to model phenotypic data will
    also help to simplify the description of complex results or the illustration of
    processes such as nutrient use efficiency (NUE), water use efficiency (WUE), and
    radiation use efficiency (RUE) (Porter and Christensen, 2013; Brown et al., 2014;
    Granier and Vile, 2014). The crop models will need to be integrated with flux
    models at the cellular and organ level (Baghalian et al., 2014; Kruger and Ratcliffe,
    2015). An example for an integrative approach between physiological phenotyping
    and modelling is the model-assisted analysis of metabolism throughout tomato fruit
    development that reveals enzyme and carrier properties in relation to vacuole
    expansion (Beauvoit et al., 2014) and extensive reprogramming (Colombié et al.,
    2015). Unlike conventional quantitative genetics, integrative phenomics involve
    the detailed analyses of physiological parameters to consider the underlying processes,
    their genetic basis, as well as environmental impacts and agricultural practices.
    This framework is valuable for practical applications because complex crop phenotypes
    with quantitative features and their response to environmental variation cannot
    be understood and predicted based solely on the genes specific to a single macroscopic
    phenotype per se. Armed with this interdisciplinary systems biology approach,
    plant physiology and functional genomics complement each other, ultimately enabling
    the in silico assessment of responses to genetic fine-tuning under defined environments
    (Yin et al., 2004). In practical terms, phenomics demand broad scientific expertise,
    including in genetics, molecular biology, cell biology, systems biology, and higher
    levels of phenotypic expression, and these experts must be capable of communicating
    effectively and of collaboratively designing and executing translational research
    projects on a large scale. Such a multidisciplinary phenomics approach is then
    expected to be able to overcome the operational phenotyping bottleneck currently
    experienced. The big data challenge An increasing major challenge in phenotyping
    is the great number and heterogeneity of data obtained with diverse methods that
    need to be handled and integrated. In particular, the implementation of multiscale
    physiological phenotyping which includes the association of phenotypic information
    with a multitude of metadata and integration of highly diverse data sets, such
    as data deriving from genomic or biochemical analyses, will further contribute
    to the complexity related to the acquisition of large data sets within a multidimensional
    phenomics approach (Krajewski et al., 2015). Such an approach can contribute to
    the aim to capture a detailed image of the current status of as well as processes
    in the plant. The inclusion of additional layers of information such as physiological
    and biochemical data in future phenomics approaches will only allow a better estimation
    of the real plant status as most (if not all) data collected are not of an absolute
    nature. All data acquired at different levels are prone to bias, ranging from
    methodological limitations such as the integration over certain sample sizes in
    biochemical analyses, to errors in experimental set-ups and measurements, to management,
    analysis, and interpretation of data. This is also a complex challenge for advancing
    phenomics beyond state-of-the-art, where an approach would be to integrate physiological
    and biochemical information with genotype and phenotype characteristics (Chen
    et al., 2014) in order to harness the approach towards (i) getting as close to
    the true phenotype as possible considering its true complexity and (ii) identifying
    with a higher frequency specific correlations which ultimately can be used as
    concrete markers that account for specific desired plant traits. A shift from
    the consideration of absolute values to relative signatures that comprise a number
    of individual measuring points will be helpful to diminish the problem. Such approaches
    are, for example, the determination of enzyme activity signatures (Jammer et al.,
    2015) or phytohormone profiles (Großkinsky et al., 2014). An approximation of
    the true phenotype has also to be based on good and standardized experimental
    practices as well as use of uniform nomenclature of data and standardized protocols
    for data processing and interpretation, which can contribute to decrease bias
    and increase comparability of generated data. Data handling Phenotypic data can
    be used for a direct assessment of parameters of interest such as crop traits
    and can create an immediate impression of the plant status. Advanced phenotyping
    approaches generate already enormous amounts of data, which are expected to increase
    in the future considering up-scaling methods for field application, combined use
    of techniques, additional parameters such as derived from physiological phenotyping,
    and increasing resolution and precision. The value of the generated phenotypic
    data thus depends not only on the quality control of the experimentation and data
    collection but also on data management, processing and standardization (Krajewski
    et al., 2015), together forming a kind of ‘good phenotyping practice’. Data nomenclature
    and ontology To make optimal use out of phenotypic data and allow their interpretation
    as scientific results in a uniform way, it is essential to define a nomenclature
    for phenomics. This applies both to the use of terms in the scientific description
    of phenotyping experiments or results and to the ontology needed to secure robust
    data (bio-) informatics of complex data such as derived from sensor measurements
    (Roda and Musulin, 2014). Thus bio-ontologies are essential as integrative tools
    for analysing phenomics and genomics data (Walls et al., 2012). Based on such
    definitions, distinct data can be generated, processed, evaluated, and presented
    in a uniform way, which maintains easy and direct correlations or comparison between
    different data sets. A complete description of data sets necessarily must include
    specific metadata comprising technical information automatically recorded and
    guiding information added manually. Similar to original data, metadata also need
    a certain definition, and especially guidelines on which metadata have to be collected
    for a valid interpretation of the data set. Besides technical metadata necessary
    for functional processing such as unique identifiers, important information could
    include settings of the monitoring device, climatic and light conditions, geographic
    position, and date and time of data collection. Without considering this basic
    information, the interpretation, correlation, and evaluation of phenotypic data
    are hardly possible. With respect to heterogeneity of the data collected, the
    wide range of techniques applied, in particular when integrating wet chemistry
    analyses with non-invasive phenotyping, standardization is urgently needed with
    respect to the metadata, the vocabulary, and formats for data exchange. First
    tools have been already developed for automated plant phenomic analyses using
    plant ontology (Shameer et al., 2014; Oellrich et al., 2015). Data storage, management,
    and processing The information value of the plant phenotype is enormous, but phenotyping
    approaches, particularly high-throughput and high-precision imaging techniques,
    generate huge amounts of data and thus are technically limited by the availability
    of high-performance computation for data storage, management, and processing.
    To maintain phenotypic data generation and processing, advanced computer platforms
    as well as (bio-) informatics tools are needed. To cope with the increasing complexity
    of data, they must be based on newly developed algorithms, which facilitate data
    handling and processing to useful information formats on a reasonable time scale.
    The requirements of informatics thereby strongly depend on the type of generated
    data (amount, complexity), the load of accompanying information as metadata, and
    their ultimate purpose that determines the data analyses needed. For accurate
    data analysis, which procedures are necessary and which are allowed to generate
    an additional value without falsification have to be defined. This applies particularly
    to the important statistical analyses of different complex phenotypic data. Since
    phenomic data derive from phenotyping campaigns conducted worldwide under various
    climatic and geographic conditions, statistical analyses of these data include
    the interesting aspect of geostatistics dealing with such spatial and spatiotemporal
    data. The value and use of phenotypic data would greatly benefit from efforts
    in identification and application of appropriate statistical and geostatistical
    methods to them, which could feed into prediction models, for example for global
    use in precision agriculture. However, all data processing and analysis should
    be feasible and aim towards an easy use of data in an understandable format without
    loss of sense and content. In appropriate formats, phenomic data could also be
    deposited in general databases—comparable with existing databases used, for example,
    in advanced breeding programmes or for genomic data—which would facilitate the
    exchange of information for scientific evaluation of data and directed development
    of novel approaches taking into consideration such database information. Approaches
    are on the way to develop comprehensive information systems making data available
    for the scientific community (Fabre et al., 2011). The future development and
    optimization of phenotyping approaches must involve manufacturers, computer scientists,
    and end-users to define the goals. Successful efforts must therefore be based
    on realistic estimations of the technical possibilities as well as the necessity
    and value of information expected from the use of specific techniques taking into
    consideration certain purposes (e.g. scale of use, broad screening versus detailed
    analysis). Taking these aspects into account, the most promising and powerful
    approaches could be identified and focused on. By intense exchange of information
    from these sectors, the development and validation of useful methods combined
    with the design of user-friendly devices or interfaces including data processing
    to a directly usable format are feasible. The meta-analysis of multiplexed phenotyping
    and phenomics data is both a great opportunity and a challenge (Krajewski et al.,
    2015). Examples of the practical relevance of such analyses of phenomics datasets
    are the crop QTLome (Salvi and Tuberosa, 2015), the analyses of biotic and abiotic
    stress responses (Naika et al., 2013; Blum, 2014), biomass allocation (Poorter
    et al., 2012), and environmental factors (Poorter et al., 2010). Conclusions and
    perspectives In the light of the development of molecular and genetic methods,
    high-performance computing, and automated phenotyping platforms, the implementation
    of physiological phenotyping of the internal phenotype at a cellular or tissue
    level in a multidimensional phenomics approach will open up new opportunities
    to understand the complex interactions between plants and their dynamic environment.
    The combination of high-resolution internal with high-throughput external phenotyping
    offers new opportunities to obtain detailed and complementary information on important
    physiological plant traits which are of agricultural interest. The assessment
    of the phenotype can therefore be used for the improved understanding of the relationship
    between varietal responses to different climate and soil conditions, and management
    strategies. Providing that these methods are fully validated by linking them to
    known genetic and, particularly, physiological functioning, phenotyping is a promising
    and valuable tool for basic and applied plant science and breeding. The establishment
    of robust physiological traits will allow recognition of predispositions and the
    use of predictive physiological phenotyping will be valuable for screening in
    breeding programmes. The rapid development of new research instruments is providing
    scientists with opportunities to work more closely together. This should result
    in more detailed insights into G×E×M interactions, elucidating the mechanisms
    governing phenotypic plasticity, and thus contribute to at least further narrowing
    the genotype-to-phenotype gap. Such an interdisciplinary approach will open up
    completely new perspectives to apply this knowledge for climate-smart breeding
    of new varieties. Through ‘breeding by design’ for sustainable agriculture, varieties
    better adapted to and prepared for future changes in climatic conditions or a
    range of specific local soil conditions, with better ability to resist weeds,
    diseases, and pests and improved ability to exploit water, nutrients, and solar
    energy, can be generated in a more efficient manner (Fig. 2). In addition, from
    this knowledge, precision agriculture will also greatly benefit and stimulate
    the establishment of a closer interaction between breeders and farmers to develop
    protocols mutually for the optimal use of novel varieties (Fig. 2). The tools
    and the knowledge are available to spur on a second green revolution to meet the
    agricultural challenges of the 21st century to feed the world also in the future.

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) systems
    have been collecting massive volumes of datasets for decades, managing and analyzing
    of which are not practical using common software packages and desktop computing
    resources. In this regard, Google has developed a cloud computing platform, called
    Google Earth Engine (GEE), to effectively address the challenges of big data analysis.
    In particular, this platform facilitates processing big geo data over large areas
    and monitoring the environment for long periods of time. Although this platform
    was launched in 2010 and has proved its high potential for different applications,
    it has not been fully investigated and utilized for RS applications until recent
    years. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively explore different aspects
    of the GEE platform, including its datasets, functions, advantages/limitations,
    and various applications. For this purpose, 450 journal articles published in
    150 journals between January 2010 and May 2020 were studied. It was observed that
    Landsat and Sentinel datasets were extensively utilized by GEE users. Moreover,
    supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, were more widely
    applied to image classification tasks. GEE has also been employed in a broad range
    of applications, such as Land Cover/land Use classification, hydrology, urban
    planning, natural disaster, climate analyses, and image processing. It was generally
    observed that the number of GEE publications have significantly increased during
    the past few years, and it is expected that GEE will be utilized by more users
    from different fields to resolve their big data processing challenges. Topic:

    I. Introduction In Recent years, there has been a significant increase in the
    number of remote sensing (RS) datasets acquired by various spaceborne and airborne
    sensors with different characteristics (e.g., spectral, spatial, temporal, and
    radiometric resolutions) [1]. This trend is expected to continue due to the availability
    of more open-access RS datasets and daily advancement in sensor, image processing,
    and computer vision technologies [2]. Working with petabytes of RS datasets is
    a challenging task and has its own special requirements. The challenges of big
    data processing and analyzing can be divided into two categories: common and individual
    facets [3]. The common challenges are more related to handling big data and include
    big data computing, big data collaboration, and big data methodologies. The individual
    challenges are related to big data life cycle in different applications, such
    as the appropriate data identification, data deployment, data representation,
    data fusion, as well as data visualization and interpretation. In order to provide
    a comprehensive solution that can meet a wide range of current and future challenges
    and requirements in RS applications, one of the most important steps is to develop
    a safe, efficient, and advanced cloud computing platform [3], [4]. Cloud computing
    platforms are efficient ways of storing, accessing, and analyzing datasets on
    very powerful servers, which virtualize supercomputers for the user. These systems
    provide infrastructure, platform, storage services, and software packages in a
    variety of ways for the customers [3], [4]. Several cloud computing platforms
    have so far been developed. For example, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a pay-as-you-go
    platform, where users pay based on the hours that they use the services [2]. AWS
    has a dedicated cloud Earth Observation (EO) offering called “Earth on AWS” as
    part of its Public Dataset Program, which includes open data from several satellites
    such as Landsat-8, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite
    program, National Oceanographic, and Atmospheric Administration Advanced (NOAA)
    image datasets, as well as global model outputs. AWS also hosts open data supplied
    by DigitalGlobe with its SpaceNet challenges. Moreover, AWS hosts the largest
    suite of machine learning services [4]. Azure is another cloud computing platform
    hosted by Microsoft. This platform has established the Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) for earth initiative to facilitate the use of its AI tools for addressing
    environmental challenges in four main areas of climate, agriculture, biodiversity,
    and water. Azure only contains Landsat and Sentinel-2 products for North America,
    since 2013, as well as moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery.
    Azure is also a pay-as-you-go platform which provides virtual systems for the
    users [5]. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is another cloud computing platform which
    was launched by Google, in 2010. GEE uses Google''s computational infrastructure
    and available open-access RS datasets [6]. GEE is the most popular big geo data
    processing platform, facilitating the scientific discovery process by providing
    users with free access to numerous remotely sensed datasets [1], [2]. Users can
    access GEE via an internet-based Application Programming Interface (API) and a
    web-based Interactive Development Environment [2], [6]. Additionally, users do
    not need to have expertise in web programming or HyperText Markup Language to
    use GEE for different applications [6]. GEE has the features of an automatic parallel
    processing and fast computational platform to effectively deal with the challenges
    of big data processing [6], [7]. For instance, according to Hansen et al. [8],
    it only took 100 h to process 654 178 Landsat-7 images (about 707 terabytes) within
    GEE and produce a global map of forests. This was reported as a great achievement
    because if they did not use GEE, this process would have taken a million hours
    to complete. Furthermore, users do not need to download the available dataset
    within GEE in order to use them or install any software to perform the processing
    tasks existing in GEE. However, GEE users can utilize complementary software packages
    or process their own private datasets within this platform. This platform also
    contains various built-in algorithms, such as classification algorithms, to analyze
    data at a planetary scale and also helps scientists to develop their own algorithms
    with less effort than before [1], [2], [9]. As discussed, the remarkable capabilities
    of GEE provide unprecedented opportunities to employ this platform for big data
    processing and interpretation and, therefore, it is effectively employed in a
    broad variety of disciplines in all branches of Earth science studies. It is also
    expected that users will more frequently use this cloud computing service considering
    the trends of GEE studies in recent years. There are currently four GEE literature
    review studies conducted by Gorelick et al. [6], Kumar and Mutanga [9], Mutanga
    and Kumar [10], and Tamiminia et al. [2], published between 2017 and 2020, respectively.
    Gorelick et al. [6] was the first comprehensive GEE review paper conducted by
    the main GEE developers. The authors comprehensively discussed different aspects
    of GEE, including data catalog, system architecture, functions, data distribution
    models, efficiency, along with several applications and challenges. Kumar and
    Mutanga [9] also briefly discussed the publication and authorship trends, datasets,
    study areas, and applications of GEE by reviewing 300 journal papers. Furthermore,
    Mutanga and Kumar [10] briefly discussed four main applications of GEE. More recently,
    Tamiminia et al. [2] also discussed various aspects of GEE by reviewing 349 journal
    papers. The authors provided comprehensive information about the GEE publications
    based on study areas, number of publications, datasets and products, functions,
    sensor type and resolutions, classification accuracies, and various applications.
    There is still need for a more comprehensive review to discuss various aspects
    of the GEE platform. Therefore, in this study, 450 journal articles along with
    peer-reviewed conference papers were investigated through eight main sections:
    Section I provides an introduction to GEE; Section II provides an overview of
    the GEE platform; Section III presents different datasets included in this platform;
    Section IV discusses various GEE functions and algorithms; Section V provides
    comprehensive information about the advantages and limitations of GEE; Section
    VI analyzes the pattern of GEE publications over one decade; Section VII discusses
    different applications of GEE; and finally Section VIII provides several case
    studies, in which GEE was applied to process and analyze big data over large areas
    and within a long period of time. SECTION II. GEE Platform Overview GEE is mainly
    composed of the following three platforms: Earth Engine (EE) Explorer; EE Code
    Editor; EE Timelapse. The details of each platform are discussed in the following
    sections. A. EE Explorer EE Explorer (see Fig. 1) is a data viewer platform which
    allows users to access the massive datasets available in the EE Data Catalog.
    The Data Catalog houses millions of publicly available datasets, including a complete
    series of Landsat-4, -5, -7, and -8, MODIS, Sentinel-1, -2, -3, and -5P imagery,
    as well as several atmospheric, meteorological, and vector datasets, which will
    be further discussed in Section III. The Data Catalog receives approximately 4000
    new datasets every day [11]. Fig. 1. Earth Engine Explorer platform. (a) Workspace.
    (b) Data Catalog. Show All As illustrated in Fig. 1, the EE Explorer is composed
    of the Workspace [see Fig. 1(a)] and the Data Catalog [see Fig. 1 (b)]. In the
    Data Catalog, users can search among massive datasets and import them to the Workspace.
    In the Workspace, users can manage and visualize datasets. The Workspace also
    enables users for a quick view, zoom, and pan. Additionally, it allows users to
    set parameters related to the visualization setting, such as contrast, brightness,
    and opacity levels. To better inspect any changes over time, users can add multiple
    layers to the Workspace. Users can display the layers in a three-band RGB or a
    single-band grayscale/pseudocolor representation [6]. For example, Fig. 1(a) demonstrates
    a true color composite of a MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function
    (BRDF)-adjusted image. B. EE Code Editor While the EE Explorer platform is designed
    to visualize datasets, the EE Code Editor (see Fig. 2) is designated to process
    big data using a JavaScript programming language and to develop EE applications.
    According to Fig. 2, the EE Code Editor is composed of the following elements:
    Code editor, Map, Layer manager, Geometry tools, and several tabs, including Script,
    Doc, Assets, Inspector, Console, and Tasks. Fig. 2. Overview of the Earth Engine
    Code Editor. Show All The central panel allows users to write their JavaScript
    code. GEE processes the written codes and illustrates the results as images in
    the Map panel or as messages in the Console Tab. Similar to the EE Explorer, users
    can set the visualization parameters via the Layer manager in the Code Editor
    (see Fig. 2). In the Script tab, numerous examples of scripts facilitate developing
    applications. There are more than 800 prebuilt functions (discussed in detail
    in Section IV) in the EE library, users can become familiar with them using the
    Doc tab, providing API reference documentation [6]. As previously mentioned, GEE
    includes big open-access datasets. Users, however, are not restricted to use only
    these datasets. They can upload and manage their own data using the Asset tab.
    It is also possible to interactively query the map using the Inspector tab. Finally,
    the Geometry tools allow users to draw geometric features, such as points, lines,
    and polygons, which can be used in further analyses [6]. C. EE Time-Lapse GEE
    combines petabytes of RS datasets over four decades and produces a global, zoomable,
    and cloud-free video over space and time in its EE Time-laps platform [6]. The
    Timelapse platform is an example of the great computational power of the GEE platform.
    This platform provides the most comprehensive picture of the Earth revealing how
    its residents are treating it. For instance, through EE Time-lapse, one can easily
    observe the fast retreat of Mendenhall Glacier in Alaska, decapitation of West
    Virginia Mountains by the mining industry, forest loss in the Amazon, and drying
    Urmia lake in Iran over time. SECTION III. GEE Datasets As discussed, GEE contains
    an immense number of datasets, including raw datasets, preprocessed data, elevation
    models, and products at global, national, and regional extents. Table IV in the
    Appendix provides all available datasets within GEE along with a brief description
    of each. Some of these datasets, which are frequently utilized by users are discussed
    in more detail in the following. Landsat datasets are valuable resources to perform
    temporal analysis. Landsat collection includes seven multispectral satellites:
    Landsat 1–3 (1972–1983), Landsat-4 (1982–1993), Landsat-5 (1984–2012), Landsat-7
    (1999–present), and Landsat-8 (2013–present). Landsat satellites have optical
    sensors, the images of which may be obscured by clouds. Therefore, temporal cloud
    detecting, masking, and removing are essential preprocessing steps in different
    applications, such as image classifications using multitemporal imagery [12].
    Additionally, the availability of the multitemporal Landsat datasets has facilitated
    national and global scale analysis [13]. Landsat-based datasets within GEE have
    been employed in various applications. For instance, Landsat data available in
    GEE have been widely utilized in generating Land Cover/Land Use (LCLU) maps (e.g.,
    [14]–[16]). Moreover, urban detection and extraction is an important task in the
    economic investigation due to rapid population growth. Therefore, several studies
    have utilized Landsat data in urban monitoring [17], [18]. GEE includes datasets
    acquired by Sentinel satellites, developed by the European Space Agency (ESA).
    Sentinel collection includes Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) (2014–present),
    Sentinel-2 multispectral (2015–present), Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color (2016–present),
    and Sentinel-5P Tropospheric Monitoring (2018–present) datasets. Sentinel-1 and
    Sentinel-2 have been extensively utilized by GEE users for different applications.
    Their 10 m spatial resolution makes it possible to analyze objects in a better
    resolution compared to Landsat images. They can also simplify the procedure of
    training and validation steps in image classification tasks. Mandal et al. [19]
    applied Sentinel-1 SAR data to map rice and monitor its temporal changes. Additionally,
    Traganos et al. [20] estimated satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) of three regions
    in the Aegean Sea using Sentinel-2 time-series analysis. GEE includes MODIS images.
    MODIS has a great potential in near-real-time (NRT) mapping of the ground surface
    in national and global scales. MODIS acquires images in 36 spectral bands, the
    spatial resolutions of which vary from 250 m to 1 km. MODIS time series are available
    in GEE Data Catalog from 2000 to present, facilitating temporal analysis over
    globe. Campos-Taberner et al. [21] developed a temporal investigation on MODIS-based
    indices, including the global Leaf Area Index, Canopy water content, Fraction
    Vegetation Cover, and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation.
    SECTION IV. GEE Functions GEE provides various functions to perform spectral and
    spatial operations on either a single image or a batch of images. Different operations
    within the GEE platform, ranging from simple mathematical operations to advanced
    image processing and machine learning algorithms are illustrated in Fig. 3. Various
    pixel-based spectral operations, which have high potential to be implemented in
    parallel on cloud architecture, are included in GEE. However, GEE supports fewer
    spatial functions, such as Gaussian and Laplacian filters, edge detection methods
    (e.g., Sobel, Roberts, and Canny), line detection via the Hough Transform, and
    morphological operators (e.g., dilation and erosion) due to parallel implementation
    issues. Moreover, GEE currently does not support several functions, including
    frequency domain algorithms (e.g., FFT and Wavelet), hierarchical algorithms (e.g.,
    hierarchical clustering), graph-based methods (e.g., graphcut), geometric descriptors
    (e.g., Haar, SIFT, SURF), and physical-based models (e.g., radiative transfer
    models). Fig. 3. Overview of different supporting functions within GEE. Show All
    Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are accessible through
    the GEE library. For example, the classification and regression tree (CART), support
    vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) classifiers are among the supervised
    classification algorithms within GEE. Labeled samples are required in supervised
    classification methods to train the classifiers, for which both sampling and training
    functions are available in GEE. There are also many clustering algorithms in GEE,
    such as K-means. K-means is a popular clustering method in the data mining area.
    The algorithm requires users to define the number of clusters (K) and the stopping
    criteria [22]–[24]. Besides the original K-means, two modified versions of K-means
    (i.e., Cascade K-means [25] and X-means [26]), in which the number of clusters
    is estimated automatically, are available in GEE. Cobweb is another clustering
    algorithm which hierarchically handles data instances data instances. It constructs
    a classification tree and manages it through merging and splitting steps [27].
    Simple noniterative clustering (SNIC) is another clustering-based segmentation
    method, which is initiated with randomly/manually determined seeds and generates
    segments [28]. SNIC is widely utilized by users to perform object-based image
    classifications (e.g., [29]). As mentioned before, GEE contains over 40 years
    of datasets, facilitating temporal and change analyses. For temporal analysis
    purposes, several functions, such as continuous change detection and classification
    (CCDC) [30], exponentially weighted moving average change detection (EWMACD) [31],
    and Landsat-based detection of Trends (LandTrendr) [32] are available. CCDC fits
    harmonic functions to temporal data to detect points with significant variations.
    EWMACD calculates a model according to the training data. Then, the difference
    between the model and real data points are found according to the Shewhart X-bar
    charts and an exponentially weighted moving average. LandTrendr is specially designed
    for Landsat data and finds the pixel-based spectral change in temporal analysis.
    Vegetation analysis is also a popular subject in temporal analysis. Therefore,
    GEE has several algorithms, such as vegetation change tracker (VCT) [33] and vegetation
    regeneration and disturbance estimates through time (VERDET) [34], which are specifically
    developed for this purpose. VCT can automatically analyze Landsat time-series
    images to generate forest disturbance history. VERDET categorizes forest change
    into three types, including disturbed, stable, and regenerating. The analysis
    is based on the total variation regularization in the spatial and temporal domain
    [34]. SECTION V. GEE Advantages and Limitations GEE is a valuable tool in analyzing
    geospatial data that provides many capabilities for researchers, especially for
    the RS community. However, there are also several limitations that users should
    be aware of. The key advantages and limitations of GEE are summarized in Table
    I and discussed in more detail in the following section. As illustrated in Table
    I, the advantages and disadvantages of GEE are investigated within the four categories
    of cloud infrastructure, API, data, and functions. TABLE I Main Advantages of
    GEE Big Geo Data Processing Platform A. Advantages 1) Cloud Infrastructure GEE
    is mainly a free cloud-based service without having to download and manage data
    locally [35]. It is built upon the Google cloud computing infrastructure and computations
    are automatically handled by Google itself. All operations are automatically performed
    in bulk and parallel on the Google CPUs and GPUs [6]. The complexities of parallel
    computing are hidden due to this automation in processes [17]. Since GEE was mainly
    created and optimized for geospatial data analysis, it can process petabyte of
    RS data both in large geographical scales and in long temporal coverages [17].
    Thus, it is a great tool for analyzing regional, national, continental, and global-scale
    applications. Besides various datasets, which are already available within GEE,
    researchers can easily upload and share their own datasets as well as their scripts
    and models through URLs [9]. Other maps and products are generated on-the-fly
    [28], [29], once any user wants to run the code [36], [37]. Additionally, there
    is no need to install third-party software packages, such as ENVI and ERDAS, because
    almost all of the required tools are already available on GEE [38]. GEE stores
    and analyzes RS imagery based on a pyramiding and tiling concept [39]. Every image
    ingested into GEE has its pyramid at different pixel resolutions [6]. Furthermore,
    every tool used in GEE processes images on 256×256 tiles. Thus, different scales
    of the pyramid are used at various zoom levels. This enables GEE to visualize
    large areas of processed imagery quickly and efficiently. Fast filtering and sorting
    capabilities are provided within GEE, inherited from Google. This enables users
    to select their desired data out of millions of images based on various spatial
    and temporal specifications [40]. 2) API GEE is combined with a powerful web-based
    programming interface. Users can easily access archived RS data through the JavaScript
    and Python API. The straightforward concept of using both APIs allows users to
    focus on the logic of data selection and programmable workflow. Only a log-in
    is required to access all GEE power. An online code editor is also available to
    write scripts, debug them, and see the results just after compilation. Both the
    JavaScript and Python APIs provide access to the same set of EE objects and methods,
    except for a few methods which are capitalized differently (e.g., .and() versus
    .And()) [41], [42]. Most of the libraries in GEE are similar to existing open
    source components, such as OpenCV, and GDAL. Therefore, there is a minimum requirement
    to learn new concepts. The Python API provides a programmatic and flexible interface
    to EE [41], [43]. It allows for automating batch processing tasks, piping EE processed
    data to Python packages for postprocessing and leveraging the power of the command
    line. Additionally, the Jupyter notebook interface of the Google Colaboratory
    platform delivers a highly interactive and collaborative experience and is without
    the burden of local system setup and management as a hosted service. In summary,
    the EE code editor has a high ease of setup and use, while the Python API is more
    flexible. Combining GEE and Python APIs inside a Jupyter notebook provides the
    advantage of both to users. In order to compare JavaScript with Python based on
    [43], it can be argued that JavaScript is easy to get started and share scripts,
    while it cannot share code between scripts. However, Python is easy to share code
    between scripts and is easier to be transformed into a web application. Moreover,
    Python has many plotting options, which requires several assembly and maintenance.
    Finally, the code editor enables the user to store, share, and control their codes
    in a behind-the-scene git environment. 3) Datasets As discussed in Section III,
    GEE contains a large catalog of RS, geophysical, and meteorological datasets.
    It contains most of the important and temporal datasets in RS, including Landsat,
    MODIS, and Sentinel. Furthermore, the combination of different sources of imagery
    improves the temporal density of datasets and can help fusion algorithms to have
    more power. Moreover, several NRT datasets are uploaded to GEE in a daily manner.
    If a dataset is not in the GEE Data Catalog, it can also be uploaded to the servers.
    Datasets are also downloadable to continue from a desktop workstation at any point
    of the workflow. GEE stores datasets in their original projection with all original
    data and metadata. Resolutions are managed directly by the platform. Data are
    stored in its original resolution, but a pyramid of images is also constructed
    and stored beside every image which is used in different zoom levels for the sake
    of efficiency. As mentioned, users can also easily search for their desired data
    using the tags provided within data categorization, which is very well handled
    in GEE. Several preprocessing steps have been already applied to the datasets
    and, thus, users can use corrected data besides raw data. For instance, the orthorectified,
    atmospherically corrected, and Calibrated Top of Atmosphere Landsat data are easily
    accessible apart from the raw data [44], [45]. Analysis-ready SAR datasets on
    GEE represent a significant step forward because SAR preprocessing is relatively
    complex (especially for regular users). For example, GEE hosts Sentinel-1 GRD
    data preprocessed with ESA''s SNAP software [46]. GEE makes many derivative products
    available. Multiple popular spectral indices (e.g., NDVI) are already calculated.
    Since storage is more expensive than computation, most of these derivative products
    are computed on-the-fly upon users’ request. 4) Functions As discussed in Section
    IV, a large set of functions and algorithms are available within GEE library for
    analyzing various datasets. All algorithms are parallel in nature and can automatically
    handle data management over servers. Machine learning, image processing, vector
    processing, geometrical analysis, different visualizations, and multiple specialized
    algorithms are gathered into the GEE platform and enable users to implement their
    idea. The GEE functions usually satisfy the needs of a typical scientific project.
    Additionally, users can always implement their own algorithms outside GEE and
    return the result for postprocessing. For instance, TensorFlow is a better option
    in the deep learning section, for which more complex models, larger training datasets,
    more input properties, or longer training times are required [47], [48]. TensorFlow
    models are developed, trained, and deployed outside EE [49]. For easier interoperability,
    the EE API provides methods to import/export data in TFRecord format [47]. This
    facilitates generating training and evaluation datasets in EE and exporting them
    to a format where they can be ingested to a TensorFlow model. A complete API reference
    and tutorial with runnable code examples are available for beginner to advanced
    users (e.g., [47]). The tutorials are detailed and cross referenced to each other
    to guide users through different applications and important notes. Outputs of
    these algorithms can be directly embedded in different applications. B. Limitations
    GEE limitations are relatively minor, but it is essential to be familiar with
    the constraints. Several main limitations of GEE are discussed in the following.
    Although data is kept as private in the user''s account, it is still stored in
    the servers of a private company, which is not acceptable for many governmental
    agencies and private companies [50]. GEE-based image analysis is restricted to
    existing tools within the GEE API. For example, several standard image preprocessing
    methods (e.g., atmospheric correction techniques) are currently not implemented
    in GEE. Moreover, developing new tools is not trivial and requires knowledge about
    all GEE algorithms and their functionality along with performance considerations
    about cloud-based computing on Google servers. GEE is limited to selected data
    mining models for classification and regression. There are only a few classification
    and regression algorithms, such as CART, RF, and SVM. Image classification as
    one of the important applications of RS can be considerably improved by object-based
    image analysis. However, currently, there is not an efficient and accurate segmentation
    algorithm within GEE [1]. One of the main approaches to improve classification
    accuracy is increasing the number of training samples or input features. However,
    users are limited to employ only a certain amount of samples or a limited number
    of features within classification methods [1], [16]. Complex machine/deep learning
    algorithms which require large training datasets or longer training times are
    not performed in GEE due to computational restrictions. Thus, users need to implement
    these algorithms outside of this environment [48]. When trying to download processed
    data in the middle of the workflow for further analysis in a third-party software
    environment, users face a time-consuming process due to huge map size and internet
    speed limitations. Complex SAR phase data are not stored in GEE because they are
    not compatible with the tiling concept of the infrastructure [51]. This limits
    the Polarimetric SAR and Interferometric SAR applications, which relies on the
    phase information. SECTION VI. GEE Pattern of Publications In this study, 450
    journal papers, published between January 2010 and May 2020, were assessed to
    depict the pattern of GEE publications. Several investigations, including keyword
    analysis, annual publication numbers, and geographical distribution are provided
    in the following sections. Additionally, the top journals and conferences, which
    have published GEE papers are discussed in Section VI-E. A. Analysis Method A
    meta-analysis was performed in the Elsevier''s Scopus (the largest abstract and
    citation database of peer-reviewed literature covering over 5000 publishers) and
    Web of Science (formerly known as ISI Thomson) to provide a comprehensive literature
    trend conducted using GEE. It is worth noting that conference articles and presentations
    were also reviewed during the course of this study; however, they were not considered
    in this study because most of them had a relatively lower academic level or had
    later been converted to journal papers. Only the top conferences, where GEE studies
    were presented, were provided in Table III. The Google Earth Engine and GEE search
    queries were performed in the journal articles’ titles, abstracts, and keywords
    from January 2010 to mid-May 2020. The EndNote software was then used to remove
    the duplicate articles, which resulted in 462 peer-reviewed journal articles.
    Subsequently, 12 papers, which discussed unrelated topics (e.g., using GEE for
    gaming development and analyzing the computational performance of GEE) were discarded.
    Finally, 450 journal articles were selected for further analyses. B. Keyword Analysis
    Fig. 4 illustrates a word cloud visualization based on the keywords in these GEE
    studies. The more frequent the term appears within the keyword analysis, the larger
    the word depicts in the figure. As clear, Google Earth Engine, Landsat, Remote
    Sensing, Sentinel-2, Random Forest, Cloud Computing, NDVI, Machine Learning, and
    Land Cover were the mostly used keywords, respectively. For example, Google Earth
    Engine keyword was utilized in 278 papers. The name of different satellites and
    machine learning algorithms are also widely used in GEE publications. Landsat,
    Sentinel-2, MODIS, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-1 are the satellites and Random Forest
    is the classification method, which are frequently utilized in the keyword lists
    of GEE journal papers. It was also observed that NDVI, land cover, classification,
    and Urbanization were among the most used keywords, indicating the popularity
    of LCLU classification applications. Additionally, the Time Series, Change Detection,
    Climate Change, Land Cover Change, and Time Series Analysis keywords were frequently
    utilized in the GEE publications, indicating the importance of the archived open-access
    remote sensing datasets in change detection studies. Furthermore, multiple journal
    publications used China, United States, and Africa in the keywords, demonstrating
    the leadership of the corresponding countries in utilizing GEE in their studies.
    Fig. 4. Word cloud of the keywords from the GEE journal articles. Show All C.
    Annual Publication Numbers The statistical analysis of the number of publications
    related to GEE is provided in Fig. 5. The first peer-reviewed journal paper was
    published in 2011 by Keller et al. [52] in PFG - Journal of Photogrammetry, Remote
    Sensing and Geoinformation Science. This study investigated the automated generation
    and presentation of historical 4-D city models. As clear from Fig. 5, a substantial
    increase in the number of GEE publications was observed from 2017, when Gorelick
    et al. [6] (GEE developers) discussed a comprehensive utility of this cloud computing
    platform, particularly for RS applications. Additionally, it was observed that
    the increasing trend in the number of GEE publications is getting more substantial.
    For instance, 35 journal articles were published within the last 1.5 months (April
    1–May 15, 2020). Fig. 5. Number of journal articles, which utilized GEE. Show
    All D. Geographical Distribution The study areas of the peer-reviewed GEE journal
    papers were investigated to provide a picture of the geographic distribution of
    GEE studies. Fig. 6 illustrates the geographical distribution of GEE studies after
    removing ten papers, which did not belong to any study areas (e.g., literature
    review papers and papers related to the theoretical aspects and development of
    the GEE platform). Additionally, 35 studies which were conducted over the continental
    scales (7 and 1 papers covered the entire Africa and Europe, respectively) and
    global scales (27 papers covered the entire world) were not considered in a country-based
    enumeration. Furthermore, if a study was conducted over several countries, all
    of them were counted separately. Moreover, studies with sub-country scales (e.g.,
    small study site, city, or province) were considered in the number of publications
    for the corresponding countries. Finally, it was observed that GEE studies were
    conducted over 138 countries. The highest number of GEE publications have been
    conducted over the United States (97 articles), China (96 articles), Brazil (29
    articles), Canada (25 articles), and India (25 articles), followed by Australia
    (19 articles), and Indonesia (15 articles), respectively. On the continental scale,
    37.5%, 24%, 18.5%, 9%,7.5%, 3.5%, and 0% of studies were conducted over Asia,
    North America, Africa, Europe, South America, Australia, and Antarctica, respectively.
    38% of studies conducted over Asia were related to China. Fig. 6. Number of GEE
    studies conducted over each country. Show All E. Journals and Conferences Table
    II provides the top journals, in which GEE studies have been published. 450 journal
    papers have been published in 150 journals, 95 of which have published only one
    GEE paper. Based on the results, the Remote Sensing, Remote Sensing of Environment,
    ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, and International Journal
    of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation were the top four journals, which
    published 126, 61, 14, and 12 papers, respectively. TABLE II Top 10 Journals Publishing
    GEE-Related Articles Along With the Number of Publications Per Journal Table III
    provides the name of several conferences, in which GEE studies have been most
    frequently presented. GEE studies are among the most presented research topics
    in the prominent international RS conferences, such as the International Archives
    of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences ISPRS Archive,
    the International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS, and the Proceedings
    of SPIE The International Society for Optical Engineering. TABLE III GEE Studies
    Presented at the Top Eight Conferences Along With the Number of Presented Articles
    SECTION VII. GEE Applications The 450 selected GEE journal articles were studied
    to decide about the main disciplines. It is worth noting that seven papers which
    were review articles were initially removed from the analysis. Consequently, all
    the 443 journal papers were divided into 10 categories as illustrated in Fig.
    7 along with several keywords describing each category. The articles which include
    more than one application were considered in the most relevant category by an
    in-depth review of the paper. It is worth noting that although only the journal
    articles were investigated to adopt the main disciplines, it was observed that
    other sorts of publications (e.g., conference papers) correspond well with the
    application types considered in this study. Fig. 7. GEE applications (LC: Land
    Cover). Show All Fig. 8 illustrates the number of journal articles related to
    each application provided in Fig. 7. The highest number of contributions were
    in the Vegetation category with 90 papers followed by 77 papers in Agriculture,
    68 papers in Hydrology, 53 papers in Land cover, 40 papers in Urban, 40 papers
    in Natural disaster, 31 papers in Atmosphere and climate, 17 papers in Image processing,
    and 14 papers in Pedosphere. Moreover, 13 papers, which were not related to any
    of the 10 application types or their numbers and not enough to be assigned to
    a new category were considered in the Others category. Fig. 8. Number and percentage
    of journal papers related to GEE applications, published in each discipline provided
    in Fig. 7. Show All In the following sections, more information about each of
    the GEE applications along with several case studies are discussed. A. Vegetation
    Vegetation (e.g. forest, grassland, rangeland, and shrub) can be considered as
    one of the most vital components of the Earth''s biosphere because it serves critical
    functions to both humans and the environment [53]. Vegetation is also important
    in many biochemical cycles that are directly or indirectly interacting with water,
    soil, and air [54]. Such cycles are important for global vegetation pattern and
    climate studies and, thus, vegetation is also important for biodiversity conservation
    and climate change mitigation [55]. Moreover, vegetations are the primary source
    of converting dioxide carbon to oxygen, enabling aerobic metabolism on the globe
    [56]. Considering the important services of vegetation, it is highly required
    to monitor the current state and dynamics of various vegetation types. GEE leverages
    cloud computing services for long-term monitoring of vegetation covers. Furthermore,
    the publicly available RS data within GEE enable researchers to employ this platform
    for vegetation monitoring at various spatial scales. In particular, the existence
    of several vegetation indices in GEE allows conducting vegetation studies in efficient
    and quick manners. GEE has been widely used for vegetation mapping [57], [58],
    vegetation dynamics monitoring [59], [60], deforestation [61], [62], vegetation
    and forest expansion [63], [64], forest health monitoring [65], [66], forest mapping
    [67], [68], pasture monitoring [49], [69], and rangeland assessment [70], [71].
    For instance, the full archive of the Landsat imagery was processed within GEE
    to map the vegetation dynamics from 1988 to 2017 in Queensland, Australia [59].
    Field observations were utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm
    and an overall accuracy of 82.6% was reported. Finally, the suitability of GEE
    for large-scale and long-term vegetation monitoring was reported along with an
    approximately 20% decrease in the vegetation cover in this study area. The authors
    emphasized the high computational efficiency of GEE compared to when they did
    the same analysis using traditional methods. In another study, an algorithm was
    developed within GEE by employing spectral mixture analysis to detect degradation
    and deforestation in the Brazilian state of Rondônia [62]. To this end, Landsat
    archived images from 1990 to 2013 were used. All the required processing steps
    were performed within GEE to produce annual forest disturbances maps. Landsat
    data were transformed into spectral endmember fraction and were applied to calculate
    the Normalized Degradation Fraction Index. The presented method obtained producer
    accuracies of 68.1% and 85.3% for degradation and deforestation maps, respectively.
    B. Agriculture Mapping and monitoring croplands and plantations are essential
    for food security. Food security could be stated as one of the most significant
    issues in the current era and, thus, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    has set its goal to achieve food security around the globe [72], [73]. Agricultural
    products not only play a vital role in human life, but also are critical from
    economic aspects. Therefore, agriculture can be considered as a source of livelihood
    and a contributor to national revenue [74]. Moreover, monitoring agricultural
    products is required for policy-makers and governments to ensure the path to economic
    growth and self-sufficiency of the country [72]. RS datasets allow frequent and
    cost-effective monitoring of croplands and plantations. GEE hosted extensive publicly
    available RS datasets that can be effectively utilized for productivity, quality,
    profitability, and sustainability studies of agriculture production. Researchers
    have applied GEE to plantation mapping and monitoring [75], [76], phenology-based
    classification [77], [78], cropland mapping [79], [80], crop condition monitoring
    [81], [82], crop yield estimation [83], [84], irrigation mapping [85], [86], and
    other agricultural studies [87], [88]. For example, seasonal median composites
    of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were calculated in GEE to predict the Maize yield
    in Kenya and Tanzania [83]. The use of RF resulted in the production of Maize/none
    Maize maps in Kenya and Tanzania with 63% and 79% overall accuracies, respectively.
    Finally, satellite observations along with gridded soil datasets were ingested
    into a scalable harmonic regression to estimate Maize yield. Moreover, multitemporal
    Landsat-8, Landsat-7, and Sentinel-2 imagery were employed to calculate composite
    NDVI images for winter cropland mapping in an area of over 200 000 km2 [77]. Then,
    the multitemporal NDVI curve was inserted into a CART algorithm to produce a phenology-based
    map of winter cropland with an overall accuracy of 96.22%. The authors reported
    that lacking remote sensing images with high temporal frequency in GEE was one
    of the limitations of their work and, thus, suggested to use Chinese GaoFen satellite
    data with four days revisit time for the future cropland classifications. C. Hydrology
    Water is an essential element for life whether in liquid form (e.g., lake, reservoir,
    and river) or solid forms (e.g., snow, ice, and glaciers) in the cryosphere and,
    thus, obtaining reliable information about water resources is a high necessity.
    In addition, monitoring inland, coastal, and arctic water resources are beneficial
    in climate change studies [89]. Moreover, investigating the size and behavior
    of glaciers along with the amount of snow ablation could render supporting information
    about the Cryosphere–Atmosphere interactions and climate change [90], [91]. Furthermore,
    drought and flood disasters are relatively associated with the dynamics of water
    resources [92]. Therefore, persistent and precise monitoring of all types of water
    resources is a vital need. Publicly available datasets within GEE along with its
    high computing performance allow for accurate monitoring of water resources with
    adequate temporal and spatial resolutions. Consequently, GEE was efficiently employed
    for surface water dynamics monitoring [93], [94], bathymetry [20], [95], shoreline
    and coastal studies [96], [97], lake and reservoir mapping and monitoring [98],
    [99], glacier studies [90], [100], snow ablation and snow mapping [92], [101],
    suspended sediments and river studies [102], [103], and water health assessment
    [104], [105]. For instance, Nguyen et al. [93] introduced a fully automatic method
    for water extraction in New Zealand. The GEE and Landsat-8 images between 2014
    and 2018 were employed to map lakes and reservoirs using an Automatic Water Extraction
    Index with an overall accuracy of 85%. In a different study, GEE was used to combine
    MODIS fractional snow cover with Sentinel-1 wet snow mask data to develop an algorithm
    to produce a monthly wet-dry snow map [92]. In this study, 2.5 years were studied
    in the Indian Himalayan region covering around 55 000 km2. It is worth noting
    that the underestimation of the wet snow area was corrected by DEM. In another
    study, blue and green bands of Sentinel-2 were processed to develop an empirical
    model for satellite-derived bathymetry maps [20]. In this regard, cloud masking,
    sun glint correction, radiometric calibration, and normalization were performed
    within GEE in three sites of the Aegean Sea in the Eastern Mediterranean. Finally,
    based on 9818 reference points, the proposed approach achieved R2 and RMSE of
    0.9 and 1.67 m, respectively. The authors argued that GEE time-out error was the
    main limitation in their work, because their empirical method required estimation
    of the regression between the image composite values and water depth over large
    region and a long period of time. D. Urban Urban areas are regions with concentrated
    people and human infrastructure and usually expand through the time for better
    livelihood. These regions have become the central point of economic, social, cultural,
    and recreational activities, as well as resource consumption [106], [107]. Therefore,
    urban areas could be considered as the primary source of human interaction with
    the surrounding environment. The environment and the urban areas affect each other
    mutually since the environmental changes could influence human life. On the other
    hand, unrestricted urban growth causes severe damage to natural resources and
    can negatively alter the atmosphere and climate [108], [109]. Conducting urban
    studies are essential to support sustainable development. In this regard, RS datasets
    enable the quantification and profound analysis of urban dynamics that are fundamental
    for devising suitable approaches for urban development and urban planning [110].
    GEE promotes long-term monitoring of urban conditions to effectively study the
    urban environment from different aspects. Urban expansion and extent mapping [18],
    [111], urban morphology and local climate zone monitoring [112], [113], urban
    4-D modeling [52], urban green space classification [114], [115], urban temperature
    and urban heat island identification [17], [110] are some of the main urban studies
    conducted within GEE. For instance, Ravanelli et al. [17] studied the long-term
    monitoring of Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) and its relation to urban land
    cover changes over six metropolitan areas of the United States. More than 6000
    Landsat images were interpreted between 1992 and 2011 by Detrended Rate Matrix
    analysis to illustrate the land cover change versus SUHI. It was reported that
    GEE was the best solution for their applications in terms of efficiency in time,
    cost, and computation. The results revealed a definite increase of SUHI due to
    urban growth. Moreover, Gong et al. [18] investigated the urban expansion dynamics
    by producing annual global artificial impervious surfaces that are predominate
    indicators of human settlement. To this end, the full archives of Landsat satellite
    data between 1985 and 2018 were processed within GEE. Sentinel-1 SAR data and
    nighttime images were also used to improve the final results in arid areas. The
    implementation of the Exclusion–Inclusion algorithm combined with the temporal
    consistency check within GEE yielded the overall accuracy of over 90% in mapping
    annual global impervious surfaces. E. Land Cover The dominant land cover types
    of a region determine the terrestrial surface characteristics of the corresponding
    area. Vegetation, water, and soil are the main land cover types spread across
    the globe. These land cover types form environmental conditions for the habitat
    of various flora and fauna [116], [117]. Furthermore, the distribution of land
    covers defines the physical interaction between Earth''s surface and the surrounding
    environment. Recognizing the significant impacts of land covers on the environment
    and investigating the current condition along with monitoring long-term dynamics
    of land covers are essential for sustainable development, climate change modeling,
    biodiversity studies, and natural resource monitoring [118], [119]. GEE hosted
    enormous publicly RS datasets in various spectral and spatial resolutions to conduct
    land cover mapping [14], [120], land cover dynamics monitoring [121], [122], coastal
    mapping [123], [124], and wetland classification [125]. For instance, an automatic
    land cover mapping was developed within GEE through the integration of Landsat
    imagery and RF algorithm over the north of China [14]. The reference samples were
    collected by rules of pixel and spectral filtering from MODIS land cover products
    with the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program theme in ten classes. Two types
    of monthly and percentile features were utilized separately, and the best result
    was obtained through the usage of monthly features by achieving over 80% accuracy.
    In another study, GEE was used to produce a sharpened land cover map over Mato
    Grosso, Brazil [15]. Their proposed algorithm (BULC-U) fused the 300 m the GlobeCover
    product with Landsat imagery to produce a 30 m land cover map. In this regard,
    Landsat images were segmented and then the ISODATA algorithm was applied to generate
    an unsupervised map in 20 clusters. Finally, the unsupervised classification result
    was fused to the GlobeCover product. More recently, Ghorbanian et al. [126] produced
    an improved version of the land cover map of Iran using Sentinel-1/2 imagery within
    GEE. They also proposed an automatic workflow to update this map every year without
    the need to collect additional in situ data using migrated samples. F. Natural
    Disaster Extreme and unexpected phenomena caused by the natural process of the
    Earth are called natural disasters. These events bring destruction to the surrounding
    environment and human life [127]. Profound research should be carried out to investigate
    the characteristics and behavior of these phenomena and, consequently, to reduce
    the amount of damage. The importance of geospatial data for monitoring and damage
    assessment of natural disasters is undeniable [128]. Long-term and NRT publicly
    available RS datasets within GEE along with its high-performance computing promote
    this cloud-based platform for monitoring, forecasting, prevention, vulnerability,
    and resilience studies of natural disasters. In particular, GEE was utilized for
    drought monitoring [129], [130], flood mapping and flood risk assessment [131],
    [132], wildfire severity mapping [133], [134], landslides analyses [135], hurricane
    studies [136], and tsunami studies [137]. For instance, MODIS and meteorological
    datasets were employed within GEE to study the temporal and spatial variations
    of drought events in Potohar Plateau of Punjab, Pakistan between 2000 and 2015
    [129]. In this regard, multiple features of standard precipitation index, standard
    precipitation-evapotranspiration index, vegetation condition index, precipitation
    condition index, soil moisture condition index, and temperature condition index
    were utilized for drought monitoring. In addition, 44 Sentinel-1 GRD dual-polarized
    data were employed within GEE to develop an operational methodology for rapid
    flood inundation mapping in Bangladesh [131]. Moreover, a potential flood damage
    map was generated to support efficient decision making. The proposed method obtained
    96.44% overall accuracy by incorporating 4500 reference samples. Finally, a preflood
    Landsat-8 image was used to generate a land cover map for further estimation of
    flood damages to cropland and rural settlements. It was reported that the developed
    algorithm within GEE could be effectively used for monitoring land covers in a
    cost-efficient approach because open-access Landsat datasets are regularly inserted
    into GEE. In a different study, very high-resolution oblique images were processed
    within GEE to detect irregularity in façade and rooftop areas caused by hurricane
    events [136]. First, a vertical building map was produced from a temporal analysis
    of predisaster images through an edge-based/knowledge-based approach. Then, pre-
    and postdisaster images were fused in the data level followed by spectral-only
    and geospectral classifiers through the RF algorithm. The results obtained a significant
    reduction in false-positive error. G. Atmosphere and Climate As a principal component
    of the natural process of the Earth system, land interacts with the atmosphere
    through biophysical and biochemical processes mutually [138]. Constant population
    growth and human activities result in significant changes in the atmospheric constituents
    [139]. Climate change and air pollution are two decisive consequences of these
    disturbances that directly impact the surrounding environment and human health
    [140], [141]. Therefore, it is essential to monitor and control air quality and
    climate conditions to avoid severe outcomes. The availability of climate products
    accompanied by surface products within GEE, make this platform a great tool for
    climate studies and air quality monitoring. These advantages create a rising interest
    in the research community to use GEE for air pollution analyses [142], [143],
    climate change and monitoring [144], [145], biophysical variable studies [21],
    [146], evapotranspiration estimation [147], and precipitation mapping [148]. For
    instance, GEE was employed to map exposed mine waste areas to estimate the corresponding
    emission of particulate matter to the atmosphere [142]. Four benchmark years of
    1990, 2000, 2010, and 2018 as a part of Canada''s Air Pollutant Emission Inventory
    were studied. Landsat-5, Landsat-8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 satellite data
    were used to map exposed mine through an RF algorithm. Finally, the authors reported
    that GEE was an invaluable platform for monitoring long-term emission from exposed
    mine waste. Furthermore, GEE was used along with version 1 Tropical Rainfall Measuring
    Mission (TRMM) precipitation products to study the spatial and temporal patterns
    of precipitation in the Zambezi River basin [148]. To this end, TRMM data from
    1998 to 2017 were processed in GEE to investigate the precipitation trends and
    magnitudes by Kendall''s correlation and Sen''s slope reducer respectively. A
    “dry gets dryer, wet gets wetter” pattern was observed and reported in the study
    region. H. Image Processing In the current era, almost all EO platforms are equipped
    by digital sensors and, thus, terabytes of data are generated and stored in digital
    formats every day. As discussed, GEE hosts an immense number of digital images.
    The RS images are extensively utilized in various applications and for different
    purposes. Therefore, it is highly required to develop and enhance digital image
    processing algorithms to efficiently exploit the potential of digital images.
    Moreover, since the quality of every input data directly affects the final accuracy
    of studies, image processing must be considered a necessity. Precision, level
    of automation, reliability, computational complexity, and time-consumption are
    the most critical criteria in developing image processing algorithms [149], [150].
    Therefore, to ensure high-quality results, it is inevitable to develop and enhance
    the existing image processing algorithms within GEE protocols. In this regard,
    researchers have employed GEE to develop various efficient and useful image processing
    algorithms, such as cloud masking [12], [149], data selection and enhancement
    [13], [150], image-based sensor calibration [151], [152], and training sample
    migration [153]. For instance, Kong et al. [150] introduced weighted Whittaker
    with a dynamic parameter (wWHd) denoising method within GEE to reconstruct the
    vegetation phenology based on 500 m MODIS EVI products. A large number of reference
    samples were used to compare the proposed method with four well-known denoising
    methods. The results, in terms of RMSE, roughness, and computational efficiency
    revealed the superiority of the proposed method. Furthermore, Li et al. [13] developed
    an algorithm to improve GEE''s processing to efficiently acquire large-scale cloud-free
    Landsat images to support further applications. This method comprises cloud and
    shadow masking, snow/ice masking, and low-quality pixels removal by incorporating
    the quality band. Therefore, this method can efficiently prepare high-quality
    data for each region of interest. It was discussed that their algorithm was developed
    within GEE, and the open-access codes within this platform provided a simple framework
    with a flexible user-friendly interface. Finally, Kakooei et al. [154] proposed
    a global Sentinel-1 foreshortening mask to improve the reliability of SAR-based
    analysis. I. Pedosphere The Pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth which dynamically
    interacts with the Biosphere and atmosphere [155]. Monitoring and studying the
    Pedosphere and the corresponding categories (e.g., soil, geology, and geomorphology)
    are prerequisites for sustainable development, especially in the climate modeling
    context [156]. Soil is the most significant component of the Pedosphere that has
    straight impacts on the surrounding environment and, thus, essential for biodiversity
    conservation and climate regulations [157]–[160]. The availability of RS datasets
    in GEE makes it an appealing platform for the Pedosphere studies at diverse scales.
    GEE was utilized for digital soil mapping [50], [161], geology and mining [162],
    [163], geomorphology studies [164], soil topography mapping [165], soil moisture
    derivation [166], and soil carbon and salinity estimation [167], [168]. For example,
    Ivushkin et al. [168] applied Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 datasets within GEE to produce
    a global soil salinity map based on the thermal anomaly. They incorporated 15
    188 reference points from ISRIC-world soil information. Seven soil salinity indicators
    of sand content, silt content, clay content, PH, bulk density, organic carbon
    content, and cation exchange capacity with thermal anomaly were fed to the RF
    algorithm. The final soil salinity map obtained overall accuracies of 67%–70%
    for six different times. Moreover, GEE capabilities and Landsat imagery were combined
    to automatically delineate the annual extent of surface coal mining in Central
    Appalachia between 1985 and 2015 [162]. To this end, the urban areas were masked
    using publicly available datasets and the mining zones were identified by low
    values in NDVI images. The proposed algorithm achieved Kappa coefficients varying
    from 0.62 to 0.93 for different years. J. Others Other than previously mentioned
    applications, there are multiple articles related to other applications of GEE,
    which were conducted with lower frequency. Therefore, their number was not enough
    to have a separate category and, thus, were assigned to the Others applications
    category. These studies are mainly related to archaeology [169]–[171], 3-D printing
    [172], wildlife [173], [174], oil platform detection [175], and crashed airplane
    detection [176]. For example, 300 Landsat-8 images between 2013 and 2018 were
    processed in GEE to detect possible crashed airplane in the Cambodian jungle [176].
    NDVI, albedo, thermal bands, spectral information, and panchromatic features were
    utilized in this study. Moreover, Sentinel-1 SAR data were used to automatically
    identify and delineate offshore oil platforms [175]. The proposed method was evaluated
    by 1577 reference samples and obtained an overall accuracy of 96.09% over the
    Gulf of Mexico. Furthermore, GEE was reported as a suitable platform to process
    high-resolution drone imagery for pottery shreds identification [169]. In this
    regard, texture and gradient features from RGB drone imagery were calculated within
    GEE and were ingested into the RF classifier. The developed algorithm was able
    to identify pottery shreds with 32.9% and 76.8% accuracies for two separate regions.
    Moreover, GEE was employed to process drone imagery to estimate the wildlife aggregation
    population [173]. To this end, the RF algorithm was applied to map targets of
    interest (bird nest) pursuit using a predictive model to estimate the population.
    The proposed approach obtained overall accuracies ranging from 86% to 96% over
    four different water bird colonies. Finally, a web-application called TouchTerrian
    was developed to simplify the 3-D terrain model printing [172]. After determining
    the region of interest, the corresponding DEM was obtained through GEE to be used
    for final 3-D printing. It was reported that users with any level of expertise
    could easily utilize their model within GEE with minimum computing resources requirements.
    SECTION VIII. GEE Large-Scale Case Studies As discussed, the enormous capabilities
    of GEE resolve the existing challenges of processing big data over large-scale
    areas. Therefore, GEE has been recognized as an efficient platform for regional
    to global LC mapping and monitoring over long periods of time. In this section,
    ten studies conducted over the globe, continents, and big countries (e.g., the
    United States, Canada, and China) are discussed in detail. A. Globe Long et al.
    [133] proposed an automatic method for producing a global annual burned area maps
    using all available Landsat images acquired between 2014 and 2015 within the GEE
    cloud computing platform. The map of the burn degree was first generated using
    the RF classifier. Then, several logical filters (e.g., NDVI, Normalized Burned
    Ratio (NBR), and temporal filters) were implemented to select candidate seeds
    of the burned area. Finally, the global annual burned area map of 2015 (GABAM
    2015) was produced by employing an iterative seed-growing process. A strong correlation
    (R2 = 0.74) was observed between the spatial distribution of the burned surfaces
    from the GABAM 2015 and the annual 250 m MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF)
    Collection 5.1 (MOD44B) product. Hansen et al. [8] analyzed forest cover changes
    at the global scale between 2000 and 2012 using Landsat time-series images within
    GEE. Based on the results, the authors reported the following: the tropical domain
    had the highest forest cover change (loss and gain) with annual deforestation
    rate of approximately 2101 km2/year; most forests in the subtropical climate domain
    were considered as croplands, because the existence of long-lived natural forests
    in this domain was relatively rare; the trend of change in temperate forests was
    almost constant and had a low ratio of loss compared to gain; fire was the most
    important cause of deforestation in the boreal domain; the speed of deforestation
    in Brazil was more than other countries. In [177], a grid-based Mountain Green
    Cover Index (MGCI) was implemented to monitor mountain ecosystems at large scales.
    A novel frequency- and phenology-based technique was applied to generate the global
    green vegetation cover using all available Landsat-8 images within the GEE platform.
    Then, the real surface area generated from ASTER GDEM Version 2 was applied to
    calculate the MGCI model instead of the planimetric surface. The results showed
    that the generated data had a high correlation (R2 = 0.9548) with FAO MGCI baseline
    data. In [178], global surface water and its long-term changes were mapped over
    three decades of Landsat satellite images (three million images) within the GEE
    platform. The result of this global assessment demonstrated the following: permanent
    water bodies disappeared by approximately 90 000 km2 and new water bodies covering
    184 000 km2 formed between 1984 and 2015; the permanent net water of all continental
    regions increased except for Oceania; over 70% of global net permanent water loss
    occurred in the Middle East and Central Asia due to drought and human actions
    (e.g., river damming). It is finally argued that the proposed strategy within
    GEE can be effectively used for water resources management. Scherler et al. [90]
    proposed a novel automatic method to map supraglacial debris cover over the globe
    using multitemporal optical satellite images within GEE. In this study, debris-covered
    ice surfaces were generated by thresholding of three indices, including red to
    Shortwave Infrared band ratio, the Normalized Difference Snow Index, and linear
    spectral unmixing-derived Fractional Debris Cover. These indices were generated
    based on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 optical satellite images in 19 glacier areas
    at the world-scale from 2013 to 2015. The results showed that 4.4% (about 26 000
    km²) of all glacier areas is affected with debris. Furthermore, an inverse relationship
    between glacier size and percentage of debris was also reported, indicating continuous
    shrinking glaciers due to the debris effects. B. Continent and Big Countries Amani
    et al. [1] produced the first Canadian wetland inventory (CWI) map using Landsat-8
    imagery and several advanced algorithms available within GEE. In this study, 30
    000 scenes of Landsat-8 images were used along with machine learning algorithms
    in GEE. The RF algorithm was applied to classify wetlands over the entire Canada.
    The CWI map was based on five wetland classes, defined by the Canadian Wetland
    Classification System: bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and shallow water. The quantity
    and quality of the results showed that the generated CWI map had reasonable accuracy
    considering the challenges existing over this immense country (9.985 million km2).
    Li et al. [179] generated African LCLU map at a 10 m resolution within GEE using
    multisource RS datasets, including Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, Global Human Settlement
    Layer, Night Time Light data, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and MODIS
    Land Surface Temperature images. The RF algorithm was applied to classify the
    area into five categories of urban, trees, low plants, bare soil, and water. The
    results showed that the LCLU map generated by this method had a better performance
    than that of the FROM-GLC10 [180] in detecting urban class and distinguishing
    trees from low plants in rural areas. Beresford et al. [181] developed an NRT
    monitoring framework for conservation of the Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) in
    Africa using the GEE platform. In this study, simple repeatable techniques were
    proposed to detect changes in fire rate, tree loss, and nighttime lights between
    1992 and 2013. The results showed that fire rate, nighttime lights, and rate of
    forest loss considerably increased in KBAs and ecoregions. Moreover, the authors
    argued that the method implemented within GEE has a high potential for monitoring
    changes over any geographic area and using different RS data types and could be
    effectively utilized by conservation end-users. Teluguntla et al. [182] developed
    a precise Landsat-based cropland extent product over Australia and China using
    machine learning tools in GEE. In this study, cropland maps were produced by applying
    RF to Landsat-8 images. The RF classifier was trained and validated using ground
    truth data obtained from different resources, such as field surveys, very high
    spatial resolution (5 m) imagery, and several other auxiliary information. Based
    on their results, the total cropland areas of Australia and China were estimated
    as 35.1 and 165.2 million hectares, respectively. Goldblatt et al. [183] used
    GEE for temporal analysis of large urban areas in India using multitemporal Landsat-7
    and Landsat-8 images. In order to generate high-quality maps of built-up areas,
    the country was classified into the built-up and non-built-up regions using 21
    030 training datasets and three types of supervised classification algorithms
    (i.e., SVM, CART, and RF). It was reported that the proposed GEE approach generated
    a high-quality map of built-up areas in India and can be potentially employed
    in other countries. SECTION IX. Conclusion The proliferation of big geo data and
    the recent advance in cloud computing and big data processing services are changing
    the future of RS. In this regard, GEE is effectively paving the road for researchers,
    scientists, and developers to be able to easily extract valuable information from
    big RS datasets without the burdens of traditional data analysis methods. The
    massive troves of RS datasets available with GEE (e.g., archived Landsat and Sentinel
    images) helps researchers to address global challenges and environmental issues,
    such as global warming, climate change, LCLU classification over large areas,
    and monitoring landscape over several decades. GEE also contains hundreds of prebuilt
    functions which can be easily understood and utilized by different users. Through
    a basic knowledge of JavaScript, users can also implement their own algorithms.
    These advantages make any user employ this cloud computing platform for various
    applications related to LCLU, agriculture, hydrology, natural disaster, etc. Besides
    all the advantages, it also has several limitations, such as limited storage of
    250 GBs for each user and limited memory to train machine learning algorithms,
    which may push a new user backward. However, it is undeniable that GEE presents
    a novel way of processing geospatial data and resolves several big data challenges
    existed for RS researchers. Based on the GEE publication trends, it is also clear
    that this platform is becoming more popular not only among the RS researchers
    but also within any community interested in using EO datasets. Authors’ contribution

    147 Citations 117 Altmetric Metrics Abstract Climate change, increasing populations,
    competing demands on land for production of biofuels and declining soil quality
    are challenging global food security. Finding sustainable solutions requires bold
    new approaches and integration of knowledge from diverse fields, such as materials
    science and informatics. The convergence of precision agriculture, in which farmers
    respond in real time to changes in crop growth with nanotechnology and artificial
    intelligence, offers exciting opportunities for sustainable food production. Coupling
    existing models for nutrient cycling and crop productivity with nanoinformatics
    approaches to optimize targeting, uptake, delivery, nutrient capture and long-term
    impacts on soil microbial communities will enable design of nanoscale agrochemicals
    that combine optimal safety and functionality profiles. Similar content being

    in the agri-tech revolution Article 05 June 2019 Nano-enabled strategies to enhance
    crop nutrition and protection Article 05 June 2019 Main The Green Revolution of
    the 1950s and 1960s—also known as the third Agricultural Revolution—markedly increased
    the production yield of global agriculture, thereby avoiding the spread of famine
    and malnutrition. However, the world population has grown by more than 5 billion
    since the beginning of the Green Revolution, which has necessitated a continuous
    growth in crop production. The global agriculture and food security sector is
    facing a wide range of challenges, such as low crop yields, declining soil health
    and fertility, and low use efficiency of agrochemicals mainly due to excessive
    use of fertilizers and pesticides, shrinking arable land per capita and diminishing
    freshwater availability for irrigation1. Moreover, climate change arising from
    increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration leading to rising temperature is likely
    to further affect the resilience of agricultural soils and their ability to sustain
    productivity and ensure food security for an increasing human population. Nanotechnology
    offers great potential to enable precision and sustainable agriculture, the opportunities
    and challenges of which have been discussed in several recent reviews covering
    strategies to enhance crop nutrition and smart plant sensors2,3,4. With the application
    of nanotechnology, the delivery of fertilizer5 can be tailored by targeting to
    specific tissues or organisms and delivered in a controlled manner via stimulus-responsive
    release, potentially improving nutrient-use efficiency (NUE) by releasing the
    nutrient slowly for plant uptake6. Nano-enabled agriculture is also expected to
    target pests more efficiently using smaller amounts of pesticide7, thereby avoiding
    widespread effects on soil health and biodiversity, and improving soil function
    and nutrient cycling by enhancing the soil microbiome (optimization of nitrifying
    and denitrifying bacterial communities). Longer-term applications include development
    of smart ‘sensor’ plants, whereby the plant itself is adapted to sense abiotic
    stress using targeted delivery of nanomaterials8. Figure 1 summarizes four key
    areas in which nanotechnology is improving—and will continue to improve—the precision
    and sustainability of agriculture. Fig. 1: Applications of nanotechnology in agriculture,
    focusing specifically on crop production. Most applications are still at research
    stage, due to uncertainties regarding safety and complex and emerging regulatory
    processes for approval of agricultural chemicals, including plant-protection products,
    biocides and fertilizing products or plant biostimulants. NMs, nanomaterials.
    Full size image As with all new technologies, however, the risks must be evaluated
    in parallel with the benefits, and indeed several nanomaterials have been demonstrated
    to cause negative changes in soil community structure; for example, there were
    cascading negative effects on denitrification enzyme activity and substantial
    modifications of the bacterial community structure after just 90 days of exposure
    to a realistic concentration of TiO2-containing nanoparticles (1 mg kg−1 dry soil)9,
    and studies with silver-containing nanomaterials, which are well known for their
    antimicrobial activity, have shown that the impact on soil community composition
    over 90 days is affected by exposure time and physicochemical composition of soil,
    as well as the type and coating of the nanomaterials10. Thus, an important caveat
    at the outset of this Perspective is that nanomaterials represent a very broad
    range of chemistries, compositions and physicochemical properties, which are dynamic
    and evolving as the nanomaterials interact with their surroundings, and it is
    therefore difficult to generalize their applications in agriculture and challenging
    to predict any long-term effects. However, as previous reviews have noted2,3,4,
    the development of nanotechnology for agricultural applications is still at an
    early stage, although a range of first-generation products such as nanoemulsion
    and nano-encapsulation technologies are on the market (for example, Karate Zeon,
    Seltima and others) alongside commercial formulations of nanoscale silver and
    copper as biocides (for example, Nano Green and Kocide 3000) and nanoporous zeolites
    that stimulate plant growth (for example, Nano-Gro). The nanopesticide market
    was valued at US$410 million in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual
    growth rate of just over 15% during the forecast period from 2020 to 2027, reaching
    US$940 million in 2027 (https://www.credenceresearch.com/report/nanopesticide-market).
    However, much of this market relates to encapsulation technologies for existing
    active ingredients. A recent review by Hofman et al. provides a good overview
    of the status of the field11. Notably, important differences may exist between
    nanotechnology-based pesticides and conventional pesticides, including altered
    bioavailability, sensitivity, dosimetry and pharmacokinetics12,13. Challenges
    and barriers to exploiting the full potential of nanomaterials as sensors, soil
    enhancers and plant growth stimulators, and to enhancing NUE, include a limited
    understanding of plant–nanomaterial interactions, limited methods for efficient
    delivery of nanomaterials to plants and soil, risks of potentially hazardous effects
    of nanomaterials on human health from accumulation of nanomaterials and active
    ingredient residues in edible portions of plants3, and on long-term soil quality
    and soil health from the accumulation of nanomaterials and their degradation products
    in soil, and the resultant potential alterations in microbial biodiversity14.
    There is an urgent need to address these barriers and achieve a true win-win scenario,
    in which improved agricultural production, reduced environmental pollution from
    agriculture and lower costs for farmers can be achieved synergistically. A one-health
    approach to nano-agriculture was proposed by Lombi et al., which requires interdisciplinarity
    and the bridging of human and environmental health research15. In this Perspective,
    we suggest that computational approaches including artificial intelligence (AI)
    and machine learning modelling will have a critical role in driving the progress
    of nano-enabled agriculture; indeed, such approaches are already starting to gain
    regulatory acceptance for safety assessment of nanomaterials, facilitating safe-by-design
    nanomaterials for a range of consumer products and in medicine. We also present
    examples of where the integration of AI and nanotechnology in precision agriculture
    could accelerate development and provide the insights needed to overcome the current
    barriers. Nanoinformatics will have a vital role in probing the design parameters
    of nanomaterials for use in fertilizer and pesticide delivery to ensure minimal
    impacts on soil health coupled with low phytotoxicity and minimal nanomaterial
    residues remaining in the edible tissue portions; in exploring and predicting
    the plant and ecosystem responses to nanomaterials across different climate and
    soil conditions and over multiple growing seasons; and in optimizing the interplay
    of nanomaterials and plant responses for safe and sustainable agriculture. By
    leveraging advances in cheminformatics for de novo design of drugs16 and for multi-objective
    optimization17 to simultaneously optimize numerous or competing objectives, and
    advances in nanoinformatics for prediction of cellular attachment, uptake, toxicity,
    biodistribution and safe-by-design optimization of nanomaterial properties18,19,20,
    it is clear that, despite current limitations in data availability and harmonization,
    the time is ripe for application of AI and machine learning approaches to nano-enabled
    agriculture. For example, AI may predict nanomaterial impacts on the agricultural
    ecosystem and their performance in improving agricultural production (NUE and
    reduction in air and water pollution from key elements) by integrating experimental
    data from across different soil conditions and different plant species or climate
    conditions, and from nanomaterial physicochemical properties to develop predictive
    models to optimize the efficacy of delivery, while minimizing pollution and ensuring
    a high safety profile for the nanomaterials in soil and minimal residues in the
    edible plant parts, as part of an overall approach for safer-by-design development
    of nano-agrochemicals. Current challenges and applications of AI in agriculture
    The application of computers and AI in agriculture is not new—for example, articles
    addressing software for integrated resource management21, image digitization for
    soil and crop science21, and light and temperature monitoring and control for
    plants22 were published 35 years ago. The rise of remote sensing and integration
    of remote sensing data in decision-support tools for contemporary farming systems
    is expected to improve yield production and management while reducing operating
    costs and environmental impact23. Models of agricultural systems have emerged
    over the past 50 years, spanning field, farm, landscape, regional and global spatial
    scales and engaging questions in past, current and future time periods. Integrated
    agricultural systems models combining grasslands and cropping models, livestock
    models, pest and disease models and risk-behaviour models are also emerging, although
    data gaps exist across all aspects, hampering their implementation24. A comparison
    of the capabilities of a random-forest machine-learning-based model and a physics-based
    model (a two-dimensional solver of Richards equation using HYDRUS 2D) to predict
    soil matrix potential in the root zone of a cranberry field over 72 h found that
    although both models can accurately forecast the soil matrix potential in the
    root zone, the machine-learning-based model achieved better performance compared
    with the physics-based model, but its forecasting accuracy decreased rapidly toward
    the end of the 72 h lead time25. The main driver for innovation in agritech is
    the need to optimize productivity to feed the increasing human population with
    the decreasing global per capita agricultural land area while ensuring the conservation
    of soil health and the protection of environmental quality26. The intensification
    of agriculture for enhanced productivity has resulted in extremely poor NUE globally27,28
    (less than 50%), which poses a serious threat to environmental quality as large
    amounts of nutrients are lost to water and air, causing eutrophication and greenhouse
    effects (nearly 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions are from agriculture29).
    Rockström et al. recommended a reduction of reactive nitrogen (N) use in agriculture
    from 150 MtN yr−1 to about 35 MtN yr−1 globally to ensure sustainability30. Such
    a reduction may be achieved through a combination of targeted nano-enabled delivery
    of fertilizer to match plant demands and thus avoid excessive losses, development
    and availability of low-cost in situ nutrient-sensing technology to help farmers
    plan fertilization efficiently, and identification of crop breeds that are efficient
    in nutrient uptake or fixation of atmospheric N2 directly or through enhanced
    symbiosis31. Recent efforts to enhance NUE include the use of biofertilization
    to enhance microbial biodiversity32 and the application of a range of N management
    tools across the growing season, including soil testing, plant tissue testing,
    spectral response, fertilizer placement and timing, and vegetative indexes (leaf
    area index and normalized difference vegetation index) using AI-enabled drones,
    handheld sensors and satellite imagery33. Global agricultural yields are also
    impacted by crop loss due to competition from weeds, insect damage and plant diseases.
    Weed competition causes 34% of crop loss on a global scale, and microbial diseases
    and pest damage cause a further 34% of crop loss34. The application of synthetic
    herbicides and pesticides thus increases yields (reducing crop loss) and, in the
    case of herbicides containing nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, improves food
    quality through enhanced nutrient uptake and retention35; however, these agrochemicals,
    which are designed to kill, also cause severe adverse impacts on the health of
    human and non-targeted organisms and soil fertility, and result in contamination
    of water, soil and air36. Misuse of agrichemicals on poor-quality soils, soil
    degradation as a result of farming intensification, decreasing water availability
    and water quality, and globalization of diseases have led to low resilience of
    agriculture systems37. Moreover, climate change effects, such as increased atmospheric
    CO2 levels and increasing temperatures, will also impact the future of agriculture38.
    Nanotechnology applications in the agricultural sector have great potential to
    improve all aspects of crop production—that is, to increase crop production yields
    and resource-use efficiency while reducing agriculture-related environmental pollution—thereby
    ensuring global food security while ensuring future agricultural sustainability.
    The convergence of AI approaches and nano-enabled agriculture is in its infancy
    and thus this Perspective aims to stimulate the development of this important
    area. Coupling existing models for nutrient cycling and crop productivity with
    AI and machine learning to optimize targeting, uptake, delivery, nutrient capture
    and soil microbial composition will enable design of nanoscale agrochemicals that
    combine optimal safety and functional profiles and implementation of nano-agrichemicals
    into mainstream agricultural systems management. A roadmap to achieve this, and
    the existing components that can be leveraged from nanosafety research more broadly,
    are laid out in the following sections. Leveraging progress in nanosafety and
    nanoinformatics for nano-agrochemicals Before maximizing the use of nanomaterials
    in agriculture and agronomy, some concerns need to be addressed, including the
    potential toxicity of the nanomaterials to target and non-target organisms and
    adverse impacts on ecosystems39,40, their persistence and mobility in the environment
    and those of their breakdown or transformation products. As with all agrochemicals,
    concerns about potential residues in edible portions of plants also need to be
    addressed as part of an overall risk assessment of nano-enabled agrochemicals41.
    Since the use of nanomaterials on farmland will require large quantities of nanomaterials—the
    synthesis of which requires high energy input—evaluating the cost of production
    and the cost–benefit trade-offs should be considered in the development of nanomaterials
    for application in agriculture. The rapid pace of the development of nanotechnologies,
    the enormous diversity of physicochemical properties of nanomaterials and their
    dynamic interactions with, and transformations by, their surroundings (including,
    for example, biomolecule corona formation, dissolution and sulfidation42,43) lead
    to a need for in silico approaches to predict and assess their safety19. Nanoinformatics
    emerged a decade ago in the context of development and implementation of nanotechnology
    in the real world requiring the harnessing of information at the nexus of environmental
    and human safety, risk assessment and management, physiochemical properties and
    function. Through the application of AI and machine learning for in silico risk
    assessment44, nanomaterials grouping and classification45, and safe-by-design46
    nanomaterials design, as well as for prediction of nanomaterials corona formation47
    and consequences of cellular attachment and uptake48,49,50, nanoinformatics has
    had a notable role in the area of nanosafety and nanomedicine. Deep learning approaches
    have been applied, for example, to microscopic images of the aquatic indicator
    species Daphnia magna exposed to nanomaterials in a range of representative waters
    of different ionic strengths and natural organic matter contents, and can automatically
    detect possible malformations—such as effects on the length of the tail, overall
    size and uncommon lipid concentrations and lipid-deposit shapes, which are due
    to direct or parental exposure to nanomaterials—and can classify the nanomaterials
    as toxic or non-toxic20. An early application of Bayesian networks modelled the
    risk of silver nanomaterials exposure in aquatic environments51, which was subsequently
    used for sensitivity analysis52. A Bayesian network combining physicochemical
    properties and exposure potential of nanomaterials was used to perform hazard
    assessment53. Bayesian networks can also underpin the development and quantitative
    analysis of the causal relationships in adverse-outcome pathways (AOPs) and AOP
    networks54. For example, the causal relationships between the building blocks
    of an AOP relating the reproductive failure of Caenorhabditis elegans through
    oxidative stress caused by silver nanomaterials were established using Bayesian
    networks55. This highlights an important difference between Bayesian and machine
    learning approaches, which is that the former requires that causal relationships
    are known or are assumed, whereas the latter does not require any a priori causal
    relationships. A key challenge in the development of nanoinformatics models has
    been the accessibility of datasets, although there are considerable efforts underway
    currently to curate, harmonize and integrate nanosafety data and to enrich them
    with environmental, gene, protein, geospatial and other data. Tools and approaches
    to automate data mining have been developed, including workflows that simplify
    the handling, processing and modelling of cheminformatics and nanoinformatics
    data, including the Enalos toolbox of more than 25 processing modules called Enalos+
    nodes, which extract useful information and analyse experimental and virtual screening
    results in a chemoinformatics or nanoinformatics framework via KNIME56. Other
    approaches applied in the nanosafety area to overcome the limitations of dataset
    size include application of read-across approaches for gap filling57 and enrichment
    of datasets through image analysis58,59 or by generation of computational descriptors60,61,
    for example, which are then correlated with toxicity. The increasing availability
    of nanomaterials models that can make predictions without the need for any experimental
    input, using only knowledge of nanomaterial structure and composition (that is,
    physics-based models62) enables developers to screen nanomaterials in silico before
    actually producing them, thus ensuring that the properties of concern are reduced
    or eliminated, which should make the nanomaterials safe by design63,64. For nanomaterials
    and individual molecules, the starting level of the data is quantum chemical,
    and includes explicit representation of all atoms and valence electrons. To set
    up such simulations, input of the nanomaterial chemical composition, including
    impurities, as well as nanomaterial crystal structure is needed. At this level,
    atomistic and quantum-chemical representation can be used to evaluate the electronic
    structure of the nanomaterial and to parameterize a coarser representation: an
    atomistic model, by development of appropriate force fields and material constants.
    This procedure can combine physics-based multiscale modelling for calculation
    of advanced descriptors and properties of nanomaterials with nanoinformatics methods
    for evaluation of their complex properties and functionalities63. By scanning
    the main groups of engineered nanomaterials, specific properties can be identified
    that might be responsible for causing a particular toxic effect and lead to a
    particular adverse outcome, which needs to be modified or avoided. This provides
    a means of grouping and read-across characterization of nanomaterials and enables
    development of nanomaterials that are safe by design, and is currently an area
    of very intensive research. As the available pool of fully validated nanoinformatics
    models and tools with well-defined domains of applicability grows, the nanosafety
    field is becoming less reliant on animal testing and more targeted towards the
    safe-by-design principles for early stages of nanomaterial development. Integration
    of models into predictive risk assessment frameworks, such as Integrated Approaches
    to Testing and Assessment (IATA) are the next step, combining nanomaterials exposure
    and hazard characterization for complete risk assessment. IATA use existing information
    coupled with the generation of new information in an iterative approach to answer
    a defined question in a specific regulatory context, and can include a combination
    of methodological approaches (such as quantitative structure–activity relationships
    (QSARs), read across in silico, in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo) or omics technologies
    (for example, toxicogenomics). As AI and machine learning models for nanosafety
    emerge, they are increasingly being incorporated into IATA. In these IATA, the
    output from one model can be the input for the next, and predictions from several
    different models can then be integrated in a final machine learning modelling
    and predictive analysis. The analysis can then be applied to generate, for example,
    development of nanomaterial fingerprints—predictive and informative physicochemical,
    biological and computational descriptors that describe a set functionality—that
    is, the minimum set of descriptors required as input to predict specific nanomaterial
    functionalities63. Standard nanoinformatics methods for modelling have thus far
    ignored the multi-objective nature of the problem and have focused on optimizing
    each biological or material property individually as they become available during
    the material design process. Multi-objective optimization (MOOP) methods introduce
    an innovative approach for optimization founded on compromises and trade-offs
    among the various objectives17. The aim of MOOP methods is to discover a set of
    satisfactory compromises and through them, the global optimal solution, by optimizing
    numerous dependent properties simultaneously. The primary benefit of MOOP methods
    is that local optima corresponding to one objective can be avoided by consideration
    of all the objectives simultaneously, thereby escaping single-objective dead ends
    and leading to a more efficient overall process. Several methods have been developed
    for the in silico optimization of small molecules that account for the multi-objective
    aspect of the drug-design process, enabling scientists to optimize in multiple
    spaces simultaneously. Although MOOP models have not yet been explored properly
    in the area of nanomaterials, a pool of well-validated nanoinformatics models
    and tools, assisted by physics-based models, is available, and efforts to integrate
    these and facilitate multi-factor optimization of safety and functionality as
    the basis of safety by design are now beginning63. For example, multi-perspective
    AI- and machine-learning-based modelling techniques can be used to optimally aggregate
    and integrate experimental information and outcomes of the multi-scale modelling
    methods and eventually increase confidence levels concerning evidence of particular
    hazards. The resulting commercial benefits will include improved market access
    for agricultural applications and reduced costs for the exposure, hazard and risk
    assessment of nanomaterials, including safe-by-design screening before production
    to optimize both functionality and safety. The examples highlighted above demonstrate
    that there is ample scope to apply nanoinformatics in nano-enabled agriculture,
    although this has yet to be explored and is thus the rationale for the current
    Perspective to inspire the community to begin to apply the wealth of knowledge
    and existing approaches to the specific challenges of nanomaterials applied to
    agriculture. Areas ripe for application of nanoinformatics and modelling include
    prediction of nanomaterial interactions with and impacts on rhizosphere secretions
    (both proteins and metabolites), nanomaterials transformations before and during
    uptake and translocation, nanomaterials impacts on soil microbial communities
    and for prediction of plant uptake following foliar or soil application. Experimental
    data are emerging in all these areas14,65,66, and a dedicated effort to integrate
    and curate these data and present them in a format suitable for modelling is currently
    underway within the nanoinformatics e-infrastructure projects NanoCommons and
    NanoSolveIT63. Coupling these approaches with existing models for nutrient cycling67,
    NUE68 and crop productivity69, and the aforementioned agricultural systems models
    into overall IATA with MOOP capabilities, will begin to enable co-optimization
    of nanomaterials for use in agricultural systems that combine safety and functionality
    profiles (including enhancing NUE and calorific value of crops) enabling precision
    agriculture, as shown schematically in Fig. 2. Fig. 2: Applications of machine
    learning to nano-enabled agriculture. Application of machine learning in risk
    assessment and safe-by-design nanomaterials design and the potential for extension
    of machine learning approaches to support nano-enabled agriculture, building on
    advances in both nanoinformatics and agricultural systems modelling and emerging
    developments related to MOOP modelling. Integrating a range of different modelling
    and experimental approaches via an IATA will lead to enhanced prediction power
    in terms of optimal nanomaterials properties for safety and functionality across
    the range of potential nano-agriculture applications, and faster and safer implementation
    of precision nano-enabled agriculture. Full size image Experimental studies using
    nanomaterials for agriculture in the laboratory, mesocosms and field are expensive,
    time consuming and complicated, limiting the range of conditions that can be varied
    systematically. Conclusions may be ambiguous, because the interpretation of the
    results is influenced by factors such as experimental procedures, protocols, duration,
    nanomaterials types, doses, soil types and plant species. Integration of the existing
    data—albeit with gaps and limitations—and supplementation with predictive modelling
    and machine learning approaches—including Bayesian networks53,70, which can be
    dynamically updated as new knowledge emerges—into IATA underpinned by MOOP approaches
    offer exciting new directions. Development of a nano-agriculture IATA case study
    using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development IATA case study
    approach71 seems to be a logical next step as shown schematically in Fig. 2. AI
    and machine learning for nano-enabled agronomy Here we present current and future
    applications of AI and machine learning applications in agriculture. AI and machine
    learning approaches As computational capabilities grow and the value of data as
    knowledge to be exploited is increasingly realized, AI and machine or deep learning
    approaches are emerging as means to identify patterns in large datasets that are
    predictive of future outcomes. One of the most widely used approaches involves
    neural network algorithms, which use an unbiased subset of the total available
    data as the training set to develop a model that makes predictions using the rest
    of the data—the validity of the predictions is evaluated to ensure that they could
    not arise randomly. The size and range of the dataset used to train the model
    provides the limits of its predictive power, or its domain of applicability—models
    cannot predict reliably outside the range of these data. Box 1 describes the various
    types of data-driven machine learning models, which include models that link structure
    or properties (for example, of a chemical or nanomaterial) to specific effects
    or impacts on the environment—QSARs or quantitative property–activity relationship
    models72, and Bayesian networks, which are a powerful tool for incorporating uncertainty
    into decision-support systems73—by providing a basis for probabilistic inference
    and facilitating assessment of changes in probabilistic belief as new evidence
    is entered into the model. The larger the dataset available to train a machine
    learning model, the more powerful it will be—for example, in drug discovery or
    cheminformatics, models typically use data from thousands of different chemicals
    to develop a prediction. Similarly, genomics and related approaches, in which
    hundreds of thousands of data points are available, enable generation of strong
    gene-interaction networks and assessment of effects of specific genetic perturbations;
    these are used, for example, to understand gene-regulation networks in plants74.
    For application of AI and machine learning in nano-enabled agriculture, it will
    be necessary to mine the existing publicly available datasets, including those
    on nanomaterials safety and nanomaterials impacts on plants and soil microbial
    communities, existing plant omics databases such as the Plant Omics Data Center75,
    an integrated web repository for interspecies gene-expression networks incorporating
    information on eight plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Solanum
    lycopersicum, Sorghum bicolor, Vitis vinifera, Solanum tuberosum, Medicago truncatula
    and Glycine max) with functional annotation of the genes to facilitate biological
    comprehension, the plant proteome database, the Plant Secretome and Subcellular
    Proteome KnowledgeBase (PlantSecKB76) and similar databases for soil microbiota,
    and integrate these with relevant agricultural databases such as the global gridded
    data of soil physical properties, hydroclimatic and agricultural variables, socio-economic
    metrics, and historical pesticide usage data (for example, table 1 in Maggi et
    al.77). The utility of such an approach of integrating disparate datasets has
    recently been demonstrated with the establishment of PEST-CHEMGRIDS, a comprehensive
    database of the 20 most-used pesticide active ingredients on 6 dominant crops
    and 4 aggregated crop classes at 5 arcmin resolution (about 10 km at the equator)
    projected from 2015 to 2025. The use of automated data extraction, curation and
    integration via the Enalos+ KNIME tools, which has already been demonstrated for
    drug discovery and nanoinformatics56, will facilitate this process, and new nodes
    for specific databases or data clean-up and integration will be developed for
    nano-agriculture datasets as needed. Box 1. The main types of machine learning
    algorithms and examples of their application in agriculture and/or nanomaterials
    design and safety assessment104 Show more Current AI and machine learning in agriculture
    A 2018 review of the use of machine learning in agriculture classified the application
    areas into (1) crop management, including applications in yield prediction, disease
    detection, weed detection crop quality and species recognition; (2) livestock
    management, including applications in animal welfare and livestock production;
    (3) water management (daily, weekly or monthly evapotranspiration rates); and
    (4) soil management such as prediction and identification of agricultural soil
    properties78. However, application of Bayesian networks to agricultural systems
    has remained challenging, as there are often insufficient data to compute the
    prior and conditional probabilities required for the network73. Several other
    machine learning methodologies can be investigated without the need for a priori
    relationships, and numerous models can be linked together to fill gaps in the
    data and predict missing values, as demonstrated successfully for a meta-analysis
    of 216 published articles on cytotoxicity of metal oxide nanomaterials79. In terms
    of the key areas identified for improvements in crop production, process-based
    machine learning models (for example, the SPACSYS model80) for plant growth—incorporating
    assimilation, respiration, water and nitrogen uptake, partitioning of photosynthate
    and nitrogen, nitrogen fixation for legume plants and root growth81—are emerging
    and being constantly improved. With increased understanding of the processes and,
    more importantly, the variables driving them, and the availability of intervention
    strategies such as precision nano-agrochemicals to target specific locations or
    release in response to specific stimuli, the potential of machine learning for
    optimization of agroecosystems has never been greater. Integrating machine learning,
    simulation and portfolio optimization can inform decisions and support selection
    of optimal seed varieties (for example, soybean) to grow, with resolution at the
    level of a specific farm with its individual crop rotation history rather than
    at regional scale based on soil type and quality82. Incorporating such information
    into multi-object optimization modelling of nanomaterial safety, soil management
    and plant yield offers exciting new possibilities. Indeed, a recent review of
    the potential impacts of AI on achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs) suggested that AI will be an enabler for SDG2 (“improved nutrition
    and promote sustainable agriculture”), but highlights generally that the pace
    of development of AI may have implications in terms of a lack of regulatory oversight
    and insight, which could potentially result in gaps in transparency, safety and
    ethical standards83. Nanoinformatics models applicable to nano-enabled agriculture
    The application of machine learning in nanomaterial risk assessment and for design
    of safe and environmentally friendly nanomaterials has also been an area of intensive
    research over the past few years. For example, nanoQSAR models linking specific
    nanomaterials properties to uptake by, and impacts on, cells or organisms are
    emerging. Models that allow determination of surface functionalizations that enhance
    (or decrease), for example, protein binding and/or cellular association (as a
    pre-requisite for internalization84) are also emerging, and can be applied for
    design of targeting strategies in precision nano-agriculture. Although to date
    no nanoQSARs have been developed for plants, ecotoxicities of plant-protection
    chemicals to target and non-target species have been predicted using QSAR85, and
    as the corpus of data related to nanomaterials in plants and soil species is growing
    exponentially, it is only a matter of time before the first nanoQSARs for plants
    and soil microbiota are developed. Similarly, extending advances in nanomedicine
    to precision nano-agriculture will facilitate the design of optimized controlled-release
    agrochemicals86,87. For example, deep learning using an automatic data-splitting
    algorithm and evaluation criteria suitable for pharmaceutical formulation data
    has been developed for the prediction of optimal pharmaceutical formulations and
    doses88. From an agricultural perspective, understanding the factors (including
    nanomaterial, plant, soil and climate factors) that control the release rate of
    active ingredients, and the factors driving transport of the carrier can influence
    selection of formulation parameters and suitability of application to specific
    locations or climates. Such data-driven models require substantial amounts of
    data to train and validate them, which remains a barrier to their development.
    However, significant work is underway in the wider nanosafety arena to develop
    optimized workflows for generation of data and metadata (for example, using electronic
    laboratory notebooks89 to capture experimental data as it is generated, linking
    them to underlying protocols and calibrations, and facilitating curation and storage
    of the data in databases, thereby accelerating their accessibility and re-usability),
    annotation with relevant ontological terms mapped to the data schema of the receiving
    databases and automated upload to nanosafety knowledge bases90, which in the medium
    term will facilitate the aggregation, integration and reuse of nanosafety- and
    nano-agriculture-related datasets. However, as noted above, there are important
    concerns regarding the safety and risks of nanomaterials that must be addressed
    before their widespread intentional application to the environment can be sanctioned,
    and there are tight regulatory processes for approval of agrochemicals91. A recent
    review assessed the regulation of pesticides and the potential use of computer-based
    chemical modelling technologies to facilitate risk assessment of nano-enabled
    pesticides88, and concluded that quantum chemistry is an appropriate tool for
    characterization of the structure and relative stabilities of organic compounds
    and for studying degradation pathways. However, a re-evaluation is needed to determine
    its suitability for nano-enabled agriculture, using quantum nanomaterials descriptors
    for QSAR development. Among the quantum descriptors for nanomaterials are molecular
    and electronic properties such as band gap, ionization potential, atomic charge,
    electronegativity and adsorption energy, as well as interaction parameters for
    prediction of interactions of proteins and small molecules, such as binding energies,
    binding affinities, Hamaker constants and absorption energies, which can be used
    to predict biomolecule corona formation92. In due course as data emerges, the
    evolution of the adsorbed biomolecule as nanomaterials interact with, and respond
    to, soil and plant secretomes, and are transformed as shown in Fig. 3, will also
    be predictable through modelling, allowing tailoring of nanomterials to acquire
    the desired biomolecule corona. Fig. 3: The complexity of nanomaterial behaviour
    in the soil–plant environment and the potential impacts in soil–plant systems.
    Understanding and predicting nanomaterial translocation and transformation, and
    identifying the optimal nanomaterial forms to retain bioavailable N species in
    the soil, will facilitate design of sustainably functional nanomaterials for agriculture,
    enhancing NUE while simultaneously reducing pollution and the need for fertilizers.
    Coupling this knowledge with enhanced targeting and sustained, controlled release
    of pesticides can be facilitated using AI to design optimal nano-agrichemicals.
    Among the input data for machine learning (ML) models are the nanomaterials characteristics
    and those of the plants and soils exposed to the nanomaterials, as indicated (a
    non-exhaustive list). Gene expression, proteomics and secretomics information,
    global soil quality and other parameters can be mined from existing databases.
    NOM, natural organic matter; S, sulfur-containing functional groups; RCOO, carboxylate
    ion. Full size image Challenges and barriers to precision nano-agriculture Although
    nanotechnology has potential in a wide range of applications in agriculture, there
    are many challenges to be overcome to move this area forward and facilitate full
    commercial-scale application of many of the innovative nanomaterials presented
    in Fig. 1. These include a lack of mechanistic understanding of the interactions
    at the nanomaterial–plant–soil interface and nanomaterial uptake and translocation
    in plant vascular structure and organelles; insufficient understanding of the
    environmental safety and human health risks of intentional nanomaterial application;
    a lack of soil and large-scale field studies to demonstrate the efficacy of nanomaterials
    under realistic scenarios; balancing the adoption of new technology and the low
    profit margins in agriculture; and the challenges in collection and harmonization
    of the datasets needed for development of AI models. Long-term studies at ecosystem
    level under environmentally relevant conditions and at realistic nanomaterials
    exposure concentrations are currently lacking. For example, silver, zinc and copper-based
    nanomaterials have demonstrated potential to be applied as efficient pesticides
    or fungicides; however, the potential impact on non-target organisms (for example,
    beneficial plant rhizosphere bacteria and worms) and long-term impacts on soil
    quality are not known. While there remain challenges for the detection of nanomaterials
    in complex matrices, particularly at low concentrations, and access to state-of-the
    art facilities with sufficient resolution such as synchrotrons is limited, application
    of deep learning tools to plant spectral images (for example STXM. XRF etc.) is
    expected to enable advances in terms of determining and predicting nanomaterials
    localization and in situ transformations even with relatively limited datasets
    and against a background of naturally occurring particles. Indeed, as models are
    trained using existing high-resolution datasets for specific nanomaterial–plant
    combinations, they can be coupled with more generalized QSARs or physical models
    of nanomaterials transformations under specific environmental conditions, and
    supplemented with the development of functional assays that can provide the input
    data needed for models but under simplified conditions93,94. For example, surface
    affinity and dissolution rate have been identified as two critical functional
    assays for characterizing nanomaterial behaviour in soil systems. A range of functional
    assays for nanomaterials transformations, including binding of secreted proteins
    and small molecules or uptake using simpler hydroponic systems could be envisaged
    to begin parameterizing more complex predictive machine learning models. Although
    nanofertilizers may enhance the NUE, effects of nanomaterials on the nutritional
    quality of food (for example, alteration of the content of carbohydrates and macro-
    or micronutrients) have been reported95 and need to be assessed systematically,
    and predictive models need to be established. Nanomaterials may accumulate in
    seeds and their potential to cause transgenerational effects96,97 are largely
    unknown. The presence of nanomaterials may cause enhanced uptake of contaminants
    by plants—for example, through binding to the nanomaterial surface and co-transport—and
    may amplify their adverse effects98,99. Such effects need to be fully understood
    and the use of nanoQSAR, multi-object optimization and other machine learning
    approaches will support this understanding and prediction. Nanomaterials undergo
    numerous transformations (physical, chemical or biological) in soils and plants.
    For example, many nanomaterials based on metals and metal compounds such as zinc,
    copper and silver tend to dissolve and release metal ions, which can further react
    with soil and plant components such as phosphate, sulfur and chloride. These transformations
    may alter the original nanomaterial properties that were designed for the specific
    application. For example, antifungal nanomaterials such as those based on silver
    can be oxidized, dissolved and sulfidized in soil environments, either by interaction
    with the soil microbiome or within plants, and the antifungal property of the
    silver nanomaterials could be reduced or diminished100. Some transformations might
    release toxic components—for example, graphene oxide was reported to degrade under
    sunlight and release polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-like compounds that are likely
    to exhibit toxic properties and persist in the environment101. Development of
    QSAR or machine learning models that can predict the transformations of nanomaterials
    under a wide range of soil and temperature conditions will facilitate optimization
    of nanomaterials properties for specific locations. Substantial progress towards
    modelling of nanomaterials transformations in the environment has already been
    made, including environment fate models and process-based models. Combining current
    models with experiments will enhance next-generation nanomaterial fate and transport
    models in key areas, including descriptions of nanomaterial heteroaggregation,
    descriptions of reactive nanomaterial chemistry, increased temporal and spatial
    resolution and sensitivity analyses to allow simplification of model structure102.
    Efforts to develop functional assays to generate the data needed to parametrize
    these models are also underway43,93,94, and can be extended to include functional
    assays for rhizosphere secretions in response to nanomaterials—for example, using
    hydroponics systems or standardized soils. Computational tools that can predict
    nanomaterial transformation processes will enable manipulation or direct simulation
    of the transformation to maintain the nanomaterial function or modify its effects.
    However, the complexity of soil chemistry and the high responsiveness of plants
    and their secretions into the rhizosphere increase the variability and diversity
    of potential nanomaterial transformations (Fig. 3). Many such factors are interlinked;
    for example, nanomaterial transformations are affected by the soil and plant microbiome
    and the extracellular polymeric substances and plant root exudates around the
    rhizosphere. However, plant root exudate and the microbiome can affect each other
    and both may be altered by exposure to nanomaterials, which in turn can affect
    the nanomaterial transformation processes. Changes to the microbiome will affect
    the nitrogen-cycling processes in soil. Foliar applied nanomaterials can be translocated
    downwards to the roots and interact with phyllosphere components such as microorganisms
    and leaf exudates. All of the above areas are also subject to change and disruption
    as a result of climate change—for example, changes in CO2 concentration and temperature
    can shift nutrient cycling, alter rates of reactions and transformations and change
    plant susceptibility to nanomaterials, among other effects. Therefore, the dynamic
    nature of the whole system needs to be considered, making this a perfect candidate
    for AI and machine learning solutions, by integrating existing predictive models
    for nanomaterials corona formation (for example, those based on binding affinities
    and Hamaker constants92) or machine learning models using biophysicochemical characteristics
    of proteins, nanomaterials and solution conditions via random-forest classification47,
    with databases of plant and microbe secretomics and plant proteomes to develop
    corona evolution and exchange models. Compared with prediction of small-molecule
    toxicity, nanoinformaticians tend to work with smaller datasets (sometimes including
    only a few nanomaterial variants), and typically use exposure concentrations and
    time points as a means to expand the dataset. Thus, evaluation of the impact of
    nanomaterials on NUE in a hydroponic system, for example, could assess a panel
    of 8–10 nanomaterials and gauge their effects alone and in combination with fertilizer
    at different ratios and over different timescales, and determine the nitrogen
    concentrations in the water and plant mass and gaseous emissions under controlled
    temperatures and CO2 levels. This would provide a multi-factorial dataset for
    establishment of machine learning models to predict the NUE of a new nanomaterial,
    as long as its physicochemical characteristics fell within the domain of applicability
    of the model; that is, if at least one of the nanomaterials in the training and
    test set overlapped with the properties of the new nanomaterial. If the nanomaterials
    were characterized over time under different conditions—for example, in terms
    of their size, dissolution and acquired corona composition—further models could
    be built predicting corona composition and nanomaterials fate and behaviour, identifying
    the key nanomaterials properties and environmental factors driving the specific
    effect. If data on plant growth (roots and shoots) or localization of the nanomaterials
    in the plants were determined, increasingly complete models of NUE could be developed,
    taking into account the nanomaterial localization and speciation within the plant.
    System complexity can then be increased by moving to soils, where nanomaterial
    characterization is more challenging, but where models for the environmental fate
    of the nanomaterials—such as the NanoFASE soil–water–organism model, which predicts
    the fate of nanomaterials in the environment43—may already exist. Thus, the initial
    steps will be small, but as the datasets and models emerge, their integration
    with other models and tools into overall IATA and agricultural systems models
    will become feasible and achievable. A roadmap for progress Smart and nano-enabled
    agriculture combined with AI and machine learning capabilities offer an exciting
    convergence of technologies with the unique capability to address the overarching
    SDG2. The impetus for smart agriculture is therefore multi-pronged: from enhancing
    and sustaining productivity through nano-enabled (responsive) delivery of agrochemicals
    to crops, to reduction in environmental pollution and negative human health impacts
    from agriculture. The grand challenges in agriculture can only be solved if the
    power of nanomaterials can be harnessed safely, responsibly and sustainably. Nanoinformatics
    will have a vital role in probing the design parameters, the plant and ecosystem
    responses, and their co-optimization for safe and sustainable agriculture. For
    example, AI may predict nanomaterial impacts on the agricultural ecosystem and
    their performance in improving agricultural production (NUE and reduction in air
    and water pollution forms of key elements), by integrating experimental data from
    across different soil conditions, plant species, climate conditions and nanomaterial
    physicochemical properties to predict both the nanomaterials impacts on the agricultural
    system (on plants and soil) and the impacts of the agricultural system on the
    nanomaterials in terms of their transformations, transport and bioavailability.
    This will enable safer-by-design development of nano-agrichemicals and co-optimization
    of both safety and desired functionality of the nanomaterials. For example, the
    potential impact of nanomaterials for remobilization of pesticide residue contaminants
    of soil resulting from decades of pesticide use remains an unexplored area, and
    indeed monitoring of pesticide residues in soil is not currently required at the
    European Union (EU) level despite the known degradation of soil quality, in contrast
    to the water monitoring regulated by the EU Water Framework Directive103. Future
    research directions to address these challenges are outlined here and summarized
    in Box 2. Box 2 Future research needs • Determine the long-term fate of nanomaterials,
    including transformation, transport in soil, and uptake and translocation in plants,
    curate these data and the accompanying metadata into nanomaterials knowledge bases
    and enrich them with global soil and weather characteristics, knowledge of plant
    biology (including proteome, secretome and transcriptomics data), global pesticide
    use datasets, soil microbial community characteristics and any other relevant
    datasets to facilitate development of deep learning models tailored to specific
    nanomaterials being developed for nano-agriculture and the local environmental
    conditions, crop rotations and historical and future needs. Show more Understand
    the long-term fate of nanomaterials in agricultural environments Transformation
    of nanomaterials will change their original designed properties, which may affect
    their function as fertilizers, pesticides, carriers or sensors. The transformation
    could occur in soil, at the plant interface (for example, root or leaf surface)
    or inside the plant. In soil, the transformation could be driven by soil texture
    and chemistry, and by interactions with soil microorganisms and animals. Plant
    interfaces, including the rhizosphere and phyllosphere, are critical locations
    for nanomaterials transformation. The transformations in these regions are driven
    by the dynamic and complex composition, including plant metabolites and microorganisms.
    Nanomaterials may also be transformed during their translocation in plant vascular
    structure by interacting with plant fluids. All of these areas remain largely
    unknown and thus generation of datasets that are deposited in open access databases
    is urgently required. Another critical question is how to effectively deliver
    nanomaterials to target different locations in plants. This requires a clear understanding
    of the uptake and translocation of the nanomaterials. Both the leaf and root contain
    physiological barriers to prevent the entry of unwanted substances, and the structures
    of these two organs are very different. Nanomaterials that enter the leaf translocate
    downward in phloem, whereas those entering roots translocate upward in the xylem.
    The fluid composition and flow rate in xylem and phloem may greatly affect the
    translocation and accumulation of nanomaterials in plant. Data and predictive
    models for these questions are all required urgently. Assess the long-term life
    cycle impact of nanomaterials in the agricultural ecosystem Given the fact that
    repeated application of nanotechnology in agriculture will become possible in
    the future, long-term retention of nanomaterials in agricultural soil is inevitable.
    The majority of current studies regarding plant–nanomaterials interactions are
    phenomenological observations of nanomaterials toxicity under short-term, high-dose
    conditions. Long-term, low-dose effects of nanomaterials on agroecosystems therefore
    also need to be studied, addressing nanomaterial impacts on plant growth, microbial
    activity and community structure, soil health (for example, soil enzyme activity
    and nutrient cycling), trophic transfer of nanomaterials and transgenerational
    effects. Use of multiple doses, multiple sampling time points and a wide panel
    of nanomaterials, a range of different soil conditions or different plants under
    identical exposure conditions will facilitate implementation of data-hungry machine
    learning models, although meta-analysis and computational gap filling of smaller
    datasets is also helping to accelerate the pace of development of nanomaterials
    models. Take a systems-level approach to nano-enabled agriculture The behaviour,
    fate and impact of nanomaterials in the soil–plant system, plants and microorganisms
    are all interconnected. As shown in Fig. 3 and described above, change of one
    factor may induce a change of the whole system. Given the power of AI and the
    complexity of the optimization challenges facing nano-agriculture, it is clear
    that their convergence offers exciting new directions (Fig. 4). Using extensive
    existing models and datasets for soil quality, crop yield and NUE, for example,
    and combining these with models and datasets related to plant and microbial secretomes,
    nanomaterials physicochemical properties, transformations and bioavailability,
    and release of active ingredients, could enable important new insights into: (1)
    the probable transformation pathways for the nanomaterials and their resulting
    environmental transport and bioavailability; (2) the potential impact of the nanomaterial
    and its associated active ingredients (in cases where the nanomaterial is a carrier)
    on crop yield and NUE; and (3) potential identification of biomarkers of crop
    health and disease that can be used as early warning systems. Identification of
    data gaps can also drive the design of focused experiments to fill the gaps or
    to develop sub-models for gap filling or prediction of specific parameters, to
    be integrated into an overall model framework enabling design of combinations
    of nanomaterials and active ingredients that optimize NUE and minimize pollution
    while enhancing crop yield and potentially even nutritional (calorific) value.
    Integration of safe-by-design approaches and feeding forward the emerging knowledge
    into the updating of regulatory processes for advanced nano-enabled agricultural
    applications, both in fertilization and in plant protection, are also essential.
    Fig. 4: Approach to integration of AI models needed to assess nanomaterials behaviour,
    fate and impact in agriculture based on the interplay between nanomaterial and
    environmental factors including the crop type and soil characteristics. Application
    of automated tools for harvesting data from public databases and pre-processing
    and curation of the data for direct input into the AI or machine learning models—for
    example, using the Enalos tools56 in KNIME—ensures that the output data from one
    model can serve as the input data for subsequent models, thereby facilitating
    model integration and development of increasingly multiplexed predictions for
    nano-enabled precision agriculture. A number of potential multi-object optimization
    machine learning modelling outputs are shown in the far right panel to inspire
    the development of the field. Full size image Systems-wide approaches can also
    support pre-emptive identification of potential challenges or solutions arising
    from use of nanomaterials. For example, integrating knowledge on the historical
    use of pesticides and the accumulation of pesticide residues in soils globally
    could potentially identify specific nanomaterials with high affinities for such
    residues, leading to their remobilization and unintended uptake into plants. Thus,
    the convergence of nanotechnology and AI or machine learning will also support
    efforts under the EU Green Deal, and could be used to identify hot spots and/or
    optimized nanomaterial compositions for soil remediation, for example, as well
    as supporting impact assessment and helping in efforts to protect soil fertility,
    reduce soil erosion and the overuse of nutrients, while increasing soil organic
    matter levels as part of an overall adoption of sustainable soil management practices,
    including as part of the forthcoming revision to the Common Agricultural Policy,
    which a recent report has suggested is only marginally consistent with the ambitions
    of the EU Green Deal11. Extensive changes to EU legislation are expected in 2021,
    including the EU Soil Thematic Strategy and the Zero Pollution Action Plan for
    Air, Water and Soil, which will encompass a range of chemicals including pesticides.
    Use AI and machine learning to identify key nanospecific properties that initiate
    the effects or functions of nanomaterials There are multiple physicochemical properties
    of nanomaterials such as size, shape, surface charge, surface area, surface reactivity
    and crystal structure that can influence their transformations and toxicities.
    AI and machine learning will enable selection of the most critical parameters
    that determine and predict the behaviour of nanomaterials in soil and plant systems
    from large datasets (Fig. 4). The use of automated data retrieval from public
    databases, data pre-processing and gap filling, and automated splitting of the
    data into test and validation sets for modelling56 will facilitate the in silico
    design of NMs that can be delivered to plants efficiently. Nanomaterial transformations
    in different soil conditions and different rhizosphere compositions under changing
    climate conditions could also be predicted by integrating predictive models, enabling
    optimization of nanomaterials for agricultural application in a range of climatic
    and local conditions. Wider ecosystem effects and prediction of tripartite (nanomaterials–soil–plant)
    behaviours under future climate scenarios can also be predicted using, for example,
    Bayesian networks and deep learning approaches. Such models are especially important
    as they can operate under data scarcity, yet can easily incorporate new data as
    they emerge. Application of these emerging models to address the broader issues
    of food security, and to tackle SDG2—improved nutrition and promotion of sustainable
    agriculture—will provide important new intersectional insights and suggestions
    for ways forward. References Shahzad, A. N., Qureshi, M. K., Wakeel, A. & Misselbrook,

    for enhancing our understanding of genotype–phenotype\nrelationships and its relevance\
    \ to crop improvement\nJoshua N. Cobb • Genevieve DeClerck •\nAnthony Greenberg\
    \ • Randy Clark •\nSusan McCouch\nReceived: 1 November 2012 / Accepted: 8 February\
    \ 2013 / Published online: 8 March 2013\n\x02 The Author(s) 2013. This article\
    \ is published with open access at Springerlink.com\nAbstract\nMore accurate and\
    \ precise phenotyping strate-\ngies are necessary to empower high-resolution linkage\n\
    mapping and genome-wide association studies and for\ntraining genomic selection\
    \ models in plant improvement.\nWithin this framework, the objective of modern\
    \ pheno-\ntyping is to increase the accuracy, precision and throughput\nof phenotypic\
    \ estimation at all levels of biological orga-\nnization while reducing costs\
    \ and minimizing labor\nthrough automation, remote sensing, improved data inte-\n\
    gration and experimental design. Much like the efforts to\noptimize genotyping\
    \ during the 1980s and 1990s, design-\ning effective phenotyping initiatives today\
    \ requires multi-\nfaceted collaborations between biologists, computer sci-\n\
    entists, statisticians and engineers. Robust phenotyping\nsystems are needed to\
    \ characterize the full suite of genetic\nfactors that contribute to quantitative\
    \ phenotypic variation\nacross cells, organs and tissues, developmental stages,\n\
    years, environments, species and research programs. Next-\ngeneration phenotyping\
    \ generates signiﬁcantly more data\nthan previously and requires novel data management,\n\
    access and storage systems, increased use of ontologies to\nfacilitate data integration,\
    \ and new statistical tools for\nenhancing experimental design and extracting\
    \ biologically\nmeaningful signal from environmental and experimental\nnoise.\
    \ To ensure relevance, the implementation of efﬁcient\nand informative phenotyping\
    \ experiments also requires\nfamiliarity with diverse germplasm resources, population\n\
    structures, and target populations of environments. Today,\nphenotyping is quickly\
    \ emerging as the major operational\nbottleneck limiting the power of genetic\
    \ analysis and\ngenomic prediction. The challenge for the next generation\nof\
    \ quantitative geneticists and plant breeders is not only to\nunderstand the genetic\
    \ basis of complex trait variation, but\nalso to use that knowledge to efﬁciently\
    \ synthesize twenty-\nﬁrst century crop varieties.\nIntroduction\nAgriculture\
    \ faces tremendous challenges in the decades\nahead. The FAO predicts that population\
    \ and income\ngrowth will double the global demand for food by 2050,\neffectively\
    \ increasing competition for crops as sources\nof bioenergy, ﬁber and for other\
    \ industrial purposes\n(http://www.fao.org).\nCompounding\nthe\npressure\nfor\n\
    increased agricultural output are looming threats of water\nscarcity, soil fertility\
    \ constraints, and climate change.\nAddressing\nthese\nproblems\nwill\nrequire\n\
    innovative\napproaches to both the agronomic and the genetic com-\nponents of\
    \ crop production systems. More sustainable\nmanagement of renewable soil and\
    \ water resources, in\nconcert with more efﬁcient utilization of genetic diversity\n\
    will be key to achieving the necessary gains in productivity\nCommunicated by\

    \ al. 2011;\nPypers et al. 2011; McCouch et al. 2012).\nGenetic diversity provides\
    \ the basis for all plant\nimprovement. Historically, plant breeders have sought\
    \ to\nunderstand the nature of genetic variation by evaluating the\nperformance\
    \ of breeding populations over years and loca-\ntions. Using replication and sophisticated\
    \ experimental\ndesigns, they obtained useful insights about trait herita-\nbility,\
    \ the inﬂuence of environment, the breeding value of\ndifferent parents, and strategies\
    \ for selecting genetically\nsuperior offspring in the ﬁeld. With the dawn of\
    \ the\ngenomics era, emphasis began to shift toward the evalua-\ntion of genetic\
    \ diversity directly at the DNA level. This\napproach is of interest to geneticists\
    \ for the evolutionary\nand functional insights it brings, and to plant breeders\
    \ as a\nsource of tools for improving the power and efﬁciency of\nselection. Parallel\
    \ investments in genotyping and pheno-\ntyping have generated datasets that can\
    \ be associated with\neach other to address both basic and applied questions.\n\
    Geneticists are interested in the nature and origin of\nmutations and their functional\
    \ signiﬁcance in the context of\nboth qualitative and quantitative traits. Plant\
    \ breeders\nembrace genomics as a way to document and protect the\ngenetic composition\
    \ of plant varieties, trace pedigree\nrelationships, identify and select valuable\
    \ mutations, and\ngain insight into the nature of genotype by genotype\n(G9G)\
    \ and genotype by environment (G9E) interactions.\nThe ultimate goal of genomics\
    \ research in plant breeding is\nto contribute to improving the efﬁciency, effectiveness\
    \ and\neconomy of cultivar improvement.\nAs biology moves from a data-starved\
    \ and largely\nobservational discipline to a data-rich science capable of\nprediction,\
    \ it follows the path of physics and engineering\nthat came before. The tremendous\
    \ innovation in genomics\ntechnology over the last two decades has been driven\
    \ by\nmulti-faceted collaborations between chemists, biologists\nand engineers,\
    \ and today, costs continue to decline while\naccuracy and throughput continue\
    \ to increase (Elshire et al.\n2011; Tung et al. 2010). Correlated with the downward\n\
    trend in the cost of sequencing is the expanded use of high-\nresolution genotyping\
    \ in plant species that were previously\nignored by the genomics community, a\
    \ sampling of which\ninclude cassava, common bean, pea, sunﬂower, cowpea,\nand\
    \ grain amaranth (Bachlava et al. 2012; Ferguson et al.\n2011; Hyten et al. 2010;\
    \ Maughan et al. 2011; Smy´kal et al.\n2012; Varshney et al. 2009; Varshney et\
    \ al. 2010). In\naddition to offering new insights into diverse germplasm\nresources,\
    \ high-throughput genotyping and next-generation\nsequencing (NGS) make it possible\
    \ to efﬁciently leverage\ngenetic information across species. The power of whole-\n\
    genome sequencing as a unifying force in biology has\nmotivated the development\
    \ of diversity panels and large\nmapping populations in many crop species to facilitate\
    \ trait\ndissection and gene discovery (Atwell et al. 2010; Huang\net al. 2010;\
    \ McCouch et al. 2012; Yu et al. 2008; Zhao\net al. 2011a; Neumann et al. 2011;\
    \ Pasam et al. 2012). It\nhas also catalyzed new thinking about how to manipulate\n\
    the genetic variation that exists in elite gene pools (Chen\net al. 2011; Thomson\
    \ et al. 2011; Trebbi et al. 2011).\nWith the deluge of low-cost genomic information\
    \ on\nimportant crop species, a fundamental change in research\nemphasis is needed\
    \ to address the shortage of high-quality\nphenotypic information. At this time,\
    \ phenotyping has\nreplaced genotyping as the major operational bottleneck\nand\
    \ funding constraint of genetic analyses. Unlike geno-\ntyping, which is now highly\
    \ mechanized and essentially\nuniform across organisms, phenotyping is still a\
    \ cottage\nindustry, species-speciﬁc, labor intensive, and inevitably\nenvironmentally\
    \ sensitive. Further, while sequence varia-\ntion is theoretically ﬁnite, and\
    \ thus all sequence variants\ncould conceivably be discovered for a given crop\
    \ species,\nthere is no expectation that the phenome will ever be fully\ncharacterized\
    \ (Houle et al. 2010). The phenome of an\norganism is dynamic and conditional,\
    \ representing a com-\nplex set of responses to a multi-dimensional set of endog-\n\
    enous and exogenous signals that are integrated over the\nevolutionary and developmental\
    \ life history of an individ-\nual. Phenotypic information can be envisioned as\
    \ a con-\ntinuous stream of data that changes over the course of\ndevelopment\
    \ of species, a population or an individual in\nresponse to different environmental\
    \ conditions. While it can\nbe associated with genomic information to understand\
    \ the\ncomponents of phenotypic variation that are due to genetics,\nwith increasing\
    \ availability of high-density genotypic\ninformation, understanding genotype–phenotype\
    \ relation-\nships is becoming more dependent on the availability of\nhigh-quality\
    \ phenotypic and environmental information.\nOver the next two decades, the development\
    \ of pheno-\ntyping strategies will almost certainly mirror innovations in\ngenotyping\
    \ technology that have occurred over the last\n20 years, characterized by increasing\
    \ automation and\nthroughput (Rafalski and Tingey 1993; Perlin et al. 1995;\n\
    Shefﬁeld et al. 1995; Weber and Broman 2001). As the\nscience of phenotyping evolves,\
    \ emphasis will increasingly\nbe placed on generating information that is as accurate\n\
    (able to effectively measure traits and/or performance\ncharacteristics), precise\
    \ (small variance associated with\nreplicated measurement), and as relevant as\
    \ possible, while\nkeeping costs within reasonable limits. If developments in\n\
    genotyping offer a roadmap for where phenotyping is going\nin the future, these\
    \ objectives will be reached based on new\nforms of automation and collaborations\
    \ between biologists,\nengineers and computer scientists.\nThe purpose of this\
    \ review is to outline considerations\nrelated to the future of phenotyping as\
    \ the basis for asso-\nciation mapping and gene discovery as well as for\n868\n\
    Theor Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n123\ndeveloping predictive genomic selection\
    \ (GS) models for\ncrop improvement.\nAssociation between phenotype and genotype\n\
    The central challenge of modern genetic analysis is to\nunderstand the biological\
    \ determinants of quantitative\nphenotypic variation. To date efforts in the plant\
    \ genetics\ncommunity have done well at identifying genes underlying\ntraits controlled\
    \ by one or a few loci with large effects.\nThis is particularly true in the major\
    \ crop species where\ngenetic analyses have identiﬁed the biochemical basis of\n\
    many important phenotypes (particularly, resistance to\nbiotic and abiotic stress)\
    \ and have also been the driving\nforce behind the development of tools for marker-assisted\n\
    selection in crop improvement (Foolad and Panthee 2012;\nJin et al. 2010; Paux\
    \ et al. 2010; Robbins et al. 2010).\nHowever, understanding complex trait variation\
    \ has proven\nfrustratingly difﬁcult, as the genetic architecture of these\nimportant\
    \ traits often involves many loci of small effect\nthat may interact with each\
    \ other as well as with the\nenvironment (Buckler et al. 2009; Collard and Mackill\n\
    2008; Schuster 2011). To discriminate such small effects, a\ncombination of technologies\
    \ and statistical methods are\nnow being employed. NGS technologies have provided\
    \ an\neconomically feasible way to survey genetic variation with\na resolution\
    \ that is now limited more by the linkage dis-\nequilibrium (LD) in a particular\
    \ mapping population than\nby marker density. This phenomenon has motivated the\n\
    assembly of large panels of genetic diversity as well as the\ncreation of large\
    \ inter-mated populations to manipulate LD\nand facilitate the association of\
    \ genotype with phenotype\n(Huang et al. 2011; Morris et al. 2013; Yu et al. 2008;\
    \ Zhao\net al. 2011a). These large and diverse populations aim to\nincrease the\
    \ recombination frequency and the frequency of\nrare alleles in order to enhance\
    \ the power to infer the\neffects of individual loci. This also highlights the\
    \ need for\ncareful population design and advocates for the inclusion\nof admixed\
    \ lines that may provide statistically useful\nobservations\nof\nallele\neffects\n\
    in\ndiverse\ngenetic\nbackgrounds.\nPhenotyping for genomic selection\nThe emphasis\
    \ on precision-phenotyping represents a sig-\nniﬁcant change for breeders engaged\
    \ in variety develop-\nment who have traditionally favored simplicity, speed,\
    \ and\nﬂexibility over sensitivity, precision and accuracy. This is\nbecause,\
    \ historically the advantages of the latter could not\nbe translated into economically\
    \ relevant genetic gain in a\nbreeding context. We argue that this paradigm is\
    \ beginning\nto change with the potential to integrate GS into a variety\ndevelopment\
    \ program. As the cost and efﬁciency of\nobtaining genomic information on large\
    \ numbers of indi-\nviduals dips below the cost and efﬁciency of evaluating\n\
    populations phenotypically over years and environments,\nthe breeding community\
    \ is alert to the idea that genomic\ninformation can be leveraged to predict phenotypic\
    \ out-\ncomes (Cabrera-Bosquet et al. 2012; Heffner et al. 2009;\nHeslot et al.\
    \ 2012). Further, the use of Bayesian models\nfacilitates the analysis of sparse\
    \ data (where not all indi-\nviduals or families are evaluated phenotypically\
    \ in each\nenvironment) and strongly suggests that there are cost-\neffective\
    \ experimental designs that can dramatically reduce\nthe amount of replication\
    \ needed to extract meaningful\nphenotypic performance indicators for a population\
    \ (see\nsection on ‘‘Analysis, adjustment, and value extraction of\nphenotypic\
    \ data’’).\nIf the accuracy of genomic predictions is sufﬁcient to\noffset the\
    \ time and expense required to evaluate the per-\nformance of the breeding populations\
    \ in the traditional\nmanner, and if GS demonstrates a clear increase in the rate\n\
    of genetic gain per cycle of selection, then breeders will\nquickly adopt the\
    \ most efﬁcient strategy to accomplish\ntheir goals. This may require staggered\
    \ use of traditional\nand precision-phenotyping, depending on the trait(s) and\n\
    the species under consideration. What is important is\nbreeders begin to reevaluate\
    \ how a focused investment in\nprecision-phenotyping of a training population\
    \ may be able\nto minimize the requirement for costly, extensive pheno-\ntyping\
    \ of large numbers of lines every generation in the\nfuture. The purpose of this\
    \ paper is to explore some of the\nkey dimensions of next-generation phenotyping\
    \ that will\nallow geneticists and breeders to productively interrogate\nthe complex\
    \ me´nage-a`-trois between genotype, phenotype\nand the environment as well as\
    \ to develop models that\nleverage genotypic information to predict phenotypic\n\
    outcomes.\nUnder a GS model, precision-phenotyping is most\nimportant when evaluating\
    \ a training population because\nthat dataset provides the basis for developing\
    \ the statistical\nmodel that is then used to predict phenotypic performance\n\
    in related members of a breeding population. The model is\nderived from the relationship\
    \ between phenotype, geno-\ntype, and G9E, where marker genotypes are treated\
    \ as\nrandom variables. GS is particularly useful when it can\nsave a generation\
    \ or two of time-consuming and expensive\nphenotyping, as only comparatively small\
    \ training popu-\nlations need be screened.\nGenomic selection aims to model genome-wide\
    \ SNP\nvariation without concern for identifying particular alleles,\nloci or\
    \ pathways or understanding how different alleles\ncontribute to the phenotype.\
    \ Since the metric of success is\nthe ability to predict the performance of an\
    \ adapted line or\nTheor Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n869\n123\nvariety under\
    \ relevant agronomic conditions, it is important\nto consider phenotyping strategies\
    \ that (1) estimate crop\nperformance under appropriate management conditions\
    \ in\nthe ﬁeld; (2) can evaluate performance across a population\nof target environments;\
    \ and (3) can generate useful data in\nreal time without a disproportionate investment\
    \ in labor\nand infrastructure. Despite the advantages of accelerating\nthe breeding\
    \ cycle, the ability of GS models to accurately\npredict phenotype is dependent\
    \ on using prohibitively large\ntraining populations when working with traits\
    \ with low\nheritability and complex inheritance (Calus et al. 2008;\nGuo et al.\
    \ 2012; Hayes et al. 2009; Heffner et al. 2010; Jia\nand Jannink 2012; Kumar et\
    \ al. 2012; Nakaya and Isobe\n2012; Munoz et al. 2011; Resende et al. 2012; Zhao\
    \ et al.\n2011b; Zhong et al. 2009). This is due to the fact that G9E\ninteraction\
    \ plays a major role in explaining ﬁeld perfor-\nmance, and GS is highly dependent\
    \ on a prediction model\ndeveloped from a limited sampling of the environmental\n\
    variance. Recombination also disrupts phasing of markers\nand leads to low accuracy\
    \ of predictions as breeding gen-\nerations are farther and farther removed from\
    \ the training\npopulation. Further research is needed to improve the\naccuracy\
    \ of prediction under GS models.\nPhenotyping for QTL and gene discovery\nIn contrast\
    \ to GS, phenotyping of a diversity panel for\ngenome-wide association studies\
    \ (GWAS) or a bi-parental\nmapping population for QTL analysis is designed to\n\
    interpret and dissect the genetic architecture of complex\ntraits and to understand\
    \ how speciﬁc DNA variants con-\ndition the inheritance of diverse phenotypes.\
    \ Both forms of\nlinkage mapping are successful at implicating genomic\nregions\
    \ involved in complex trait variation, but cloning the\ngene(s) underlying the\
    \ QTL remains time-consuming and\nresource intensive, even when the QTL explains\
    \ a sub-\nstantial proportion of the phenotypic variation (Bhatta-\ncharyya 2010;\
    \ Fan et al. 2006; Krattinger et al. 2009; Li\net al. 2010; Liu et al. 2008; Saito\
    \ et al. 2010). Bi-parental\npopulations are limited by the particular alleles\
    \ present in\nthe parents, but they offer power for QTL dissection\nbecause population\
    \ structure is disrupted and genetic\nbackground differences in the progeny are\
    \ constrained.\nAssociation mapping studies, on the other hand, generally\nprovide\
    \ higher resolution of QTL for the same number of\nlines and evaluate a wider\
    \ array of alleles but are limited by\nthe inability to interrogate rare alleles\
    \ or to dissect phe-\nnotypes that are perfectly correlated with population\n\
    structure (Manolio and Collins 2009; Price et al. 2006;\nPritchard and Cox 2002;\
    \ Reich and Lander 2001). When\nlarge numbers of markers are used for either QTL\
    \ analysis\nor GWAS, a multiple test correction is required to limit the\nfalse\
    \ discovery rate. With ever-improving approaches to\nstatistical modeling and\
    \ improvements in the accuracy and\nprecision of phenotyping, both forms of linkage\
    \ mapping\nhold great promise for elucidating the genetic architecture\nof complex\
    \ traits and identifying the genes and speciﬁc\nalleles underlying trait variation.\n\
    Sampling vs. controlling environmental variation\nDifferent approaches to phenotyping\
    \ are required for dif-\nferent purposes (Campos et al. 2004; Crouch et al. 2009;\n\
    Gordon and Finch 2005; Kloth et al. 2012; Masuka et al.\n2012; Pieruschka and\
    \ Poorter 2012). Plant breeders have\ntraditionally relied on large-scale replication\
    \ of phenotypic\ntrials over years and locations to identify individual fami-\n\
    lies or populations that perform best in a target population\nof environments\
    \ (TPE). By modeling locations and years as\nrandom effects, they were able to\
    \ reliably extract genetic\nsignal from environmental noise and identify varieties\
    \ with\nbroad or narrow zones of adaptation (Beavis 1998), though\nthe process\
    \ was very time and labor consuming. Many\ngeneticists, on the other hand study\
    \ phenotypic variation at\nthe cell or tissue-speciﬁc level using plants grown\
    \ under\ncarefully deﬁned environmental conditions, and evaluate\ncascades of\
    \ molecular events using biochemical and\n‘‘omics’’ technology. The world of the\
    \ plant breeder and\nthat of the molecular geneticist intersect at the level of\
    \ the\nplant, but the different scales of phenotyping make it\nchallenging to\
    \ integrate the knowledge contributed by each\ncommunity into a uniﬁed and comprehensive\
    \ view of the\ngenetic determinants of plant growth, development and\nresponse\
    \ to environment.\nUnder ﬁeld conditions, it is often convenient to collapse\n\
    quantitative phenotypes into discrete categories to facilitate\nmanual data collection\
    \ in real time and at reasonable cost.\nThis has been the practice for many years\
    \ among breeders\nand geneticists working with large, ﬁeld-grown popula-\ntions,\
    \ and different communities of researchers have\ndeveloped standardized categorical\
    \ scales or indices for\nimportant whole-plant phenotypes that are easy to apply\n\
    (Clarke et al. 1992; De Boever et al. 1993; International\nRice Research Institute\
    \ 1996; Kuhn and Smith 1977; Mo-\nlina-Cano 1987; Yuan et al. 2004). For example,\
    \ traits such\nas ﬂowering time or disease resistance are frequently\nestimated\
    \ using a visual assessment of ‘‘days to 50 %\nﬂowering’’ in a row or plot, or\
    \ ‘‘percent leaf area affected’’\non individual diseased plants. Historically,\
    \ trait evaluation\nusing these indices was reliable enough to provide rea-\n\
    sonable data in the context of plant breeding. However,\nnew population designs\
    \ (Yu et al. 2008) in combination\nwith high-density marker coverage have increased\
    \ the\npower to detect small-effect QTL and estimate their\n870\nTheor Appl Genet\
    \ (2013) 126:867–887\n123\neffects, even on whole-plant phenotypes. This suggests\
    \ that\nmore rigorous, quantitative approaches to phenotyping are\nlikely to bring\
    \ rewards. Further, when there is signiﬁcant\nvariability in phenotypic scores\
    \ collected by different\nindividuals, more objective phenotyping protocols are\n\
    desirable (Poland and Nelson 2010).\nRecently, it has been argued that automated,\
    \ high-\nthroughput, ﬁeld-based organismal phenotyping techniques\ninvolving remote\
    \ sensing (such as near-infrared spectros-\ncopy mounted on agricultural harvesters\
    \ to measure spec-\ntral canopy reﬂectance with the aid of global positioning\n\
    system (GPS)-guided tractors) will enhance the precision\nand accuracy of phenotyping\
    \ without extracting plants\nfrom the production environment (Cabrera-Bosquet\
    \ et al.\n2012; Houle et al. 2010; Montes et al. 2007; Tuberosa\n2012; White et\
    \ al. 2012). While these efforts can certainly\nfacilitate selection for enhanced\
    \ performance in a target\nzone of adaptation, one of the biggest challenges associated\n\
    with these automated, ﬁeld-based technologies is the var-\niable nature of most\
    \ natural environments.\nTo enhance the ability to screen for stress tolerance\
    \ in\nﬁeld-grown plants, scientists often use plant populations to\n‘sample’ the\
    \ degree of stress encountered in a TPE. Once\nthis has been ascertained, the\
    \ TPE is used to evaluate the\nrelative performance of different populations over\
    \ several\ngrowing seasons. This requires signiﬁcant up-front invest-\nment, as\
    \ many different locations must be tested over\nmultiple years in order to make\
    \ an accurate estimation.\nAlternatively, breeders use ‘‘managed stress’’ as a\
    \ way of\noptimizing screening protocols for application to large\nplant populations\
    \ in the ﬁeld. By managing the amount and\ntiming of water, fertilizer, pest control\
    \ or soil amendments,\nplants can be exposed to fairly reliable levels of stress\n\
    while experiencing normal temperature, day length, etc.,\nover the course of the\
    \ growing season. These approaches\nwork well if the genetic component of phenotypic\
    \ variation\n(heritability) is high, and if the differences among popu-\nlations\
    \ or individuals within a population are large. How-\never, in cases where complex\
    \ traits are conditioned by\nmany alleles with small effects, the error associated\
    \ with\nestimating the phenotype and the environmental variance\ncontributing\
    \ to the observed phenotypic variation are likely\nto dilute the relatively weak\
    \ genetic signals and may pre-\nclude their detection.\nTo partially overcome\
    \ this problem, many researchers\nhave endeavored to take advantage of phenotyping\
    \ strate-\ngies based on analytical chemistry (i.e. gas chromatogra-\nphy–mass\n\
    spectroscopy,\nhigh\nperformance\nliquid\nchromatography, inductively coupled\
    \ plasma spectroscopy,\netc.) or a wide range of -omics technologies (transcripto-\n\
    mics, metabolomics, ionomics, proteomics, etc.). These are\nall highly automated\
    \ and are important and useful due to\ntheir high throughput and high accuracy.\
    \ They are\ngenerally used to analyze speciﬁc anatomical parts of a\nplant at\
    \ a particular time(s) in its development, and are best\nused on plants grown\
    \ under well-deﬁned growing condi-\ntions. Owing to the high cost per sample and\
    \ the require-\nment\nfor\nconsiderable\ntechnical\nexpertise\nand\ninfrastructure,\
    \ these techniques may not be available to\neveryone and it may not be economically\
    \ feasible to survey\nlarge numbers of ﬁeld-grown plants. Thus, it often makes\n\
    sense to ﬁrst screen a population under controlled condi-\ntions with minimal\
    \ replication and once a hypothesis about\nthe genetic control of a trait of interest\
    \ is formulated, it can\nbe tested in a focused way in the ﬁeld, or simply used\
    \ to\neliminate a large proportion of a population prior to\nundertaking ﬁeld\
    \ evaluation.\nScreening populations under controlled conditions is\nalso appropriate\
    \ when the controlled environment is nec-\nessary to impose a particular form\
    \ of stress or to permit\ngrowth of plants under speciﬁc conditions that cannot\
    \ be\nreplicated in the ﬁeld. Controlled environments have been\nsuccessfully\
    \ used to inoculate plants with a particular strain\nof a pathogen, or to impose\
    \ a particular abiotic stress such\nas aluminum toxicity without the natural coupling\
    \ with\nphosphorus deﬁciency, or high CO2 in combination with a\ncritical night\
    \ time temperature. Use of multi-step strategies\ninvolving both controlled and\
    \ ﬁeld environments are often\nthe best way to maximize the extraction of useful\
    \ genetic\ninformation while minimizing the expense and time\ninvolved (Fernie\
    \ and Schauer 2009; Rafalski 2010).\nDrought tolerance as an illustration\nWhile\
    \ a complete survey of advances in drought pheno-\ntyping is beyond the scope\
    \ of this review (see Mir et al.\n2012 for a detailed overview of this topic),\
    \ drought toler-\nance offers a compelling example of a combined approach\nof\
    \ leveraging both controlled and uncontrolled phenotyp-\ning designs to enhance\
    \ genetic analysis. The onset of water\ndeﬁcit and its impact on plant performance\
    \ is a dynamic\nprocess that occurs across space and time. Under ﬁeld\nconditions\
    \ the inability to obtain standardized and consis-\ntent drought stress contributes\
    \ to a loss in heritability and\npresents a challenge for both selection and mapping\n\
    experiments (Berger et al. 2010). Many different approa-\nches have been used\
    \ to apply deﬁned levels of drought\nstress in an effort to understand the nature\
    \ of this complex\ntrait, ranging from chemically manipulating osmotic bal-\n\
    ance in hydroponics (Rengasamy 2010; Tavakkoli et al.\n2010) to conveyer systems\
    \ in glasshouses with digitally\ncontrolled irrigation systems (Granier et al.\

    \ houses) or out-\nsourced to a phenotyping facility such as the Ju¨lich Plant\n\

    \ Australia; http://www.plant\nphenomics.org/HRPPC). The two former facilities\
    \ are part of\nthe larger European Plant Phenomics Network (http://\nwww.plant-phenotyping-network.eu/)\
    \ and the latter two are\npart of the Australian Plant Phenomics Facility (http://www.\n\
    plantphenomics.org.au/). Each system presents its own\nadvantages and disadvantages,\
    \ but collectively they empower\nthe researcher to investigate plant response\
    \ to drought in ways\nthat are more comprehensive than any one design can offer.\n\
    These approaches are most often utilized for linkage mapping\nand gene discovery,\
    \ and once QTL or candidate genes are\nidentiﬁed, they can be validated for practical\
    \ application by\nevaluating speciﬁc germplasm, genetic stocks or breeding\npopulations\
    \ under managed drought conditions in the ﬁeld (Ali\net al. 2010; Cavanagh et\
    \ al. 2008; Huang et al. 2012; Kholova´\net al. 2010; Saisho and Takeda 2011;\
    \ Venuprasad et al. 2011;\nYadav et al. 2011). If validated, lines carrying the\
    \ genes or\nQTLs of interest will be useful for elucidating the molecular\nmechanism(s)\
    \ involved in the component trait(s), and will also\nbe of immediate value as\
    \ donor material for breeding with elite\ngermplasm.\nExamining the relationship\
    \ between phenotypic varia-\ntion under controlled environments and that observed\n\
    under ﬁeld conditions offers valuable insights that can be\nused to iteratively\
    \ improve controlled environment phe-\nnotyping techniques so they are more predictive\
    \ of plant\nperformance in the ﬁeld (Table 1; Fig. 1). Ultimately, the\nchoice\
    \ of phenotyping approach will depend on the inten-\ntion of the researcher, the\
    \ size of the population in question\n[e.g. less than ten individuals for precise\
    \ physiological\nexperiments, to a moderate number of lines (200–400) for\nmapping\
    \ studies or GS training populations, or a large\nnumber of lines (400–1,000?)\
    \ for association studies], the\nheritability of the phenotype, the tractability\
    \ of the phe-\nnotype to controlled environment testing, and resource\navailability.\n\
    Development of technology and phenotyping tools\nThe creative use of technology\
    \ and careful development of\ntools to automate processes without sacriﬁcing predictive\n\
    power will be critical as next-generation phenotyping\nplatforms are developed.\
    \ This can be a real challenge as\nmany\nexperimental\ntechniques\nin\nplant\n\
    physiology,\nmolecular biology and breeding can be restrictive and\nrequire specialized\
    \ protocols that are often difﬁcult to\nstandardize. The integration of these\
    \ approaches will be\nnecessary to fully interrogate the genetic landscape of\n\
    complex traits. Standardized phenotyping systems are not\nfeasible for all research\
    \ questions, but with thorough con-\nsideration and clearly deﬁned objectives,\
    \ many techniques\ncan be harnessed to investigate speciﬁc traits under high-\n\
    throughput settings.\nIn recent years, automation, imaging, and software\nsolutions\
    \ have paved the way for many high-throughput\nphenotyping studies. Semi-automated\
    \ systems have been\nsuccessfully applied to investigate various components of\n\
    plant growth and development, and can be used to help\ntackle basic research questions\
    \ when combined with\ngenetic mapping strategies (Famoso et al. 2010). Addi-\n\

    \ to manage and perform large-scale\ngrowth screens in laboratory, greenhouse\
    \ and ﬁeld envi-\nronments (Nagel et al. 2012).\nAside from mechanization, digital\

    \ in ways previously unattainable using\nconventional metrics. Large image data\
    \ sets, however,\nrequire novel software solutions in order to process and\nextract\
    \ meaningful estimates of phenotypic variation. Most\nimage analysis tools for\
    \ plant phenotyping incorporate\npredeﬁned processing and analysis procedures\
    \ into semi-\nautomatic or automatic routines in order to quantify mul-\ntiple\
    \ phenotypes from single images or groups of images.\nIn its essence, high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping means\nintegrating and optimizing a phenotyping process in a way\n\
    that makes it as efﬁcient and controlled as possible. In\nconsidering efﬁciency,\
    \ several questions and decisions\narise related to the accuracy, precision, automation,\
    \ and\nadaptability of various stages of the phenotyping process,\nfrom growth\
    \ techniques to experimental design and man-\nagement practices to data capture\
    \ and analysis strategies.\nThe accuracy and precision of the treatment and mea-\n\
    surement process is a fundamental concern during any\nexperimental procedure.\
    \ During phenotyping studies where\nmultiple individuals and replicates from different\
    \ genetic\nbackgrounds are evaluated across batches, effectively\ncontrolling\
    \ the accuracy and precision of the phenotyping\nsystem will have direct impacts\
    \ on the outcome of the\nanalysis. Accuracy and precision are intimately interre-\n\
    lated, where accuracy represents how close the process or\nmeasurement is to the\
    \ absolute truth and precision repre-\nsents the repeatability or variance of\
    \ the measurement\nprocess. Accuracy is important when there is variation\nacross\
    \ individual genotypes during mapping experiments.\nFor instance, Clark et al.\
    \ (2011) characterized the root\nsystems of a rice bi-parental recombinant inbred\
    \ line (RIL)\npopulation, and found that one parental genotype had\ndense, highly\
    \ branched root systems while the other had\nlong, sparse root systems. In order\
    \ to clearly capture these\ndifferences, a system needed to be designed that could\n\
    correctly quantify both types of root systems in order to\nproperly assess their\
    \ relationship and further analyze var-\niation within the progeny. Comparison\
    \ and validation\nstudies with known standards, such as the use of comple-\nmentary\
    \ imaging modalities or other quantiﬁcation soft-\nware, can help evaluate the\
    \ accuracy of a system.\nPrecision is critical when individual genotypes have\n\
    multiple replicates that are evaluated across several bat-\nches. Presuming that\
    \ the replicates share similar charac-\nteristics, the measurement system must\
    \ be able to quantify\nthe features in a repeatable way to prevent unpredictable\n\
    system noise from masking the true similarities/differences\nbetween the genotypes.\
    \ While there are statistical approa-\nches for accounting for unwarranted variability\
    \ in silico,\nefforts to improve the precision of data collection will only\n\
    serve to enhance the statistical power of any analysis per-\nformed. The key to\
    \ maintaining precision throughout a\nphenotyping activity is to employ stable\
    \ instrument designs\nthat can effectively control precision, such as the ﬁxed\n\
    lighting and camera setups used in the root systems in\nstudies cited previously.\n\
    Unfortunately, there will always be trade-offs between\nthe maintenance of accuracy,\
    \ precision, and the ultimate\nthroughput of the phenotyping approach. As throughput\n\
    and standardization increase, it necessitates a drop in\naccuracy and precision\
    \ that must be carefully monitored in\norder to maintain the economic feasibility\
    \ of the data\ncollection. It is not always straightforward to properly\nbalance\
    \ these trade-offs, but through iterative design and\ntesting, phenotyping tools\
    \ can be established to satisfy\nresearch objectives and meet resource constraints.\n\
    The level of automation employed by a phenotyping\napproach is counter-balanced\
    \ not only by trade-offs with\naccuracy\nand\nprecision,\nbut\nalso\nwith\nadaptability.\n\
    Increasing automation improves throughput and reduces\nlabor costs, but also results\
    \ in more specialized designs that\nhave less adaptability and predictive power,\
    \ and are prone\nto errors from non-standard individuals. This principle is\n\
    illustrated well when image analysis involves batch pro-\ncessing many photographs\
    \ using predeﬁned algorithms and\ncommands. It is fairly obvious that batch processing\
    \ is\ninvaluable during large-scale phenotyping experiments\nwhere thousands of\
    \ images can be generated daily, but this\nalso means that the software must rely\
    \ on a rigid set of\nconstraints. The quality of the images is usually not a\n\
    problem during high-throughput phenotyping where the\nimaging process is standardized,\
    \ but if any individuals\ndeviate from pre-speciﬁed growth assumptions of the\n\
    measurement algorithm, unpredictable and misleading\nmeasurement errors can arise.\
    \ Even with automated anal-\nysis algorithms that have been thoroughly tested,\
    \ it is\nnecessary for the experimenter to manually check and\nvalidate the system\
    \ outputs regularly. Along those same\nlines, incorporating user-guided processes\
    \ into the pheno-\ntyping pipeline can also provide a useful compromise that\n\
    improves the ﬂexibility while maintaining the efﬁciency\nneeded to perform large\
    \ experiments (Clark et al. 2012; Le\nBot et al. 2010; Lobet et al. 2011).\nMost\
    \ phenotyping tools that have been developed by\nresearch groups in the public\
    \ and private sector are inte-\ngrated in a way that makes them easy to disseminate\
    \ and\nuse, but sometimes this convenience can limit the range of\ntheir functionality\
    \ to other studies. While this has precip-\nitated the release of a number of\
    \ software programs\navailable for the extraction of phenotype data from images\n\
    (Table 2), the highly speciﬁc nature of individual pheno-\ntypes also motivates\
    \ the development of in-house tools\nideally suited to the analysis at hand. Although\
    \ it is not a\nsimple task, implementing modular designs will help\nincrease ﬂexibility\
    \ of phenotyping in the future. The\n874\nTheor Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n\

    \ of the software and make it\napplicable to wide range of research disciplines.\
    \ Modular\nconcepts have proven quite successful for the high-\nthroughput phenotyping\

    \ is GiaRoots,\na software program that allows users to incorporate their\nown\
    \ processing and algorithms into the automated analysis\nroutines as a way of\
    \ overcoming the limitations imposed by\nmore integrated approaches (Galkovskyi\
    \ et al. 2012).\nAccess, storage, and management of phenotypic data\nIt is clear\
    \ then, that much of next-generation phenotyping\nwill be done at the intersection\
    \ of the ﬁelds of biology,\nengineering, and computer science. Progress in developing\n\
    technology in these disciplines that empowers next-gener-\nation phenotyping strategies\
    \ is moving forward rapidly.\nHowever, congruent with the progress in the capability\
    \ to\ncollect high-throughput phenotypic data, is the growing\nproblem of managing\
    \ these data sets in ways that empower\nvalue extraction. Retroﬁtting a lab to\
    \ handle the rapid\ninﬂux of phenotype data could require signiﬁcant invest-\n\
    ment in facilities, device control systems and computa-\ntional resources.\nFor\
    \ experiments that are only measuring a few traits on a\npanel of germplasm, setting\
    \ up a local (customized) phe-\nnotyping system in-house might be practical; but\
    \ in such\ncases, a laboratory information management system (LIMS)\nor local\
    \ database may be needed to manage the high vol-\numes of phenotypic information.\
    \ Generally, there are no\n‘off the shelf’ solutions that can be applied universally,\
    \ so\nsome computer expertise will be needed for data manage-\nment. Even so,\
    \ organizing that information into a ‘‘phe-\nnome’’ is challenging because of\
    \ the continuous, multi-\nfaceted, and interpretive nature of what a phenotypic\n\
    observation is, contrasted with the ‘‘discrete’’ nature of\ngenotypic data, which\
    \ can be abstracted into a single\nalphabetical character (National Science Foundation\
    \ 2011).\nBeyond the technologies used to run, collect and digest\nlarge-scale\
    \ phenotypic evaluations, the ﬁeld of phenomics\nfaces similar bottlenecks that\
    \ genomics has been grappling\nwith as the drop in cost of DNA sequencing outpaces\
    \ the\ncost of hard drive data storage (Stein 2010). Though there\nis ample exploration\
    \ that can be done on genomic data\nalone, for many plant researchers, associating\
    \ and enrich-\ning genotype data with phenotypic manifestations contex-\ntualized\
    \ by the ﬁeld environment is a vital part of gaining\ntrue biological insight\
    \ and solving agronomic problems.\nThe storage of phenotype data at this scale\
    \ has become a\nsub-discipline on its own and some projects are dealing\nwith\
    \ it quite well. There are many public databases that\nhave been working to organize\
    \ and collate plant phenotype\ndata (Lai et al. 2012; Table 3), but most only\
    \ have the\ncurrent capacity to present free-text phenotypic descrip-\ntions of\
    \ mutants, e.g. SoyBase (Grant et al. 2010) and\nMaizeGDB (Schaeffer et al. 2011).\
    \ Some crop databases\nhave tried to move beyond this paradigm by including\n\
    functionality for the management of phenotypic measure-\nments, predominantly\
    \ from either managed ﬁeld trials or\nGWA studies [e.g. T3 Triticeae Toolbox (http://triticeae\n\
    toolbox.org), Panzea (Canaran et al. 2008), and Gramene’s\ndiversity module (Chen\
    \ et al. 2010)]. They are also among\na number of projects preparing for an increasing\
    \ amount of\nassociation data emerging from the marriage of powerful\ngenomic\
    \ information with next-generation phenotyping.\nOne effort is NCBI’s dbGAP (Mailman\
    \ et al. 2007), which\nwas created as a public repository for phenotypes, geno-\n\
    types and the associations between them. Currently, how-\never, dbGAP only accepts\
    \ human data.\nThere are a few database projects that specialize spe-\nciﬁcally\
    \ in plant phenomics data, and deserve to be high-\nlighted. The ﬁrst example\
    \ of these is PHENOPSIS DB\n(Juliette et al. 2011), which mainly houses information\n\
    regarding the growth response of Arabidopsis thaliana to\nvarious environmental\
    \ conditions. The database is popu-\nlated with phenotype information extracted\
    \ from images\nand measurements collected automatically in specialized\ngrowth\
    \ chambers. The collaborative international network\nfor ionomics ( http://www.ionomicshub.org;\
    \ Baxter et al.\n2007) is a second example that hosts ICP-mass spectrom-\netry\
    \ ionomics data for thousands of Arabidopsis, rice, and\nyeast samples with the\
    \ goal to facilitate the understanding\nof response mechanisms in plants to various\
    \ nutrient\navailabilities and/or abiotic toxicities.\nAdditionally, there are\
    \ other efforts in human and mouse\ngenomics research that could serve as useful\
    \ models for\ncontinued development in the plant phenomics domain.\nMouse genomics\
    \ informatics (MGI), (http://www.infor\nmatics.jax.org)\ncomprise\nseveral\ndatabase\n\
    projects,\nincluding the mouse genome database (MGD), (Eppig et al.\n2012) and\
    \ houses a variety of tools for searching and\nbrowsing large phenotype data sets.\
    \ PhenomicDB is\nanother, multi-species (primarily human, mouse, fruit ﬂy,\nand\
    \ yeast) resource designed to empower ‘‘comparative\nphenomics’’ (Kahraman et\
    \ al. 2005). The nutritional phe-\nnotype database (Van Ommen et al. 2010) is\
    \ a third, which\nfocuses on human nutritional phenotype data. The DbNP\neven\
    \ goes a step further than most databases by empha-\nsizing the importance of\
    \ the characterization and uniﬁca-\ntion of experimental designs and allows for\
    \ ﬁner grained\nstorage and searching protocol parameters. The DbNP\n876\nTheor\
    \ Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n123\nproject recently announced that it will\
    \ further expand the\nscope of the resource to include management of environ-\n\
    mental plant studies (http://www.dbnp.org).\nOne important feature shared among\
    \ many current dat-\nabases organizing phenotype data is the use of controlled\n\
    vocabularies known as ‘ontological terms’. Ontologies are\nsets of deﬁned keywords\
    \ that can be used as tags to qualify\nand describe features related to biological\
    \ data points and\ndata sets. Such ontological terms can be used to describe\n\
    traits, genes, environments, or taxonomy. As an example,\none might use the hierarchy\
    \ of terms ‘‘growth and devel-\nopment C shoot\ndevelopment C inﬂorescence\ndevelop-\n\
    ment C ﬂower development C ﬂowering time C days to\nﬂower’’ to describe formally\
    \ what is colloquially referred\nto as simply ‘‘ﬂowering time’’. While this is\
    \ an arguably\nsimple example, it is not difﬁcult to imagine the com-\nplexity\
    \ that ensues when trying to use ontologies to\ndescribe\ncomplicated\nmolecular\n\
    pathways.\nUsage\nof\nontologies is a critical step toward making diverse and\n\
    rapidly growing collections of biological data searchable,\nand accessible to\
    \ computational algorithms. The Open\nBiological and Biomedical Ontologies Foundry\
    \ (OBO\nfoundry) (Smith et al. 2007) has emerged as an important\ncentralized\
    \ repository for plant and animal ontological\ncollections, with the goal of increasing\
    \ standardization and\nmaximizing interoperability between ontologies. For plant\n\
    data the most commonly used ontologies include the plant\nontology (PO), (Avraham\
    \ et al. 2008; Jaiswal et al. 2005)\nthe plant trait ontology (TO), plant environment\
    \ ontology\n(EO), and the phenotypic quality ontology (PATO).\nUnfortunately,\
    \ all research groups do not universally\nadopt usage of these community standards\
    \ and without a\ncritical mass of ‘‘buy-in’’, their beneﬁts cannot be fully\n\
    realized. Also a great deal of time and resources go into the\ncuration and maintenance\
    \ of ontologies and projects rely\non term-based grant funding, which is not always\
    \ reliable.\nIn order to meet the demand imposed by the upscaling\nof phenotypic\
    \ data production, sophisticated computational\nmethods will need to be employed.\
    \ Phenotype data is\ncomplex and highly context sensitive, and crucial infor-\n\
    mation can potentially be lost when data descriptions are\nﬂattened down to only\
    \ a few ontology terms. As a way of\ndealing with this complexity, some groups\
    \ have been\nexploring the potential of the Semantic Web (Lee et al. 2001)\ntoexpandthedimensionalityofstoredbiologicaldata\
    \ inorder\nto more effectively mine the enormous volume of descriptive\ndata available\
    \ in the literature (Vision et al. 2011). The\nPhenoscape project (http://kb.phenoscape.org;\
    \ Mabee et al.\n2012) has been working on developing semantical search\nalgorithms\
    \ capable of linking biological data by relationships\nbetween ontological terms\
    \ and by similarities found between\nfree-text descriptions. Data are characterized\
    \ as statements of\nfact, where there is a subject (e.g. ‘‘a ﬂoret’’), a predicate\
    \ (e.g.\nTable 3\nA selection of integrated storage and maintenance systems designed\

    \ this approach adds some of the\nnecessary dimensionality for unlocking biological\
    \ meaning\nusing linguistic and intuitive tool sets.\nAnalysis, adjustment, and\
    \ value extraction\nof phenotypic data\nIndependent of the effort involved to\
    \ both collect and\nappropriately manage high-throughput phenotype data, the\n\
    data sets themselves are only as valuable as the analyses\nthat can be performed\
    \ on them. Great care must be taken to\nmake accurate inferences from the data\
    \ in order to cor-\nrectly characterize the genotype–phenotype relationship.\n\
    Correct estimations of genetic gain from selection, for\nexample, depend heavily\
    \ on accurate estimates of herita-\nbility and the covariance among phenotypes\
    \ (Dickerson\n1955). Because none of these parameters are directly\nobservable,\
    \ they must be estimated from data using a\nvariety of statistical models.\nWhile\
    \ the methods for measuring phenotypic data are\nbecoming more sophisticated and\
    \ the ability to catalog and\nquery data across experimental designs is becoming\
    \ more\nachievable, the precision of such data will always be lim-\nited by inherent\
    \ biological noise. This biological noise is\nunavoidable and is even present\
    \ under the most controlled\nexperimental conditions. These ﬂuctuations can be\
    \ local,\naffecting single organisms, or more general, inﬂuencing the\nwhole experiment\
    \ and modifying the phenotypes for the\nwhole replicate population. Furthermore,\
    \ where automation\nis impractical, and a team of researchers is employed to\n\
    conduct the experiment, individual bias can skew obser-\nvations, even in cases\
    \ where subjective criteria are not\ndirectly used to measure the phenotypes.\
    \ These problems\nare further compounded by the environmental variability\nthat\
    \ inconsistently affects phenotypic observation over\nboth space and time. Unpredictable\
    \ environmental condi-\ntions can also lead to a fair amount of missing data,\
    \ which\nin turn will limit the statistical power to make inferences\nabout the\
    \ genotypic contribution to the phenotype. In\naddition to biological and environmental\
    \ noise, variable\nassay quality can introduce further uncertainty and must be\n\
    accounted for in any statistical models that are used to\nestimate parameters\
    \ of interest.\nLinear models have long been the mainstay of quanti-\ntative-genetic\
    \ experiments, and are the most commonly\napplied statistical approach to understanding\
    \ phenotypic\nvariation. Traditionally, these models are ﬁt using a variety\n\
    of maximum-likelihood approaches (Lynch and Walsh\n1997; Sorensen and Gianola\
    \ 2002). These approaches are\npopular because they are fast and easy to use,\
    \ and their\nlong history has resulted in a wide availability of user-\nfriendly\
    \ software. However, maximum-likelihood methods\nhave a number of serious limitations.\
    \ Fundamentally,\nmaximum-likelihood model ﬁtting yields point estimates of\n\
    parameters, ignoring the inherent uncertainty in their val-\nues. Parameters are\
    \ then tested for statistical signiﬁcance\nbased on a threshold (typically the\
    \ 5 % cut-off) and are\nexcluded from further analysis if they are not ‘‘signiﬁcant’’.\n\
    Finally, these statistical tests rely on restrictive assump-\ntions about the\
    \ distributions of model parameters. These\nconstraints of maximum-likelihood\
    \ model ﬁtting affect\nexperimental designs and data acquisition procedures, as\n\
    well as biasing the resulting associations. More pointedly,\nthese estimates perform\
    \ well only when measurements are\nextensively replicated and normally distributed.\
    \ Therefore,\na great variety of procedures for data normalization and\ndetection\
    \ of outliers are necessary in order to meet the\nassumptions of the model. Unfortunately,\
    \ these methods\nare often poorly motivated from a statistical point of view\n\
    because they involve arbitrary thresholds for data exclu-\nsion. Despite these\
    \ drawbacks, the speed and prevalence of\nmaximum-likelihood\nmethods\nmake\n\
    them\nuseful\nas\nexploratory data analysis tools even in cases where the\nresulting\
    \ estimates are not expected to be robust.\nThe Bayesian approach to statistical\
    \ inference is funda-\nmentally different and overcomes many of the limitations\n\
    imposed by a maximum-likelihood approach. Instead of\narriving at single most\
    \ likely point estimates of parameters,\nthe goal of Bayesian inference is to\
    \ describe distributions of\nrandom variables of interest, taking into account\
    \ uncertainty\nin all the other model parameters. This perspective on\ninference\
    \ is thus much more in line with biological reality\nand should be preferable\
    \ when dealing with phenotype data\nthat have been contextualized by both the\
    \ genotype and the\nenvironment. The drawback of Bayesian inference is its\ncomputational\
    \ complexity. Historically, this complexity has\nbeen the disadvantage that held\
    \ back widespread applica-\ntions of Bayesian statistics. However, with the dramatic\n\
    increase in computer power, it is now feasible to apply this\napproach to inference\
    \ even when the data sets are large and\nmulti-faceted. Furthermore, computer\
    \ packages that make\nmodel building and analysis relatively simple and accessi-\n\
    ble to researchers without a programming background are\nstarting to make an appearance\
    \ (Lunn et al. 2009; Plummer\n2003). Bayesian formulations of the standard quantitative-\n\
    genetic models have been extensively studied (Sorensen\nand Gianola 2002), but\
    \ these models can be computation-\nally inefﬁcient for large data sets. This\
    \ is true for maximum-\nlikelihood as well, but because Bayesian estimation\n\
    involves the extra step of estimating full distributions rather\nthan just point\
    \ estimates of parameters the computational\nproblems are particularly acute.\n\
    Appreciable improvements in computational stability\nand efﬁciency can be achieved\
    \ by re-formulating the\n878\nTheor Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n123\nstandard\
    \ linear models in a hierarchical framework (Gel-\nman et al. 2003; Gelman and\
    \ Hill 2007). This framework is\npopular in the analyses of sociological data,\
    \ and is now\nachieving more currency in genetics (Greenberg et al.\n2010; Lenarcic\
    \ et al. 2012). The basic idea is that quanti-\ntative-genetic experiments are\
    \ inherently structured. For\nexample, when an inbred line is evaluated in a number\
    \ of\nenvironments, environmental effects can be nested within\ngenotypic effects.\
    \ Such nesting improves computational\nefﬁciency, increases power by incorporating\
    \ data-driven\npooling of observations from replicates (Gelman et al.\n2003; Gelman\
    \ and Hill 2007; Greenberg et al. 2010), and\naids in biological interpretation\
    \ of the results. Nesting\nenvironmental effects within genotypes has the added\n\
    convenience of allowing the direct modeling of G9E\ninteractions simply by estimating\
    \ the regression slopes as\nthey vary between inbred lines.\nIn cases where even\
    \ modest numbers of outlier obser-\nvations are present, Bayesian hierarchical\
    \ models also\nout-perform\nsimilar\nmaximum-likelihood\napproaches\n(Greenberg\
    \ et al. 2010). Furthermore, it is straightforward\nto expand hierarchical models\
    \ to include non-normal data\n(Gelman et al. 2003; Gelman and Hill 2007; Greenberg\n\
    et al. 2010), handle unbalanced designs (Gelman et al.\n2003; Greenberg et al.\
    \ 2010), incorporate variable assay\nquality (Greenberg et al. 2010, 2011), account\
    \ for outlier\nobservations without using arbitrary thresholds to exclude\nthem\
    \ from the data (Greenberg et al. 2010, 2011; Lenarcic\net al. 2012), and interrogate\
    \ phenotypic networks by\nextending the analyses to multiple phenotypes through\n\
    multivariate modeling (Greenberg et al. 2011). Finally,\nbecause the Bayesian\
    \ approach integrates over the inherent\nuncertainty in a system and borrows power\
    \ across the\nexperiment through hierarchical modeling, it reduces the\nneed for\
    \ extensive biological replicates, and therefore\nmaximizes the number of lines\
    \ that can be evaluated in a\ngiven study (Greenberg et al. 2010).\nThat being\
    \ said, while Bayesian hierarchical models are\nrobust to many problems in experimental\
    \ design and data\nacquisition, it is still a good idea to follow best practices\n\
    when embarking on a quantitative-genetic experiment.\nCertain problems, such as\
    \ putting all replicates for a line in\na single block, lead to complete confounding\
    \ of variables\nthat cannot be resolved by any statistical treatment.\nAlthough\
    \ it is possible to incorporate non-Gaussian data\ninto Bayesian models, these\
    \ extensions are typically com-\nputationally more expensive. For example, when\
    \ modeling\ncategorical data, one attempts to estimate an underlying\ncontinuous\
    \ distribution that would yield the observed data\nwhen coerced to being discrete.\
    \ Converting quantitative\nphenotypes (for example, the fraction of a plant tissue\n\
    affected by disease) to an index (susceptibility class) leads\nto loss of information\
    \ and an increase in model complexity.\nLikewise, summarizing replicate observations\
    \ and report-\ning only means can lead to either increased noise when\noutliers\
    \ are present or unwarranted precision. Such short\ncuts were defensible in the\
    \ past, when computational power\nand storage capacity to handle large data sets\
    \ was limited,\nbut this is no longer the case and the data should be\nreported\
    \ as ‘‘raw’’ as possible, and then modeled explicitly.\nGermplasm development\
    \ and distributed phenotyping\nnetworks\nAdvances in phenotyping and genotyping\
    \ technology, as\nwell as data storage, and computational capacity are\nopening\
    \ many new opportunities to extract meaningful\ninferences from even noisy biological\
    \ data. New statistical\nmodels that account for biological uncertainty and estimate\n\
    values of direct interest, rather than those dictated by\ncomputational\nconvenience,\n\
    promise\nto\naid\nin\nthe\nachievement of this goal. However, the value of any\
    \ pro-\ngress that may be gained through the marriage of next-\ngeneration phenotyping\
    \ with modern genomic tools is\npredicated on the availability of diverse germplasm\
    \ and\ngenetically well-deﬁned populations. Indeed associating\ngenotype with\
    \ phenotype in ways that address hypothesis-\ndriven questions and empower crop\
    \ improvement depends\non the availability of appropriate germplasm resources\
    \ to\naddress speciﬁc questions.\nThe preservation of plant biodiversity in publicly\n\
    available, international germplasm collections is of central\nimportance to our\
    \ quest to understand natural variation and\nto utilize that variation to meet\
    \ the future needs of the\nplanet. It is not unimaginable that we will be able\
    \ to ge-\nnomically characterize most of the accessions in the\nworld’s repositories\
    \ of genetic resources, but the sheer size\nof these collections, the broad range\
    \ of adaptation they\nrepresent, import–export restrictions, and the genetic\n\
    redundancy housed within their ranks presents a challenge\nfor direct phenotypic\
    \ evaluation. Targeted subsets of this\nvariation need to be assembled so that\
    \ available pheno-\ntyping resources can be efﬁciently used to evaluate them,\n\
    taking advantage of economies of scale wherever possible\n(Glaszmann et al. 2010;\
    \ McCouch et al. 2012). The\ndevelopment of shared populations with publically\
    \ avail-\nable, high-resolution genotype data will be critical for\npermitting\
    \ the kind of distributed phenotyping necessary to\nunderstand genotype–phenotype\
    \ relationships (Valdar et al.\n2006). Examples of research communities that have\n\
    developed these kinds of publicly shared germplasm\nresources include rice (Zhao\
    \ et al. 2011a), maize (Yu et al.\n2008), wheat (Neumann et al. 2011) Arabidopsis\
    \ (Atwell\net al. 2010), sorghum (Mitchell et al. 2008), barley (Pasam\net al.\
    \ 2012) and many other species (Zhu et al. 2008). The\nTheor Appl Genet (2013)\
    \ 126:867–887\n879\n123\navailability of these resources makes it possible for\
    \ mul-\ntiple researchers to interrogate the same genetic materials,\nphenotyping\
    \ in environments and with technology and\nanalytical expertise that are uniquely\
    \ available to different\nresearch groups. Integrating such vast phenotypic datasets\n\
    on common germplasm resources in well-structured dat-\nabases will permit high-end\
    \ analysis not just of the phe-\nnotypes\nthemselves,\nbut\nalso\nof\ncomplex\n\
    correlated\nphenotypic networks that represent a more accurate\ndepiction of biological\
    \ reality.\nAdditionally, more genetically structured resources such\nas chromosome\
    \ segment substitution lines (Ali et al. 2010;\nLu et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2012;\
    \ Fukuoka et al. 2010; Xu\net al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2011), multi-parent advanced\n\
    generation inter-cross (MAGIC) populations (Huang et al.\n2011, 2012; Rakshit\
    \ et al. 2012), and nested association\nmapping (NAM) populations (Yu et al. 2008)\
    \ will permit\nthe interrogation of natural variation in elite genetic\nbackgrounds\
    \ that may be intractable otherwise. These\ngenetically structured populations\
    \ partition the variation in\nways that facilitate the identiﬁcation of exotic\
    \ alleles that\nmay have a signiﬁcant impact on a phenotype of interest,\nbut\
    \ only when introgressed into the elite background. They\nalso expedite the subsequent\
    \ use of these resources as\nparents in a breeding program, helping expand the\
    \ range of\ngenetic variation available in an elite gene pool and\nopening up\
    \ new opportunities to utilize natural variation to\ndrive crop improvement.\n\
    Conclusions\nEver since the ﬁrst published QTL analysis (Sax 1923),\ngenetics\
    \ as a discipline has endeavored to shed light on the\ncomplexities of phenotypic\
    \ variation. For most of recent\nmemory, progress in understanding the genetic\
    \ architecture\nof complex traits has been driven by improvement in\ngenotyping\
    \ technology. As a clear picture of the genome\nemerges, a renewed focus on understanding\
    \ the nature of\nphenotypes will be necessary for continued advancement.\nWe have\
    \ discussed the role of phenotyping in gene\ndiscovery and crop improvement through\
    \ both GWAS and\nGS, and we have attempted to understand the complexities\nincumbent\
    \ on the association of genotype with phenotype\nunder variable environmental\
    \ conditions. We considered\nstrategies that permit the collection of phenotypic\
    \ data in\nquantitative ways as well as the development of modular\ntechnologies\
    \ to accommodate the changing needs and\nopportunities of phenotyping in the future.\
    \ We have pon-\ndered on the best practices for storing, cataloging, man-\naging,\n\
    and\ndisseminating\nthis\ninformation\nwithin\na\ncommunity, and suggested how\
    \ this data might be com-\nbined with cutting edge statistical analysis to leverage\n\
    increased computing capacity (Fig. 2). To conclude, we\nconsider where some of\
    \ the current deﬁciencies lie and\nhighlight a few questions that still need answers.\n\
    Genotyping, while closing in on understanding the full\nextent of allelic variation\
    \ in major crop species, is still\nyears away from delivering on the quest to\
    \ catalogue the\nworld’s collection of DNA variants for an entire species.\nThis\
    \ requires assembly of multiple de novo reference\ngenomes and re-sequencing of\
    \ thousands of diverse lines to\nidentify all of the SNPs, copy number variants,\
    \ and other\nforms of DNA and epigenetic variation within a gene pool.\nAs that\
    \ information is generated, researchers will seek to\nannotate the functional\
    \ signiﬁcance of the SNPs and\ninsertion/deletion polymorphisms, and design databases\n\
    that can host this information and make it accessible and\nquery-able for the\
    \ research community. This is a real\nchallenge because many functional variants\
    \ do not fall\nwithin gene models, but are found as inter-genic regulatory\nelements\
    \ or may condition gene expression through epi-\ngenetic pathways that contribute\
    \ to quantitative phenotypic\nvariation (Ding et al. 2012; Loehlin et al. 2010;\
    \ Salvi et al.\n2007; Zhou et al. 2012; Zhu and Deng 2012). This chal-\nlenge\
    \ also highlights the value of positional cloning to\nverify the functional nucleotide\
    \ polymorphisms (FNP)\nrather than taking a candidate gene approach, as the FNP\n\
    may not be found within a gene model at all. Additionally,\nfor many years to\
    \ come, the identiﬁcation and character-\nization of rare alleles will remain\
    \ a priority, despite the fact\nthat both GWAS and GS have little power to detect\
    \ their\ncontributions to phenotypic variation.\nAlgorithms for optimizing signal-to-noise\
    \ ratios in\nphenotypic experiments, pipelines for identifying GWAS\npeaks and\
    \ extracting meaningful lists of candidate genes\nunderlying those peaks are needed\
    \ to help standardize\nassociation mapping studies. Functional annotation of QTL\n\
    alleles and correspondence to the germplasm samples in\nwhich they are found would\
    \ help link genetic research with\nbreeding applications. Better tools for SNP\
    \ haplotype\nvisualization and management of high-volume SNP data\nneed to be\
    \ integrated into software platforms to facilitate\nthe identiﬁcation of functionally\
    \ relevant SNPs that can be\nused for marker-assisted selection and as ﬁxed variables\
    \ in\ngenomic prediction. As more and more phenotype data are\ncollected and databased,\
    \ tools to facilitate our under-\nstanding of intersecting phenotypic networks\
    \ will shed\nlight on the complex relationships within and between\nphenotypes\
    \ (Yin and Struik 2008). This information will\nprovide important insights about\
    \ selection trade-offs and\nphenotypic correlations that are relevant to variety\
    \ devel-\nopment and plant breeding.\nMajor questions about phenotypic variation,\
    \ which we\ncurrently have limited capacity to answer, include: How\ndoes variation\
    \ in regulatory elements manifest itself in the\n880\nTheor Appl Genet (2013)\
    \ 126:867–887\n123\nphenotype? Which environmental variables act as signals\n\
    that regulate these genes and how do different allelic\nvariants recognize those\
    \ signals? What is the role of epis-\ntasis and epigenetics in determining phenotypic\
    \ variation,\nor in phenotypic plasticity?\nApproaching many of these questions\
    \ will require more\nreﬁned strategies of collecting and managing phenotype\n\
    data. Many of the considerations that need to be addressed\nbefore making decisions\
    \ about deﬁning a phenotyping\napproach include: How easy is it to evaluate the\
    \ pheno-\ntype? How quantitative is that measurement? Can the\nprocess be automated?\
    \ If so, does it make economic sense\nto do so? What value would automation bring?\
    \ What\nindirect\nfactors\nwill\ninﬂuence\nthe\nphenotypic\nFig. 2\nWhen combined\
    \ with high-throughput genotyping on shared\ngermplasm resources, and done in\
    \ geographically distributed collab-\norative networks, next-generation phenotyping\
    \ can empower both\ngene discovery and crop improvement. Central to that capacity\
    \ is the\ncareful and judicious use of modular technologies and managed\nenvironments.\
    \ The use of standardized ontologies and Bayesian\nanalysis then create a controlled\
    \ vocabulary for describing the data\nand provide a way to integrate results across\
    \ experiments by\naccounting for the unique signatures of biological noise generated\n\
    by environmental covariates\nTheor Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n881\n123\nmeasurement?\
    \ Can they be quantiﬁed? How much storage\ncapacity do I need to maintain the\
    \ raw or processed phe-\nnotypic data? How will the data be organized so that\
    \ it is\nboth query-able and understandable? What data processing\nneeds must\
    \ be considered before the phenotype is biolog-\nically meaningful? Do I have\
    \ the skills in-house or\nappropriate collaborators in place to realize a sophisticated\n\
    analysis of the data? Answers to these questions will\ndepend entirely on the\
    \ purpose and intention of collecting\nphenotypic data to start with, and of course\
    \ the nature of\nthe phenotype itself.\nThe phenotype of an organism is fundamentally\
    \ a\nmanifestation of a genotype’s interaction with the envi-\nronment. With increased\
    \ allocation of funding and intel-\nlectual investment over the next decade, advances\
    \ in\nphenotyping will enhance our ability to associate that data\nwith the genotypic\
    \ and environmental variables to simul-\ntaneously and synergistically drive gene\
    \ discovery efforts\naimed at understanding the genetic basis of quantitative\n\
    phenotypic variation and fuel the development of genomic\nprediction models for\
    \ crop improvement. As these two\ndrivers of genetic analysis feed into each other,\
    \ not only\nwill tremendous gains be made in comprehending the\nbiology of plants,\
    \ but we will also ensure continued\nadvancement in crop improvement aimed at\
    \ meeting the\ndemands of a growing population.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors\

    Mesoscale meteorological data present their own challenges and advantages during
    the quality assurance (QA) process because of their variability in both space
    and time. To ensure data quality, it is important to perform quality control at
    many different stages (e.g., sensor calibrations, automated tests, and manual
    assessment). As part of an ongoing refinement of quality assurance procedures,
    meteorologists with the Oklahoma Mesonet continually review advancements and techniques
    employed by other networks. This article’s aim is to share those reviews and resources
    with scientists beginning or enhancing their own QA program. General QA considerations,
    general automated tests, and variable-specific tests and methods are discussed.

    Keywords: Quality assurance/control; Mesoscale processes; Data processing 1. Introduction
    Proper interpretation of meteorological data requires knowledge of its context,
    including its metadata and any quality assurance procedures applied to the data.
    Mesoscale data present their own challenges and advantages during the quality
    assurance process. Unfortunately, a meteorological observation can become inaccurate
    during many different stages of its life cycle. Although proactive maintenance
    and sensor recalibration can greatly improve data quality (Fiebrich et al. 2006),
    some inaccuracies may be unavoidable (e.g., a rotating anemometer coated in ice
    or a pyranometer packed with snow; Tanner 2001). Gandin (1988) described the particularly
    complicated challenge of detecting errors in meteorological data, because of their
    variability in both space and time. Olson (2003) advised that in order to control
    data accuracy, it is important to control it at many different stages. Numerous
    network managers have recognized that an end-to-end quality assurance system (e.g.,
    incorporating sensor calibrations, maintenance information, automated and manual
    quality control) is essential for producing trusted, high-quality data (Hubbard
    et al. 2005; McPherson et al. 2007; Peppler et al. 2008). During the past three
    decades, rapid advances in microelectronics, computers, and communications technologies
    have resulted in an explosion of meteorological networks across the globe (Fiebrich
    2009). These range from federal, synoptic-scale networks (with stations generally
    located at airports) to mesoscale networks (with stations typically located in
    rural areas) to urban networks (with stations commonly located at schools and
    near buildings). The Oklahoma Mesonet (McPherson et al. 2007) is one such mesoscale
    network that continues to enhance and refine its quality assurance (QA) system
    in order to provide users with high quality, real-time data. As part of that refinement,
    meteorologists with the Oklahoma Mesonet continually review advancements and techniques
    employed by other networks. The purpose of this article is to share those reviews
    and resources with scientists beginning or enhancing their own QA program. 2.
    General QA considerations Ensuring the quality of meteorological data begins well
    before the data are recorded and ingested. Even the best quality control tests
    cannot be expected to improve poorly observed data. Several fundamental standards
    must be adhered to during the observation process: 1) proper station siting, 2)
    proper and routine site maintenance, and 3) proper and routine calibration of
    sensors. Several other practices greatly aid the QA process, including: 1) always
    archiving the original observations, 2) using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
    and standard units for observation reporting, 3) using similar instruments and
    instrument configurations for sites that will be compared during the QA process,
    and 4) installing redundant sensors (when possible) for core variables. a. Proper
    station siting Several guides are available to aid in the selection of weather
    station site locations. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) provides guidance
    on the exposure and siting for most instruments installed in meteorological networks
    (WMO 1996). The Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services
    and Supporting Research (OFCM) details federal standards for station siting (NOAA
    1994). In general, these guides encourage station siting to be representative
    of as large an area as possible. Therefore, the following physical attributes
    should be avoided: 1) obstructions (e.g., buildings, trees) near wind sensors,
    2) artificial heat sources (e.g., buildings, asphalt roads) near air-temperature
    sensors, and 3) shielding (e.g., buildings, trees) near precipitation sensors.
    In addition, site slope and the influence of irrigation should be minimized (Shafer
    et al. 2000; Schroeder et al. 2005). However, some applications do require measurements
    near pavement (e.g., road weather forecasting), amidst buildings (e.g., quantifying
    an urban heat island; Oke 2006), or near irrigation (e.g., evapotranspiration
    monitoring for a corn crop). In those cases, the challenge of assuring data quality
    greatly increases. Although outside of the scope of this manuscript, it is worth
    mentioning that station siting will change over time for a particular station
    (e.g., seasonal and annual vegetation growth, urban encroachment, construction
    of nearby structures, and even sensor reconfigurations/relocations). For retrospective
    analysis of long-term data that may be affected by such changes, the authors suggest
    Easterling and Peterson (1995), Peterson et al. (1998), Feng et al. (2004), and
    Menne and Williams (2005). b. Proper and routine site maintenance Site maintenance
    plays a key role in ensuring quality data. Without it, siting may slowly degrade
    at a station as vegetation encroaches (thereby decreasing ventilation for air
    temperature measurements, inhibiting flow for wind measurements, and shielding
    precipitation measurements). In addition, without routine cleaning, the sensors
    will become coated with dust, leaves, and other debris. Routine maintenance provides
    an efficient means of conducting sensor inspections and tests, as well as the
    documentation of stations with digital pictures (Fiebrich et al. 2006). Performing
    in-field sensor comparisons or calibrations, preferably with independent sensor
    technologies, can be included during routine maintenance (Whitfield and Wade 1993;
    McPherson et al. 2007). Depending on sensor requirements and vegetation growth
    rate, routine maintenance may need to be performed biweekly (e.g., Atmospheric
    Radiation Measurement Program; Peppler et al. 2008), bimonthly (e.g., West Texas
    Mesonet; Schroeder et al. 2005), or seasonally (e.g., Oklahoma Mesonet; Fiebrich
    et al. 2006). c. Proper and routine calibration of sensors All sensors drift or
    degrade with age. Significant drift occurs relatively quickly with some sensors
    (e.g., within 12–24 months for most relative humidity sensors) while other sensors
    are more stable (e.g., most thermistors drift only about 0.1°C yr−1). Because
    every sensor eventually will drift out of specification, routine sensor testing,
    calibration, or rotations are necessary for providing quality data. According
    to a survey conducted by Meyer and Hubbard (1992), some automated weather station
    operators never recalibrate their sensors. In contrast, many networks take great
    effort to calibrate their sensors. At the Oklahoma Mesonet, personnel test or
    calibrate every sensor before it is deployed to the field, regardless of whether
    it is new or previously installed (McPherson et al. 2007). Metadata resulting
    from the tests document sensor performance both before the sensor is installed
    at a site (i.e., prefield calibration) and after it returns to the laboratory
    (i.e., postfield calibration). If a postfield calibration identifies drift outside
    of specification, the sensor’s past data can be flagged as erroneous. Without
    a routine process to check sensors, bad data may continue to be measured, reported,
    and archived. Fiebrich et al. (2006) documented suggested intervals to rotate
    common sensors from the field to the laboratory. d. Archival of the original data
    Many network operators greatly value the originally measured values from each
    weather station, even if the data fail quality assurance tests (You and Hubbard
    2006; McPherson et al. 2007). Instead of changing the suspicious observations,
    quality assurance flags can be linked to each datum, identifying the quality of
    the observation, and the original observations can be examined further. In addition
    to collecting the data, some networks also take responsibility for estimating
    missing observations. The Automated Weather Data Network across the Great Plains
    (Hubbard 2001) documents how missing data are estimated via an inverse distance-weighting
    technique, based on data from the nearest two to five stations. Those estimated
    observations receive a flag to indicate they are estimated. Data are also estimated
    (based on a regression-based approach) if they fail a screening test (Hubbard
    2001). e. Use of standard time and observation units Because the intercomparison
    of data from neighboring stations, including those across time zone boundaries,
    is one of the most essential procedures in data quality assurance, it is imperative
    that raw observations adhere to standard time (i.e., UTC) and measurement units
    (e.g., meters per second). The use of UTC also eliminates confusion during the
    transition to or from daylight saving time. Note that routine verification of
    datalogger clocks is critical to avoid clock drift (Whitfield and Wade 1993).
    A conversion to local time or imperial units may be applied during postprocessing,
    after the QA process has completed. f. Use of similar instruments and configurations
    for sites The use of similar instruments and site configurations can greatly aid
    the QA process because it allows for efficient troubleshooting. For instance,
    a network consisting of several different datalogger, sensor, and mounting configurations
    can produce abundant combinations of potential problems. Likewise, use of multiple
    types of sensors, perhaps with different time constants (e.g., air temperature
    sensors) or measurement methods (e.g., tipping-bucket versus weighing rain gauges),
    presents obstacles to making objective comparisons of data values from sensor
    to sensor, especially across a large, inhomogeneous observing network. g. Use
    of redundant sensors It is certain that the most straightforward QA test involves
    the comparison of two or more identical sensors at the same station at the same
    height. In most networks, duplicate sensors are an unattainable luxury, but it
    should be considered during the planning of station configurations. If very accurate
    temperature data are needed, but funds are limited, it may be more advantageous
    to install two temperature sensors and forgo an ancillary measurement (e.g., pressure
    or solar radiation). The Climate Reference Network (CRN; Gallo 2005) is perhaps
    the best example of this practice. Because the goal of the CRN is to provide long-term,
    high-quality, homogeneous observations of surface air temperature and precipitation
    across the United States, the network uses three aspirated temperature sensors
    and two precipitation gauges to enhance and streamline quality assurance. The
    triplicate configuration of temperature sensors quickly identifies when data quality
    is suspect (i.e., when the three sensors disagree with one another) and pinpoints
    which of the three sensor is in error. As a separate example, Allen (1996) recommended
    installing duplicate relative humidity and air temperature sensors to obtain accurate
    estimates of evapotranspiration in agricultural weather networks. 3. General automated
    QA tests Automated quality assurance tests can be implemented on both real-time
    and archived data, in most cases, with minimal processing time required. The most
    used automated QA tests are those that can be implemented on multiple types of
    variables. These generic tests are summarized below. a. Range tests Range-based
    tests simply verify that an observation is within a predetermined range. 1) Sensor-based
    range tests Sensor-based range tests detect observations that are outside the
    range of sensor hardware specifications or theoretical limits (Fiebrich and Crawford
    2001; Graybeal et al. 2004a; Schroeder et al. 2005). These thresholds are typically
    the most objective and easiest to determine. For instance, one model of temperature
    sensor may operate between −30° and +50°C while a different model may operate
    between −50° and +50°C. The sensor-based range test must be linked to unique range
    thresholds for each sensor type and model in the network. 2) Climate-based range
    tests Climate-based range tests typically use archived data to calculate thresholds
    by variable, station (or region), and date (or set of dates) to account for seasonal
    variation of observations. For example, Gandin (1988) described a climatological
    test that compared an observation with its mean climatological value and expected
    standard deviation. Hubbard (2001) documented a test using seasonal range thresholds.
    His method predicted the climatological maximum and minimum daily temperatures,
    Tmax(d) and Tmin(d), where d is the day of year, using maxima and minima from
    summer (i.e., TmaxHOT, TminHOT) and winter (i.e., TmaxCOLD, TminCOLD) and applying
    a sinusoidal variation throughout the year: View Expanded View Expanded These
    calculated values then were used as thresholds for a climate-based range test.
    The Oklahoma Mesonet adopted a similar climate range test in 2007 (Hall et al.
    2008b). Approximately 13 years of data were used to define monthly, site-specific
    climate ranges for air temperatures (at 1.5 and 9 m), soil temperatures (under
    native sod at 5, 10, and 30 cm, and under bare soil at 5 and 10 cm), and solar
    radiation. When a new maximum or minimum value is observed and verified (by a
    QA meteorologist) at a station, the associated climate range threshold is updated
    for that station. For new stations, the thresholds are initialized with ranges
    from a nearby station. b. Temporal checks Temporal checks assess the validity
    of changes in the time series of data at a station (Graybeal et al. 2004a). The
    thresholds used are more subjective than range tests and usually vary from one
    climate regime to another. 1) Step tests Step tests typically compare the change
    in magnitude between sequential observations. The threshold values used for step
    tests are dependent on the station location (i.e., climate regime), time interval
    between observations (e.g., 5-min, hourly, and daily), variable, and tendency
    (Hall et al. 2008b). For instance, with strong cold fronts, air temperatures in
    Oklahoma realistically have decreased 9°C in five minutes; however, for the same
    time interval and location, air temperatures rarely have increased 6°C (Hall et
    al. 2008b). Thus, the Oklahoma Mesonet includes a step test with unique thresholds
    for positive and negative tendencies. Graybeal et al. (2002) investigated historical
    hourly surface synoptic meteorological reports from around the United States and
    found that most of the hourly temperatures that were flagged as suspect by a step
    test were associated with spikes (i.e., successive increase and decrease) or dips
    (i.e., successive decrease and increase; Fig. 1). Thus, they concluded that tests
    that checked for spikes or dips were more efficient than traditional step tests.
    2) Persistence tests Persistence tests assess whether observations vary minimally
    with time, possibly indicating a physical problem with either the sensor (e.g.,
    bearing failure in or ice accumulation on a wind sensor) or its wiring (e.g.,
    in the case of some barometers). These tests are variable-dependent and compare
    the length of time a variable has repeated the same observation to its persistence
    threshold. For instance, the persistence threshold for solar radiation may be
    set to 840 min to allow for up to 14 h of darkness (e.g., during winter) while
    the threshold for air pressure should not be greater than 30 min for 5-min observations
    (assuming the barometer has high precision). c. Spatial checks Spatial checks
    detect observations that are inconsistent with data from nearby stations. Typically,
    data from the site being evaluated are compared to expected values (calculated
    using a spatial objective analysis algorithm). Observations that differ by more
    than a predefined threshold from the expected values are flagged as suspect. The
    thresholds usually depend on variable, locations of nearby stations (e.g., coastal
    stations or stations in mountainous terrain), and distance to the neighboring
    stations. Wade (1987) warned that unequal distribution of stations (e.g., a dense
    network within a larger-scale network) might bias spatial estimates. In such cases,
    either the observations from the dense network could be eliminated from the analysis
    or two separate analyses could be conducted (i.e., one for the densely spaced
    stations and one for the larger-scale network). In general, spatial comparisons
    are most successful at finding erroneous data during the well-mixed portion of
    the day during periods of weak horizontal gradients (Hubbard and You 2005; You
    et al. 2008). The Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System (MADIS; more
    information available at http://madis.noaa.gov/madis_sfc_qc.html) of the National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) uses an optimal interpolation (OI)
    technique developed by Belousov et al. (1968). When an observation does not agree
    with the estimate calculated by the OI, reanalyses are performed by eliminating
    one neighboring observation at a time. An observation is flagged as bad when successively
    eliminating data from each neighbor does not produce an analysis that agrees with
    the target observation. MADIS also uses analysis fields from the Rapid Update
    Cycle Surface Assimilation System as background grids to improve the performance
    of the OI. These background grids have a 15-km resolution and provide an accurate
    1-h persistence forecast that incorporates previous surface observations. The
    West Texas Mesonet and Oklahoma Mesonet employ the Barnes objective analysis (Barnes
    1964), which computes an expected value by assigning an exponentially decreasing
    weight as distance between a station and its neighbor increases (Shafer et al.
    2000; Schroeder et al. 2005). Variable-specific thresholds are calculated dynamically
    based on the standard deviation of data from the neighboring stations (Fiebrich
    and Crawford 2001). The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Clarus Initiative
    uses a similar method for environmental sensor stations along roadways (Pisano
    et al. 2007). Hubbard et al. (2005, 2007) and You and Hubbard (2007) developed
    a spatial regression test (SRT) that assigned weights to neighboring station data
    based on the root-mean-square-error values between the station and each of its
    neighbors. You et al. (2008) and Hubbard and You (2005) found that the SRT method
    was superior to the distance weighting methods when computing estimated values
    for 1) daily maximum and minimum temperatures across the United States and 2)
    areas of complex terrain. Angel et al. (2003) described a spatial check employed
    by NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). The test interpolated data from
    the Automated Surface Observation System (ASOS) and Automated Weather Observing
    System (AWOS) to a gridded field that provided the basis to check daily temperature
    data from the U.S. Cooperative Observer Network. Menne and Duchon (2001) explained
    two statistical tests that could be used to identify deviations in daily maximum
    and minimum temperatures by comparing them to data from neighboring stations.
    One test used cross correlations, while the second statistical model was based
    on autocorrelations present in the data model. These tests have been used at NCDC
    for the National Weather Service’s ASOS. d. Like-instrument and internal consistency
    tests Like-instrument checks detect observations that significantly differ from
    identical or similar instruments at the same station and time. Like-instrument
    thresholds are variable-specific and may be dependent on the mounting heights
    of the similar sensors. The CRN, with its three 1.5-m temperature sensors per
    station, can identify errant observations quickly. If all three sensors report
    within 0.3°C, all sensors pass the quality check (J. Lawrimore 2008, personal
    communication). Similarly, the Oklahoma Mesonet applies like-instrument checks
    to examine air temperature using sensors at 1.5 and 9 m; soil temperature using
    sensors at 5, 10, and 30 cm; and wind speed using sensors at 2 and 10 m (Hall
    et al. 2008b). Erroneous data may not be detected by a like-instrument check,
    however, if a problem develops with a component shared by the like sensors (e.g.,
    the datalogger). Internal consistency checks identify observations that do not
    comply with reasonable meteorological relationships between variables. MADIS makes
    use of relationships between sea level pressure and station pressure, 3-h pressure
    change and station pressure, air temperature and dewpoint temperature, and sea
    surface temperature and air temperature in their internal consistency checks (more
    information available online at http://madis.noaa.gov/madis_sfc_qc.html). Similarly,
    Graybeal et al. (2004a) described internal consistency checks for physical relationships
    between a number of similar measurements including dewpoint, dry bulb, and wet
    bulb temperatures. e. Adjustment tests Adjustment tests act to modify QA flags
    produced by an automated test based on output from a different test. For example,
    if observations at a station pass a like-instrument test (section 3d) but not
    the spatial check (section 3c), an adjustment test could reduce the severity of
    the QA flag from the spatial check. Similarly, if an observation failed a climate-based
    range test [section 3a(2)] but passed the spatial check (e.g., during a widespread
    record cold or heat wave), an adjustment test could reduce the severity of the
    flag from the climate-based range test (Hall et al. 2008b). Such adjustment tests
    help to minimize the number of good observations that are flagged as “erroneous”
    by the automated QA system. f. Decision maker for final automated QA flag Some
    networks employ a multiphase approach to automated QA. The Oklahoma Mesonet begins
    with a filter phase that filters observations from entering the full set of automated
    QA tests if any of the following conditions are true at the time of the observation:
    1) a technician is conducting maintenance at the site, 2) a QA meteorologist has
    manually flagged the variables as erroneous, or 3) the sensor-based range test
    fails. After the independent QA algorithms operate on the filtered data, an automated
    decision-maker routine generates a final QA flag that is archived with each observation
    (McPherson et al. 2007). Gandin (1988), Schroeder et al. (2005), and Graybeal
    et al. (2004a) described similar types of decision-makers or decision trees. 4.
    Variable-specific tests and considerations The general QA tests described in section
    3 form a framework for an automated QA system. Some variables are well suited
    for all of the general tests; others only can be assessed by a subset of the tests.
    Still, modifications of or additions to the general tests may be needed for particular
    variables. This section describes some of the variable-specific tests and associated
    considerations, including those that require human interpretation (i.e., manual
    QA). a. Air temperature The main challenge in the assessment of air temperature
    data is identifying small sensor biases that are masked by real meso- and microscale
    temperature anomalies. Such anomalies can be caused by differences in elevation
    (Gustavsson et al. 1998; Fiebrich and Crawford 2001; Hunt et al. 2007), wind speed
    (Thompson 1986), cloud cover, proximity to oceans (Helmis et al. 1987; Fiebrich
    et al. 2005), snow cover (Fiebrich and Crawford 2001), and storm outflows and
    heat bursts (Williams 1963; Johnson 1983; MacKeen et al. 1998; Fiebrich and Crawford
    2001; Graybeal et al. 2004b; McPherson et al. 2010). In most cases, additional
    data (e.g., satellite data, radar data, and topographic data) are needed to help
    distinguish between real and erroneous anomalies. Comparison of air temperature
    data among neighboring stations is best conducted when the boundary layer is well
    mixed and winds are moderate (>4 m s−1; Wade 1987). Thus, longer-term manual analysis
    (as opposed to real-time analysis) employed to detect sensors with subtle biases
    should focus on data from the well-mixed portion of the day (Martinez et al. 2004).
    To compensate for elevation differences between neighboring stations, Wade (1987)
    used potential temperature in his objective analysis procedure for data in the
    hilly region of eastern Montana. Wade (1987) recommended that to minimize errors
    in estimating potential temperature, pressure data should be accurate to at least
    1 hPa. MADIS also uses potential temperature for one of its spatial tests (more
    information available online at http://madis.noaa.gov/madis_sfc_qc.html). Last,
    if an unaspirated radiation shield is used, it should be noted that sensor inaccuracy
    can be as high as 1°C in light winds and strong radiation (Tanner et al. 1996;
    Hubbard et al. 2004). For networks that have forced ventilation shields, an automated
    test should check the fan speed to ensure aspiration. b. Air pressure Perhaps
    the greatest challenge in analyzing pressure data, especially in varied topography,
    is reducing station pressure to a standard height (e.g., mean sea level) for spatial
    comparison. Pauley (1998) evaluated several techniques for calculating sea level
    pressure and found that performance varied greatly depending on elevation, type
    of terrain, and weather features impacting the site. For spot-checking pressure
    data for outliers, Wade (1987) demonstrated the value of plotting the station
    pressure values from numerous sites on a pressure-height diagram (Fig. 2a). To
    enhance Wade’s check, residuals from a linear fit of pressure and elevation can
    be compared (Fig. 2b). Using data from 761 stations across Canada, Wan et al.
    (2007) found that nearly every station had a systematic error associated with
    incorrect station elevation, improper data digitization, or transposition of station
    and sea level pressure values. Both climatological range and temporal tests were
    valuable in identifying erroneous data. In addition, a test that used the hydrostatic
    equation detected 50% of the errors in station height or pressure measurements.
    Some barometers exhibit a nonlinear temperature dependency. Wade (1987) described
    a method to identify sensors that were not properly compensated for thermal effects
    by computing the hourly pressure difference between a test station and a reference
    station, subtracting the average daily offset from each hour’s difference value,
    and plotting the resulting departure as a function of time of day. During convective
    precipitation, observations of mesoscale perturbations in the surface pressure
    field can be flagged as suspect by automated QA tests (Fiebrich and Crawford 2001).
    By overlaying radar data with the pressure field in the manual QA analysis, mesolows
    (Hoxit et al. 1976) and mesohighs (Sanders and Emanuel 1977) can be distinguished
    from true pressure errors. c. Relative humidity and dewpoint temperature Most
    weather networks measure either relative humidity or dewpoint temperature. If
    both are measured, observed and calculated values of the same variable can be
    compared for a useful automated check (e.g., by converting relative humidity to
    dewpoint and comparing to the dewpoint observation). If dewpoint is measured,
    another like-instrument test is to ensure that air temperature always equals or
    exceeds dewpoint (Graybeal et al. 2004a). Graybeal et al. (2004b) also described
    an internal check that compared the current dewpoint depression with the preceding
    24-h temperature range. If only relative humidity is measured, spatial comparisons
    are best conducted by first converting the observations to dewpoint. Allen (1996)
    also noted that manual inspection of dewpoint time series typically is more valuable
    than those of relative humidity, since dewpoint is fairly continuous throughout
    the day (in the absence of airmass boundaries). Nearby irrigation can have a pronounced
    effect on dewpoint temperature. Some applications require weather stations to
    be close to irrigated fields, so that accurate computations of reference evapotranspiration
    can be calculated for irrigation scheduling (Martin and Jai 2000). Depending on
    the application, it may be necessary to flag as suspect high dewpoint temperatures
    for stations in close proximity to irrigated farmlands. Data affected by nearby
    irrigation typically demonstrate minimum daily temperatures within 3°C of the
    dewpoint on a routine basis (Martin and Jai 2000). Similarly, in largely agricultural
    areas (e.g., Oklahoma’s winter wheat belt, Iowa and Nebraska’s corn belts, or
    Canada’s summer-fallowed fields), observations of anomalously moist dewpoint temperatures
    at the mesoscale may be observed during the growing season (McPherson et al. 2004;
    Sandstrom et al. 2004; Gameda et al. 2007; McPherson 2007; Mahmood et al. 2008).
    Manually inspecting the monthly maximum relative humidities across the network
    can help identify sensor drift (Fig. 3; Martinez et al. 2004). If a sensor consistently
    peaks at a value less than 100%, even if dew is known to have formed, a drifted
    sensor should be suspected (Allen 1996). During strong low-level inversions, stations
    located in relatively higher terrain may be significantly warmer and drier than
    those in lower terrain. By incorporating elevation data into the manual QA process,
    such true meteorological phenomena can be distinguished from sensor problems.
    d. Soil moisture Soil moisture may be the most difficult variable to quality assure
    in a surface observing network. Its dependence on rainfall, evaporation, vegetation
    type and condition, slope, soil texture, and soil structure (e.g., compactness,
    profile) presents a wide range of possible correct values (Hillel 1982; Illston
    et al. 2008). Numerous sensor technologies and methods for measuring soil moisture
    also affect the QA techniques that should be performed on the data. For example,
    raw voltages recorded by the Stevens Hydra Probe depend on the electrical properties
    of the soil and can be checked using range and temporal tests. Similarly, both
    the dielectric constants and the volumetric water content derived from the raw
    voltages can be tested using range and temporal checks. Further, the derived volumetric
    water content can be examined for preferential flow (Illston et al. 2008) or compared
    to model output or remotely sensed soil moisture (Combs et al. 2007). Illston
    et al. (2008) described specific QA tests for soil moisture sensors that operate
    on the heat dissipation principal (e.g., Campbell Scientific 229-L). Most sensors
    cannot calculate soil moisture accurately when the soil freezes. Thus, an automated
    test for soil moisture should include flagging all soil moisture data as suspect
    when soil temperatures drop below freezing (Illston et al. 2008). e. Soil temperature
    Based on about 30 years of daily and hourly data, Meek and Hatfield (1994) recommended
    range and temporal tests for soil temperature data. Hu et al. (2002) developed
    similar tests for the Soil Moisture–Soil Temperature Pilot Network, operated by
    the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service. For
    any given station, they calculated a daily reference soil temperature based on
    soil moisture data, heat transfer equations, air temperature observations from
    the Cooperative Observer Network, and several adjustment factors, including annual
    and daily phase corrections, annual and diurnal amplitude adjustments, and an
    annual temperature correction. The daily reference calculation then was compared
    to the raw soil temperature observations to identify data problems. In addition
    to the range, temporal, spatial, and like-instrument tests, the Oklahoma Mesonet
    employs several special tests for soil temperature data. These include a test
    to allow hot soils (i.e., >30°C) to have greater variance from the like-instrument
    and spatial thresholds. Also, a conduction test ensures that the temperature traces
    at two depths intersect on an approximately diurnal basis (Fig. 4). In addition,
    the monthly average difference between each depth and a shallower depth are analyzed
    to check for sensor drift (Martinez et al. 2004). Soil temperatures are sensitive
    to the physical characteristics of the soil (e.g., heat capacity, thermal conductivity),
    soil moisture content, and insulation from vegetation (e.g., Fiebrich and Crawford
    2001). Metadata, including site photographs, of the soil and vegetation characteristics
    can provide the QA meteorologist critical information for determining whether
    anomalous readings are caused by microscale features or sensor problems (Martinez
    et al. 2005). In addition, cool rain that falls on hot soils can cause rapid decreases
    in near-surface soil temperature, sometimes causing the data to fail step tests
    (Fiebrich and Crawford 2001). f. Rainfall Hubbard (2001) indicated a need for
    better QA procedures for precipitation. Because of the spatial and temporal complexity
    of rainfall, it is difficult to assess sensor problems associated with rain gauges
    (e.g., Marzen 2004). Gauge friction, noise, debris, and overflow can affect weighing
    gauge measurements (Morgan et al. 2007; Duchon 2008); time-to-tip, leaky buckets,
    and malfunctioning switches can influence tipping-bucket measurements (Humphrey
    et al. 1997; Ciach 2003). Wind-induced errors can affect above ground gauges of
    both types (Alter 1937; Duchon and Essenberg 2001). One simple automated test
    is to check for rainfall amounts less than 0 mm or greater than some subjectively
    determined maximum value expected at a given location (Meek and Hatfield 1994).
    As a type of internal consistency check, a number of networks also use independent
    wetness sensors to identify erroneous precipitation data (Collins and Baker 2007).
    Kim et al. (2006) created a multiphase spatial test that incorporated radar data.
    The test compared precipitation from stations located within ±0.25° latitude and
    longitude of each other. Observations that differed by more than 2.2 times the
    standard deviation of all neighbors’ hourly values were considered errant. A radar
    test next compared hourly gauge precipitation to hourly radar-derived precipitation
    and flagged observations that did not agree well with radar estimates. Marzen
    (2004) also developed a QA procedure that compared rain gauge data to corresponding
    radar-derived rainfall amounts. A gauge could be deemed suspect if any of the
    following conditions were true: 1) the gauge reported rainfall while the radar
    did not, 2) the gauge and radar both reported rainfall but disagreed by a large
    amount, or 3) the gauge did not report rainfall while the radar reported a large
    amount. The first and third scenarios identified the highest number of erroneous
    gauges during the winter and summer seasons, respectively. Although radar data
    may be one of the best tools for verifying rainfall observations, one must recognize
    that radar-derived precipitation estimates have several limitations. For example,
    radar estimates can be erroneous when the radar’s elevation angle causes the rainfall
    to be sampled high in the sky, rather than at the ground level; when beam blockage
    occurs; when melting ice particles cause high-reflectivity patterns at the melting
    level; and when an incorrect Z–R relationship is used. Because of these limitations,
    some network operators choose to conduct intensive manual comparisons of rainfall
    data with radar-derived storm-total precipitation (Wilson and Brandes 1979; Legates
    2000; McPherson et al. 2007; Krajewski et al. 2010). Double mass analysis is a
    useful method to detect subtle problems in a rainfall dataset (Martinez et al.
    2004). Figure 5 demonstrates this manual method for rainfall data at two Oklahoma
    Mesonet stations in eastern Oklahoma. Although the accumulated rainfall throughout
    the year seemed reasonable at Claremore (Fig. 5a), a notable discontinuity was
    evident during the first half of the year (Fig. 5c, circled portion). By comparison,
    the rainfall data at the Haskell station exhibited a trend similar to its neighbors
    throughout the year (Figs. 5b,d). g. Snowfall and snow depth The challenges of
    ensuring the quality of liquid precipitation observations seem minor in comparison
    to those of frozen precipitation. Snow, when combined with rain, sleet, or freezing
    rain, can change snow depth. Even pure snow can have a wide range of snow-to-water
    ratios that make comparing the data with radar estimates extremely difficult.
    Graybeal and Leathers (2006) developed a method to check snowfall data during
    postanalysis. They completed a cube-root transformation of a long series of snow
    observations, normalized the transformed series (using the median and interquartile
    ranges), and compared the results with a bootstrapped 99.9% univariate-normal
    prediction interval. They also conducted a bivariate test to identify observations
    that should undergo manual inspection. Robinson (1989) found that accurate and
    complete information on snowfall and snow cover was being collected at only 57%
    of official climate observing stations in U.S. states where snow occurred, and
    that quality was weakest where snow was least common. To evaluate the quality
    of snow observations at each official station, Robinson applied a three-step test
    on the monthly snow data of stations within the same climate division: 1) monthly
    totals had to be similar, 2) monthly maximum snow depth observations had to be
    similar, and 3) number of days in the month with snow on ground had to be similar.
    If observations from a given site did not pass all three tests, they were determined
    to be unacceptable for publication as official measurements. Robinson recommended
    two steps to improve the quality of snow data: 1) automatically identify observations
    with suspicious reports (e.g., no snowfall reported, yet measureable precipitation
    was listed with maximum temperatures less than −1.1°C) and 2) give greater emphasis
    on careful prescreening of the data by NCDC personnel prior to digitization (i.e.,
    manual QA). h. Radiation Younes et al. (2005) grouped errors in radiation data
    into two main categories: 1) equipment error and uncertainty (e.g., cosine response,
    azimuth response, temperature response, spectral selectivity, stability, nonlinearity,
    and dark offset long-wave radiation errors) and 2) operational-related problems
    and errors (e.g., misalignment, incorrect leveling, and shading from structures
    or debris). All radiation sensors require calibration coefficients to account
    for sensor-to-sensor variability. These coefficients almost always change throughout
    the sensor’s lifetime (King and Myers 1997). It is of the utmost importance that
    the appropriate coefficients are applied to the data being analyzed. Radiation
    sensors are quite sensitive to the accumulation of debris on them. If dirt, dust,
    bird excrement, ice, or moisture accumulates on the sensor, the measurements will
    become biased (Allen 1996). Stanhill (1992) detected biases in thermopile pyranometers
    that increased almost linearly beginning on the day that daily cleaning ceased.
    Occurrences of moderate to heavy rainfall were found to naturally clean the sensor
    and reduce the bias. Because of this, the QA meteorologist may want to inspect
    data from a day following a rain event before dispatching a technician to repair
    a sensor with a suspected bias. Some may consider shadows from nearby obstructions
    to be the most severe operational-related problem in radiation data. Even a far-off
    obstruction on the horizon can interrupt sunrise or sunset from a few minutes
    to an hour (as detected by a station’s pyranometer; Fiebrich and Crawford 2001).
    The quality of net radiation data is also adversely affected when other sensors
    or obstructions shade the footprint of the sensor’s field of view (Allen 1996).
    1) Solar radiation One of the most common tests of solar radiation data is to
    compare it to the theoretical solar radiation under clear skies (Bird and Hulstrom
    1981; Snyder and Pruitt 1992; Allen 1996; Meek 1997; Santamouris et al. 1999;
    Ineichen and Perez 2002). However, agreement between predicted solar radiation
    and measured solar radiation does not always confirm proper calibration because
    of atmospheric turbidity and prediction algorithm uncertainties (Allen 1996; Long
    and Shi 2008). In addition, bright sunshine that sporadically breaks through cumulus
    clouds can cause observations to be higher than theoretically possible as the
    contribution of reflected short wave radiation (from cumulus clouds) is added
    to the direct solar radiation (Oke 1987). Younes et al. (2005) reviewed a number
    of quality control methods for solar radiation data and proposed a new procedure.
    The proposed procedure used the Page model to set upper and lower limits for diffuse
    horizontal irradiation and global horizontal irradiation measurements; the procedure
    required that observations of global horizontal irradiation, diffuse horizontal
    irradiation, and extraterrestrial horizontal irradiation were available. Geiger
    et al. (2002) described a web service (more information available at http://www.helioclim.net)
    developed to screen both daily and hourly solar radiation data. The web service
    compared submitted observations with expected values based on extraterrestrial
    irradiation and a simulation of the irradiation for clear and overcast skies.
    Meek and Hatfield (1994) described a quality control method that made use of the
    maximum daily solar radiation observed at a location each day in the year over
    a long time period. From that, they developed an equation based on a trigonometric
    Fourier series to test the data. 2) Net radiation Allen (1996) described the benefits
    of comparing net radiation measurements to net radiation estimates. They documented
    that such comparisons allowed for the detection of sensor calibration errors and
    drift. Equations to predict net radiation estimates can be found in Dong et al.
    (1992) and Brutsaert (1982, 128–144). Dong et al. (1992) indicate that their equation
    presented was appropriate for predicting net radiation over “healthy, well-watered,
    non-stressed, cool season grass at uniform height”. Special care should be taken
    when assessing data from domeless net radiometers, which are highly sensitive
    to precipitation or dew. Moisture that condenses on these sensors causes them
    to report erroneous data (Brotzge and Duchon 2000; Cobos and Baker 2003). i. Winds
    Local topography and nearby obstructions can have a pronounced impact on wind
    measurements. Even trees 100+ m away can have a noticeable effect on wind speed
    observations (Fig. 6; Haugland 2004). Wade (1987) noted that minimal obstructions
    (e.g., a few trees or buildings) will likely cause errors that dwarf those caused
    by calibration or other sensor errors. Manual inspection of station panoramic
    photographs and aerial maps is often required to determine if anomalous wind observations
    are caused by poor fetch or by true sensor problems. Hollinger and Scott (2001)
    presented a method for determining surface roughness in the 16 direction sectors
    around a station. Their method provided objective information on the impact of
    obstructions around a station. Because of the inherent discontinuity in wind direction
    between 0° and 360°, it is important to employ special versions of the basic tests
    described in section 3 that make use of vector averages (rather than arithmetic
    averages). For instance, an automated spatial test should recognize that two sites
    reporting northerly winds (e.g., one at 355° and one at 5°) are in good agreement
    despite the large arithmetic difference between their observations. DeGaetano
    (1997) described a postanalysis technique to identify excessive variability of
    wind speed and wind direction. The change of wind speed (or direction) for an
    evaluated hour was compared to changes in wind speed (or direction) before and
    after the test hour. If certain criteria were met (see DeGaetano 1997), the evaluated
    wind observation was considered suspect. If a rain shower or thunderstorm occurred
    simultaneously, the speeds were not counted as suspect. Finally, the remaining
    suspect observations were compared to the change of other measured variables (e.g.,
    station pressure) to determine if the atmosphere was highly variable. When wind
    speeds are available from multiple heights on a weather station, the data can
    be compared via simple wind profile tests (e.g., wind speeds should increase with
    height). The West Texas Mesonet, which employs both 10- and 2-m wind sensors,
    investigated approximately 9000 instances when the 2-m wind speed exceeded that
    from 10 m. They found that over 90% of the events occurred during the winter months,
    when ice accumulation impacted the 10-m sensor (Sonmez et al. 2005). QA meteorologists
    at the Oklahoma Mesonet have found that changes in the ratios between wind speeds
    at varying heights help pinpoint the occurrence of ice accumulation and thus identify
    when to manually flag the data as erroneous (Fiebrich et al. 2002). 5. Manual
    QA Unfortunately, it is impossible to implement an automated quality assurance
    test that will identify every bad observation yet never inadvertently flag good
    data as erroneous. The outputs from a QA system provide the crucial pieces of
    evidence to help a quality assurance meteorologist determine which data need further
    analysis (Reek and Crowe 1991; Martinez et al. 2004; Andsager et al. 2005). Manual
    inspection of the outputs from the automated tests is also critical to determine
    the performance of the automatic procedures (e.g., is the test underflagging,
    overflagging, etc.; Durre et al. 2007). Hall et al. (2008a) described a method
    of using accuracy measures (e.g., false alarm rate, probability of detection,
    etc.) to assess a QA system. Each day at the Oklahoma Mesonet, a web-based quality
    assurance report is generated that lists detailed output from the automated tests,
    a graph of the variable from the site in question and neighboring sites, a graph
    of both the variable in question and other relevant variables at the station,
    and a tabular output of the original observations (McPherson et al. 2007). When
    data are deemed erroneous, the quality assurance meteorologist will typically
    trace the start of the problem to a more subtle shift in the data (i.e., at a
    time before the automated software detected the problem). This allows the data
    to be flagged from the true trace time of the problem until the sensor is replaced
    or repaired by a technician. Because isolated or extreme weather events (e.g.,
    hurricanes, sharp cold fronts) will sometimes fail automated QA tests (You and
    Hubbard 2006; Durre et al. 2007), a QA meteorologist is required to manually remove
    QA flags on data if they are determined to represent real meteorological phenomena
    (Fiebrich and Crawford 2001). You and Hubbard (2006) developed a test that had
    some success in recognizing and resetting flags for zones where inappropriate
    quality assurance flags were issued for observations during extreme weather events.
    In the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) network, similar duties
    are assigned to quality assurance meteorologists and “instrument mentors.” In
    addition to documenting the expected performance of the sensors, the instrument
    mentors provide thresholds for automated tests, have the final word on data quality
    issues, and write data quality reports that are seen by data users (Peppler et
    al. 2008). In addition, it is critical that QA information be readily available
    to data users (Peppler et al. 2008). The Oklahoma Mesonet lists current known
    sensor problems and the monthly data quality reports on a public webpage. This
    type of metadata on a public Web site allows users to understand why certain data
    may not be available. 6. Summary Quality assuring mesoscale meteorological data
    requires an evolving, dynamic system. Adherence to standards in siting, maintenance,
    and calibration can ensure a strong foundation for data quality. A set of core,
    automated algorithms can act as a useful tool for identifying suspicious observations.
    It is important to recognize, however, that general automated tests must always
    be complimented with sensor-specific algorithms and manual analysis in order to
    ensure high quality data. This paper reviewed quality assurance procedures currently
    used by numerous meteorological networks. The authors’ aim was to not only present
    relevant references, but to also relay their personal experiences with quality
    assuring meteorological data. Although the authors encourage readers to develop
    their own regionally specific thresholds for each test, they have included some
    sample thresholds that are currently in use at the Oklahoma Mesonet in the appendix.

    pressure on the agriculture sector. With the advent of technology, this decade
    is witnessing a shift from conventional approaches to the most advanced ones.
    The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed both the quality and quantity of
    the agriculture sector. Hybridization of species along with the real-time monitoring
    of the farms paved a way for resource optimization. Scientists, research institutions,
    academicians, and most nations across the globe are moving towards the practice
    and execution of collaborative projects to explore the horizon of this field for
    serving mankind. The tech industry is racing to provide more optimal solutions.
    Inclusion of IoT, along with cloud computing, big data analytics, and wireless
    sensor networks can provide sufficient scope to predict, process, and analyze
    the situations and improve the activities in the real-time scenario. The concept
    of heterogeneity and interoperability of the devices by providing flexible, scalable,
    and durable methods, models are also opening new domains in this field. Therefore,
    this paper contributes towards the recent IoT technologies in the agriculture
    sector, along with the development of hardware and software systems. The public
    and private sector projects and startup''s started all over the globe to provide
    smart and sustainable solutions in precision agriculture are also discussed. The
    current scenario, applications, research potential, limitations, and future aspects
    are briefly discussed. Based on the concepts of IoT a precision farming framework
    is also proposed in this article. A graphical abstract for Recent developments

    (SM) is a key hydrologic state variable that is of significant importance for
    numerous Earth and environmental science applications that directly impact the
    global environment and human society. Potential applications include, but are
    not limited to, forecasting of weather and climate variability; prediction and
    monitoring of drought conditions; management and allocation of water resources;
    agricultural plant production and alleviation of famine; prevention of natural
    disasters such as wild fires, landslides, floods, and dust storms; or monitoring
    of ecosystem response to climate change. Because of the importance and wide-ranging
    applicability of highly variable spatial and temporal SM information that links
    the water, energy, and carbon cycles, significant efforts and resources have been
    devoted in recent years to advance SM measurement and monitoring capabilities
    from the point to the global scales. This review encompasses recent advances and
    the state-of-the-art of ground, proximal, and novel SM remote sensing techniques
    at various spatial and temporal scales and identifies critical future research
    needs and directions to further advance and optimize technology, analysis and
    retrieval methods, and the application of SM information to improve the understanding
    of critical zone moisture dynamics. Despite the impressive progress over the last
    decade, there are still many opportunities and needs to, for example, improve
    SM retrieval from remotely sensed optical, thermal, and microwave data and opportunities
    for novel applications of SM information for water resources management, sustainable
    environmental development, and food security. Key Points Recent soil moisture
    measurement and monitoring techniques and estimation models from the point to
    the global scales and their limitations are presented The importance and application
    of soil moisture information for various Earth and environmental sciences disciplines
    such as forecasting weather and climate variability, modeling hydrological processes,
    and predicting and monitoring extreme events and their impacts on the environment
    and human society are presented 1 Introduction Soil moisture (SM) is a key hydrologic
    state variable that links land surface and atmospheric processes (Robinson et
    al., 2008). Detailed knowledge about the state of SM and its spatial and temporal
    dynamics is of crucial importance for numerous meteorological, climatologic, and
    hydrologic applications and to improve our understanding of the water, energy
    and carbon cycles, as well as for forecasting of extreme climate events (Li et
    al., 2007; Robock & Li, 2006; Seneviratne et al., 2010; Vereecken et al., 2014).
    In general, in situ gravimetric measurements and electromagnetic (EM) sensor networks
    are considered as the most reliable means for direct and accurate determination
    of moisture within the soil profile. However, in situ measurements may be prone
    to uncertainties due to, for example, high salinity levels, loss of intimate contact
    between sensors and the surrounding soil because of shrinkage or biological activity,
    or lack of calibration, especially for soils with high specific surface areas.
    In addition, implementation of such methods is destructive, expensive, and laborious
    (Rahimzadeh-Bajgiran et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014) and they only provide localized
    information about SM dynamics and are not always representative of the larger
    surrounding area (Petropoulos et al., 2013). Because of the high spatial and temporal
    SM variability due to spatiotemporal variations of associated meteorological (precipitation,
    temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and humidity) and biogeophysical (soil
    properties, topographic features, and vegetation characteristics) parameters,
    measurement, and monitoring of large-scale SM dynamics is challenging. During
    the last decade numerous noninvasive techniques have been developed and employed
    to analyze SM patterns and dynamics across various spatial and temporal scales.
    For example, at the field and catchment scales, noninvasive proximal sensing techniques
    have been successfully applied to measure profile SM dynamics (Huisman et al.,
    2003; Kiseleva et al., 2014; Loijens, 1980; Moghadas et al., 2010). Today, ground-based
    and airborne and spaceborne remote sensing (RS) techniques provide an exceedingly
    powerful means for characterization and monitoring of large-scale near-surface
    soil properties and processes at reasonable temporal and spatial resolutions.
    Numerous studies have provided surface and near-surface SM estimates based on
    reflectance and/or emission of EM radiation within the optical (Sadeghi et al.,
    2015; Schnur et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2014), thermal (Lei et al., 2014; Rahimzadeh-Bajgiran
    et al., 2013; Verstraeten et al., 2006), active (Bartalis et al., 2018; Ulaby
    et al., 1982; Vinnikov et al., 1999; Wagner et al., 2012), and passive (Chen et
    al., 2018; Jackson et al., 2010; Kerr et al., 2016; Koike et al., 2004; Njoku
    & Entekhabi, 1996) microwave frequency ranges at various spatial scales that include
    the field scale (Jonard et al., 2011; Wigneron et al., 2007), the catchment scale
    (Baatz et al., 2014; Rosenbaum et al., 2012; Western et al., 2004), the regional
    scale (Louvet et al., 2015; Romshoo, 2004; Zhao et al., 2013), and the continental/global
    scale (Entin et al., 2000; Li & Rodell, 2013; Renzullo et al., 2014). Because
    of the limited measurement depth of microwaves, novel data assimilation techniques
    have been developed and implemented in hydrological models to establish links
    between remotely sensed near-surface and root-zone SM (Das et al., 2008; Draper
    et al., 2012; Dumedah et al., 2015; Montzka et al., 2011). Accurate monitoring
    of large-scale SM status is essential for the management of agricultural water
    resources to not only improve knowledge of plant water availability, water use
    efficiency, and water productivity but also to reduce the risks of detrimental
    anthropogenic environmental impacts. SM is an effective indicator for drought
    conditions and flood risks, two major meteorological hazards, and thus plays a
    unique role in their prediction (e.g., under drought conditions the SM anomaly
    typically proceeds the anomaly of the vegetation indices). Saturated soils are
    not able to absorb additional water, which leads to an increase in surface runoff
    and subsequently to flooding. Detailed information about the soil water status
    aids in improving flood prediction accuracy and provides means for near-real-time
    (NRT) flood forecasting. Continuously monitoring the root-zone SM status of agricultural
    crops aids in detection of plant water stress and the onset of drought conditions
    as well as provides the basis for precision irrigation management for provision
    of a water stress-free rhizosphere environment, while preventing leaching of agrochemicals
    and potential groundwater contamination. SM also influences precipitation patterns
    by controlling evapotranspiration, which affects the development of the daytime
    atmospheric boundary layer and thereby the initiation and intensity of convective
    rainfall events. Feedbacks between SM and precipitation are of significant importance
    for weather forecasting (Koster et al., 2004) and the regional hydroclimatic variability
    (Ines & Mohanty, 2008; Mahmood & Hubbard, 2007). Because of the significance and
    wide-ranging applicability of SM information, related research and technological
    advances have gained substantial scientific and public attention in recent years.
    Of late, SM has been included in the list of the 50 most essential climate variables
    (Dorigo et al., 2015) in order to support international organizations with the
    assessment of climate change impacts. In 2010, the Global Climate Observing System
    initiative has defined SM as a fundamental climate variable (Global Climate Observing
    System, 2010). This has prompted the European Space Agency (ESA) to incorporate
    SM in the climate change initiative (CCI; Hollmann et al., 2013). During the past
    decade, several instruments such as the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)
    Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E on the National Aeronautics and
    Space Administration''s [NASA] Aqua satellite and Advanced Microwave Scanning
    Radiometer 2 [AMSR-2] on the Global Change Observation Mission-Water [GCOM-W1]
    satellite), the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites
    (EUMETSAT) Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT), the ESA Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity
    (SMOS), the NASA Aquarius, the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), and the
    ESA Sentinel-1 that operate in the microwave frequency range are dedicated to
    the measurement of land surface SM (Entekhabi et al., 2010; Kerr et al., 2001;
    Njoku et al., 2003; Paloscia et al., 2013; Wagner et al., 2013). Seneviratne et
    al. (2010) have discussed the role of SM in climate and atmospheric processes
    with focus on SM-temperature and SM-precipitation feedbacks. Dobriyal et al. (2012)
    have provided an overview of landscape-scale SM estimation methods with emphasis
    on water resources sustainability and management. Vereecken et al. (2014) have
    discussed the state of the art of characterizing spatiotemporal field-scale SM
    dynamics and provided an overview of advanced measurement techniques. Petropoulos
    et al. (2015) have provided a comprehensive overview of efforts invested over
    the last 20 years in surface SM retrieval from microwave sensors. Noninvasive
    techniques for characterization of SM dynamics at the field to basin scales have
    been presented in Bogena et al. (2015). This review is aimed at (1) an inclusive
    presentation and discussion of recent advances in ground, proximal, and airborne
    and spaceborne RS techniques that provide novel means for characterization and
    continuous monitoring of SM dynamics across various spatial scales and (2) summarizing
    the available SM data resources and rapidly expanding repositories to promote
    and stimulate future research about novel applications of SM information. The
    review is organized in 10 sections. After introducing the importance and wide-ranging
    impact of SM information, section 2 provides a definition of SM and its relationship
    to various spatial scales. Section 5 presents ground-based point measurement techniques
    and SM sensor networks. Section 13 is devoted to proximal sensing techniques for
    SM retrieval. In section 18, an overview of RS techniques for SM retrieval from
    optical, thermal, and microwave RS information is provided. Section 27 describes
    available data and monitoring resources such as global sensor networks and microwave
    satellite and airborne RS missions and provides an evaluation of microwave satellite
    retrievals. After a discussion of the basic principles of analytical and numerical
    root-zone SM derivations from remotely sensed SM information and data assimilation
    in section 42, spatial and temporal variability inherent to RS of SM applications
    is presented in section 48. In section 52, potential applications of SM information
    are presented and an outlook for future research opportunities is provided. Finally,
    a summary and conclusions are provided in section 59. 2 Definition of SM The SM
    or soil water content, which may be expressed on a gravimetric, θ m , or volumetric,
    θ v , basis represents the amount of water present in the soil at a given matric
    potential (Tuller & Or, 2005). The matric potential, Ψ m (or matric head, h),
    is synonymous with the combined capillary and adsorptive surface forces that hold
    water within the solid soil matrix and are uniquely related to SM under hydrostatic
    conditions. The highly nonlinear relationship between SM and Ψ m is termed the
    soil water characteristic and exhibits a very distinctive shape for each individual
    soil texture (Figure 1). A comprehensive discussion about the origin of, Ψ m ,
    and the measurement and modeling of the soil water characteristic are provided
    in Tuller and Or (2005) and Tuller et al. (1999). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Soil water characteristics for different soil textures. The gravimetric
    SM, θ m (g/g), which can be directly determined by oven drying a wet bulk soil
    sample at 105 °C, is defined as the ratio of the mass of water within the soil
    sample and the mass of the oven-dry solid material. The volumetric SM, θ v (cm3/cm3),
    defined as the volume of water within a given soil volume may be expressed in
    terms of θ m as (Robinson, Campbell, et al., 2008) (1) where ρ b is the dry bulk
    density (g/cm3) of the soil and ρ w is the density of water (g/cm3). When all
    pores are filled with water, θ v is termed saturated water content, θ s . In some
    instances, it is advantageous to express SM in terms of relative saturation, S
    e = θ v /θ s , which is the volumetric SM content normalized to θ s (i.e., pore
    volume; Wagner et al., 2013). In theory, S e ranges from zero, when the soil is
    completely dry, to 1, when all soil pores are completely filled with water. In
    practice, however, it is not possible to attain complete dry or saturated conditions.
    There is always a residual moisture content, θ r , present under dry conditions,
    and it is virtually impossible to completely de-air soil as air bubbles remain
    entrapped in dead-end pores and cavitation nuclei are held tightly in crevices
    of rough particle surfaces (Sadeghi et al., 2018). To account for residual moisture,
    relative saturation is commonly defined as (2) Under wet conditions, due to air
    entrapment in the soil pores, the maximum attainable S e ranges from about 0.94
    to 0.97 (−) for fine-textured (i.e., clay) and coarse-textured (i.e., sand) soils,
    respectively. For agricultural applications, a plant available (or extractable)
    soil water content, θ PAW, is often defined as the difference between the water
    content at field capacity, θ FC, and the water content at the permanent wilting
    point, θ PWP (see Figure 1; Kabat & Beekma, 1994). The θ FC is defined as the
    water content after internal redistribution of water within the soil matrix due
    to gravity (free drainage) and for practical purposes is often assumed to coincide
    with a matric potential of −330 cm. This definition is not entirely correct as
    θ FC is dependent on the soil texture. For example, θ FC for a sandy soil more
    likely coincides with Ψ m = −100 cm. Below the permanent wilting point that is
    defined as the water content at −15,000 cm matric potential, water is so tightly
    bound within the soil matrix that plants are no longer able to recover their turgidity
    and irreversibly wilt. Again, this is only an approximation, as the permanent
    wilting point is dependent on plant physiology. Desert plants, for example, can
    withstand significantly lower matric potentials (drier conditions; Hupet et al.,
    2005). For water balance calculations it is convenient to express SM in length
    units to be consistent with other variables such as precipitation or evapotranspiration.
    This so-called equivalent depth of wetting is obtained by multiplying θ v with
    the depth of the soil layer of interest. 2.1 SM and Measurement Depth of EM Radiation
    Dependent on the penetration depth of EM radiation as well as within the context
    of land surface modeling, the SM content is commonly referred to as (1) skin or
    surface SM, (2) near-surface SM, (3) root-zone SM, or (4) vadose zone SM. Skin
    or surface SM is commonly used within the context of optical and thermal RS and
    describes the water content in the uppermost, very thin soil layer (~z ≤ 1 mm)
    at the interface between the land and the atmosphere. The term near-surface SM
    is usually related to the maximum measurement depth of microwave remote sensors
    (i.e., X-band, C- band, and L-band) and is defined as the average water content
    within the top few centimeters (~1 < z ≤ 10 cm) of surface soil. Root-zone SM
    (RZSM) defines the amount of water stored within the plant root-zone and is available
    for transpiration and biomass production (i.e., photosynthesis). While from a
    terrestrial hydrology point of view, the RZSM is highly variable in space and
    time, it is commonly assumed as the water content of the top 1-m soil layer. It
    can be directly measured with weighing lysimeters or determined with P-band microwave
    remote sensors, cosmic ray sensors (section 8), profiling EM sensors (section
    13), or via modeling approaches (section 42). The vadose or unsaturated zone is
    defined as the soil compartment that extends from the land surface to the depth
    of the unconfined groundwater table. Vadose zone SM can be measured with deep
    penetrating EM radiation such as applied in airborne EM surveys (section 36).
    The measurement depth of EM radiation is dependent on its frequency (wavelength).
    Optical RS techniques measure changes in surface reflectance that are associated
    with a change in soil color (i.e., moist soil appears darker than a dry soil).
    The spectral soil surface reflectance within the visible (Vis, 400–700 nm), near-infrared
    (NIR, 700–1,400 nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1,400–2,500 nm) EM range decreases
    with increasing SM content (Sadeghi et al., 2015). Thermal infrared techniques
    monitor changes in skin soil temperature that is intimately related to SM. In
    contrast to optical and thermal methods, microwave RS measures bulk dielectric
    soil properties (i.e., bulk dielectric permittivity) that are governed by SM content
    (section 6). Table 1 summarizes the measurement depths of microwave bands (C-band,
    L-band, and P-band) for various land surface covers. While short wavelengths (C-band)
    are applicable for SM retrieval for bare soils or sparse vegetation cover (Baghdadi
    et al., 2012; Prigent et al., 2005), longer wavelengths (L-band and P-band) are
    less (partially) attenuated by vegetation canopies and are amenable for near-surface
    and RZSM determination (Jackson & Schmugge, 1995; Jonard et al., 2011; Moghaddam
    et al., 2000). Jackson and Schmugge (1995) pointed out that the depth of the soil
    layer that contributes to the measured microwave signals (e.g., brightness temperature)
    increases with wavelength. They also discussed that for vegetated surfaces the
    attenuation of the microwave signal increases, affecting the soil layer depth
    contributing to SM retrieval. Table 1. Approximate Microwave Measurement Depths
    for Bare Soil and Different Land Surface Covers Land surface cover X-band (2.5–3.75
    cm) (8–12 GHz) C-band (3.75–7.5 cm) (4–8 GHz) L-band (15–30 cm) (1–2 GHz) P-band
    (30–100 cm) (0.3–1 GHz) Bare soil ~1.25–1.87 cm ~1.87–3.75 cm ~7.5–15 cm ~15–50
    cm Agriculture and rangeland ~0.5–0.75 cm ~0.75–1.5 cm ~3–6 cm ~6–20 cm Forest
    ~0.25–0.37 cm ~0.37–0.75 cm ~1.5–3 cm ~3–10 cm Note. The measurement depth ranges
    for each microwave band were calculated based on one tenth (λ/10), one fifth (λ/5),
    and one half (λ/2) of the wavelength ranges (Karthikeyan et al., 2017; Wilheit,
    1978) assumed for bare soil and sparsely and fully vegetated surfaces, respectively.
    It should be noted that soil moisture content, soil texture, and surface roughness
    also affect the measurement depth of microwave signals. 2.2 Spatial Scales of
    SM SM can be defined for different spatial scales that range from point measurements
    (Miralles et al., 2010; Teuling et al., 2006) all the way to the global scale
    (Kerr et al., 2001; Naeimi et al., 2009). Point observations are commonly directly
    obtained with in situ techniques such as simple gravimetric sampling, various
    EM sensors (time domain reflectometry [TDR], amplitude domain reflectometry [ADR],
    and frequency domain reflectometry [FDR]; see section 6) or application of neutron
    radiation (Famiglietti et al., 1999; Fares et al., 2016; Grayson & Western, 1998;
    Wang et al., 2016) with sensing volumes ranging from about 2 to 40 cm. The significant
    spatial variability of SM, even over a distance of only a few meters (Vereecken
    et al., 2014), creates challenges for accurate determination of larger-scale SM
    with point measurement techniques, unless a large number of sensors are deployed.
    This in many cases is prohibitively expensive and laborious. If spatially averaged
    large-scale SM is of interest, airborne or spaceborne microwave RS sensors with
    spatial resolutions on the order of tens of meters to tens of kilometers are applied.
    To bridge the gap between point and satellite observations, proximal sensing techniques
    can be applied. Figure 2 shows a classification of the SM retrieval techniques
    presented in this review. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Classification
    of soil moisture (SM) measurement methods: spaceborne and airborne remote sensing
    techniques (top left), static and mobile proximal sensing methods (top middle),
    and in situ/ground sensor measurements (top right) for continuous monitoring of
    SM dynamics (bottom scatterplot, illustrating an example of Soil Moisture Active
    Passive (SMAP) surface SM vs. in situ data for the Arizona Walnut Gulch site).
    A unique definition of the spatial scales of SM measurements has been provided
    by Western and Bloschl (1999). They proposed a scale definition based on spacing,
    extent, and support that applies to both SM measurements and models. The term
    “spacing” refers to the distance between measurement points or model elements,
    the term “extent” to the overall coverage, and “support” refers to the measurement
    or model integration volume or area. As an example, for a network of TDR SM sensors
    deployed in a field, the scale may be defined based on 101-m spacing (distance
    between sensors), 102-m2 extent (area of the field), and 103-cm3 support (volume
    of the soil sampled with a TDR sensor). Similarly, for a satellite image (e.g.,
    Landsat-8) the scale would be defined based on 30-m spacing (distance between
    the centers of two neighboring pixels), 170 km × 185 km extent (the footprint
    area), and 302-m2 support (the pixel size for bands 1 to 9; Figure 3). The major
    application of such spatial terms is to study spatial variability of SM with respect
    to the effect of geophysical and climate parameters. An overview of spatial scale
    in terms of support and extent of existing SM measurement instruments and networks
    is provided in Table 2. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Definition of
    spatial scales based on “support,” “spacing,” and “extent” as related to (a) in
    situ sensor networks and (b) satellite remote sensing observations. Table 2. Overview

    on SM content. 3 Ground-Based Point Measurements and Sensor Networks This section
    is devoted to novel and evolving SM measurement techniques ranging from neutron
    scattering, EM, and heat pulse probe (HPP) point-scale methods to larger-scale
    cosmic ray neutron and other EM-based methods. In addition, other recent technologies
    such as (wireless) SM networks (WSMN) are introduced and their potential to improve
    our understanding of hydrologic processes is evaluated. 3.1 Neutron Scattering
    The neutron scattering technology was first introduced by Brummer and Mardock
    (1945) for laboratory applications. Underwood et al. (1954) and Holmes (1955)
    were the first to develop and deploy portable neutron probes (NP) for in situ
    SM measurements for agricultural applications. The theory at the core of the neutron
    scattering technique is based on the tendency for hydrogen nuclei to slow (thermalize)
    high-energy (2–4 MeV) neutrons to approach the characteristic speed of particles
    at ambient temperature with corresponding energies of about 0.03 eV. A typical
    NP consists of a radioactive neutron source (americium-241 and beryllium) and
    a detector to determine the flux of thermalized neutrons that form a cloud of
    nearly constant density near the probe. Neutrons lose different amounts of energy
    when colliding with various atomic nuclei. The greatest energy loss is due to
    collisions with particles of similar mass, such as hydrogen. The quantity of hydrogen
    in the soil is largely dependent on the amount of water and to a lesser extent
    on the amount of organic matter and clay minerals. Therefore, a calibration function
    that relates the number of detected slow neutrons to soil water content can be
    developed. The sphere of influence (measurement volume) of a NP depends on the
    SM content and chemical composition and on the strength of the radioactive source
    (Figure 4). Note that reliable measurements cannot be obtained close to the soil
    surface (i.e., top 20 cm) as neutrons escape into the atmosphere. Ideally, the
    NP should be calibrated for each soil type (soil-specific calibration) and access
    tube material (Vachaud et al., 1977). Prior to the terrorist attacks on 9/11,
    NPs utilizing a radioactive source and detector were widely used for SM profile
    assessment as part of irrigation management owing to the ability to monitor water
    content in bore holes. The subsequent increase in regulations and paperwork related
    to radioactive devices has made NPs impractical for most users. Additional information
    about the practical and theoretical aspects of neutron scattering for SM measurements
    are provided in Sadeghi, Babaeian, et al. (2018). Figure 4 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Schematic of a portable neutron probe. The cosmic ray neutron probe
    (CRNP) for recording the neutrons that are generated by cosmic rays within air
    and soil and other materials is a newer method for noninvasively measuring area-averaged
    (effective) SM within the top soil (Zreda et al., 2008). Similar to the NP method,
    a calibration function is commonly developed to relate the change in low-energy
    neutrons to the change in hydrogen content for SM determination. For instance,
    a common theoretical function has been developed by Desilets et al. (2010) relating
    SM to relative neutron counts (3) where N is the neutron count rate (count per
    hour) normalized to a reference atmospheric pressure and solar activity level
    and N 0 is the counting rate (count per hour) over dry soil under the same reference
    conditions. A detailed description of the cosmic ray technique can be found in
    Zreda et al. (2012). Due to the higher propagation of cosmic rays in thin air,
    the lateral footprint extent is inversely proportional to the atmospheric (vapor)
    pressure and is up to 300 m in diameter, while the penetration depth strongly
    depends on the SM content and ranges from 15 cm in wet soils to approximately
    70 cm in dry soils (Franz et al., 2012; Zreda et al., 2008). Figure 5 shows simulations
    with the Ultra Rapid Adaptable Neutron-Only Simulation (URANOS) code that was
    tailored by Köhli et al. (2015) to simulate neutron transport for environmental
    science applications. The figure illustrates the simulated interactions of cosmic-ray
    neutrons in the ground (black dots), the estimated footprint radius and penetration
    depth within which 86% of the detected neutrons originated, and the respective
    histograms over distance and depth. The shown values are exemplary, while the
    exact CRNP footprint volume and sensitivity depend on soil moisture, bulk density,
    and atmospheric conditions and are still an active area of research. At present,
    most research is being conducted to interpret the measured signals, as the sensors
    measure not only SM but also the presence of water in vegetation, subsurface biomass
    and organic matter, surface water, atmospheric vapor, and clay lattices water
    (Baatz et al., 2015, Andreasen et al., 2017). Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Illustration of cosmic-ray neutron interactions with the soil (black dots) prior
    to detection in a central virtual CRNP sensor at (x = 0, y = 0, z = 2 m). The
    top panels show a birdseye view in a 320 × 320 m2 domain, an estimated footprint
    radius within which 86% of neutrons originated, and a corresponding histogram
    over radius (in m). The bottom panels show a slice through the ground, the estimated
    footprint depth (in cm) over radius (in m), and the corresponding histogram over
    depth (in cm). Real values depend on soil moisture, bulk density, and atmospheric
    conditions. The figure was extracted from the supporting information of Köhli
    et al. (2015), http://www.ufz.de/cosmosfootprint. SM derived from CRNP is frequently
    validated using local-scale wireless SM networks (Franz et al., 2012). Comparison
    of CRNP measurements with TDR SM data at 10 test sites in Germany (catchment of
    the river Rur) demonstrated reliable measurements of SM with root-mean-square
    error (RMSE) of 0.032 cm3/cm3 (Baatz et al., 2014). Baatz et al. (2014) installed
    a catchment-wide network consisting of 10 cosmic ray sensor systems at the Terrestrial
    Environmental Observatories (TERENO) Rur site in Germany in order to compare three
    different parameterization methods: (1) the N-O method, (2) the hydrogen molar
    fraction method (hmf method), and (3) the Cosmic method. All three methods were
    found to perform well after calibration. The hmf and Cosmic methods showed more
    similar calibration curves than the N-O method. First attempts are now being undertaken
    to establish networks of CRNP at larger scales. The COsmic ray Soil Moisture Observing
    System (COSMOS) network (Zreda et al., 2012) is presently being installed in the
    United States with the aim to install 500 cosmic ray sensors (see section 27).
    Currently, there are approximately 194 permanent CRNP stations worldwide (Andreasen
    et al., 2017) including 109 COSMOS stations in the United States (Zreda et al.,
    2012), 20 TERENO stations in Germany (Baatz et al., 2015), 13 CosmOz stations
    in Australia (Hawdon et al., 2014), and 32 COSMOS-UK stations in the United Kingdom
    (Evan et al., 2016). Also, mobile CRNP rover systems have been developed (Dong
    et al., 2014). Due to its large footprint, the CRNP could potentially fill the
    spatial gap between SM ground point data and satellite estimates; hence, it can
    serve as a reference for the validation of satellite SM products. The CRNP SM
    has been recently used for validation of spaceborne SM products such as SMAP,
    SMOS, and ASCAT in the United States, Australia, Europe and Africa (Akbar & Moghaddam,
    2015; Babaeian et al., 2018; Fascetti et al., 2016; Montzka et al., 2017; Van
    der Schalie et al., 2016). One important limitation of the CRNP in humid climates
    and wooded regions is that it is significantly influenced by various sources of
    hydrogen in environment (e.g., water vapor in the atmosphere, litter water, organic
    matter, and root biomass), which in some cases yield volumetric SM contents that
    exceed soil porosity. Thus, CRNP data need some additional adjustments to remove
    the effect of additional hydrogen contained in these pools. Adjustment methods
    have been presented in Franz, Zreda, Ferre, et al. (2012) and Bogena et al. (2013).
    Figure 6 shows an example of CRNP data adjustment for the Arizona Walnut Gulch
    site after subtracting the contribution of additional hydrogen pools during converting
    neutron counts into SM content. It is obvious that corrected CRNP data better
    capture in situ SM data from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). Figure

    Walnut Gulch site in Arizona. Uncorrected and corrected data after removing the
    effects of additional hydrogen pools (water vapor, organic matter water content,
    and lattice water) are shown. The colored lines represent Soil Climate Analysis
    Network (SCAN) soil moisture data at different depths. CRNP = Cosmic Ray Neutron
    Probe. 3.2 EM SM Sensors Topp et al. (1980) revolutionized soil water content
    sensing with the introduction of TDR. At that time, the first TDR instruments
    were very expensive and only deployable for laboratory measurements. Since then,
    the costs of TDR devices have decreased by several orders of magnitude, while
    other EM sensors based on capacitance or impedance circuits have also been developed.
    As a result, over the last decade, numerous companies have developed a variety
    of sensors based on EM measurements of soil permittivity (Bogena et al., 2007;
    Jones et al., 2005; Seyfried & Murdock, 2004; Vaz et al., 2013). Permittivity,
    also called dielectric constant, is a measure of the electrical potential energy
    of a substance under the influence of an EM field. The EM sensor electric field
    is generally directed into the soil along 2-, 3-, or 4-parallel electrodes or
    an adjacent pair of rings. For example, the Hydra Probe (Stevens Water Monitoring
    Systems Inc.) uses one central and three outer electrodes based on an impedance
    circuit operating at 50 MHz. The Hydra Probe is the only EM water content sensor
    offering both real and imaginary permittivity output (Figure 7a). While there
    is potential to extract additional information from complex permittivity, few
    have attempted to fully utilize these measurements (Kelleners et al., 2005; Peplinski
    et al., 1995). The Hydra Probe is widely used by the U.S. federal agencies in
    weather and snow monitoring stations (e.g., SCAN; SNOwpack TELemetry, and SNOTEL).
    The measurement of permittivity provides a highly accurate determination of water
    content in soil because the permittivity of water is about 80, while permittivities
    of solids and air are around 4 and 1, respectively. Interestingly, the most accurate
    water content determination method remains the original TDR method operating at
    around 1-GHz frequency, despite a larger number of low-cost low-frequency (<100
    MHz) water content sensors being marketed today (Blonquist et al., 2005; Vaz et
    al., 2013). In general, TDR does not require soil-specific calibration and is
    less susceptible to secondary effects such as electrical conductivity, temperature
    and relaxation (from high clay or organic matter content) than lower-frequency
    EM sensors. This immunity to secondary effects comes in part because of the higher
    measurement frequency (~1 GHz) and the use of travel time as the measurement method.
    The travel time, t, of the EM signal is proportional to the relative permittivity,
    K r , of the substance through which it travels according to (4) Figure 7 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Examples of electromagnetic water content sensors
    are (a) the Stevens Water impedance-based Hydra Probe measuring at 50 MHz, (b)
    the Acclima True TDR measuring in the range of 1000 MHz, and (c) the Sentek capacitance-based
    EnviroSCAN sensor, which employs frequency domain resonance, that is, the water
    content determines the resonant frequency in the range from 100 to 150 MHz. (Please
    note that sensor manufacturers are only named for the convenience of readers,
    which does not imply an endorsement of specific sensors by the authors). where
    l is the length of the TDR electrodes and c is the speed of light (3 × 108 m/s)
    (Robinson et al., 2003). Once K r is measured, the relationship between the volumetric
    moisture content (θ) of the substance and K r is given from a general mixing model
    (Dobson et al., 1985; Jones et al., 2002), written as (5) where n is the soil
    porosity and subscripts s, a, and w refer to permittivities of constituent solids
    (minerals), air, and water, respectively. The exponent β summarizes the geometry
    of the substance and has a range −1 < β < 1, with β = 0.5 representing an isotropic
    mixed medium. Recently, gigahertz frequency TDR (Figure 7b) has been developed
    and reduced in size using low-cost cellular phone components, facilitating production
    of TDR sensors that are competitively priced with more common lower-frequency
    sensors. Limitations of the TDR method include restricted applicability under
    highly saline conditions due to signal attenuation and the requirement of soil-specific
    calibration for soils with high clay or organic matter (OM) contents. Severe attenuation
    of TDR waveforms in the presence of high salinity and/or some clays having high
    surface area and surface charge may interfere with, or even preclude, water content
    measurements. In soils with an abundance of 2:1 clay minerals that commonly exhibit
    large specific surface areas, the bulk dielectric permittivity is more susceptible
    to temperature fluctuations due to the release of bound water under very dry conditions
    (Escorihuela et al., 2007; Wraith & Or, 1999). In organic matter rich soils, the
    amount of bound water is commonly higher due to the large specific surface are
    and associated higher adsorptive surface forces, which is manifested in lower
    bulk permittivity values when compared to soils with low OM contents (Bircher
    et al., 2016). Further limitations include the inability to measure the frozen
    water content due to the similarity of the permittivities of ice and the mineral
    soil constituents (Jagdhuber et al., 2014) and restricted applicability in highly
    structured soils with an abundance of large pores that prevent a close contact
    between the sensor electrodes and the soil matrix. In recent years, several EM-based
    borehole or downhole solutions, most employing parallel rings and capacitance
    circuitry to estimate water content in the vicinity of the cylindrical sensor
    (Figure 7c), have been developed. A growing trend for environmental sensors in
    general is to employ SDI-12 communication, which uses addressing to facilitate
    multiple sensors connected to a single digital port of a data logger. With options
    for addressing with single digit numbers and both uppercase and lowercase letters,
    more than 60 sensors can be connected to each available port on a data logging
    device. Given these advances, deployment of water content sensors for RS calibration
    has become more user friendly with lower costs. In general, EM-sensors are well
    suited for monitoring SM profiles, but seemingly few if any were developed specifically
    for near-surface moisture monitoring. In order to calibrate optical RS measurements
    from satellites or drones, the soil “skin” moisture content is needed, but common
    practice has the closest sensor to the surface at just 5 cm below the surface.
    This leads to a great deal of uncertainty since the soil typically wets and dries
    from the surface downward. There are certainly times when the surface has been
    wetted by rainfall, but the wetting did not penetrate to the sensor, and similarly,
    when the surface has air dried while the soil 5 cm below the surface is still
    quite moist. For these scenarios and others, novel and improved EM-based sensors
    are desired to address the growing need for accurately calibrating soil surface
    RS data using ground measurements more focused on the soil skin. Recently, a novel
    sensing instrument has been developed for more accurate measuring surface and
    near-surface SM content. Sheng et al. (2017) designed and tested a TDR array sensor
    that provides centimeter-resolution measurements of near-surface SM (0–8 cm) with
    high accuracy (±1 permittivity unit). 3.3 HPPs The use of heat as a tracer for
    thermal property determination in soil was pioneered several decades ago, but
    technological limitations hindered application of this method (Al Nakshabandi
    & Kohnke, 1965; De Vries, 1958). HPP were miniaturized, and their measurements
    automated in the early 1990''s (Bristow et al., 1993; Campbell et al., 1991),
    and a growing body of literature attests to the many applications for which they
    are well suited owing to the water content dependence of soil thermal properties
    (Hopmans et al., 2002; Kamai et al., 2008; Y. Lu et al., 2014, Lu et al., 2016;
    Ochsner et al., 2003; Ren et al., 2000; Yang et al., 2013). Probes generally consist
    of one heater needle (typically 18 Ga or 1.27-mm diameter) and one to five thermistor
    needles spaced approximately 6 mm from the heater needle, which makes them ideally
    suited to small sample interrogation (Figure 8). Various algorithms have been
    developed and applied to infer thermal conductivity (λ, W·m−1·K−1), thermal diffusivity
    (k, m2/s), or heat capacity (C, J·m−3·K−1) from HPP temperature rise measurements.
    The interrelationship between these three thermal properties means that only two
    of the three parameters must be determined for calculation of the third. The heat
    capacity can be computed from (6) Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Heat
    pulse probes used for thermal property assessment: (a) a commercial dual-needle
    probe for heat capacity determination (METER Group Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) and
    (b) the Utah State University-developed penta-needle heat pulse probe yielding
    thermal conductivity and diffusivity in addition to heat (and water) velocity
    in two directions. (Please note that sensor manufacturers are only named for the
    convenience of readers, which does not imply an endorsement of specific sensors
    by the authors). A heat pulse of 8 s is generally applied resulting in a temperature
    rise of about 1 °C at the sensing needles. This translates to 5% precision in
    heat capacity estimation if temperature measurements are on the order of 0.05
    °C accuracy (Kluitenberg et al., 1993). These measured temperature rise data are
    used to fit one or more thermal properties as functions of analytical or numerical
    solutions. One estimate of k is given as (Bristow et al., 1994) (7) where r is
    the mean heater needle to thermistor needle spacing, t m is the time from the
    initiation of heating to the occurrence of the maximum temperature, T max, and
    t 0 is the heating duration (8 s). To estimate λ, an expression for C from Knight
    and Kluitenberg (2004) is multiplied with the thermal diffusivity (8) where e
    is the Naperian constant (≈2.718) and ε = t 0 /t m . The soil volumetric heat
    capacity is an important link between thermal properties and volumetric moisture
    content of soil (θ). The soil heat capacity describes the amount of heat stored
    in the soil, which can be summed as the heat capacities of individual constituents
    according to (De Vries, 1963) (9) where ρ is constituent density (kg/m3), c is
    constituent specific heat (J·kg−1·K−1), ϕ is total porosity, and subscripts s,
    w, and a indicate the soil''s solid, water, and air phases, respectively. If the
    air phase is neglected and the solid phase is assumed to exhibit typical soil
    mineral density and heat capacity, we can substitute C w  = (ρc) w and C s = (ρc)
    s resulting in a simplified relationship written as (Campbell, 1985) (10) Estimates
    of C can ultimately be used to estimate the soil volumetric water content, θ,
    using the expression (11) where ρ b is soil bulk density (kg/m3) and c s is the
    specific heat capacity of the soil solids (J·kg−1·°C−1). Heat pulse sensor needles
    are generally short, and needle spacing is several millimeters apart because of
    the interest in minimizing energy input to the soil while maximizing the signal
    to noise ratio. This makes heat pulse measurements well suited for near-surface
    determination of soil properties including SM content (Mori et al., 2003). 3.4
    Other SM Sensors A potential new source of information about continental-scale
    SM is observations of temporal changes in gamma radiation. It has long been recognized
    that airborne gamma radiation surveys with low-flying planes can be used to determine
    SM content (Carroll, 1981) and snow water equivalent (SWE) for flood forecasting
    applications (Peck et al., 1971). The GAMMA instrument on the NOAA AC690A Turbo
    Commander aircraft has been used operationally by NOAA''s National Weather Service
    since 1979 to measure the mean areal SWE and SM along the flight path (Peck et
    al., 1980). Attenuation of natural terrestrial gamma radiation by water in air,
    snow, soil, and vegetation between the ground and the aircraft is the basis of
    SWE and SM measurements. After the nuclear reactor accident in Chernobyl in 1986,
    most countries of the European Union established in situ monitoring networks measuring
    outdoor gamma radiation for early warning. The data are composite gamma radiation
    measurements over a broad energy spectrum, and the sources of gamma radiation
    can be separated into terrestrial, cosmic, and artificial origin. These gamma
    radiation measurements are published in near-real time and archived by the EUropean
    Radiological Data Exchange Platform. As a result of this network of networks,
    measurements of more than 4,600 monitoring stations are made accessible to the
    public at least once a day. The footprint of a typical EUropean Radiological Data
    Exchange Platform gamma ray monitoring station has a radius of about 7 m and 90%
    of the sensor response originates from the top 12 to 25 cm of the soil (Bogena
    et al., 2015; Mao et al., 2015). The gamma ray intensity measured near the soil
    surface has been shown to be related to soil water content (Mao et al., 2015),
    but it is also known to depend on cosmic rays that enter and interact with the
    atmosphere, anthropogenic Cs137 from nuclear tests and accidents, and atmospheric
    Rn222. For accurate SM estimation from gamma radiation measurements, all interfering
    time variable, anthropogenic, and nonterrestrial signals have to be removed from
    the data (Bogena et al., 2015). If this can be achieved, SM of the top 25 cm of
    the soil can be determined with an expected accuracy of 0.025 g/g (Loijens, 1980).
    Recently, the potential of gamma ray sensors for measuring SM has gained popularity,
    especially in Europe where these sensors have been deployed in the aftermath of
    the Chernobyl nuclear accident to monitor the spread and fate of radionuclides.
    A comprehensive review of these methods is provided in Bogena et al. (2015). Another
    promising technology for SM determination at larger scales is the utilization
    and analysis of signals that are recorded on the ground through Global Navigation
    Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers (Katzberg
    et al., 2006; Larson et al., 2008; Rodriguez-Alvarez et al., 2009) that have initially
    been established for geodynamic (navigation and positioning) applications. In
    this technique, also called GPS interferometric reflectometry (GPS-IR or GNSS-IR),
    SM retrieval is based on the analysis of power variations of the GNSS signals,
    where the direct signal from the GNSS satellite and the signal reflected by the
    land surface are simultaneously received by the antenna (Figure 9). Considering
    their phase difference due to the motion of the GNSS satellites, the simultaneously
    received direct and coherently reflected signals cause an interference pattern
    in the signal power. This interference pattern is dependent on the height differences
    between the GNSS antenna and the reflection level (Vey et al., 2016). The interference
    between the direct and reflected signals produces a modulation that can be observed
    in temporal variations of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) recorded by the GPS
    receiver. A change in the soil permittivity (due to change in moisture content)
    affects all three GPS interferogram parameters, including the effective reflector
    height, amplitude, and phase (Larson et al., 2008), where the phase of the SNR
    is the most sensitive parameter for SM determination. If the soil is wet, the
    active L-band microwave GNSS signal (~1.2 and 1.5 GHz) is reflected from a layer
    just below the land surface, while for dry soil the signal penetrates deeper into
    the soil and is reflected within a surface layer of up to 7-cm thickness (Bogena
    et al., 2015). It has been shown that the changes in SNR are highly correlated
    with near-surface SM in the top 5 cm of soil (Larson et al., 2010; Rodriguez-Alvarez
    et al., 2009, 2010). It has been also demonstrated that GPS-based SM estimates
    are independent of the soil type (Chew et al., 2014). Figure 9 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Sketch illustrating the geometry of a multipath signal for antenna
    height ha and satellite elevation angle θE. Black and gray arrows represent the
    Global Positioning System signal transmitted from the satellite and the reflected
    signal from the ground, respectively. The solid circle represents the gain pattern
    of the antenna, and the dashed circles indicate power levels of the receiving
    antenna gain pattern. When the satellite is approaching the horizon, the reflected
    signal is associated to a larger distance to the Global Positioning System antenna.
    The GNSS-IR has been shown to have great potential for SM estimation using ground-based
    receivers (Chew et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2018). However, variables such as
    snow depth and vegetation water over land may affect SM retrieval accuracy (Larson
    et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2017). The GNSS-IR footprint can cover up to thousands
    of square meters, depending on antenna height and satellite elevation angle (Larson
    et al., 2010). For a GPS antenna installed at heights of 1 and 50 m, the footprint
    area radius varies from 50 to 330 m (Bogena et al., 2015). In this technique,
    the current temporal resolution of SM retrievals is daily because each GPS satellite
    has a 1-day revisit time at any antenna location. Numerous studies have been conducted
    in different regions of the World indicating the good accuracy of SM retrievals
    from GNSS data (Chew et al., 2018; Rodriguez-Alvarez et al., 2009; Sanchez et
    al., 2015). Recently, Zhang et al. (2018) analyzed GNSS-IR data over a dense grassland
    site in southwestern France and compared the GNSS SM retrievals to in situ observations
    at 5-cm depth and reported RMSE values of 0.035 cm3/cm3 (for grass covered surfaces)
    and 0.018 cm3/cm3 (after grass has been cut). We also compared the GPS SM inferred
    over a Savana site in California to the SMAP L4 surface SM values and obtained
    a very similar pattern with R 2 and RMSE values of 0.52 and 0.09 cm3/cm3, respectively
    (Figure 10). Figure 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Soil moisture content
    inferred with GPS-IR (circles) compared to SMAP L4 surface soil moisture (black
    line) over California (Calaveras GPS site with Savanna vegetation cover) and daily
    precipitation (blue bars) from April 2015 to October 2017. The green symbols represent
    standard deviation (SD). GPS = Global Positioning System; SMAP = Soil Moisture
    Active Passive. The NASA Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CyGNSS) that
    has been designed for tropical ocean surface wind sensing is also capable to record
    GNSS reflections over land and thus has potential for large-scale SM estimations.
    In a study by Kim and Lakshmi (2018), they used the CyGNSS in conjunction with
    SMAP SM and provided improved SM estimates with higher temporal resolution (five
    times per day). Chew and Small (2018) related L-band CyGNSS signals to SMAP SM
    and found a strong positive linear correlation between the change in CyGNSS reflectivity
    and the change in SMAP SM with a daily averaged RMSE of 0.045 cm3/cm3. Yet direct
    applications of this technology to improve our understanding of hydrological processes
    need to be documented in literature. The value of these larger-scale networks
    resides less in their potential to directly study hydrological processes but rather
    in their ability to provide spatially averaged data for the calibration and validation
    of remotely sensed data and their use in data assimilation methods to improve
    predictions of hydrological fluxes and states. The GPS SM data are available publicly
    through the National Science Foundation Plant Boundary Observatory (NSF''Topps
    Plant Boundary Observatory) at http://xenon. colorado. edu/portal/. 3.5 Wireless
    Network Technology 3.5.1 Network Structure The development of WSMNs has gained
    a strong momentum in the last few years due to the development of low-cost SM
    sensors and transmitting technologies, offering the potential to determine spatiotemporal
    SM dynamics at the field to catchment scales (Bogena et al., 2015; Vereecken et
    al., 2014) and permitting real-time data access to distributed SM sensors through
    a centralized communication architecture. Most WSMNs consist of five basic elements,
    including (1) a series of SM probe/sensor nodes, (2) a series of infrastructure
    nodes or routers, (3) an end node (gateway or coordinator) for data gathering
    and transfer, (4) a datalogger or PC, and (5) an internet server with a web interface.
    SM probes which are installed below the soil surface should be low cost, reliable,
    low power, and easy to install (Robinson, Campbell, et al., 2008). The most promising
    sensors are those that measure soil electrical permittivity, as described above
    in section 6. The routers are commonly installed above the ground. They receive
    data from SM probe nodes and other infrastructure nodes and transfer to the coordinator.
    Each network has only a single coordinator which controls and keeps the network
    running and streams information from the sensor network to the user and vice versa.
    ZigBee Alliance (ZigBee Alliance, 2010) is a low-cost mesh networking property
    standard that has been widely used for communication in wireless control and monitoring
    applications (Bogena et al., 2010; Kuorilehto et al., 2008; Valente et al., 2006).
    Two main topologies for wireless sensor networks have been proposed: (i) underground
    topology and (ii) hybrid topology (Akyildiz & Stuntebeck, 2006). In underground
    topology all sensor units are deployed below the soil surface except for the coordinator
    unit (Ritsema et al., 2009). Whereas in hybrid topology a combination of underground
    and aboveground devices is considered. It has been pointed out that a hybrid topology,
    which is composed of a mixture of underground sensors and aboveground router devices,
    is preferable to achieve longer transmission ranges (Bogena et al., 2009). The
    basic structure of hybrid topology is illustrated in Figure 11. Figure 11 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint An example for a hybrid topology wireless soil moisture
    network (adapted from Bogena et al., 2010). Since WSMNs mainly operate on battery
    power, overall power consumption becomes a critical constraint. Thus, it is important
    to design WSMNs that minimize retransmissions. Underground topologies require
    considerable power to overcome soil attenuation. Hybrid topologies on the other
    hand allow data to be routed from the underground in a few steps, thus reducing
    underground travel distance to conserve power (Bogena et al., 2010). 3.5.2 WSMN
    Applications Many WSMNs have been used to study spatiotemporal dynamics of SM
    at the field (Vereecken et al., 2014), catchment (Graf et al., 2014; Schröter
    et al., 2015) and landscape (Qu et al., 2015) scales. Earlier work has focused
    on the identification of SM patterns and their temporal stability (Brocca, Tullo,
    et al., 2012; Mittelbach & Seneviratne, 2012; Western et al., 1999). The seminal
    work of Western et al. (1999) about the Tarrawarra catchment where they deployed
    an array of SM sensors showed that SM in catchments exhibits dry and wet states
    that switch in function due to the interplay between local and nonlocal hydrological
    controls. This finding has been further corroborated in other catchment studies
    such as at the TERENO Wüstebach site in Germany (Graf et al., 2014). Brocca et
    al. (2014) used data from six SM networks around the Earth to study absolute versus
    temporal anomaly and percentage of global SM saturation. One major application
    of WSMNs is the validation of SM products from microwave RS missions. Recently,
    Wiekenkamp et al. (2016) used wireless SM networks to identify the occurrence
    and controls of preferential flow in a forested catchment. Their approach is based
    on the work of Graham and Lin (2011), who based on the changes in SM observed
    at different depths after rainfall events identified three major flow regimes:
    preferential flow, sequential flow, and nondetectable flow. Preferential flow
    refers to out of sequence SM changes where deeper locations respond earlier to
    an increase in soil water than locations closer to the surface. The SM measurements
    indicated that preferential flow occurred throughout the catchment. No clear controls
    triggering the spatial occurrence of preferential flow could be identified. Wiekenkamp
    et al. (2016) used the WSMN at the Wüstebach site to analyze catchment-wide controls
    of preferential flow. Based on the sensor response times, they identified four
    different flow regimes: (1) nonsequential preferential flow, (2) velocity-based
    preferential flow, (3) sequential flow, and (4) no response. Different potential
    factors that may control preferential flow and its spatial occurrence were analyzed:
    hydrological, topographical, and soil physical and chemical parameters as well
    as temporal factors such as precipitation events and antecedent SM status were
    studied. None of these factors were found to control preferential flow. Apparently,
    occurrence of preferential flow was governed by small-scale soil and biological
    processes. During storm events, the preferential flow occurred across the whole
    catchment. Blume et al. (2009) used a combination of sparse SM measurements in
    space, but with high temporal resolution, and rainfall simulation experiments
    and dye tracing to study the controls of preferential flow. They found that hydrophobicity
    in combination with small-scale variability in rainfall and strong heterogeneity
    in hydraulic conductivity were the main drivers controlling preferential flow.
    Stockinger et al. (2014) used the WSMN in combination with stable δO18 isotope
    measurements in water to study travel time distributions in the Wüstebach catchment.
    They showed that the presence of wet and dry states is reflected in the stream
    flow discharge pattern. Under the dry state, the uphill regions of the headwater
    catchment are disconnected from the river system and were found not to contribute
    to discharge. Only the riparian part of the catchment is contributing to river
    discharge under this state. Under the wet state both the uphill and riparian part
    of the catchment supply water for river discharge. The change from wet to dry
    state was found to occur at a mean water content of 0.35 cm3/cm3, which corresponds
    to the maximum spatial variation of soil water. SM data obtained from wireless
    sensor networks can be coalesced to produce the mean water content (σ θ ) function
    (i.e., the relationship between the spatial mean of SM and its standard deviation)
    for the observation area. The interpretation and analysis of this function has
    been the focus of various studies (Qu et al., 2014; Rosenbaum et al., 2012). Vereecken
    et al. (2007) was the first to use a closed form analytical expression based on
    stochastic perturbation theory to predict this function. Rosenbaum et al. (2012)
    observed the presence of hysteretic behavior in the σ θ with drying events leading
    to a decrease in the spatial variability and wetting events to an increase for
    identical mean water content values. Qu et al. (2014) applied inverse optimization
    of the observed SM content values using the Hydrus-1D model at 102 points at the
    German TERENO Rollesbroich site to link temporal stability of measured locations
    with key soil hydraulic properties (SHPs). Qu et al. (2015) expanded the work
    of Vereecken (2007) by deriving a closed form expression for the van Genuchten
    (1980) equation. Using pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to generate the input parameters
    for the closed form expression, they were able to predict the σ θ function for
    different sites. This approach has been applied at the global scale by Montzka
    et al. (2017). 4 Proximal Sensing Methods Because of high costs and laborious
    installation of point-scale SM sensors, they are not well suited to provide spatially
    continuous profile SM distributions at larger scales. In recent years, several
    geophysical proximal sensing methods such as ground penetrating radar (GPR), ground-based
    radiometer and radar systems, electromagnetic induction (EMI), and magnetic resonance
    imaging (MRI) techniques have been developed for field-scale SM determination
    (Robinson et al., 2008; Robinson, Campbell, et al., 2008). It should be noted
    that CRNP and GPS methods (section 8) may be considered as proximal sensing techniques.
    However, here we classify them as ground-based techniques as they provide temporally
    continuous SM measurements and have been used in SM networks for calibration and
    validation of remotely sensed SM estimates. This section provides an overview
    of the basic principles and recent advances of proximal sensing techniques. 4.1
    GPR GPR, also known as georadar, subsurface radar, and ground probing radar, is
    a promising proximal soil sensing technique that has proven to be applicable for
    high-resolution profile SM mapping in two or three dimensions at the field scale.
    The GPR technique can be used to bridge the present scale gap between small-scale
    invasive sensors (e.g., TDR sensors) and large-scale airborne or satellite RS
    observations. GPRs transmit high-frequency (1 MHz to 1 GHz) EM signals into the
    subsurface in a noninvasive manner. The travel time associated with an EM signal
    traveling between a radar transmitter and receiver is measured and used to estimate
    the dielectric permittivity of the soil (Huisman et al., 2002, 2003). GPR-derived
    dielectric bulk permittivity is then transformed to volumetric SM content using,
    for example, Topp''s empirical relationship (Topp et al., 1980) or other dielectric
    mixing models (Sihvola, 1999). Three GPR types including cross-borehole, airborne
    or off-ground, and surface-based or on-ground systems are commonly deployed for
    SM determination (Huisman, Hubbard, et al., 2003). Cross-borehole systems are
    used to monitor SM dynamics in the vadose zone. The transmitting and receiving
    antennas are located in two parallel boreholes and generate a two-dimensional
    velocity image between the boreholes, which can then be converted to dielectric
    permittivity and consequently to SM (Binley et al., 2002; Looms et al., 2008).
    The borehole GPR has been successfully applied to reconstruct two-dimensional
    images (tomographs) of SM distributions between borehole locations (Binley et
    al., 2001; Looms et al., 2008), but it remains limited to smaller-scale (a few
    meters) applications, as it requires the installation of vertical boreholes for
    transmitter and receiver deployment. Although borehole GPR performs well (van
    der Kruk, 2006), the systems are time consuming to operate, effectively limiting
    their suitability for larger-scale spatial investigations. Alternatively, off-ground
    and on-ground GPR systems have been deployed to map SM variability at the field
    scale (Ardekani, 2013; Jonard et al., 2011; Minet et al., 2012; Serbin & Or, 2003).
    Off-ground GPR configurations are installed at distinct heights above the soil
    surface and in many cases mounted on mobile platforms to rapidly move over the
    soil surface. Such systems are also used for airborne and spaceborne applications
    (Ulaby et al., 1986). Using full-waveform GPR signal modeling, field-scale SM
    mapping is feasible (Lambot et al., 2004; Minet et al., 2012; Weihermüller et
    al., 2007). Combined with a vector network analyzer, off-ground systems commonly
    use the surface reflection coefficient for soil characterization and SM estimation
    (Jonard et al., 2011; Serbin & Or, 2003). The main challenge for off-ground GPR
    is its sensitivity to surface roughness (Lambot et al., 2006; Van der Kruk et
    al., 2010) and the shallow measurement depth of the signal as compared to on-ground
    GPR techniques (Vereecken et al., 2014). However, the effect of surface roughness
    may be alleviated by operating at low frequencies (0.2–0.8 GHz; Jonard et al.,
    2011). The off-ground GPR may be used for validation of microwave RS SM products
    (Koyama et al., 2017). On-ground GPR systems represent a perfect alternative for
    mapping of profile SM because of their ability to measure direct ground wave propagation
    velocity (Grote et al., 2003; Huisman et al., 2002, 2001), which allows for deeper
    signal penetration when compared to the off-ground systems due to ground coupling.
    On-ground GPR measurements are performed with a fixed separation distance between
    transmitting and receiving antennas (Figure 12). The combination of GPR signals
    with other sensors/data such as EMI (Moghadas et al., 2010) and seismic (Ghose
    & Slob, 2006) has become more common for providing better estimates of SM. However,
    GPR has limitations such as poor performance in clay or electrically conductive
    soils, contact issues in dense shrubs, and soils with rock fragments (i.e., on-ground
    GPR), as well as requiring more sophisticated data interpretation (Robinson et
    al., 2012). A detailed review about the application of GPR for measuring SM is
    provided in Klotzsche et al. (2018). Figure 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Sketch illustrating the on-ground Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) basic principle
    and reflection profiling, where Tx is the transmitting and Rx is receiving antenna.
    Reflections at interfaces arise from changes in subsurface velocity (v) and dielectric
    constant (ε). 4.2 EM Induction SM determination with EMI sensors relies on the
    strong correlation between soil water content and the EMI measured apparent soil
    electrical conductivity (EC a ; Moghadas et al., 2010). Applications of EMI for
    SM variability mapping and monitoring at intermediate (hillslope to catchment)
    scales are discussed in, for example, Sheets and Hendrickx (1995), Allred et al.
    (2005), and Huth and Poulton (2007), Tromp-van Meerveld and McDonnell (2009),
    and Shanahan et al. (2015). EMI sensors apply current to the soil through EMI;
    hence, no direct contact with the soil surface is required (Corwin & Lesch, 2003).
    Common instruments consist of a transmitter coil that, when energized with alternating
    current (AC) at audio frequency, produces an EM field (Figure 13). The time-varying
    EM field emitted from the transmitter coil induces weak circular eddy current
    loops in the conducting soil, which in turn generate a secondary EM field that
    differs in amplitude and phase from the primary field (McNeill, 1980). The magnitude
    of amplitude and phase differences between primary and secondary fields primarily
    depends on soil properties including moisture content, type, and concentration
    of ions in the soil solution, the amount, and type of clay minerals in the soil
    matrix, the temperature, and the phase of soil water (Brevik & Fenton, 2002; Carroll
    & Oliver, 2005; Kachanoski et al., 1990; Reedy & Scanlon, 2003) as well as spacing
    between the transmitter and receiver coil, the distance between coils and soil
    surface, and coil orientation (parallel or perpendicular to the soil surface).
    The effect of magnetic permeability of the soil seems to be negligible according
    to De Jong et al. (1979). The primary and secondary fields are sensed as apparent
    conductivity at the receiver coil in Siemens per meter (S/m; McNeill, 1980). A
    detailed description of the theoretical background of EMI is provided in Tuller
    and Islam (2005). Figure 13 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Sketch illustrating
    the propagation of electromagnetic fields in soil for an electromagnetic induction
    (EMI) sensor. EMI sensors commonly used for soil investigations include monofrequency
    (e.g., DUALEM-1, DUALEM-2, EM31, EM38, EM38-DD, EM38-MK2, and EMP-400) and multifrequency
    (e.g., GEM-300) sensors. EMI has been also thoroughly tested for estimating soil
    salinity (Williams et al., 2006), soil texture (White et al., 2012), clay content
    (Harvey & Morgan, 2009), cation exchange capacity (Triantafilis et al., 2009),
    soil compaction (Sudduth et al., 2010), soil pH (Van Meirvenne et al., 2013),
    soil organic carbon (Martinez et al., 2009), leaching rates of solutes (Slavich
    & Yang, 1990), herbicide partition coefficients (Jaynes et al., 1994), groundwater
    recharge (Williams et al., 2006), and for estimation of the leaf area index (Rudolph
    et al., 2015). An excellent review by Doolittle and Brevik (2014) details EMI
    applications for soil studies. Monofrequency instruments have been recurrently
    used to estimate SM, yielding R 2 values ranging from 0.11 to 0.99 (Robinson,
    Binley, et al., 2008; Tromp-van Meerveld & McDonnell, 2009). Recently, several
    studies have shown that multifrequency EMI sensors can be effectively used for
    measurement of SM distributions within soil profiles (Tromp-van Meerveld & McDonnell,
    2009). For example, Calamita et al. (2015) used a multifrequency sensor with eight
    frequencies between 7 and 2 KHz for the retrieval of shallow SM at four sites
    in Italy and indicated a linear relationship between SM and EC a with R 2 between
    0.46 and 0.69 and RMSE between 0.064 and 0.077 cm3/cm3. Tromp-van Meerveld and
    McDonnell (2009) tested a multifrequency sensor with four frequencies (7–14 KHz)
    to monitor SM for a 9-month period over an upland forested hillslope and found
    a better relationship between EC a and SM at depths ~>30 cm (R 2~0.84–0.87) than
    at a depth <15 cm (R 2~0.78-0.83). Combining GPR and EMI data in an integrated
    inverse modeling scheme that increases the information extracted from geophysical
    data has become more common. Moghadas et al. (2010) investigated the joint analysis
    of GPR and EMI synthetic data to reconstruct the electrical properties of a two-layer
    medium and reported that the GPR-EMI inversion approach can accurately estimate
    the soil electrical parameters when the values of conductivity and permittivity
    of the first layer are low. 4.3 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Nuclear magnetic resonance
    imaging (NMRI; also called magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) is another proximal
    sensing technique for noninvasive SM determination. It is based on the sensitivity
    of the MRI signal intensity (echo) to SM content. Paetzold et al. (1985) first
    applied this concept to monitor SM. Guillot et al. (1989) then recorded the first
    images of a porous medium during moisture depletion. The most fundamental MRI
    principle for SM is spin-echo imaging (Merz et al., 2016), in which an echo is
    created by a 180° radiofrequency pulse following an initial 90° radio frequency
    pulse. The echo intensity depends on the proton density, which is proportional
    to the water content of the medium and the relaxation times. Since relaxation
    times also change with water content, the echo intensity is not necessarily proportional
    to the water content (Barrie, 2000). Because echo intensity itself is also affected
    by experimental parameters like echo time and repetition time, it is preferable
    to record an entire series of echoes and extrapolate to zero to obtain a quantity
    that is proportional to the water content if the relaxation time is sufficiently
    long (Edzes et al., 1998). In most natural porous media that include high content
    of silt or clay, the relaxation time might be quite short. In this case the so-called
    single point imaging (SPI) technique, originally developed to monitor water in
    saturated rocks, may provide more reliable estimates (Balcom et al., 2003). Merz
    et al. (2014) tested three MRI methods (unilateral NMR, spin echo multiscale (SEMS),
    and SPI3D) for estimating near-surface moisture based on equation (12) (12) with
    θ α,MR = M(0,r)/M(0,r)saturated in which M(0,r) and M(0,r)saturated denote the
    signal amplitude at partial and initial saturation, respectively, θ r,MR is the
    relative magnetic resonance (MR) signal at dry (residual) soil condition. The
    assumption of this model is the linear relationship between MR signals and the
    moisture content. Figure 14 depicts high-resolution near-surface moisture profiles
    of medium sand monitored over time with the three MRI methods. Figure 14 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Temporal near-surface soil moisture profile evolution

    The crosses at the abscissa represent the gravimetric water content (Merz et al.,
    2014). 4.4 ELBARA/JULBARA and ComRAD Ground-Based Radiometer and Radar Systems
    The Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zürich L-Band Radiometer (ELBARA)
    is a passive system operating at a frequency of 1.4–1.427 GHz. It was constructed
    by the University of Bern in collaboration with ETH to infer SHPs from the SM
    dynamics of top soil. The radiometer consists of a dual-mode conical horn antenna
    mounted on a back of a truck (mobile) or a tower (fixed) with 4–17 m elevation
    at zenith angle between 30 and 330°. It measures the brightness temperature at
    the soil surface for SM retrieval. The radiometer is equipped with internal cold
    (273°K) and hot (338°K) loads for measurement calibration (Jonard et al., 2011).
    The ELBARA II system has been designed by ESA as part of SMOS, and it is used
    for ground-based campaigns in Europe for calibration of SMOS and SMAP SM algorithms
    and for validation of SM retrievals (Miernecki et al., 2014; Schwank et al., 2010;
    Wigneron et al., 2012). Miernecki et al. (2014) used ELBARA II SM estimates for
    evaluation of SMAP and SMOS SM retrieval algorithms and demonstrated that SMAP
    single channel (Single Channel Algorithm [SCA]-H and SCA-V) and dual channel (DCA)
    algorithms and the SMOS land parameter retrieval model (LPRM) provide results
    very close (RMSEs 0.035–0.056 cm3/cm3) to those obtained from L-band Microwave
    Emission of the Biosphere (L-MEB) model-based multi-angular ELBARA II measurements.
    The JULBARA system at the Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany is a Dick-type L-band
    (1.414 GHz) radiometer that has been used for SM retrieval at the field scale
    with RMSEs of 0.062 (horizontal polarization) and 0.054 cm3/cm3 (vertical polarization)
    (Jonard et al., 2011). The Combined Radar and Radiometer (ComRAD) ground-based
    L-band simulator (O''Neill et al., 2007) developed jointly by NASA/GSFC and George
    Washington University has been used to refine SMAP SM retrieval algorithms under
    controlled conditions (Srivastava et al., 2015) and to develop new radiative transfer
    based SM retrieval models for vegetated terrain and small tree canopies (Kurum
    et al., 2011). It consists of a quad-polarized radar (1.25 GHz) and a dual-polarized
    radiometer (1.4 GHz) sharing the same 1.22-m parabolic dish antenna with 12° field
    of view and mounted on a 19-m hydraulic boom truck for field deployment. Before
    field measurements, the radiometer is calibrated with cold sky and ambient microwave
    absorber targets. In a study by Srivastava, et al. (2015), ComRAD data were used
    for evaluation of the SCA-H algorithm integrated with Mironov/Dobson dielectric
    mixing models for SM retrieval at a USDA field site covered with corn and soybeans.
    Results indicated that SCA-H is promising for L-band SM retrieval with a RMSE
    of 0.04 cm3/cm3. 5 RS Methods for SM Retrieval RS approaches for SM estimation
    have been applied since the 1970s. These promising methods produce spatially explicit
    measurements of SM. This section provides an overview of progress and constraints
    of optical, thermal, and microwave RS techniques for skin and near-surface SM
    measurements and monitoring. A brief overview of these RS techniques for SM retrieval
    and associated pros and cons is provided in Table 3. Table 3. Overview of Remote

    infrared. 5.1 Optical RS In optical RS, the Vis, NIR, and SWIR EM radiation bands
    with wavelengths ranging from 350 to 2,500 nm are used to provide SM estimates
    from spectral surface reflectance information. Optical RS systems are classified
    into multispectral and hyperspectral imaging systems, depending on the number
    of spectral bands used in the imaging process. In this section, we discuss optical
    imagery and reflectance spectroscopy techniques that are deployed for SM retrieval
    at large and small (laboratory) scales. 5.1.1 Optical Imagery Optical RS methods
    have been proposed to quantify skin SM from broadband and narrowband optical satellite
    and airborne remote sensors such as Landsat (Profeti & Macintosh, 1997; Vincente-Serrano
    et al., 2004), MODIS (Zhang & Wegehenkel, 2006), Hyperion (Song, Ma, et al., 2014),
    HyMap (Haubrock et al., 2008) and simulated satellite bands (Castaldi et al.,
    2015; Muller & Decamps, 2000). Despite the numerous optical remote sensors currently
    in orbit, a limited body of literature exists on the exploitation of optical observations
    for skin SM estimation. This seems to be partly due to the inability of optical
    signals to penetrate clouds and vegetation covers (Zhao & Li, 2013) and the lack
    of an agreed physically based model for accurate estimation of SM from optical
    data (Sadeghi et al., 2017). In addition, some optical and hyperspectral data
    from satellite sensors exhibit low temporal resolution, which limits their applicability
    for monitoring state variables such as SM. Because of the wider spectral resolution
    of satellite/airborne sensors when compared to laboratory instruments that operate
    within the 1- to 8-nm spectral range and natural heterogeneities at larger scales,
    it is challenging to directly apply laboratory-developed SM retrieval methods
    to RS measurements. Besides SM, other soil properties (e.g., organic matter, color,
    salinity, texture, vegetation, roughness, and crust) affect surface reflectance;
    hence, RS spectral measurements are highly variable in space (Ben-Dor et al.,
    2002). This affects the accuracy of large-scale applications. Despite these limitations
    there is significant interest in SM estimation from optical RS data, because the
    high spatial resolution SM products are useful for agricultural applications.
    Recently, Hassan-Esfahani et al. (2015) developed a neural network method that
    translates high spatial resolution unmanned aireal system (i.e., AggieAir) imagery
    to reasonably accurate SM estimates (RMSE less than 0.03 cm3/cm3) for a large
    center pivot irrigated field in Scipio, Utah. Although the application of hyperspectral
    imaging has generally provided promising results for surface SM (Anne et al.,
    2014; Peng et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011), the usefulness of this technique
    needs to be further explored in future research. Hyperspectral sensors with finer
    spatial resolution and narrow spectral bands may offer an alternative to traditional
    multispectral analysis of SM, in particular for landscapes with high spatial heterogeneity.
    New missions such as Hyperspectral Precursor and Application Mission (Galeazzi
    et al., 2008), the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program, that will be launched
    in 2020 (Stuffler et al., 2006), or the HYPerspectral IMager, scheduled to launch
    prior to 2020 (Michel et al., 2010), are able to fully cover the solar domain
    (400 to 2,500 nm) with high spectral resolution (average of 10 nm) and offer new
    opportunities for estimating surface moisture from hyperspectral imagery. 5.1.2
    Reflectance Spectroscopy Reflectance spectroscopy (diffuse optical spectroscopy)
    has been applied as a powerful means for large-scale SM estimation or for skin
    SM measurements at smaller scales. This spectroscopic technique exploits the fact
    that the EM spectrum exhibits several distinct water absorption bands within the
    NIR (~1,414 nm) and SWIR (~1,915 and 2,210 nm) frequency ranges (Clark, 1999;
    Viscarra Rossel et al., 2006). Reflectance spectroscopy can be also classified
    as a proximal sensing techniques. Diffuse reflectance relies on a focused projection
    of the spectrometer beam onto a sample of interest, where it is reflected, scattered,
    and transmitted through the sample material. Spectrometers that operate within
    the Vis, NIR, and SWIR (400–2,500 nm) range are applied for both laboratory and
    field measurements. The relationship between skin SM and spectral reflectance
    has been extensively studied and is well documented in literature (Ben-Dor & Banin,
    1995; Bogrekci, & Lee, W. S., 2006; Chang et al., 2001; Hummel et al., 2001).
    Numerous studies have been conducted, mainly at the laboratory scale, to explore
    the relationships between spectral reflectance and skin SM for a wide range of
    soil types (Gao et al., 2013; Lobell & Asner, 2002; Philpot, 2010; Tian & Philpot,
    2015). Findings from these studies indicate that reflectance decreases relative
    to an increase of SM with the effect being more pronounced in the SWIR range (Angstrom,
    1925; Liu et al., 2002; Sadeghi et al., 2015; Weidong et al., 2002). Exceptions
    to this trend have been observed, particularly when approaching saturation (Liu
    et al., 2002; Neema et al., 1987) and when models that consider Fresnel reflectance
    were applied (Sadeghi et al., 2015). In general, empirical and physical approaches
    can be discerned for estimating SM from spectral reflectance data. Most studies
    that capitalized on the full hyperspectral signature of soils have focused on
    empirical regression models such as partial least squares regression (Bogrekci,
    & Lee, W. S., 2006; Castaldi et al., 2015), principal component regression (Chang
    et al., 2001), and multiple linear regression (Ben-Dor & Banin, 1995; Liu et al.,
    2002; Lobell & Asner, 2002) to estimate SM. Hyperspectral signatures measured
    in the laboratory are very repetitive and highly oversampled with a high degree
    of intercorrelation between neighboring bands. For such cases, band aggregation
    can be applied as a simple method to reduce and downsample spectral data, which
    in turn is helpful to obtain accurate calibrations (Lopez et al., 2013). Several
    empirical indices have been defined to estimate skin SM from measured surface
    reflectance. The most reliable results have been obtained with the Water Index
    SOIL (Bryant et al., 2003), the Normalized SM Index (Haubrock et al., 2008), and
    the Shortwave Angle Slope Index (Khanna et al., 2007). The main drawback of such
    indices is the use of bands located within the water absorption features, making
    them very sensitive to effects of atmospheric water vapor. Although empirical
    methods seem to work reasonably well for the distinct conditions they were developed
    for, they cannot be universally applied as spatially significantly varying soil
    composition (i.e., SM, organic matter content, minerals, and salts) strongly affects
    spectral reflectance (Huan-Jun et al., 2009). Physical approaches for SM estimation
    from optical reflectance are mainly based on radiative transfer theory (Philpot,
    2010; Twomey et al., 1986). Sadeghi et al. (2015) proposed a promising physically
    based method to determine skin SM from transformed reflectance of bare and sparsely
    vegetated soils based on the Kubelka-Munk (Kubelka & Munk, 1931) two-flux radiative
    transfer theory, which describes diffuse reflectance from a uniform, optically
    thick, absorbing, and scattering medium. This approach yielded reasonable results
    with a RMSE of less than 0.07 cm3/cm3 when compared to directly laboratory-measured
    water contents for various soils (Figure 15). The potential applicability for
    large-scale skin SM measurements and associated challenges is yet to be assessed.
    While diffuse spectroscopy has been proven to yield good skin SM results, a few
    studies also documented its potential for accurate predictions of more complex
    properties such as water retention and hydraulic properties (Babaeian et al.,
    2015; Santra et al., 2009). Figure 15 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison
    of the Sadeghi et al. (2015) model estimates with directly measured skin soil
    moisture for single samples representing four different soil orders (left) and
    multiple samples of two different watersheds (right). RMSE = root-mean-square
    error. It is apparent that while the application of diffuse spectroscopy under
    laboratory conditions in most cases provides reasonable results, field measurements
    exhibit higher uncertainty due to natural heterogeneity of soil properties, topography,
    and vegetation effects. This points to the need for further investigations of
    spatial heterogeneity effects on the relationships between reflectance and skin
    SM. A more detailed analysis of reflectance spectra and comparison to laboratory
    spectral resolutions are required to overcome this limitation (Haubrock, Chabrillat,
    Lemmnitz, & Kaufmann, 2008). 5.2 Thermal Infrared RS Thermal infrared RS exploits
    the EM wave band between 3,500 and 14,000 nm for SM retrieval from land surface
    temperature (LST) determined with the thermal inertia method (Jackson, 1982; Price,
    1980; Schieldge et al., 1982; Verstraeten et al., 2006) or in conjunction with
    vegetation indices (VI; Claps & Laguardia, 2004). Over the past three decades,
    the LST-VI concept has been widely applied for the estimation of SM (Gillies et
    al., 1997; Mallick et al., 2009) and evapotranspiration (Heilman et al., 1976;
    Stisen et al., 2008). Several studies have documented the LST-VI/fractional vegetation
    cover (FVC) relationship within a triangular (Carlson, 2007) or trapezoidal space
    (Moran et al., 1994). The FVC ranges between 0 for bare soil and 1 for full vegetation
    cover. The so-called “universal triangle” concept was first proposed by Price
    (1990) for prediction of evapotranspiration and later adapted for surface SM retrieval
    (Carlson et al., 1994; Gillies et al., 1997). A central assumption of the triangle
    method is that when a large number of pixels capturing the full range of soil
    surface moisture and FVC are considered, sharp boundaries in the LST-VI scatter
    plot reflect real physical limits that include bare soil, full-cover vegetation,
    and lower and upper limits for surface SM (e.g., completely dry points A and C
    and saturated points B and C in Figure 16a). The dry and wet edges intersect at
    point C for full vegetation cover. The relative value of surface SM and the surface
    energy fluxes for each pixel can be defined in terms of its position within the
    triangle (Wang et al., 2011). A detailed description of the universal triangle
    method is provided in Carlson (2007). While an advantage of the triangle method
    is its independence of ancillary data (atmospheric and surface data), it is challenging
    to define the triangular space for locations with narrow VI range or for regions
    with rainy/dry seasons, which results in narrow scattering of the LST-VI points.
    The establishment of the LST-VI relationship is more complicated for large scales
    due to the spatial heterogeneity of surface properties that may affect the shape
    of LST-VI space and thereby interfere with the precise determination of the dry
    and wet edges (Wang et al., 2011). Figure 16 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Triangular LST-FVC space (a), conventional trapezoidal LST-FVC space (b), and
    two-stage trapezoidal LST-FVC space (c) reproduced from Sun (2016). LST = land
    surface temperature; FVC = fractional vegetation cover. Numerous studies have
    been devoted to estimation of surface SM from the LST-VI space. For example, Sandholt
    et al. (2002) proposed a dryness index for estimation of SM via linking the surface
    temperature Ts-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) scatter plot with
    a temperature-vegetation dryness index and found similar spatial patterns (R 2
    = 0.70) between TDVI and SM simulated with a hydrological model. Wang et al. (2001)
    proposed a Vegetation Temperature Condition Index for monitoring drought occurrence
    and its spatial distribution at the regional scale in China. Rahimzadeh-Bajgiran
    et al. (2013) developed a new method to estimate SM from the surface evaporative
    fraction retrieved from the LST-FVC space. Some studies used multiple regression
    analysis for estimation of SM. For example, Sobrino et al. (2012) applied high-resolution
    thermal images acquired with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner to estimate SM
    at field scale from emissivity, NDVI, and LST data and obtained a RMSE value of
    0.05 cm3/cm3. Based on the triangular LST-FVC feature space method, Zhang et al.
    (2015) proposed a simple method to estimate SM for the North China Plain with
    a second-order polynomial interpolation function. This method requires a number
    of atmospheric input parameters to establish the edges of the triangular LST-FVC
    space from energy balance considerations, which allows comparison of the directly
    derived SM for a wide range of atmospheric forcing conditions. Validation experiments
    with ground data for 10- and 20-cm depths yielded RMSEs from 0.04 and 0.10 m3/m3,
    respectively. The universal triangle method has been previously employed to predict
    SM at the regional/global scales from low spatial resolution but high revisit
    frequency satellite imagery such as provided by MODIS and Advanced Very High Resolution
    Radiometer for a wide range of land surface covers (Sandholt et al., 2002; Wan
    et al., 2004). NASA''s Landsat-8 satellite that was launched in February 2013
    provides thermal data (bands 10 and 11) at a moderate resolution of 100 m that
    has been applied for thermal SM RS (Amani et al., 2016; Shafian & Maas, 2015).
    The trapezoid method first proposed by Moran et al. (1994) describes the relationship
    between the surface soil and air temperature difference (Ts-Ta) and the FVC. This
    method has been applied to estimate evapotranspiration rates for both fully covered
    and partially vegetated land surfaces via the Water Deficit Index (WDI). While
    the universal triangle method establishes the dry and wet edges empirically, the
    trapezoid method is based on physical processes (Yang et al., 2015); hence, derived
    WDI values are comparable for different times. In addition, the trapezoid method
    is applicable for finer scales and regions with a narrow SM and vegetation cover
    range (Wang et al., 2011). Although the idea of a trapezoidal (Ts-Ta)-FVC space
    is widely accepted, only a few applications for SM estimation are documented in
    literature. This is partly due to challenges associated with the calculation of
    the soil surface and air temperature difference (Ts-Ta) and partly due to the
    lack of atmospheric data (i.e., air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity).
    These limitations motivated Wang et al. (2011) to apply the Ts-VI space. They
    proposed an iterative procedure for quantifying the Ts-VI trapezoid and calculated
    the WDI from MODIS surface temperature and an Enhanced Vegetation Index. SM validation
    experiments in the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in Arizona revealed that
    while temporal variations of SM can be captured reasonably well, the quantification
    of spatial variations is limited, at least for semiarid climatic conditions. This
    might be due to the often erroneous assumption of a linear relationship between
    SM and soil temperature. Although this assumption yielded reasonable SM estimates
    in the past, it is not supported by laboratory and field measurements. A simple
    evaporation experiment conducted in our laboratories revealed a nonlinear (L-shaped)
    relationship between soil surface temperature and surface SM that is also confirmed
    by field observations at a SCAN site within the Little River Watershed in Georgia
    (Figure 17). These observations point to the need to quantify and apply the actual
    soil temperature-SM relationship that is mainly influenced by atmospheric forcing
    (i.e., air temperature, humidity, and wind) to improve SM predictions. Figure

    measured surface/skin SM (soil moisture) and average (0–5 cm) SM (blue circles)
    and surface temperature (red circles) during evaporative drying of a sand column
    (left). Field-measured SM and temperature at different depths at a Soil Climate
    Analysis Network site in 2013 within the Little River Watershed in Georgia (right).
    Recent attempts to modify the trapezoid method have mainly focused on a more accurate
    definition of space edges based on the actual response of soil and vegetation
    to SM dynamics. For example, a two-stage trapezoid method (i.e., two merged triangular
    spaces) proposed by Sun (2016) proved to be more efficient than the conventional
    trapezoid method as it resolves some of the challenges discussed above (Figures
    16b and 16c). The central assumption of the two-stage trapezoid is that Ts is
    governed by surface SM within the LST-FVC space, while vegetation temperature
    (Tv) is governed by RZSM (Carlson, 2013). In fact, when moisture within a vegetated
    soil profile varies from its wettest to its driest value, the surface moisture
    approaches its lowest value before the RZSM does. This indicates a difference
    in variation rates for Tv and Ts, where Tv is lagging Ts because vegetation absorbs
    RZSM for photosynthesis and transpiration. Sun (2016) simulated the LST-FVC space
    with the “SimSphere” model and demonstrated that the new trapezoid is more consistent
    with the simulated LST-FVC space and can evolve the LST-FVC space from the triangular
    to the trapezoidal form (Figure 16c). Additionally, they compared both the two-stage
    trapezoid and the conventional trapezoid to estimate the evaporative fraction
    based on 110 MODIS LST and VI products. Comparisons have indicated that the two-stage
    trapezoid is more effective than the classical trapezoid for evaporative fraction
    estimation. The uncertainty analysis has also revealed that this method is better
    suited for areas and periods exhibiting low SM levels. Recently, Sadeghi, Babaeian,
    et al. (2017) and Babaeian et al. (2018) proposed a novel optical trapezoid model
    named OPTRAM as an alternative to the conventional triangle/trapezoid methods
    for estimating SM from transformed reflectance (SWIR transformed reflectance,
    STR) data of Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and MODIS in the SWIR band. The trapezoid
    is formed by distribution of NDVI as a measure of vegetation fraction versus STR
    as a measure of SM (Figure 18, left). The latter is based on a simple two-flux
    radiative transfer model indicating a linear relationship between surface SM and
    STR within SWIR bands, which proved to be valid for a broad range of soils (Sadeghi
    et al., 2015; Sadeghi et al., 2018). (13) Figure 18 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Sketch illustrating OPTRAM trapezoid (left), and the evaluation results of the
    optical trapezoid using Sentinel-2 data in the Little Washita watershed in Oklahoma

    NDVI = Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; MAE = mean absolute error; RMSE
    = root-mean-square error LW = Little Washita watershed. where θ s is the saturated
    water content, r is transformed reflectance, and r s and r d are the transformed
    reflectance of saturated and dry soils, respectively. This novel approach was
    evaluated based on in situ measurements of SM in different watersheds in the United
    States and showed reasonably good performance for SM retrieval (see Figure 18,
    right). The OPTRAM model has also performed equally well or, in some cases, better
    than the traditional trapezoid models. The main advantage of OPTRAM is its applicability
    to new higher spatial resolution optical satellites with no thermal band (e.g.,
    Sentinel-2). 5.3 Microwave RS As with EM in situ SM sensors, the vast disparity
    in dielectric permittivity of water, air, and solids is also exploited for microwave
    RS (Ulaby et al., 1982). The dielectric properties of the soil phases (i.e., water,
    air, and solids) affect the emissivity and backscattering of microwaves at the
    soil surface. SM is routinely retrieved from low-frequency microwave data, including
    the P-band, L-band, C-band, and X-band. Several dielectric mixing and empirical
    models have been proposed to infer bulk soil permittivity that can be related
    to SM content (Dobson et al., 1985; Mironov et al., 2009; Roth et al., 1990; Topp
    et al., 1980; Wang and Schmugge, 1980). Passive and active microwave RS of SM
    are currently the most promising techniques for global-scale monitoring. Microwave-based
    SM products are the only ones routinely supplied various satellite missions. In
    terms of continues availability of large-scale data products, microwave-based
    techniques are substantially more advanced than optical- and thermal infrared-based
    SM products. For example, some agencies (e.g., EUMSETAT and JAXA) have made operational
    commitments to their microwave SM products (i.e., ASCAT and AMSR-2) by launching
    a new mission to ensure product continuity in the event of a satellite/sensor
    failure. 5.3.1 Passive Microwave RS Passive microwave sensors (radiometers) record
    the natural microwave emission (brightness temperature, T b ) that is dependent
    on emissivity and physical temperature of the emitting body. For passive SM retrieval,
    knowledge of the physical temperature of the land surface is required. The Fresnel
    reflection equations describe the emissivity of a smooth bare soil surface based
    on the incidence angle of the sensor and the complex dielectric constant of the
    soil. Typically, soils have a rough surface, which decreases reflectivity and
    thus increases emissivity. Vegetation cover also alters microwave emissions and
    adds a separate contribution to the land surface emission signal. To simulate
    these effects, Mo et al. (1982) developed the τ-ω model that requires the optical
    depth (τ) and the single-scattering albedo of the vegetation (ω) as input parameters.
    The τ-ω model is the basis for virtually all passive microwave SM retrieval models
    that include the SCA, the L-MEB Model, the Community Microwave Emission Model,
    and the LPRM as presented in Mladenova et al. (2014), Wigneron et al. (2007),
    and Drusch et al. (2009). Where vegetation opacity governs the attenuation effects,
    the single scattering albedo describes the scattering effects within the canopy
    (Brunfeldt & Ulaby, 1984). Because the optical depth is typically not directly
    available, it can be derived from vegetation water content (VWC; Njoku & Entekhabi,
    1996) or vegetation indices (Hasan et al., 2014). A more detailed discription
    of current passive microwave instruments is presented in section 28. 5.3.2 Active
    Microwave RS While radiometers capture weak natural microwave emissions from the
    land surface, radars actively transmit a microwave signal and record the normalized
    backscattered fraction, which after SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) proccessing
    provides higher spatial resolutions than obtained with passive systems. The microwave
    energy backscattered from land surfaces is determined by soil properties as well
    as vegetation cover. As the roughness of the surface increases, the specular reflection
    decreases and surface scattering increases, which in turn increases the backscatter
    returned to the sensor (Ulaby et al., 1982). Because of these interactions, SM
    retrieval is highly dependant on accurate characterization of soil surface roughness
    (Verhoest et al., 2008). The effect of soil surface roughness on SM estimates
    can be removed by means of multiincidence angle or multipolarimetric observations,
    which eliminates the need for independent roughness measurements (Jagdhuber et
    al., 2013; Kweon & Oh, 2014; Oh, 2006; Rahman et al., 2008; Srivastava et al.,
    2003). Existing SM retrieval methods from active microwave measurements can be
    classified as empirical (Le Hégarat-Mascle et al., 2002), semiempirical (Oh et
    al., 2002), or physically based (Elfouhaily & Guérin, 2004). In the presence of
    vegetation cover, the scattering process is more complex as it is affected by
    plant geometry and plant moisture content. The plant contribution to backscattering
    depends on the specific vegetation structure that is determined by occurrence,
    orientation, water content, and optical depth of stalks, branches, and trunks.
    Vegetation effects are commonly taken into consideration by means of multiangular
    observations (Gherboudj et al., 2011; Grant et al., 2010; Magagi and Kerr, 1997),
    multilayer canopy representation (Toure et al., 1994), or polarimetric decomposition
    of vegetation and soil contributions (Jagdhuber et al., 2013, 2015). More details
    regarding radar microwave instruments are given in section 28. 5.3.3 Downscaling
    Coarse (Passive) Microwave RS Data Because of its coarse spatial resolution, passive
    microwave-based SM is not suitable for small-scale (e.g., field scale and catchment
    scale) applications, where SM commonly exhibits significant horizontal spatial
    variability. Recently, some progress has been made toward improvement of spatial
    SM representation via downscaling of radiometer data. The general idea behind
    combining active and passive microwave observations for SM retrieval from SMAP
    was driven by the fact that passive (radiometer) observations are typically more
    accurate but exhibit low spatial resolution, whereas active (radar) observations
    are more susceptible to surface roughness conditions but exhibit higher spatial
    resolution (Das, Entekhabi, Dunbar et al., 2018). Combining both observations
    may provide lower accuracy but higher spatial resolution. Das, Entekhabi, Dunbar
    et al. (2018), Das, Entekhabi, Kim et al. (2018) applied the SMAP active-passive
    algorithm and combined 3-km L-band radar and 36-km radiometer observations as
    an effective approach to high spatial resolution (3 and 9 km) and accurate SM
    estimation (ubRMSE of 0.039 cm3/cm3). Several other published approaches for active/passive
    microwave data fusion include the temporal change detection method (Piles et al.,
    2009, 2014), a Bayesian merging approach (Zhan et al., 2006), and the fusion of
    two single-source SM products from radar and radiometer (Montzka et al., 2016).
    Akbar and Moghaddam (2015) developed a combined active-passive SM retrieval algorithm,
    which is based on Monte Carlo simulations and optimization. Their approach yields
    reasonable results for a wide range of SM (0.04 to 0.40 cm3/cm3) and vegetation
    (VWC, between 0 and 5 kg/m2) conditions. They concluded that the application of
    the combined active-passive algorithm for corn surface cover (with VWC 5 kg/m2)
    reduced the SM retrieval error from 0.050 cm3/cm3 (active only) and 0.045 cm3/cm3
    (passive only) to 0.035 cm3/cm3. The performance of active-passive microwave observations
    and various retrieval and fusion methods have been evaluated for several regions
    of the World; for example, North America (Bindlish et al., 2009; Colliander et
    al., 2012; Magagi et al., 2013; Narayan et al., 2006; Njoku et al., 2002), Australia
    (Panciera et al., 2014), and Europe (Montzka et al., 2016). The combined application
    of active and passive microwave observations is exploited not only to improve
    the spatial resolution but also to improve the parameterization of retrieval models.
    The combined application dates back to Ulaby et al. (1983). Recently, Rötzer et
    al. (2017) estimated the relationship between radar backscatter and vegetation
    opacity for radiometer brightness temperature inversion for SM estimation from
    Aquarius data. Dente et al. (2014) applied a discrete scattering model to forward
    simulate both emission and backscatter and used C-band AMSR-E and ASCAT observations
    for calibration. The application of active and passive microwave observations
    in conjunction with optical NDVI data in an artificial neural network simulation
    scheme improved SM retrieval accuracy (Santi et al., 2016). The potential of SMAP
    combined L-band radar-radiometer for high spatial resolution (3 and 9 km) and
    accurate global SM has been demonstrated in Das et al. (2018a). Additional downscaling
    methods are based on optical/thermal high-resolution remote sensors, mainly relying
    on MODIS LST/NDVI products (Merlin et al., 2012, 2013; Piles et al., 2011, 2014;
    Srivastava et al., 2013), cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching (Kornelsen
    & Coulibaly, 2014), and MODIS soil evaporative efficiency (Djamai et al., 2015;
    Merlin et al., 2008) and provide SM estimates at finer resolutions ranging from
    100-m to 1-km pixel size. In the course of the Southern Great Plains (SGP-97)
    experiment, Chauhan et al. (2003) inverted the brightness temperature from the
    Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) to SM and then linked the SSM/I-derived
    low-resolution SM to Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-derived parameters
    NDVI, surface albedo, and LST, to obtain higher resolution SM estimates. Similarly,
    Merlin et al. (2013) downscaled ~40-km SMOS SM data with 1-km soil evaporative
    efficiency data from MODIS. Fang et al. (2018) improved a passive microwave SM
    downscaling algorithm based on thermal inertia for the use with SMAP. Pellenq
    et al. (2003) coupled a radiative transfer model with a hydrological model to
    consider topography and soil texture patterns for SM downscaling. Montzka et al.
    (2018) used soil textural information to estimate the subgrid SM heterogeneity
    to account for during downscaling. A good review of the existing methods for spatial
    downscaling of coarse-scale SM products is provided by Peng et al. (2016). 6 Data
    Resources This section provides an overview of ground and RS data resources available
    for long-term monitoring of SM. First, an overview of SM monitoring networks used
    for RS measurement validation is provided. Then newly developed active and passive
    microwave satellite instruments and microwave airborne remote sensors for near-surface
    and root-zone SM retrieval are described. 6.1 SM Monitoring Networks Due to the
    importance of measurements in identifying SM patterns and key hydrological processes,
    field to catchment-scale SM data have been integrated in global or continental
    networks. These data have found use both for evaluating models and for validating
    remotely sensed SM estimates. The International SM Network, ISMN, (Dorigo et al.,
    2011) combines and hosts in situ SM data from various networks including the U.S.
    Climate Reference Network, USCRN (Coopersmith et al., 2015) and the SCAN (Schaefer
    et al., 2007) for vadose zone research applications (Wang & Franz, 2015). Robock
    et al. (2000) were the first to initiate a global SM data bank including about
    600 stations in five regions. The ISMN has been initiated in 2009 by ESA for the
    SMOS project and made possible through the voluntary contributions of scientists
    and networks from around the World. The ISMN is hosted by the Vienna University
    of Technology and provides free access to the data set at http://ismn. geo. tuwien.
    ac. at/networks. The ISMN currently contains SM data contributions from more than
    35 networks and about 2,000 stations located in North America, Asia, Europe, and
    Australia. While the database contains measurements from as early as 1964, most
    data sets were initiated during the last decade (see Table 4). A long-time data
    set of gravimetrically measured SM has been previously presented by Robock et
    al. (2005), who compiled 45 years (1958–2002) of SM data for the top 1-cm soil
    layer from over 141 stations in croplands in the Ukraine with 10-day temporal
    resolution. However, this data set does not represent all the biomes to the same
    extent, which may provide uncertainties for validation of SM estimates. The latest
    SM networks in the United States are the COSMOS and GNSS networks, which are described
    in Sections 5 and 8. These data have been used for validation of remotely sensed
    SM products such as SMAP (Akbar & Moghaddam, 2015; Colliander et al., 2017; Montzka,
    Bogena, et al., 2017), SMOS (Montzka, Bogena, et al., 2017; Van der Schalie et
    al., 2016), ASCAT (Fascetti et al., 2016), and AMSR-2 (Wu et al., 2016). The USCRN
    data have been used to validate AMSR-E SM data products (Coopersmith et al., 2015).
    The ISMN data have been widely used to validate the ESA CCI SM product (Al-Yaari
    et al., 2016; Chakravorty et al., 2016; Cui et al., 2018; Dorigo et al., 2015;
    Karthikeyan et al., 2017). For further information, interested readers are referred

    of climate model simulations and identifying trends in the hydrological cycle
    due to the impact of regional climate change and land use. Some of the stations
    (e.g., OK Mesonet and ARM SGP Sites) only monitor soil matric potential with matric
    potential sensors. These matric potentials can be converted to SM estimates via
    site- and depth-specific soil water retention curves (see section 2). Apart from
    SM measurements, important atmospheric variables such as precipitation, air temperature,
    soil temperature, humidity, pressure, and solar radiation are also monitored in
    some U.S. networks that include SCAN, CRN, and SNOTEL. These auxiliary data assist
    users with correct interpretations of SM observations. Table 4 provides a detailed
    overview of the most important ISMNs that are currently measuring SM on an operational
    basis within and outside the United States. It should be noted that this overview
    of networks presents a current snapshot with the ISMN continuously expanding.
    Not only in the United States but also in Europe and Asia several large-scale
    SM monitoring networks have been established for research purposes, validation
    of RS SM products, and as support for natural hazard forecasting. It is widely
    acknowledged that significant additional efforts are needed to enhance measurement
    consistency and standardization, data, and metadata. Furthermore, to reach the
    goal of a fully integrated global SM observation system, it will be important
    to establish, expand, and improve current SM observations, both in situ and remotely
    sensed. 6.2 Microwave Satellite SM Data Resources Microwave RS has been applied
    for SM retrieval since 1978 (Chen et al., 2012). Recent and currently operating
    spaceborne sensors that provide SM information include (1) the Advanced Microwave
    Scanning Radiometer on NASA Earth Observing System Aqua and the GCOM-W1 (AMSR-E
    and AMSR-2; Jackson et al., 2012; Kachi et al., 2014), (2) the ASCAT on EUMETSAT
    MetOp-A and MetOp-B (Wagner et al., 2013), (3) NASA''s WindSat Spaceborne Polarimetric
    Microwave Radiometer on the Naval Research Laboratory''s Coriolis satellite (Gaiser
    et al., 2004), (4) the European SMOS (Kerr et al., 2001); (5) NASA''s SMAP (Entekhabi
    et al., 2010), (6) the JAXA Advanced Land Observation Satellite 2, and (7) the
    ESA Sentinel-1 (Bartalis et al., 2007), which are selectively described in more
    detail below and in Table 5. The Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR)
    onboard Nimbus-7 (1978–1987) and the SSM/I satellite data have been interpreted
    in terms of SM as well (De Jeu, 2003), and though the accuracy may be lower, these
    data do cover time periods that are otherwise missing. A combination of several
    initial active and passive satellites is provided by the CCI for global SM. The
    U.S. and Indian radar mission NISAR (NASA-ISRO SAR Mission) that is currently
    in the planning stage and projected to be launched in 2021 will operate at the
    L-band and S-band. However, it is still unclear whether NISAR will generate official
    SM products. A Tandem-L mission that enables the systematic monitoring of dynamic
    processes on the Earth surface has been proposed as an innovative interferometric
    and polarimetric radar mission (Krieger et al., 2007) using a pair of cooperating
    L-band SAR satellites flying in close formation (Krieger et al., 2009). Moreover,
    a Copernicus candidate mission has been proposed incorporating optical, thermal,
    and microwave data from ESA''s Sentinels and SMOS with contribution of non-ESA
    satellites such as ASCAT, Terra-SAR, and RADARSAT-2. The current state of SM RS
    has been reviewed by Mohanty et al. (2017). Table 5. Overview of Operational Satellite

    Over grasslands and agricultural areas. The integration of multiple SM data sources
    at various spatial and temporal scales is beneficial for numerous applications.
    An excellent example is NASA''s Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active
    Archive Center (ORNL DAAC), which provides scientific and other user access to
    SM data for North America from airborne (Airborne Microwave Observatory of Sub-canopy
    and Subsurface [AirMOSS]), satellite (SMAP, GRACE) and ground network sources
    (SCAN, USCRN, COSMOS, SNOTEL, Soil Moisture Sensing Controller and oPtimal Estimator,
    and FLUXNET) through a single platform called SM Visualizer (http://daac. ornl.
    gov). The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) also manages and distributes
    such data for users (https://nsidc. org/data). 6.2.1 The Advanced Microwave Scanning
    Radiometer (AMSR-E/AMSR-2) The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the
    Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) is a passive multiband sensor onboard of NASA''s
    Earth Observing System Aqua satellite (Figure 19a) that measures geophysical variables
    related to the Earth''s water cycle such as precipitation rate, water vapor, cloud
    water, sea surface wind/temperature, sea ice concentration, SWE, and SM content.
    AMSR-E uses the X-band and C-band for SM retrievals. Because of radio frequency
    interference (RFI) in the C-band (6.9 and 10.7 GHz), especially over the U.S.,
    Middle East, Japan, Italy, and the U.K. (Njoku et al., 2005), the X-band has been
    extensively used for SM retrieval. The AMSR-E spatial resolution has improved
    (50 km) when compared to previous missions (e.g., SMMR with 150 km), while sustaining
    all channels of the previous sensors (i.e., SMMR, SMM/I, and TMI). Providing ~10-year
    data across several channels, AMSR-E generates new opportunities and very useful
    insights toward the development of SM retrieval algorithms (e.g., development
    of SMAP and SMOS algorithms) and long-term monitoring of soil, water, and climate
    interactions. Several retrieval algorithms have been developed to estimate global
    SM from AMSR-E data (Du et al., 2016; Jackson et al., 2010; Njoku et al., 2003;
    Owe et al., 2001). The LPRM developed by VU University Amsterdam in collaboration
    with NASA (Owe et al., 2008) is one of the more widely applied algorithms for
    simultaneous SM, vegetation optical depth, and surface temperature retrieval (Cho
    et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015; Meesterns et al., 2005). Figure 19 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Renderings of the (a) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer
    for the Earth Observing System, (b) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-2),
    (c) Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), (d) Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS), (e)
    Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), and (f) Sentinel-1 satellites. As a follow-on
    to AMSR-E, the AMSR-2 (Figure 19b) sensor onboard of Japan''s Aerospace Exploration
    Agency (JAXA) GCOM-W satellite started measuring and releasing brightness temperature
    (passive) data in multiple frequencies (bands) in January 2012 with a revisit
    time of 1–2 days and crossing nodes at 1:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. local solar time
    for ascending and descending orbits, respectively. The lower frequencies (6.9
    GHz, C-band) provide more accurate SM retrievals for the top ~1–2 cm soil layer
    (Molero et al., 2017). The underlying concept of AMSR-2 is identical to that of
    AMSR-E (Kachi et al., 2014). Major improvements of AMSR-2 include (1) a larger
    reflector system of 2.0-m diameter to provide better spatial resolution, (2) the
    inclusion of an additional 7.3-GHz dual polarization frequency channel for improvement
    of RFI mitigation, (3) 12-bit quantization for all channels, and (4) an improved
    calibration system (Imaoka et al., 2010). Table 5 provides operational details
    of the AMSR-E and AMSR-2 sensors. AMSR-2 includes several SM products. The LPRM
    SM product for descending overpass has provided more accurate results than that
    of ascending orbit (Molero et al., 2017) probably due to the more uniform surface
    temperature and SM. 6.2.2 The ASCAT The Active Microwave Instrument Wind Scatterometer
    onboard of the European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellite is a C-band (5.3 GHz) sensor
    initially intended for wind monitoring but also widely utilized as the first active
    sensor for retrieving SM. The ERS-1 SCAT has been monitoring the Earth between
    1991 and 2000. The second instrument (ERS-2 SCAT) was launched in 1995 and ceased
    operation in 2011. The ERS-1/2 SCAT had a spatial resolution of 50 km and a revisit
    time of 2–7 days. ERS-1/2 SCAT provides a valuable long-term SM data set for climate
    change applications that is used to create the ESA CCI active SM products. As
    a successor of ERS-1/2 SCAT, the ASCAT is a C-band scatterometer with no SAR-based
    resolution enhancement deployed on satellite platforms of the European Organization
    for the EUMETSAT (Figure 19c). The EUMETSAT MetOp-A satellite was launched in
    October 2006, and MetOp-B was launched in September 2012. The MetOp-C platform
    was launched in November 2018. The instrument was initially designed for monitoring
    wind speed and direction over the oceans, but ASCAT has also been widely used
    for monitoring SM (Albergel et al., 2009; Draper et al., 2011; Matgen et al.,
    2012) due to its high-quality calibration, high radiometric accuracy, and multiple-viewing
    capabilities (Wagner et al., 2013). The ASCAT sensor includes three vertically
    polarized antennas oriented at 45°, 90°, and 135° angles with respect to the satellite
    track, resulting in a double swath of about 500 km with a gap of about 360 km.
    The ASCAT near-surface SM estimates are obtained with a linear change detection
    retrieval algorithm developed by Wagner et al. (1999), where estimates are obtained
    at a distinct incidence angle (taken at 40°). This algorithm yields SM content
    in terms of relative saturation. The algorithm is part of the WAter Retrieval
    Package software, which provides the means for deriving long-term SM time series
    (Naeimi et al., 2009; Naeimi, Scipal, et al., 2009). The basic assumptions of
    the algorithm include a linear relationship between backscatter (dB) and near-surface
    SM and stability of backscatter despite seasonal change in vegetation and roughness
    (Naeimi et al., 2009a & 2009b). Thus, a disadvantage of the change detection algorithm
    is that the different contributions to the observed total backscatter from the
    soil, vegetation, and soil-vegetation interaction effects cannot be separated
    (Wagner et al., 2013). It should be noted that the algorithm calculates only relative
    changes in SM and not absolute SM. Hence, tie points to convert relative saturation
    to absolute SM are required. The MetOp-C, unlike SMOS and SMAP, is an operational
    platform that generates a real-time operational product that is publicly distributed
    by EUMETSAT (https://navigator.eumetsat.int/product/EO:EUM:DAT:METOP:SOMO12).
    This constitutes a much stronger commitment to data continuity than provided by
    scientific missions such as SMOS and SMAP. 6.2.3 The Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity
    (SMOS) Mission The SMOS satellite with the Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture
    Synthesis (MIRAS) instrument is developed by the Centre d''Etudes Spatiales de
    la Biosphère with support from ESA and in collaboration with the Centre National
    d''Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and the Centro Para el Desarrollo Tecnological Industrial
    (Figure 19d). SMOS is the first satellite dedicated to the global measurement
    of near-surface SM (top 5 cm) with moderate spatial resolution (Kerr et al., 2001;
    Kerr et al., 2010). Using an interferometric radiometer, SMOS captures brightness
    temperature (T b ) at several incidence angles. The radiometer exploits the interferometry
    principle, where 69 small receivers measure the phase difference of the incident
    radiation emitted from the Earth''s surface. The technique is based on cross correlation
    of observations from all receiver pair combinations to generate the scene T b
    . As the satellite moves along its orbital path, each observed area is imaged
    at various viewing angles. The microwave signal within the L-band is much more
    sensitive to changes in SM than it is to atmospheric disturbances or land surface
    characteristics (i.e., surface roughness, soil texture, topography, and soil bulk
    density; Kerr et al., 2012). The SMOS mission provides SM estimates generated
    from T b (L1) via the SMOS L2 processor (Kerr et al., 2010), which in principle
    contains the L-MEB model proposed by Wigneron et al. (2007). In general, L-MEB
    is applied to compute multiangular top-of-the-atmosphere brightness temperatures
    based on a set of soil (e.g., moisture, temperature, and texture), vegetation
    (e.g., water content and temperature), and radiative transfer parameters (e.g.,
    single scattering albedo, polarization coupling factor, and surface roughness).
    The retrieval algorithm as outlined in Kerr et al. (2012) is based on a Bayesian
    approach, where L-MEB based brightness temperatures are compared with direct observations
    through minimizing a cost function. SMOS L1 and L2 products have been used to
    derive higher-level products, L3 and L4. SMOS L3 products include surface SM and
    vegetation optical depth (VOD), while SMOS L4 products provide root-zone SM (0–100
    cm), surface roughness, neural network-based SM from AMSR-E/SMOS synergies, and
    an agricultural drought index with spatial resolution of 25 km (EASE-2 grid; Al
    Bitar et al., 2013; Mecklenburg et al., 2016; Parrens et al., 2016; Rodríguez-Fernández
    et al., 2016). A comprehensive overview of modeling approaches and SM retrieval
    algorithms has been presented by Wigneron et al. (2017). The recent diurnal L3
    product, SMOS-IC, has been released by the French Institut National de la Recherche
    Agronomique in collaboration with the Centre d''Etudes Spatiales de la biosphere
    to provide global estimations of SM (Figure 20, top) and VOD (Fernandez-Moran
    et al., 2017). The VOD product can be used in support of agricultural applications
    related to food security (Mecklenburg et al., 2016). SMOS-IC is based on L-MEB,
    but its algorithm is simpler than the operational SMOS L2 and L3 SM retrieval
    algorithms. In SMOS-IC pixels are assumed homogeneous (a single value of each
    input model parameter is used for the whole pixel), while operational SMOS L2
    and L3 algorithms correct for pixel heterogeneity. This provides greater independence
    of SMOS-IC from uncertainties in auxiliary data (e.g., MODIS LAI data and SM information
    used as auxiliary data in L2/L3 algorithms to estimate T b in the pixel fractions
    of heterogeneous pixels) and tends to perform better than previous SMOS products
    due to considering updated soil roughness and vegetation albedo parameters for
    calibration of L-MEB SM retrievals based on ISMN SM data (Fernandez-Moran et al.,
    2017; Parrens et al., 2016). L-band observations have been challenged by unexpected
    RFI. Despite being a protected band for scientific studies, the SMOS mission has
    suffered significantly from RFI effects in certain regions (Oliva et al., 2012).
    The number of RFI sources has been reduced in Europe, North and South America,
    and China but remains significant in Asia and the Middle East (Soldo et al., 2016).
    SMOS data are publicly available from ESA (L2 and L3; http://smos-diss.eo.esa.int/)
    and CATDS (L3 and L4; http://www.catds.fr/Products). Figure 20 Open in figure

    (0–5 cm) soil moisture retrievals for August 2017. SMOS = Soil Moisture Ocean
    Salinity; SMAP = Soil Moisture Active Passive. 6.2.4 The SMAP Mission The SMAP
    satellite is the most recent microwave sensor designed to measure and map SM within
    the top 5 cm of soil and to discern between frozen and thawed states by applying
    both active and passive sensors. The major science objectives of SMAP are to understand
    processes that link the water, energy, and carbon cycles, land surface global
    water, and energy fluxes and to improve weather and climate predictions (Entekhabi
    et al., 2010). This was intended to be accomplished with an instrument that combines
    L-band radar with an L-band radiometer, which share a conically rotating 6-m aperture
    reflector antenna that scans a 1,000-km-wide swath while the observatory orbits
    the Earth (Figure 19e and Table 5). The radiometer provides “passive” measurements
    of microwave emissions from the upper soil layer. It is more sensitive to near-surface
    SM and less sensitive to the effects of surface roughness and vegetation when
    compared to the radar. The SMAP mission yields 15 publicly available baseline
    science data products that include near-surface and root-zone SM (RZSM) estimates.
    The RZSM estimates are based on the assimilation of SMAP data into land surface
    models (NASA Catchment land surface model; Reichle et al., 2014). The joint processing
    of the radar and radiometer data was intended to yield SM at spatial resolutions
    of 3, 9, and 36 km with 3-day temporal resolution (Entekhabi et al., 2010). While
    the SMAP satellite was designed to spend at least 3 years in orbit, the high-resolution
    SMAP radar failed in July 2015 (three months after launch), leaving only the SMAP
    radiometer operational to this day. The SMAP target accuracy for SM is 0.04 cm3/cm3
    (based on unbiased RMSE) and is determined based on threshold VWC less than 5
    kg/m2. There are two types of SMAP level 2/3 passive surface SM products: the
    standard product is posted on a 36-km Equal-Area Scalable Earth (EASE)-2 grid
    (L2/3 SM_P), while the optimally interpolated “enhanced” product is posted on
    a 9-km EASE-2 grid (L2/3 SM_P_E). The actual resolution of the latter is coarser
    than 9 km (Figure 20, bottom). Both products include SM retrievals for both a.m.
    and p.m. orbits. These data have a revisit time of 2–3 days at any location and
    a latency of 12–24 hr from the time of observation. Of particular interest is
    the SMAP level 4 (L4) model-based SM product obtained from assimilating SMAP level
    2 (L2) brightness temperature observations into the NASA catchment land surface
    model (Reichle et al., 2017). SMAP L4 provides global estimates of both surface
    (0–5 cm) and RZSM (down to 100 cm) with 9-km spatial and 3-hr temporal resolutions,
    interpolated from the coarse-scale (36 km) observations in space and in time (Reichle
    et al., 2017). The improved SMAP L4 product resolution provides additional information
    about the spatial variability of SM making it suitable for medium-scale applications.
    As a replacement for the radar, SMAP has recently released an active/passive SM
    product at a 3-km posting, which uses C-band backscatter observations from Sentinel-1
    to replace the SMAP L-band radar. It is only available for the locations and times
    where SMAP and Sentinel-1 overlap. The experience gained from SMOS aided SMAP
    in the development of better back-end mitigation tools and filters for RFI for
    both radiometer and radar instruments (Colliander et al., 2017). L-band RFI is
    a critical threat to future efforts to globally measure SM. It should be noted
    that to date, SMAP provides the most accurate global SM products (L3 and L4) for
    various applications (Chan et al., 2016 & 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Colliander
    et al., 2017; Crow et al., 2017; Koster et al., 2016). Passive SMAP data are publicly
    available from the National Soil and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) (https://nsidc. org/data/smap/smap-data.
    html). 6.2.5 The Sentinel-1 Mission The ESA Sentinel-1 mission (S-1) is a two-satellite
    polar-orbiting and day-and night-radar imaging system for land and ocean monitoring
    (Figure 19f). The goal of the mission is to provide data continuity following
    the retirement of ERS-2 and Envisat (Paloscia et al., 2013). The S-1 yields improved
    spatial, temporal, and radiometric resolutions when compared to the previous Envisat
    ASAR GM mode, while working at nearly the same frequency (e.g., 5.4 versus 5.3
    GHz; Table 5). Another improvement is the application of cross polarization to
    correct for seasonal vegetation effects in the copolarized backscatter measurements.
    In general, due to the better penetration of horizontally polarized (HH) waves
    through vertically oriented vegetation (grasses, crops), HH polarization is preferred
    (Brown et al., 2003). While the ESA provides Level-1 georeferenced single looked
    complex and projected multilook ground range detected products, a dedicated SM
    product is not available. Several attempts have been made to develop algorithms
    for retrieving SM from S-1 SAR data (Balenzano et al., 2012 ; Pierdicca et al.,
    2014). For example, Paloscia et al. (2013) presented an Artificial Neural Network-based
    algorithm to retrieve SM from S-1 data and tested their approach based on in situ
    ground data from several test sites in Italy, Australia, and Spain and obtained
    mean RMSEs less than 0.046 cm3/cm3, which is in line with S-1 target retrieval
    accuracy (0.05 cm3/cm3). In general, SM retrieval from SAR data is challenging
    due to the confounding influence of surface roughness and vegetation on the signal.
    Although numerous approaches utilizing different backscatter models have been
    developed, SM retrieval from S-1 data remains an enigma, mainly due to significant
    roughness changes (e.g., due to agricultural practices) and higher complexity
    of vegetation characterization at finer scales (e.g., wheat versus sugar beet)
    (Barrett et al., 2009). Due to the loss of the SMAP radar, S-1 is currently the
    only active sensor with a high spatial but 6-day temporal resolution for near-surface
    SM estimations. Such temporal resolution is not adequate for applications where
    3 days or less is required. Recently, the S-1 radar backscatter measurements (C-band)
    have been combined with SMAP radiometer brightness temperature (L-band) observations
    to produce a high resolution SMAP-Sentinel-1 SM product (SPL2SMAP_S) with 3-km
    EASE-grid providing SM from April 2015 to present and available to the public
    through NASA DAAC at the NSIDC (https://nsidc. org/data/SPL2SMAP_S/versions/2)
    (Das et al., 2018b). 6.2.6 The CCI The CCI is a part of ESA''s global monitoring
    of Essential Climate Variables (program, which includes SM). The CCI aims to provide
    the most complete and consistent global SM products based on several active and
    passive microwave remote sensors dating back to 1978. The record is based on three
    products that differ in the data source: (1) an active-only data set, (2) a passive-only
    data set, and (3) a merged active-passive data set (Liu et al., 2012; Wagner et
    al., 2012). The active data set (1991–2014) was generated with the change detection
    algorithm (Naeimi, Scipal, et al., 2009; Wagner, Lemoine, & Rott, 1999) based
    on observations from the C-band scatterometer onboard of ERS-1, ERS-2 (AMI SCAT)
    and METOP-A (ASCAT). The passive data set (1978–2014) was generated by VU University
    Amsterdam in collaboration with NASA using the LPRM (Owe et al., 2008) based on
    observations from Nimbus 7 SMMR, DMSP SSM/I, TRMM TMI, and Aqua AMSR-E (Liu et
    al., 2012). The new 04.2 version of the CCI additionally includes passive AMSR-2
    and SMOS SM data in the merged SM product (Chung et al., 2018). It is possible
    to include SM data from new satellite missions (i.e., SMAP, Aquarius, and Sentinel-1)
    (Wagner et al., 2012) (Figure 21). This CCI SM merged data set is publically available
    from https://www.esa-soilmoisture-cci.org. Figure 22 shows an example of the CCI
    product for global monitoring of SM. Figure 21 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    WACMOS: Water Cycle Multi-mission Observation Strategy). 6.2.7 Evaluation of Microwave
    Satellite SM Retrievals SM retrieval from RS observations may be biased by numerous
    factors, which are mainly related to atmospheric interferences, vegetation properties,
    and soil roughness. This necessitates comprehensive validation of the resulting
    SM estimates. Significant efforts have been devoted to the development of novel
    algorithms providing reliable SM estimates for a variety of land surface conditions
    (Al-Yaari et al., 2017; Das et al., 2011; Fernandez-Moran et al., 2017; Kerr et
    al., 2016; McNairn et al., 2015; Montzka et al., 2014; Piles et al., 2009; Rodríguez-Fernández
    et al., 2015; Schwank et al., 2010; van der Schalie et al., 2018; Vittucci et
    al., 2016). Validation of SM retrievals is commonly performed based on data from
    in situ SM networks. For example, validation of SMAP SM products is performed
    with a global network of 34 high-quality core validation sites that provide estimates
    of SM at SMAP grid product scales (Colliander et al., 2017). A comprehensive assessment
    of SMAP L4 surface and root-zone SM products based on sparse network and core
    validation sites in the World has been provided by Reichle et al. (2017). Their
    findings indicate that the SMAP L4 meets its established SM retrieval accuracy
    requirement (0.04 cm3/cm3) with ubRMSE of 0.035–0.038 cm3/cm3 and 0.026–0.03 cm3/cm3
    for surface and root-zone retrievals, respectively (https://nsidc. org/data/smap/technical-references).

    has a target SM retrieval error of less than 0.04 cm3/cm3. Experimental validation
    has been carried out in Europe (Dall''Amico et al., 2012; Dente et al., 2012;
    Fascetti et al., 2016; Pierdicca et al., 2015; Rötzer et al., 2014; Wigneron et
    al., 2012), the United States (Al Bitar et al., 2012; Jackson et al., 2012; Wagner
    et al., 2014), Africa (Fascetti et al., 2016; Louvet et al., 2015; Pierdicca et
    al., 2015), South America (Niclòs et al., 2016), and Australia (van der Schalie
    et al., 2015). The validation ranged from local (Jackson et al., 2012; Louvet
    et al., 2015) to continental scales (Al Bitar et al., 2012; Fascetti et al., 2016).
    Different validation experiments for SMOS SM products have generally revealed
    varying retrieval accuracies ranging from 0.030 to 0.140 cm3/cm3 depending on
    soil type, seasonality, and vegetation density (see also Table 6). For example,
    for rain-fed croplands in Argentina, Niclòs et al. (2016) determined a SM retrieval
    uncertainty of ±0.07 cm3/cm3 for SMOS L2 SM products. Louvet et al. (2015) evaluated
    SMOS L3 SM data with ground-based SM measurements at the local and regional scales
    over West Africa and found an average RMSE of 0.047 cm3/cm3. Petropoulos et al.
    (2015) extensively evaluated SMOS SM operational estimates for some European sites
    with a variety of climate, environmental, biome, and seasonal conditions against
    the Carbo-Europe in situ network and found that SMOS performed better for low
    vegetation cover (with a RMSE from 0.044 to 0.061 cm3/cm3) and during the autumn
    season (with a RMSE of 0.076 cm3/cm3). Global comparison of SMOS to other missions
    like AMSR-2 indicated consistent results for SMOS over all surfaces from very
    dry (African Sahel, Arizona) to wet (tropical rain forests; Al-Yari et al., 2014;
    Kerr et al., 2016; Van der Schalie et al., 2016). Since AMSR-2 is a new passive
    system, efforts have been devoted to the evaluation of the quality of its SM estimates
    by utilizing existing in situ observation networks (Cho, Choi, & Wagner, 2015;
    H. Lu et al., 2014; Parinussa et al., 2014). For example, Kim et al. (2015) evaluated
    the accuracy of global AMSR-2 SM estimates based on COSMOS networks in the United
    States, Australia, Europe, and Africa and reported reliable performance. More
    recently, Wu et al. (2016) evaluated the performance for ascending and descending
    AMSR-2 SM products during a 3-year period (2012–2015) based on in situ measurements
    at 598 stations of the ISMN network obtained for various land cover types and
    ecoregions. Their results revealed the best agreement with in situ measurements
    for the Great Plains (RMSE 0.051 cm3/cm3) and the worst for forested areas (RMSE
    0.094 cm3/cm3; see also Table 6). Validation experiments for ASCAT SM estimates
    indicated reasonable performance for several regions in Europe, with even somewhat
    better results than provided by the initial SMOS and best AMSR-E SM retrievals.
    The performance of ASCAT for mountainous regions or desert land was unsatisfactory
    (Wagner et al., 2013). A comparison between ASCAT and SMOS SM retrievals with
    in situ ground measurements in Europe and Northern Africa for the period from
    2010 to 2013 has shown similar results (with mean RMSE 0.124 cm3/cm3; Fascetti
    et al., 2016). A validation experiment for ASCAT and SMOS SM data for four U.S.
    watersheds yielded large differences. The ASCAT SM estimates were very noisy and
    unstable, which may be due to higher sensitivity of the active observations to
    surface roughness (Leroux et al., 2014). In a similar study, Rötzer et al. (2014)
    evaluated SMOS and ASCAT SM products based on upscaled in situ measurements at
    three TERENO test sites in western Germany for the time period from 2010 to 2012.
    They applied the Water Flow and Balance Simulation (WaSiM) model for upscaling
    in situ measurements and found that while SMOS provided relatively constant bias,
    ASCAT bias was variable throughout the year. While ASCAT provides accurate SM
    estimates for bare and sparsely vegetated soils, estimates for tropical forests
    and other densely vegetated regions are associated with significant SM retrieval
    errors (Wagner et al., 2013). The ASCAT surface SM estimates have been applied
    to determine SM distributions within the soil profile by means of the Soil Water
    Index (SWI), an exponential relationship that links surface and subsurface SM
    via a characteristic time length (Ceballos et al., 2005; De Lange et al., 2008;
    Wagner et al., 1999). For example, Paulik et al. (2014) evaluated SWI estimates
    based on in situ measurements at 664 stations (distributed over 23 observation
    networks) in the United States for a 5-year period and found an average correlation
    coefficient of 0.54 and RMSEs below 0.079 cm3/cm3. A global validation of the
    ASCAT SWI with in situ data from the ISMN has been provided by Paulik et al. (2012).
    The ASCAT near-surface SM products have also been assimilated into land surface
    models to provide profile SM (Dharssi et al., 2011; Draper et al., 2011, 2012;
    Reichle et al., 2007). An ASCAT root-zone SM profile product, the so-called SM-Data
    Assimilation System-2, SM-DAS-2 or H14, has been developed by the European Organization
    for the EUMETSAT based on a near-surface SM index, the H-16 SM-OBS-3 product,
    and a Simplified Extended Kalman Filter Data Assimilation System (De Rosnay et
    al., 2011). This product is available for four soil layers from the surface down
    to 3 m (i.e., 0–7, 7–28, 28–100, and 100–289 cm) with global daily coverage. This
    product has been evaluated based on in situ measurements and yielded better SM
    estimates than model or satellite estimates alone (Albergel et al., 2010, 2012).
    The ASCAT root-zone SM profile retrieval algorithm is now operational at the European
    Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). A significant constraint of
    ASCAT SM data is the irregular temporal coverage. However, so far only a few validation
    experiments have been conducted to determine the performance of the S-1 data with
    regard to SM retrieval. Table 6 provides an overview of the accuracy and performance
    of validation experiments used to retrieve SM from various microwave satellite
    remote sensors. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate CCI products based
    on in situ measurements and finer spatial resolution remotely sensed SM data.
    In a comprehensive validation, Dorigo et al. (2015) evaluated historical CCI products
    based on ground measurements at 596 sites from 28 globally distributed SM networks.
    They reported RMSE of 0.05 cm3/cm−3 (R = 0.46) for absolute values and 0.04 cm3/cm−3
    (R = 0.36) for SM anomalies. In a similar study, Wang et al. (2015) performed
    reliability analysis of CCI products for croplands in North China for the period
    from 1981 to 2010. They obtained an average triple collocation (TC) random error
    of 0.052 cm3/cm3 and an average Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.42. A quality
    assessment of 5-year CCI data based on estimates from Envisat ASAR (Wide Swath
    Mode) for various climate, topography, land cover, and soil-type conditions has
    provided reasonable agreement between the ASAR and CCI data sets, with correlation
    values larger than 0.55 (Pratola et al., 2015). It has been pointed out that the
    merged products have a similar or better performance than individual products
    (Dorigo et al., 2015). Recently, Gruber et al. (2017) proposed a new merging approach
    based on weighted averaging and error variance estimates obtained from TC analysis
    for blending multi-platform (active/passive) SM products, which is being used
    in the new CCI product (version v03.x and higher). An overview of validation results
    for microwave satellite SM retrievals is given in Table 6. High spatial variability
    of SM results in significant differences between the point-scale in situ SM sensors
    and the coarse-scale satellite-based SM retrievals, which provides a significant
    challenge for the validation of SM from the current and the upcoming SM satellite
    missions. Upscaling point-scale SM could help to fill in the scale gaps and provide
    reliable validation of satellite SM products. An excellent review of the SM upscaling
    problem and measurement density requirements for ground based SM data has been
    provided by Crow et al. (2012). 6.3 Airborne Microwave Sensors and Imagery Over
    the past few decades, extensive L-band and C-band airborne observations have been
    conducted with the aim of preparation for L-band and C-band satellite missions.
    Such microwave instruments are only capable of measuring near-surface SM, which
    is then assimilated into hydrologic models to determine profile SM (Draper et
    al., 2012; Montzka et al., 2011; see also section 43). There is significant interest
    in direct, large-scale, profile SM measurements because data assimilation approaches
    that couple satellite-based near-surface SM and subsurface SM may fail under specific
    circumstances (Kumar et al., 2009; Walker et al., 2002). The application of lower-frequency
    (deeper measurement) airborne microwave remote sensors for profile SM quantification
    has been an area of extensive research in recent years. In this section we focus
    on lower-frequency airborne activities only. At the lower P-band microwave frequencies,
    the signal penetrates to deeper soil depths, which allows direct profile SM sensing,
    which is of significant importance for many agricultural, hydrological, and meteorological
    applications and which is critical to strategic management of water resources.
    6.3.1 The AirMOSS Mission The NASA AirMOSS mission that consists of a P-band fully
    polarimetric SAR represents the first attempt to provide high-resolution observations
    of RZSM and net ecosystem exchange (NEE). The project targets nine regions representative
    of the major North American climatic biomes for estimating the impact of RZSM
    on regional carbon fluxes and integrating the measurement-constrained estimates
    of regional carbon fluxes to the continental scale of North America (Chapin et
    al., 2012; Tabatabaeenejad et al., 2013). In contrast to L-band and C-band microwave
    remote sensors, AirMOSS is designed to provide direct RZSM estimates. For the
    AirMOSS mission, NASA has adapted its Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture
    Radar, a pod-based repeat-pass polarimetric SAR that operates within the L-band
    (∼1.2 GHz) and incorporated a P-band (280–440 MHz) SAR, which operates at different
    frequencies onboard a Gulfstream-3 aircraft. The AirMOSS is capable of penetrating
    through vegetation extending to soil depths of about 0.5 m. The actual measurement
    depth depends on SM status, soil type, and vegetation cover (Moghaddam et al.,
    2000). It should be noted that P-band SAR observations are influenced by Faraday
    rotation resultant from the anisotropic ionosphere and the action of the geomagnetic
    field. This distorts P-band data and complicates their direct application for
    SM retrieval (Qi & Jin, 2007; Rignot et al., 1995). AirMOSS test flights started
    in August 2012 and science operations commenced in October 2012. The surveys cover
    approximately 25 × 100-km areas that contain FLUXNET sites for ground calibration
    and span regions ranging from boreal forests in Saskatchewan (Canada) to tropical
    forests in La Selva (Costa Rica) (Tabatabaeenejad et al., 2015). The flights have
    provided high spatial resolution (100 m) measurements for nine regions representative
    for the major North American biomes (Figure 23) at subweekly, seasonal, and annual
    time scales. Furthermore, AirMOSS data can provide a direct means for validating
    RZSM algorithms applied for the SMAP L4 SM retrieval (Tabatabaeenejad et al.,
    2015). A cross comparison between AirMOSS and model-based RZSM estimates generated
    by the Flux-Penn State Hydrology Model (Flux-PIHM) over the nine biome sites demonstrated
    comparable levels of accuracy for the two products when evaluated against in situ
    SM measurements and a significant temporal cross correlation. However, the AirMOSS
    RZSM retrievals showed higher spatial and temporal variability than the Flux-PIHM
    estimates (Crow et al., 2018). AirMOSS data are publicly available from NASA at
    https://airmoss. jpl. nasa. gov. Figure 23 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The
    Airborne Microwave Observatory of Sub-canopy and Subsurface study regions in North
    America. 6.3.2 The E-SAR The Experimental Synthetic Aperture Radar (E-SAR) onboard
    the German DLR DO228 aircraft is capable of simultaneously capturing data within
    the X-band, C-band, L-band, and P-band. The measurement modes include single channel
    operation mode (i.e., one wavelength and polarization at a time), the SAR Interferometry
    mode (X-band and C-band), and the SAR Polarimetry mode (L-band and P-band). The
    E-SAR captures an area of 3–5 × 20 km with slant range resolution of 2.3 to 4.5
    m and azimuth resolution of 0.7 to 2.5 m. The E-SAR has been in operation since
    1989 and has been continuously improved and applied to various SM and ice study
    campaigns such as AgriSAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar in Agriculture, 2006), OPAQUE
    (Operational discharge and flooding predictions in head catchments, 2007–2008),
    SARTEO (Synthetic Aperture Radar within TERENO framework, 2008; Bogena et al.,
    2018), and ICESAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar for Ice, 2007) (Jagdhuber et al.,
    2015; Parrella et al., 2016). In 2012, the Microwaves and Radar Institute of the
    German Aerospace Center (DLR) developed an improved E-SAR version, termed F-SAR,
    based on the same platform and frequencies. Several studies have demonstrated
    the capability of E-SAR for SM retrieval. Zwieback et al. (2015) showed that SM
    variations significantly affect E-SAR L-band radar signals (i.e., phase, coherence,
    and phase triplets). Jagdhuber et al. (2015) coupled full polarimetric L-band
    E-SAR data with an iterative generalized hybrid decomposition method to retrieve
    SM for vegetated land surfaces and obtained RMSEs ranging from 0.04 to 0.044 cm3/cm3
    for different vegetation covers and soil types. The retrieved RZSM from microwave
    airborne instruments can provide validation of RZSM retrievals from assimilation
    of near-surface SM into hydrological models, which is discussed in section 43.
    6.3.3 The Polarimetric L-Band Multibeam Radiometer The Polarimetric L-band Multibeam
    Radiometer (PLMR) is a passive microwave remote sensor onboard a small aircraft
    owned by the Australian Research Council and several Australien universities.
    It provides brightness temperature data at six different incidence angles (±7°,
    ±21.5°, and ±38.5°) to estimate high-resolution SM, salinity, and temperature
    at low to moderate vegetation conditions. The radiometer includes a thermal imager
    (FLIR ThermaCam S60, 7.5–13μ) and a dual polarization L-band (1.4 GHz) radiometer
    with 1- and 50-m resolutions, respectively, at a flight elevation of 150 m above
    ground. The instrument''s accuracy is 0.7 for H- and 2°K for V-polarizations,
    which translates to a SM accuracy better than 0.01 cm3/cm3. It was used to assess
    the performance of the core algorithm (L-MEB) used for SMOS SM retrieval (Peischl
    et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2015). For example, Panciera et al. (2009) used PLMR
    brightness temperature data from National Airborne Field Experiment conducted
    in southeastern Australia in 2005 to evaluate the L-MEB algorithm for SM retrieval
    and showed good accuracy with errors less than 0.048 cm3/cm3 for crops and grasslands.
    It was also used in different studies for detection of land surface SM changes
    (Ma et al., 2017; Summerell et al., 2009). The PLMR was also used in SMAP experiments
    in Australia for an algorithm development test-bed for the SMAP mission (Panciera
    et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014, 2015). 6.3.4 The Passive Active L-Band Sensor The
    Passive Active L-band Sensor (PALS) onboard NASA''s P-3, NCAR C-130, and Twin
    Otter International''s aircrafts is a combined dual polarization radiometer and
    radar operating at 1.41 and 1.26 GHz, respectively. The antenna is a high beam
    efficiency conical horn with relatively low side lobes pointed at a 38° incidence
    angle and the spatial resolution 600-m at 1,200-m altitude. It was designed and
    built as the prototype for the Aquarius and SMAP missions to assess the benefits
    of combining active and passive microwave sensors for SM and ocean salinity RS
    (Colliander et al., 2017; Wilson et al., 2001). PALS has been used in varying
    configurations for four major field experiments between 1999 and 2007 (Colliander
    et al., 2012). PALS observations have been used to improve the calibration and
    validation of SMAP SM algorithms (Colliander et al., 2012). For example, McNarin
    et al. (2015) used PALS in a 6-week Canada-U.S. field campaign in 2012 (SMAPVEX12)
    to simulate SMAP data. They showed that PALS radar backscatter and radiometer
    brightness temperature data were able to closely follow dry down and wetting events
    during SMAPVEX12. Akbar and Moghaddam (2015) used PALS data in Iowa in 2002 (SMEX02)
    and introduced a combined active-passive approach based on numerical modeling
    and parameter optimization in support of SMAP SM retrieval and showed retrieval
    errors of 0.035 cm3/cm3 for corn (VWC equal to 5 kg/m2). Colliander et al. (2015)
    used PALS data acquired during the SMAP validation experiment in 2012 to evaluate
    SMOS satellite brightness temperature observations and found differences less
    than 5 and 6°K for V and H polarizations, respectively. They concluded that PALS
    estimates are of significant value for the development of SMAP SM retrieval algorithms.
    Examples for other widely applied microwave airborne systems for SM retrieval
    include the L-band Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer (Gao et al.,
    2004; Guha et al., 2003), the C/X-band Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (Bindlish
    et al., 2006; Das & Mohanty, 2008), and the L-band radiometer 2D-DTAR (Rye et
    al., 2010). 7 Root-Zone SM Estimation As discussed above, most of the commonly
    applied RS methods provide only skin and near-surface SM estimates. The increased
    interest in estimating RZSM based on RS observations has led to close cross-disciplinary
    collaborations between the RS community and soil physicists and hydrologists with
    the central goal of linking RZSM to remotely sensed skin and near-surface data.
    Correlations of surface and RZSM at different depths are influenced by many factors
    such as soil type, land use, and prevailing hydroclimatological conditions (Mahmood
    & Hubbard, 2007). Nonetheless, several approaches, reviewed by Kostov and Jackson
    (1993), indicated that accurate estimation of RZSM based on near-surface SM is
    possible. Kostov and Jackson (1993) categorized these approaches into four main
    classes: (1) empirical regression-based models, (2) knowledge-based approaches,
    (3) microwave brightness temperature inversion techniques, and (4) combinations
    of remotely sensed data with soil water flow models. They concluded that “Proper
    integration of remote sensing and modeling is probably the best approach to the
    problem of profile SM estimation”. Soil water flow models commonly applied to
    this approach are classified as analytical and numerical models as discussed below.
    7.1 Analytical Modeling One approach to link RZSM to surface/near-surface SM is
    the derivation of a simple analytical equation from an approximate mass balance
    equation (Albergel et al., 2008; Ceballos et al., 2005; Wagner, Lemoine, & Rott,
    1999). An excellent contribution to this class of models is the pioneering work
    of Wagner, Lemoine, and Rott (1999), who introduced a simple one-parameter model
    by solving the following approximate mass balance equation: (14) where θ is the
    volumetric SM content averaged from z = 0 to z = L (z denotes soil depth), θ sur
    is the SM content at the surface (z = 0), t is the time, and C is a pseudo diffusivity
    coefficient that depends on the soil properties. Solving equation (14), Wagner
    et al. (1999a) obtained the following simple equation to estimate deeper layer
    (profile) SM, θ(t), from a time series of remotely retrieved surface/near-surface
    SM, θ sur (t i ), data (15) where T = C/L is a “characteristic time length” or
    recession constant, considered to be a calibration parameter to be determined
    by fitting model estimations to ground observations. Although the solution of
    Wagner, Lemoine, and Rott (1999) relies on some simplifying assumptions (i.e.,
    neglect of transpiration and invariant soil diffusivity), it is useful as a general
    concept for estimating the profile SM, accounting for the decreasing influence
    of measurements with increasing time lag. Equation (15) has been tested with both
    simulated and measured data and yielded good results (Tobin et al., 2017). The
    model has also been extensively used to improve the description of the RZSM for
    rainfall-runoff applications (Brocca, Melone, Moramarco, Wagner, et al., 2010;
    Brocca, Tullo, et al., 2012; Manfreda et al., 2011; Matgen et al., 2012). Another
    analytical approach for retrieving RZSM is the physically based model of Sadeghi
    et al. (2017), which builds on the second-order polynomial model of Tabatabaeenejad
    et al. (2015). Sadeghi, Tabatabaeenejad, et al. (2017) mathematically solved Richards''
    equation (RE; see equation (17) and section 43) for unsaturated flow in soil and
    introduced a more realistic model for retrieving profile SM from AirMOSS P-band
    radar data. The general form of their equation, neglecting initial and boundary
    conditions, is (16) where c1, c2, and c3 denote the unknown coefficients that
    need to be retrieved, P and h cM are soil-dependent parameters related to water
    retention function parameters (van Genuchten, 1980). The values of these two parameters
    are available for the 12 soil textural classes of the USDA classification scheme
    (Carsel & Parrish, 1988; Sadeghi, Tabatabaeenejad, et al., 2017). The AirMOSS
    retrieved SM profiles, using equation (16), revealed better performance than the
    original AirMOSS polynomial algorithm by improving the inversion accuracy and
    providing more accurate SM profiles (Figure 24). Figure 24 Open in figure viewer

    the mean absolute error (cm3/cm3). 7.2 Numerical Modeling and Data Assimilation
    For several years, SM has been estimated with “open loop” strategies, where hydrological
    land surface models are simply coupled with precipitation and other meteorological
    data. For example, SM has been provided as volumetric or soil wetness by the National
    Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research
    (NCEP-NCAR; Kalnay et al., 1996), the ECMWF (Simmons & Gibson, 2000), the Japanese
    25-year Reanalysis (JRA-25) project, the Global Land Data Assimilation System
    (GLDAS; Rodell et al., 2004; https://rda.ucar.edu/), the Global Energy and Water
    Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP-2; Dirmeyer et al.,
    2006), and the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS; Luo, 2003).
    Another strategy to provide high-accuracy RZSM is the combination of surface SM
    measurements with a numerical model. Numerical modeling to estimate RZSM from
    near-surface SM estimates is commonly accompanied by sequential data assimilation,
    that is, the combination of observations with previous simulations for estimations
    used for the next model forecast (Entekhabi et al., 1994; Crow & Wood, 2003; Das
    & Mohanty, 2006; Han et al., 2013; Montzka et al., 2011; Song, Shi, et al., 2014).
    Reichle et al. (2004) were among the first to show that the assimilation of SM
    observations can globally improve model-based RZSM predictions (Reichle et al.,
    2007; Reichle & Koster, 2005). In geosciences, and especially for estimation of
    RZSM, sequential data assimilation often forms an inverse problem. Here, near-surface
    SM (indirect measurements) can be used to update RZSM simulations (previous forecast)
    to initialize a corrected state for the next prediction (Hoeben & Troch, 2000).
    With this approach, a dynamically consistent motion picture of the hydrological
    system can be generated with known error bars (Ghil & Malanotterizzoli, 1991).
    In this case, accurate precipitation observations serve as the driving force for
    the hydrological model and have similar significance and largely independent information
    to contribute to the RZSM algorithm as compared to assimilated near-surface SM
    measurements (Reichle et al., 2014). The benefit of near-surface SM data assimilation
    to infer RZSM is the connection to water and energy cycles, for example, evapotranspiration
    and infiltration estimation (De Lannoy & Reichle, 2016; Lievens et al., 2015).
    Various assimilation techniques such as the Ensemble Kalman Filter (Evensen, 1997),
    the Particle Filter (Gordon et al., 1993; Moradkhani et al., 2005), or variational
    methods (Lorenc, 2003) including their modifications have been applied to RZSM
    estimation (Montzka et al., 2012). Sabater et al. (2007) compared different assimilation
    methods for RZSM retrieval. In addition to the assimilation method, subsurface
    physical models also play an important role in the improvement of RZSM estimates.
    Kumar et al. (2009) found this to be a function of surface-root-zone coupling
    strength, where the catchment land surface model outperforms the Mosaic, Noah
    and Community Land Model (CLM) models by describing the deviations from the equilibrium
    SM profile. The coupling to very deep soils is weaker but still possible using
    longer assimilation periods with more observations (Walker & Houser, 2001). During
    extreme hot conditions, the long-term correlations between near-surface and RZSM
    conditions degrade (Hirschi et al., 2014), and inversion may become misleading.
    A decoupling occurs during such extended drying periods as a result of a divergence
    between the drying rates at the soil surface and at deeper locations within the
    soil profile (Walker et al., 2002). However, Sabater et al. (2007) tested various
    data assimilation techniques derived from Kalman filter and variational methods
    and generated satisfactory RZSM results by assimilation of near-surface SM measurements
    into a model. Reichle et al. (2004) were among the first to show the discrepancy
    between absolute SM values between the datasets (satellite, model, and in situ)
    and point out the importance of bias correction and rescaling data before SM retrievals
    can be assimilated into land surface models. Yilmaz and Crow (2013) evaluated
    the optimality of three bias correction approaches including CDF matching, least
    squares regression, and TC to remove systematic differences between modeled and
    observed values and concluded that TC is the optimal approach. However, TC rescaling
    only helps for multiplicative biases, whereas CDF matching and least squares regression
    deal with both additive and multiplicative biases. There are various examples
    of near-surface SM assimilation for improved RZSM estimation (e.g., Carrera et
    al., 2015; Draper et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2014; Lievens et al., 2017; Pan
    et al., 2012). Dumedah et al. (2015) used the advanced Evolutionary Data Assimilation
    procedure to assimilate downscaled (1 km) SMOS surface SM data into the Joint
    UK Land Environment Simulator to better estimate the RZSM for the western plains
    of New South Wales in Australia. Assimilation yielded a clear improvement of RZSM
    retrieval by 34% for the 0- to 30-cm soil depth, 59% for the 30- to 60-cm soil
    depth, and 63% for the 60- to 90-cm soil depth based on RMSE. Draper et al. (2012)
    used an ensemble Kalman filter to separately and jointly assimilate ASCAT and
    AMSR-E into the NASA Catchment land surface model and recommended that joint assimilation
    of active and passive microwave observations provide maximum accuracy for RZSM
    estimation. Kolassa et al. (2017) combined active and passive microwave data from
    ASCAT and AMSR-E in a SM assimilation system and obtained highly accurate SM products.
    Lievens et al. (2017) demonstrated that joint assimilation of high-resolution
    Sentinel-1 and SMAP observations can improve the spatiotemporal accuracy of surface
    and root-zone SM estimates. Koster et al. (2018) indicated that integration of
    SMAP L2 surface SM data into the Catchment land surface model (the same as SMAP
    L4 model) along with model calibration can improve simulated SM and streamflow
    estimates. This has important ramifications for maximizing the effective employment
    of SMAP data in hydrological simulations. Hain et al. (2012) used dual assimilation
    of thermal infrared and passive microwave satellite observations of SM into the
    Noah land surface model and reported improvements for surface and RZSM. In addition
    to RZSM, satellite-derived SM data have been used for initialization of numerical
    weather prediction models. In a study by Drusch (2007), the TRMM Microwave Imager
    (TMI) SM product with 40-km resolution was used in three data assimilation experiments
    with the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) of the ECMWF over the southern United
    States to infer RZSM and improve weather parameters and forecast quality. Satellite
    SM products have been used to correct precipitation estimates with a water balance
    model via matching of observed and simulated SM. Pellarin et al. (2008) demonstrated
    that the use of AMSR-E SM measurements can be useful to suppress a significant
    number of wrongly detected rain events. Often, the model hydraulic parameterization
    leads to inadequate SM profile predictions. However, surface SM assimilation for
    improved RZSM simulation can help to constrain the parameter space (Han et al.,
    2013; Lee et al., 2014; Montzka et al., 2011). The process of combining observations
    and model forecasts during data assimilation is typically carried out by weighting
    each on the basis of their respective errors (Kumar et al., 2012). Therefore,
    one important issue during near-surface SM data assimilation is the correct estimation
    of the observation error characteristics (Reichle et al., 2008). Typically, most
    data assimilation approaches assume random, zero-mean observation errors, but
    in reality biases are unavoidable and it is difficult to attribute the bias to
    the model or the observations. Assimilating biased observations would lead to
    biased model states (including RZSM) and model parameters. Therefore, several
    bias removal techniques have been developed (Kumar et al., 2012). These techniques
    correct for both additive and multiplicative biases. In contrast to dynamically
    bias-aware data assimilation systems (Chen et al., 2014; De Lannoy et al., 2007;
    Montzka et al., 2013; Ryu et al., 2009), typically a priori bias mitigation is
    performed. Kumar et al. (2012) compared the attribution of the bias to the model
    and a priori calibration of respective model parameters with the attribution to
    the observations and a priori SM climatology matching. They found similar assimilation
    skills for near surface and RZSM, where the spatial variability of skill scores
    is reduced by a priori parameter optimization. A priori bias mitigation strategies
    include cumulative distribution function matching (Reichle & Koster, 2004) and
    least squares regression rescaling (Crow & Zhan, 2007), or TC (Stoffelen, 1998).
    Applications of near-surface SM assimilation are discussed in Lievens et al. (2015),
    Parrens et al. (2014), Rains et al. (2017), and Xu et al. (2015). 7.2.1 Soil Water
    Flow Governing Equation Estimating RZSM from surface/near-surface SM is commonly
    accomplished through a land surface or hydrological model. Land surface models
    applied to the RZSM simulations commonly consider a limited number of soil layers
    along the soil profile and calculate SM for each layer using a water balance equation
    (Crow & Wood, 2003; Sabater et al., 2007). More sophisticated hydrological models
    solve the SM profile on a much finer grid where water flow is modeled based on
    Richards'' (1931) equation (Das & Mohanty, 2006; Entekhabi et al., 1994; Han et
    al., 2012; Heathman et al., 2003; Montzka et al., 2011). RE combines the Buckingham-Darcy
    equation (Buckingham, 1907), q = –K(∇h – 1), and the continuity principle (conservation
    of mass), ∂θ/∂t = –∇q. Modified to account for root water uptake, the one-dimensional
    (1-D) form of RE is written as (17) where q is the water flux density [LT-1],
    K is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity [LT-1], h is the pressure head [L],
    θ is the volumetric SM content [L3L−3], t is time [T], z is soil depth [L] assumed
    positive downward from the soil surface, and S is the sink term [L3L−3T−1] (i.e.,
    root water uptake). 7.2.2 Soil Hydraulic Functions In an unsaturated soil, h and
    K are functions of θ which are referred to as SHPs or “soil hydraulic functions”
    (SHFs) and assumed to be invariant for a given soil. Provided that K(θ) and h(θ)
    for any given soil component are known, solving RE subject to specific initial
    and boundary conditions would result in an estimate of the SM profile, θ(z), at
    any time of interest, t. Various mathematical relationships exist for SHFs, h(θ)
    and K(θ). The most widely used unimodal SHFs are relationships introduced by Gardner
    (1958), Brooks and Corey (1964), van Genuchten (1980), Russo (1988), and Kosugi
    (1994, 1996) (Sadeghi et al., 2016; Tuller & Or, 2005). The retention curves (see
    section 2) are empirical relationships, and the conductivity models are derived
    from substitution of the retention curve into a bundle of cylindrical capillaries
    (BCC) model. These empirical SHFs are commonly parametrized via nonlinear regression
    analysis of measured h-θ and K-θ data for a soil of interest. Several studies
    conducted within the past few decades have provided evidence that in addition
    to capillary forces, adsorptive surface forces significantly impact the matric
    potential, especially in fine-textured soils with high specific surface areas
    (Lebeau & Konrad, 2010; Peters & Durner, 2008; Tuller et al., 1999; Tuller & Or,
    2005). Direct measurements of SHPs mostly rely on inversion of Darcy''s law for
    steady state conditions or an approximate analytical or numerical solution of
    RE for transient conditions. Therefore, these methods are limited to the so-called
    “Darcy scale,” where the RE originates, such as the sample scale (Kool et al.,
    1985; Peters & Durner, 2008) or column scale (Sadeghi et al., 2014; Shao & Horton,
    1998) in laboratory analyses and at the point scale (Simunek & van Genuchten,
    1996) and block/plot scale (Hillel et al., 1972) in field experiments. Hence,
    these methods are not optimal for large-scale modeling of soil water flow, for
    example, at the satellite footprint scale. To tackle this problem, effective SHPs
    at the footprint scale have been recently investigated using RS techniques (Babaeian
    et al., 2016). Most of the existing methods for RS-based estimation of SHPs rely
    on inverse modeling of RE or its extended forms in which footprint scale effective
    SHPs are solved such that model simulations best fit remotely sensed data. Camillo
    et al. (1986) were among the first to estimate soil hydraulic parameters (Brooks-Corey
    parameters) by inversion of an extended form of RE accounting for nonisothermal
    soil water flow and heat transfer to fit microwave-based surface SM and soil temperature.
    They conducted a plot-scale experiment, where passive microwave data were acquired
    with a dual-polarized L-band radiometer mounted on a boom truck. Later, Ines and
    Mohanty (2008, 2008, 2009) developed Genetic-Algorithm-based inverse modeling
    and data assimilation methods for estimating footprint-scale effective values
    of the van Genuchten (1980) soil hydraulic parameters, incorporating time series
    data of airborne and satellite (e.g., AMSR-E) RS-based near-surface SM data. In
    a synthetic study, Montzka et al. (2011) explored the potential of using near-surface
    SM retrieved from different satellites to estimate SHPs (van Genuchten parameters)
    and SM profiles using the 1-D RE and a particle filtering data assimilation method.
    The inverse modeling approaches for estimation of SHPs using RS data have been
    thoroughly reviewed by Mohanty (2013). Besides inverse modeling approaches, there
    exist a few studies on the potential of direct estimation of SHPs using RS data.
    Hollenbec et al. (1996) indicated that soil hydraulic heterogeneity could be identified
    by detection of relative changes in passive microwave RS observations. They concluded
    that the variogram of relative change indicates existence of an effective correlation
    length much larger than that commonly observed in ground-based soil surveys, and
    their findings encourage the use of passive microwave RS for assessing soil hydraulic
    characteristics that are valid at a scale appropriate for hydrometeorological
    models. Mattikalli et al. (1998) observed that temporal changes of airborne passive
    microwave (L-band) brightness temperature (a function of SM) held statistically
    significant negative lognormal relationships with saturated hydraulic conductivity
    (K s ). They showed that regression-based models could accurately relate the brightness
    temperature variations to K s across large regions. Limited literature exists
    on predicting SHPs based on hyperspectral optical imaging (Babaeian et al., 2015a).
    Such methods are mainly based on regression models between SHPs or parameters
    as target variables and various features of soil absorbance and reflectance spectra
    as explanatory variables. These regression-based predictive models were termed
    “spectrotransfer functions” or “spectral transfer functions”, STFs, and spectral
    pedotransfer functions (analogous to “PTFs”; Babaeian, Homaee, Vereecken, et al.,
    2015; Santra et al., 2009). Studies of Santra et al. (2009), Babaeian, Homaee,
    Montzka, et al. (2015), and Babaeian, Homaee, Vereecken, et al. (2015)) are among
    a few in this category, relating soil reflectance at various optical wavelengths
    (400–2,500 nm) to K s and van Genuchten hydraulic parameters. Although the STFs
    were developed using laboratory spectroscopy (i.e., a spectroradiometer), they
    are potentially promising for airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral remote sensors
    for SHPs estimation (see section 19). Recently, Babaeian et al. (2016) used coarse-scale
    STFs and Spectral Pedotransfer Functions (SPTFs) to provide coarse-scale estimates
    of the van Genuchten-Mualem hydraulic parameters. They evaluated the effective
    values of the hydraulic parameters and showed that the coarse-scale spectral transfer
    functions coupled with vadose zone flow modeling can be applied to predict profile
    SM dynamics at larger scales. 7.2.3 Scale Mismatch Since the RE has been originally
    developed for the Darcy scale, which ranges from the representative elementary
    volume (REV) to the sample or column scale, application of RE to the RS footprint
    scale, i.e., from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers, may lead to physically
    unrealistic results. When solving RE in order to simulate θ(z,t), h should be
    translated as θ. As mentioned above, this is accomplished through the application
    of the soil water retention curve, which is valid for hydrostatic conditions (i.e.,
    no flow). This means that a “local equilibrium” between water content and water
    potential is assumed when solving RE (Vogel & Ippisch, 2008). The equilibrium
    (stationary) condition is not always guaranteed, for example, when solving the
    RE numerically in a coarsely discretized domain. Therefore, allocation of more
    computational resources to solve the RE for finer spatial grids is often required
    not only to avoid numerical errors but also to satisfy the local equilibrium assumption
    (Roth, 2008). Failure to satisfy this essential requirement is not only due to
    the numerical discretization issue but also may occur at the scale of the REV.
    Roth (2008) argued that “violation of the stationary assumption at the scale of
    the REV leads to a fundamental failure of the Richards'' equation that cannot
    be amended.” This condition is observed, for example, with infiltration instabilities
    that lead to localized flow processes. Several studies addressed the much debated
    question: “Do the underlying physics in the RE formulation apply at large scales
    of practical interest?” (Or et al., 2015). Several authors (Or et al., 2015; Roth,
    2008; Vogel & Ippisch, 2008) argued that, due to the underlying assumption of
    local equilibrium, there exists an upper limit of spatial discretization (δ) above
    which the solution is expected to be biased. By equating diffusive and convective
    water flows, Vogel and Ippisch (2008) analytically derived an upper limit for
    δ. Their solution showed δ ranges from a few centimeters to a few meters depending
    on the SHPs (smaller δ for coarser soils) and the total water potential gradient
    (smaller δ for larger gradients). For large-scale hydrologic applications, Or
    et al. (2015) also indicated that the spatial extent of lateral flow interactions
    under most natural capillary gradients rarely exceed a few meters. Despite this
    fact, the RE has been widely applied at the footprint scale as discussed above.
    For such applications the spatial discretization of the numerical solution of
    the RE is limited to the remote sensor''s spatial resolution (e.g., from 10 m
    for optical Sentinel-2 to about 40 km for microwave SMOS and SMAP). This scale
    mismatch should be considered as an unavoidable source of error in numerical models
    linking surface SM and RZSM (Entekhabi et al., 1994; Han et al., 2012; Heathman
    et al., 2003). Due to inherent spatial variability of soil properties, application
    of the RE at large scales is accompanied with upscaling SHPs from point to footprint
    scale. Two general approaches for upscaling SHPs are commonly applied: (1) forward
    upscaling and (2) inverse upscaling (i.e., inverse modeling; Vereecken et al.,
    2007). Forward upscaling methods directly calculate large-scale properties from
    small-scale properties. Various theories exist for forward upscaling of SHPs such
    as simple averaging (Zhu & Mohanty, 2006), percolation theory (Hunt & Idriss,
    2009; Samouelian et al., 2007), homogenization theory (Neuweiler & Cirpka, 2005;
    Neuweiler & Vogel, 2007), hybrid mixture theory (Hassanizadeh & Gray, 1979), similar/dissimilar
    media scaling theory (Miller & Miller, 1956; Sadeghi et al., 2012; Warrick et
    al., 1977), stochastic methods (Yeh et al., 1985; Zhang & Lu, 2002), and renormalization
    methods (King & Neuweiler, 2002; Saucier, 1992). Forward upscaling requires detailed
    information of SHPs at small scales, and hence, is not appropriate for RS applications.
    As discussed above, a common approach to incorporate RS data for effective SHP
    estimation is inverse modeling, where SHFs are parametrized to match the RE solution
    with RS-based observations at large scales. This strategy may alleviate the scale
    mismatch issue discussed above, as it basically calibrates RE so that it fits
    large scale observations. However, calibration of RE in hydrological models with
    insufficiently fine discretization will likely result in parameter values that
    are physically unrealistic (Downer & Ogden, 2004). Here the effective parameters
    also appear to be dependent on the type of boundary condition (Vereecken et al.,
    2007). In other words, the parameters may not work under boundary conditions different
    from those applied during calibration. 8 Spatial and Temporal Variability of SM
    The high variability of SM in space and time is well documented (Crow et al.,
    2012; Famiglietti et al., 2008; Vereecken et al., 2014) and to a certain extent
    the cause for the large variability of SM estimates obtained with the various
    sensing methods discussed above. The surface soil layer generally exhibits the
    largest SM variability, due to the interaction of environmental (soil properties,
    topography, and vegetation), meteorological (precipitation and temperature), and
    human factors, which decrease with soil depth. The magnitude of the variabilities
    depends on the extent of scale (see section 3) as it first increases with increasing
    extent and then when reaching a threshold remains constant (Brocca, Tullo, et
    al., 2012). The relationship between mean SM and the standard deviation of SM
    has been considered as an important aspect when analyzing the spatial variability
    of SM (Brocca, Melone, Moramarco, & Morbidelli 2010; Famiglietti et al., 2008).
    Figure 25 depicts an example of this relationship for surface SM (0–5 cm) from
    SMAP L4 data (April 2015 to May 2017) from the Tonzi Ranch site in California
    for an area about 2,000 km2. In particular, a convex upward relationship can be
    identified between mean and standard deviation of surface SM (Brocca, Melone,
    Moramarco, & Morbidelli, 2010; Western et al., 2004) when the data set covers
    the whole range from dry to wet conditions. Crow et al. (2012) reviewed different
    techniques for spatial upscaling of SM and discussed the upscaling problem and
    measurement density requirements for ground SM networks. While this relationship
    describes spatial SM variability, it does not provide information about temporal
    variability. Thus, the question is how can both spatial and temporal variabilities
    be quantified and made comparable between different data sets? Figure 25 Open

    standard deviation for SMAP L4 data for the 2,000-km2 Tonzi Ranch site in California.
    The red line represents a fitted third-order polynomial function. SMAP = Soil
    Moisture Active Passive. In contrast to methods only describing variability in
    the spatial domain, for example, geostatistics (Haining et al., 2010), or only
    in the temporal domain, for example, time series analysis (Fu, 2011; Sprott, 2003),
    there exist several methods that simultaneously analyze both space and time domains.
    Especially for SM, the combined analysis of spatial and temporal patterns of observations
    is important to understand their origin. Several methods have been proposed for
    analysis of the spatiotemporal SM variability, including Temporal Stability Analysis
    (TSA; Martinez-Fernandez & Ceballos, 2005), TC (Crow et al., 2015; Gruber et al.,
    2017), and Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs; Yoo & Kim, 2004). In this section
    we discuss EOF and TSA as new methods available for understanding spatiotemporal
    variability of SM. 8.1 EOFs EOF analysis, which is also known as principal component
    analysis (PCA), decomposes the observed variability of a data set into a set of
    orthogonal spatial patterns and a set of multivariate time series called expansion
    coefficients (Korres et al., 2010). With this separation, EOFs can be used to
    identify the dominant processes and essential parameters controlling spatiotemporal
    SM patterns (Korres et al., 2010). A temporal sequence of spatial variables is
    expressed as a result of the superposition of two or more temporally stable spatial
    structures. The spatial distribution of the variable at a specific point in time
    is then defined as a weighted average of those patterns, where the weights vary
    with time. The first EOF loadings (also called the eigenvectors) typically contain
    the dominant fractions of the spatiotemporal variability, whereas the last EOF
    loadings contain the residual variance classified as observation uncertainty or
    more generally as noise. Therefore, the approach can be used to efficiently extract
    information from observed data and to describe hydrological behavior in heterogeneous
    systems in a quantitative way (Hohenbrink & Lischeid, 2015). For more details
    see Hannachi et al. (2007). Typical applications for SM datasets mainly include
    an analysis of the origins of spatiotemporal patterns. Korres et al. (2010) related
    patterns of field-scale SM measurements to soil properties and topography. They
    applied EOF analysis and indicated that soil properties and topography control
    the spatiotemporal patterns of SM. Perry and Niemann (2008) analyzed the TARRAWARRA
    data set (Western & Grayson, 1998) and found a primary pattern association with
    soil water lateral redistribution. The second factor that was found to impact
    SM distribution patterns was solar radiation, which differentially insolated the
    surface due to topography. Moreover, they decomposed the data set into EOFs, interpolated
    the EOFs using a standard interpolation method, and used the interpolated EOFs
    to reconstruct the fine-scale SM patterns in time. This method outperformed the
    standard interpolation methods. Kim and Barros (2002) and Jawson and Niemann (2007)
    explained the relationship between the spatial structure of estimated SM and that
    of ancillary data including topography, soil texture, and vegetation cover with
    an EOF analysis. Joshi and Mohanty (2010) quantified the contribution of soil
    texture to SM variability from the watershed to regional scales, as microwave
    remotely sensed SM is retrieved with dielectric mixing models such as that from
    Wang and Schmugge (1980) that, in part, is based on the dominant soil texture
    within the measurement footprint. In addition to topography and soil properties,
    Qiu et al. (2014) also analyzed the role of precipitation on SM variability at
    different spatial scales. They were able to quantify the influence of rainfall
    variability on SM being small at watershed scales and larger at regional and national
    scales (e.g., China). This is because large-scale SM distribution is more closely
    related to atmospheric forcing processes. Nied et al. (2013) reduced the dimensionality
    of their SM data set to identify the main driving patterns of flood initiation.
    The EOF analysis of Fang et al. (2015) of simulated and observed SM revealed that
    introduction of heterogeneity in soil porosity effectively improved estimates
    of SM patterns. In the same region, Koch et al. (2016) and Graf et al. (2014)
    conducted an EOF analysis on SM data and clustered the resulting loadings to separate
    wet and dry periods. This classification was further used to assess the seasonality
    of the SM patterns. Fan and Dool (2004) showed the dominance of El Niño–Southern
    Oscillation in the first EOF of global long-term SM simulations. Bauer-Marschallinger
    et al. (2013) performed a similar study for Australia. Schubert et al. (2004)
    found the causes of long-term drought in the U.S. Great Plains in the El Niño–Southern
    Oscillation and pan-Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies. Wang et al. (2015)
    found correlations of the Palmer Drought Severity Index in China with the Northern
    Hemisphere polar vortex, the Arctic Oscillation, and the North Atlantic Oscillation.
    Tatli and Turkes (2011) analyzed different drought indices with and without SM
    information in an EOF analysis to identify the most suitable index for drought
    characterization in Turkey. EOFs are also used in downscaling approaches; for
    example, Busch et al. (2012) developed a topography-related downscaling algorithm,
    where the associated expansion coefficients are estimated on the basis of the
    spatial average SM. 8.2 TSA of Spatial Structures In contrast to EOFs, TSA assumes
    that there exists a single spatial pattern that manifests itself at all times
    as spatial distributions of soil vegetation atmosphere transfer variables. TSA
    is considered to be a valuable tool for identifying a small number of representative
    sampling points to estimate the grid mean SM. It temporally averages the relative
    differences of the observations at a specific location to the spatial mean of
    all observations at a specific point in time (Vachaud et al., 1985). Each observation
    point is then ranked from dry to wet locations, which describes the spatial pattern.
    Currently, the use of the mean relative difference is the most common way to characterize
    the temporal stability (Vanderlinden et al., 2012). TSA of SM has been reported
    for various spatial scales (Brocca, Melone, Moramarco, & Morbidelli, 2010; Mohanty
    & Skaggs, 2001) from subfield (Abdu et al., 2017; Pachepsky et al., 2005) to regional
    (Brocca, Tullo, et al., 2012, Cho & Choi, 2014; Martínez-Fernández & Ceballos,
    2003) to global scales (Rötzer et al., 2015). The applications of TSA are versatile,
    because the description of relative spatial SM patterns can be used for multiple
    purposes. For example, the site rankings can also be used to reduce the number
    of observation points in an area of interest by keeping the majority of the information
    about the spatiotemporal variability. So-called “catchment average SM monitoring”
    sites were proposed for such locations at the watershed scale, which are able
    to represent the spatial mean SM (Western et al., 1998). Applications of the monitoring
    site reduction or representative areal mean estimation can be found in Martinez
    et al. (2008), Schneider et al. (2008), Thierfelder et al. (2003), Zhao et al.
    (2013), and Zucco et al. (2014). This concept has interesting applications for
    upscaling and downscaling approaches for satellite RS SM validation (Dumedah et
    al., 2013; Molero et al., 2018; Vanderlinden et al., 2012). Rötzer et al. (2014)
    used the TSA method to validate remotely sensed SM products from SMOS and ASCAT
    in a relative way, focusing on the spatial patterns of SM. Also, Bhatti et al.
    (2013) and Cosh et al. (2006) used TSA for satellite SM validation. Zhang et al.
    (2016) analyzed the SM regimes under different land covers using TSA. It was determined
    that vegetation is able to introduce patterns in the spatial distribution of SM
    (Wang et al., 2015). Lin (2006) reported that the high spatial variability of
    SM in a catchment is largely a result of soil type and landform controls rather
    than a random process. In other regions temporally stable SM patterns can be directly
    attributed to relatively high clay contents (Gao et al., 2011). Ran et al. (2017)
    examined the capability of TSA for irrigated agricultural landscapes and indicated
    that irrigation practices reduce the accuracy of the representative sampling error
    at the 1 and 5 km scales. They introduced a stratified TSA that mitigates systematic
    and random errors by combining previous information through stratification, which
    is important for validation of remotely sensed SM. Several SM TSA results focus
    on SHPs (Cosh et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2016). But in hilly areas the contribution
    of topography to spatial structures in SM increases (Brocca et al., 2009). The
    higher the mountains, the larger is the effect of snow distribution on SM patterns
    (Williams et al., 2009). At larger scales, meteorological factors increase their
    impact (Cho & Choi, 2014). In addition to SM, matric potential has also been studied
    with more direct insights on the detailed soil characteristics and controls of
    spatial variability and temporal stability (Yu et al., 2015). 8.3 TC Analysis
    TC analysis was initially developed for ocean wind studies (Stofflen, 1998), but
    it is also used in land surface hydrology (Chen et al., 2017; Yilmaz & Crow, 2014).
    TC relies on a linear error model to reduce the error from an approximated linear
    relationship between different measurements of a geophysical variable. The metrics
    that are typically used to assess the error of each data set are the variance
    of its errors and the correlation with the true SM (Chen et al., 2016; Gruber
    et al., 2016). TC has been applied in the context of calibration, validation,
    bias correction, and error characterization to allow comparisons of diverse data
    records from measurement and estimation techniques such as in situ SM and RS/modeled
    SM. In a study by Chen et al. (2017), TC analysis was used for real validation
    of the SMAP L2 SM product at five core validation sites in the United States and
    it was found that TC can solve the impact of random representativeness errors
    in the point-scale data against footprint-scale SM estimates and provide an unbiased
    estimation of the satellite versus ground correlation metric. TC and other error
    estimation methods only provide an estimation of the total observation error variance
    that is the summation of the autocorrelated and the white observation error. This
    can lead to inaccurate results in SM data analysis at time scales that are shorter
    than the autocorrelation length of the errors. Some advances have been made in
    TC analysis. Dong and Crow (2017) proposed a more generalized TC algorithm, which
    decomposes total errors provided by TC into its autocorrelated and white error
    components, helpful for the ESA CCI SM data set and additionally for hydrology
    and climatology studies that require decomposed error information. Recently, Molero
    et al. (2018) evaluated the spatiotemporal representativeness degree of in situ
    SM within the satellite footprint in Little Washita (U.S.) and Yanco (Australia)
    at timescales from 0.5 to 128 days. They proposed a new approach called Wavelet-based
    Correlation (WCor) and concluded that in contrast to the TC method, which performs
    well at the week and month scales, WCor provides consistent results at all time
    scales and is a robust method for sparse SM networks. An overview of implementations
    of SM TC analysis has been presented in Gruber et al. (2016). 9 Application of
    SM Information and Outlook There are numerous Earth and environmental sciences
    disciplines and applications benefitting from detailed SM information (Figure
    26). For example, knowledge of the SM status and its spatial and temporal variability
    is key for forecasting weather and climate, modeling hydrological processes, predicting
    and monitoring of extreme natural events (e.g., droughts, fires, and dust storms),
    managing water resources, agricultural plant production and productivity, and
    for sustaining ecosystem services (Vereecken et al., 2016). A brief discussion
    of SM information applications follows. Figure 26 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Importance of SM information for various disciplines and applications. 9.1 Weather
    Forecasting and Hydrological Modeling The SM status governs water and energy exchange
    processes between the land surface and the atmosphere. When soils are moist, the
    major portion of the net radiation is utilized for evapotranspiration (i.e., latent
    heat flux), which leads to uplift of water vapor and cloud formation when the
    air temperature falls below the dew point temperature. In dry soils, on the other
    hand, more energy is invested in sensitive heat exchange, which reduces the atmospheric
    vapor pressure and cloud cover. Knowledge of the spatial and temporal SM variability
    aids in constraining the lower boundary conditions in atmospheric simulations.
    SM information can be applied for accuracy improvement of rainfall estimations
    via a bottom-up approach (Koster et al., 2016Koster et al., 2018). Pellarin et
    al. (2008) was among the first to estimate precipitation occurrence from AMSR-E
    surface SM observations in West Africa. Brocca et al. (2014) assumed that if soil
    is considered as a natural rain gauge, then rainfall can be successfully estimated
    from SM observations (i.e., ground based or satellite based) with the SM2RAIN
    model that inverts the soil water balance equation. SM data have been extensively
    used for validation of numerical weather prediction models (Cui et al., 2009;
    Drusch, 2007). Specifically, the impact of SM on high temperature weather and
    heatwave events has been well documented (Fischer et al., 2007; Lau & Kim, 2012;
    Zeng et al., 2014). For instance, Fischer et al. (2007) indicated that during
    a heatwave, the SM is extremely low, which greatly increases the surface temperature
    and substantially reduces the latent heat flux. This confirms the key role of
    SM as a lower boundary in the partitioning of net radiation into latent and sensible
    heat fluxes and the evolution of the heatwave (Miralles et al., 2014). Incorrect
    estimation of SM leads to erroneous simulations of the surface layer evolution
    and hence precipitation and cloud cover forecasts could consequently be affected.
    Collow et al. (2014) examined the impact of SM on precipitation, temperature,
    and humidity and pointed out that accurate initialization of SM in numerical weather
    forecasting models could improve temperature, humidity, and precipitation forecasts
    for the U.S. Great Plains. As already discussed, SM is a key state variable and
    of crucial importance for hydrological modeling. Ground and satellite SM products
    have been connected to hydrological models for prediction of hydrological fluxes.
    However, the effective application of SM information for such modeling efforts
    is still in an infancy state. Vereecken et al. (2015) discussed the value of SM
    information from a global hydrological observatory network for identifying soil
    hydrological processes. Recently, Sadeghi et al. (2019) proposed an analytical
    model based on RE for estimation of the net water flux (precipitation minus evapotranspiration)
    from near-surface SM observations for different soil and vegetation conditions.
    Recent applications of SM data for hydrological modeling have focused on joint
    assimilation of remotely sensed SM products and streamflow data into distributed
    hydrologic models to provide more accurate estimations of SM (Lievens et al.,
    2016 & 2017; Verhoest et al., 2015). Yan and Moradkhani (2016) used a particle
    filter Markov chain Monte Carlo method to assimilate synthetic ASCAT SM retrievals
    and synthetic streamflow data into a fully distributed Sacramento SM Accounting
    model for the Salt River Watershed in Arizona. They revealed that solely assimilating
    outlet streamflow leads to biased SM estimates, whereas joint assimilation of
    streamflow and SM products provides better predictions of surface SM. Lievens
    et al. (2015) coupled SMOS L3 SM data in the Variable Infiltration Capacity land
    surface model using Ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation to improve modeled
    SM and streamflow prediction accuracies with high spatial resolution in Australia.
    They showed that assimilation with SMOS SM reduces modeled SM RMSE from 0.058
    to 0.046 cm3/cm3 and enhances correlation from 0.56 to 0.71, which demonstrates
    the merit of SMOS data assimilation for streamflow predictions at large scale.
    Crow et al. (2017) validated the claim of improvement of operational hydrologic
    forecasting through RS SM products and concluded that SMAP L4, which is the product
    of L-band microwave radiometry and a data assimilation technique, provides a SM
    product with the highest hydrologic forecasting skill observed to date for forecasting
    streamflow response to future rainfall events. More recently, Crow et al. (2018)
    used SMAP L4 surface and root-zone SM in combination with remotely sensed precipitation
    and streamflow observations and explored the relationship between prestorm SM
    and rainfall infiltration in the south central United States. They found that
    land surface models generally underestimate the correlation strength between prestorm
    SM and storm runoff. Mahanama et al. (2008) examined the contribution of SM to
    streamflow initialization during subseasonal and seasonal periods and pointed
    out that accurate SM data can contribute between 10% and 60% of the total streamflow
    prediction accuracy that can potentially be obtained for perfect predictions of
    meteorological forcing. Soil profile moisture measurements (10, 20, and 40 cm)
    along with rainfall data as inputs of a generalized regression neural network
    model significantly improved runoff prediction accuracy for the Tiber River in
    Italy (Tayfur et al., 2014). Data from WSMN or spatiotemporal information of SM
    are increasingly being used to validate hydrological models (Fang et al., 2015;
    Koch et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2015) and to improve our understanding of hydrological
    processes. Koch et al. (2016) compared the performances of the Hydro-Geosphere
    (HGS) model, the European Hydrological System Model (MIKE SHE), and the ParFlow-CLM
    model for prediction of SM status, discharge, and cumulative water balance components.
    All three models performed well-predicting discharge and the water balance components
    but diverged in their predictions of SM status. A comprehensive review of hydrological
    applications of radar SM retrievals is also provided by Kornelsen and Coulibaly
    (2013). 9.2 Agriculture and Crop Productivity Information about the SM status
    is crucial for agricultural applications to, for example, identify field trafficability
    for heavy farm machinery or to make informed irrigation management decisions.
    Global scale SM data assimilation can improve the representation of agricultural
    drought (Bolten & Crow et al., 2012). While various factors, such as temperature
    stress and nutrient availability, impact the growth and persistence of plants,
    much of the initial focus has been on those crop systems that are water controlled
    (Laio et al., 2001; Ridolfi et al., 2000; Rodriguez-Iturbe et al., 1999). The
    dynamics of SM has a significant impact on plant stress and the adaptability of
    various plant species to particular climate and soil conditions. Monitoring the
    amount of moisture retained in soil is critical for a healthy rhizosphere growth
    environment and aids with crop yield forecasts and irrigation planning. Early
    assessment of SM reserves and monitoring the change in plant available soil water,
    for example, with RS techniques, assist crop growers with risk reduction strategies.
    McNairn et al. (2012) argued that the Canadian RADARSAT-2 satellite can provide
    accurate estimates of field scale SM, which has been further advanced with the
    launch of the ESA Sentinel satellites as part of the Copernicus program. Continuous
    information of SM status can be used in crop growth models in combination with
    data assimilation approaches to provide growers with crop water demand estimates
    for precision irrigation management (Ines et al., 2013). Han et al. (2016) showed
    that the assimilation of continuous SM data from cosmic ray neutron observations
    into the CLM can be used for real-time irrigation scheduling for citrus trees.
    Recently, Andreasen et al. (2017) demonstrated the potential of using mobile cosmic
    ray neutron detection to support precision farming. Louvet et al. (2015) used
    SMOS L3 SM data in conjunction with the TRMM satellite-based precipitation product
    (TMPA) with 3-hr time resolution in West Africa and produced a NRT SM product
    with good accuracy (RMSE 0.030–0.044 cm3/cm3) for potential applications in agriculture
    and for drought detection. Escorihuela et al. (2018) showed that the use of SMOS
    SM in synergy with Sentinel-1 SM provides high spatial resolution SM maps with
    high accuracy (RMSE less than 0.040 cm3/cm3) applicable for the national and global
    desert early warning systems. 9.3 Natural Disasters SM is a key variable for operational
    flood forecasts (Komma et al., 2008; Silvestro & Rebora, 2014; Wanders et al.,
    2014), characterization of landslide occurrence (Baum et al., 2010; Krzeminska
    et al., 2012) and for monitoring drought conditions (Chakrabarti et al., 2014;
    Scaini et al., 2015). 9.3.1 Landslides and SM The ability to predict the spatial
    and temporal occurrence of rainfall-triggered shallow landslides is of crucial
    importance for prevention of human life and property losses. SM data are applied
    in conjunction with precipitation forcing as inputs for landslide models to obtain
    real-time assessment and forecasting of landslide occurrence (Posner & Georgakakos,
    2015; Ray & Jacobs, 2007). SM plays a critical role for slope stability, that
    is, as SM increases, slope stability decreases. Landslides commonly occur when
    SM is high. As soil saturation increases the pore water pressure increases and
    once the pressure exceeds the cohesive soil strengths, landslides are triggered.
    Coe et al. (2003) demonstrated that there is a positive correlation between SM
    content and landslide velocity, with velocities being highest during high SM conditions.
    Remotely sensed SM data have been used to forecast landslides. For example, Brocca,
    Ponziani, et al. (2012) used the SWI provided by the ASCAT satellite in conjunction
    with the antecedent precipitation index (API) to improve the accuracy of landslide
    forecasting models in central Italy. Ray et al. (2010) used AMSR-E SM products
    as input information for a dynamic physically based slope stability model to generate
    landslide susceptibility maps. SM observations have been also used in landslide
    prediction models. Recently, Segoni et al. (2018) demonstrated that SM threshold
    values can be defined to better predict landslides and improve the performance
    of regional scale landslide early warning systems in Italy. 9.3.2 Floods and SM
    Measurement and mapping of SM can potentially improve flood forecasting because
    initial SM conditions impact timing of flood initiation and peak runoff during
    storm events. The initial water content in conjunction with the infiltration capacity
    determines how much precipitation water can be added to the soil porous system
    before surface runoff (i.e., overland flow) and potential flooding occur. Silvestro
    and Rebora (2014) pointed out that the initial SM conditions substantially influence
    flood forecasting. They argued that the variability of flood forecasts is not
    constant and depends on the type and characteristics of the event and the initial
    SM conditions. Laiolo et al. (2016) used SM and LST to update the state variables
    of a physically based, distributed, and continuous hydrological model. They investigated
    the impact of SM and LST on the hydrological cycle and showed a general reduction
    of model discharge prediction errors by as much as 10%. Pauwels et al. (2001)
    assimilated European Remote Sensing Satellite ERS-1 and ERS-2 surface SM data
    into the TOPMODEL based Land-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme, which led to 20–50% reduction
    of discharge prediction errors for the Zwalm catchment in Belgium. Han et al.
    (2012) demonstrated the potential for improved streamflow predictions through
    assimilation of in situ near-surface SM with the Soil Water Assessment Tools model.
    The assimilation significantly reduced RMSE values for streamflow predictions.
    Recently, high spatial and moderate temporal resolution SM from the ESA Sentinel-1
    satellite has been assimilated into hydrological models for improving continuous
    streamflow simulations and enhancing flash flood predictions for civil protection
    applications in Italy (Cenci et al., 2017). Remotely sensed SM observations have
    improved NRT flood forecasts for large catchments. Tekeli and Fouli (2017) argued
    that incorporating antecedent SM information with a CDF based threshold value
    derived from AMSR-E products can significantly reduce false flood warnings in
    Saudi Arabia. Wanders et al. (2014) evaluated the added value of assimilated remotely
    sensed SM for the European Flood Awareness System and its potential to improve
    the timing and height prediction of the flood peak and low flows. They found that
    when remotely sensed SM data were used, the timing errors of the flood predictions
    significantly decreased, especially for shorter lead times. In addition, imminent
    floods can be forecasted more precisely. Such capabilities can improve the response
    time of government agencies to provide emergency and disaster relief. An excellent
    example is the major flood events throughout North and South Carolina on 5 October
    2015, where SM data from SMAP were able to clearly show areas of potential flooding
    and the extent of flooding prior to the event (see Figure 27). Figure 27 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Surface soil moisture in North and South Carolina
    retrieved from the Soil Moisture Active Passive level-4 product on 2 September
    2015 (before flooding, left) and on 5 October 2015 (after flooding, right). Large
    parts of North and South Carolina (red arrows) appear dark blue, representing
    the impact of heavy localized rains and flooding. Regions in darker blue indicate
    areas with saturated soil conditions and possibly standing water. Large-scale
    flooding was experienced all over South Carolina from 1 to 5 October 2015. 9.3.3
    Drought and SM Another increasingly important application of remotely sensed SM
    information is to monitor global drought conditions. There are four main drought
    categories that include meteorological, agricultural or agro-ecological, hydrological,
    and socioeconomic droughts (Dracup et al., 1980; Wilhite & Glantz, 1985). Meteorological
    drought is defined based on the number of days with precipitation below a specific
    threshold. Hydrological drought is commonly associated with effects of precipitation
    shortfalls on surface or subsurface water resources. The frequency and severity
    of hydrological drought are often defined for the watershed or basin scales. The
    definition of agricultural drought is based on soil water deficiency and its effect
    on crop production, that is, when evapotranspirative losses exceed the plant available
    SM content. Finally, socioeconomic drought occurs when the overall water demand
    exceeds supply. SM is a direct determinant of agricultural drought conditions
    that are commonly preceded by meteorological drought and succeeded by hydrological
    drought. Despite the obvious importance of SM, classical drought monitoring indices
    such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index neglect SM. Several in situ SM-based
    drought indicators have been recommended for agricultural drought monitoring,
    including the SM index (Sridhar et al., 2008), soil water deficit (Torres-Ruiz
    et al., 2013), and plant available water (PAW; McPherson et al., 2007). These
    indices identify drought conditions based on water deficit and plant available
    soil water. A major benefit of SM-based drought indices when compared to precipitation-based
    indices is that SM not only characterizes drought events but also responds to
    both precipitation and evapotranspiration processes. Detailed discussions about
    SM drought indices are provided in Ochsner et al. (2013) and Torres et al. (2013).
    More recently, several studies have attempted to improve potential applicability
    of SM indices for drought monitoring. For example, Cammalleri et al. (2016) proposed
    a novel Drought Severity Index for detecting main drought events and estimating
    both the extent and magnitude of drought. The index is based on a multiplicative
    combination of the observed soil water deficit intensity and on the rarity of
    the event compared with that of the site history (frequency of drought), in order
    to obtain a single measure of the severity of a specific soil water status in
    terms of drought. The DSI varies between 0 (no drought) and 1 (extreme drought),
    where the values between 0 and 1 can represent slight, moderate, and severe drought
    conditions. The applicability of the DSI has been evaluated for vegetated lands
    in Europe for the time period from 1995 to 2012, yielding better results for a
    broad range of conditions than commonly applied drought indices (Cammalleri et
    al., 2016). Sohrabi et al. (2015) proposed a new SM drought index (SODI) that
    considers temporal variations in precipitation, temperature, potential evapotranspiration,
    run-off and SM to determine onset, continuation, and cessation of droughts. The
    SODI is based on available water capacity and SM deviation from estimated field
    capacity (θ FC). This time-dependent drought index combines advantages of other
    drought indices by characterizing soil water retention processes and determining
    dry and wet conditions in subsequent time steps. The SODI yielded better results
    for quantifying severe droughts associated with climate variability than precipitation-based
    indices. The advantage of SODI is that the index is, in fact, a time-dependent
    and continuous index that characterizes SM dynamics during time transitions from
    the current time step to the next. Although SM is a key indicator for agricultural
    drought assessment, less attention has been paid to the application of in situ
    SM networks for systematic drought monitoring. This may be due to the fact that
    these networks commonly measure absolute values of SM and do not provide SM in
    terms of PAW. Within this context, the Oklahoma Mesonet (McPherson et al., 2007)
    is an exception, providing average daily PAW maps at three different soil depths
    (i.e., 10, 40 and 80 cm), which are publicly available from www.mesonet.org. It
    should be noted that the Mesonet does not directly measure SM; instead, a heat
    pulse measurement is used to infer soil matric potential, which is related to
    SM using water retention calibration data. Recently, Ford et al. (2015) used the
    in situ SM data from 45 Mesonet stations for early drought warning in Oklahoma
    and concluded that Mesonet observations are an important source of information
    for early warning of flash drought events in the Southern Great Plains of the
    United States. SM-based drought indices have been also developed based on remotely
    sensed information (Babaeian et al., 2018; Scaini et al., 2015) and land surface
    models (Mo & Lettenmaier, 2014). Because the number of ground SM stations and
    networks is limited (see section 27), remotely sensed SM information has great
    potential for continuous SM and drought monitoring. Chakrabarti et al. (2014)
    demonstrated that assimilation of downscaled (km) SMOS SM estimates into the decision
    support system for the agro-technology transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model can
    be used to analyze the impact of agricultural drought on crop yields. Recently,
    Babaeian et al. (2018) analyzed optical satellite SM retrievals for a range of
    climate, land cover and soil conditions for potential monitoring of agricultural
    drought in the United States. They compared the OPTRAM-based Soil Water Deficit
    Index with the widely applied Crop Moisture Index (CMI) and saw similar patterns
    between these two indices and concluded that OPTRAM-based Soil Water Deficit Index
    can potentially be applied for agricultural drought monitoring. However, to date
    there are no operational agricultural drought monitoring systems that rely on
    remotely sensed SM. Recently, a new SMOS L3 SM-based drought index product has
    been introduced by Al Bitar et al. (2013) for global monitoring of drought and
    is available from ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/Land_products. Real-time drought monitoring
    systems are crucial for early warning and adaptive management of negative environmental
    drought impacts. A real-time monitoring system, the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM),
    has been established by the National Drought Mitigation Center and is accessible
    via www.droughtmonitor.unl.edu (Figure 28, top). The USDM depicts drought integrated
    across all time scales and differentiates between agricultural and hydrological
    impacts. It is based on measurements of climatic, hydrologic, and soil conditions
    as well as reported impacts and observations from more than 350 contributors around
    the United States. There is a substantial correspondence between the USDM map
    and SM percentile map obtained from the CLM, which simulates surface water for
    the continental United States (Figure 28, bottom). SMAP SM is a potential input
    data source used by the U.S. Drought Monitor (Eswar et al., 2018). Figure 28 Open

    10 Summary State-of-the-art SM measurement, monitoring, and modeling capabilities
    were reviewed with the aim of extending the use of increasingly available RS data
    and to identify critical future research needs and directions. The latest ground,
    proximal, and satellite RS techniques; databases; and modeling approaches that
    have been developed in recent years to characterize surface, near-surface and
    root-zone SM for a wide range of spatial and temporal resolutions have been discussed.
    The main conclusions, challenges, and opportunities can be summarized as follows:
    SM networks and spatiotemporal SM data are increasingly applied to validate satellite
    RS observations. Information from these networks is also utilized to characterize
    spatial SM dynamics, validate hydrological models, identify trends in the hydrological
    cycle, identify needs yet to be developed, and improve our understanding of hydrological
    processes. The problem with validation tests of coarse-scale SM products are mainly
    due to disconnects between the sensing depth of ground and remote sensors and
    the scaling disparity (support or measurement volume) between in situ measurements
    and satellite sensor resolution. Antecedent and precise calibration of in situ
    sensors is crucial for reliable validation of remotely sensed SM estimates. Validation
    methods for these tests need to be further refined and standardized with due accounting
    for these scale mismatches that affect reliable validation. Along with the advancement
    of more reliable sensors and data acquisition systems, the number of in situ SM
    networks continues to increase. Because most of these networks have evolved without
    international standardization, they present challenges to the validation of satellite-based
    SM estimation and are not always representative of the larger surrounding area.
    The utilization of RS data within the optical and thermal bands with shallow measurement
    depth for surface and near-surface SM retrieval is sometimes restricted by atmospheric
    conditions (clouds and water vapor), causing uncertainty in relating soil reflectance/temperature
    to SM. On the other hand, most of the methods that use spectral/thermal data are,
    in principal, empirical models, which suffer from the associated limitations of
    site specificity. Advances are needed for deriving physically based models for
    SM retrieval from high spatial/temporal resolution optical/thermal RS data. The
    applicability of RS techniques reviewed in this paper is dependent on the scale
    (spatial and temporal) of interest and availability of data; hence, no single
    method can be suggested as a universal solution. While the combined use of active
    and passive microwave products may improve the resulting SM retrieval accuracy,
    it certainly improves the spatial resolution. Proximal RS methods and their combinations
    can potentially be used for mapping and monitoring SM variability at intermediate
    scales as well as for validating microwave RS SM products using field surveys.
    Improving, testing, and integrating new monitoring techniques able to provide
    SM measurements at intermediate scales like COSMOS, GPS, and EMI are potential
    new topics for future research. Because of the loss of the SMAP radar, there is
    a need for planning of a follow-on mission for providing SM with higher spatiotemporal
    resolution.SM spatial variability affects the accuracy of SM estimations from
    satellite remote sensors. Modeling and simulating SM spatial variability are important
    to improve validation of coarse-scale SM products. SM variability is associated
    not only with soil properties but also with the distribution and intensity of
    rainfall across the land surface and the heterogeneity of the vegetation cover.
    Within this context, SM data may be used for estimating rainfall by considering
    the soil as a natural rain gauge. SM estimates can also be integrated into hydrological
    models to estimate total water losses and gains, accounting for factors such as
    runoff, drainage, and ground-water recharge. SM is a key indicator for agricultural
    drought assessment, but little attention has been paid to the application of in
    situ networks and RS products for systematic drought monitoring. This may be due
    to the fact that these networks and products only measure absolute values of SM
    and do not provide SM in terms of PAW, which is a real representation of plant
    water stress. In this context, integration of remotely sensed SM products with
    SHPs provides unique opportunities to determine PAW and enhance drought monitoring.
    Integration of remotely sensed SM products and soil profile data (PAW) will provide
    invaluable information for better characterizing and monitoring of agricultural
    drought. Information about root-zone SM is critical for crop producers as it aids
    with irrigation and drought management in dryland agricultural. An increase in
    spatial and temporal resolution of SM satellite data can be expected in future,
    which will provide new opportunities for precision management of individual fields.
    This will be beneficial where installation of SM sensors and UAV observations
    are not feasible. It is necessary to improve SM retrieval accuracy over densely
    vegetated regions through development of new algorithms that precisely incorporate
    vegetation optical depth. A remaining grand RS challenge is the accurate estimation
    of root-zone SM from the SM content within the first few centimeters of the soil
    profile. The most commonly applied technique for retrieving root-zone SM from
    satellite RS is assimilation of near-surface SM measurements into, for example,
    land surface or crop growth models. Further information such as groundwater table
    depth, highly spatially resolved soil data, and remotely sensed crop information
    should be considered for constraining root-zone SM estimates. In addition, improved
    descriptions of subsurface processes that control the status of root-zone SM are
    necessary to remove model prediction biases and to further decrease estimation
    uncertainty. Acknowledgment We acknowledge funding from the National Science Foundation

    at -15000 cm matric potential, water is so tightly bound within the soil matrix
    that plants are no longer able to recover their turgidity and irreversibly wilt.

    The originally published version of this article contained a misinterpretation
    of data in Figure 5. The data presented in Figure 5 that was extracted from the
    supporting information in Köhli et al. (2015) (http://www.ufz.de/cosmosfootprint)
    has now been corrected. Also, the paragraph beginning “Due to the higher propagation
    of cosmic rays in thin air …” has been modified to read: “Due to the higher propagation
    of cosmic rays in thin air, the lateral footprint extent is inversely proportional
    to the atmospheric (vapor) pressure and is up to 300 m in diameter, while the
    penetration depth strongly depends on the SM content and ranges from 15 cm in
    wet soils to approximately 70 cm in dry soils (Franz et al., 2012; Zreda et al.,
    2008). Figure 5 shows simulations with the Ultra Rapid Adaptable Neutron-Only
    Simulation (URANOS) code that was tailored by Köhli et al. (2015) to simulate
    neutron transport for environmental science applications. The figure illustrates
    the simulated interactions of cosmic-ray neutrons in the ground (black dots),
    the estimated footprint radius and penetration depth within which 86% of the detected
    neutrons originated, and the respective histograms over distance and depth. The
    shown values are exemplary, while the exact CRNP footprint volume and sensitivity
    depend on soil moisture, bulk density, and atmospheric conditions and are still
    an active area of research. At present, most research is being conducted to interpret
    the measured signals, as the sensors measure not only SM but also the presence
    of water in vegetation, subsurface biomass and organic matter, surface water,
    atmospheric vapor, and clay lattices water (Baatz et al., 2015, Andreasen et al.,
    2017).” All corrections have been made to the online version of this article,

    between leaf wetness and plant diseases have been studied for centuries. The progress
    and risk of many bacterial, fungal, and oomycete diseases on a variety of crops
    have been linked to the presence of free water on foliage and fruit under temperatures
    favorable to infection. Whereas the rate parameters for infection or epidemic
    models have frequently been linked with temperature during the wet periods, leaf
    wetness periods of specific time duration are necessary for the propagule germination
    of most phytopathogenic fungi and for their penetration of plant tissues. Using
    these types of relationships, disease-warning systems were developed and are now
    being used by grower communities for a variety of crops. As a component of Integrated
    Pest Management, disease-warning systems provide growers with information regarding
    the optimum timing for chemical or biological management practices based on weather
    variables most suitable for pathogen dispersal or host infection. Although these
    systems are robust enough to permit some errors in the estimates or measurements
    of leaf wetness duration, the need for highly accurate leaf wetness duration data
    remains a priority to achieve the most efficient disease management. Details Figures

    Get rights and content Abstract Environmental planning takes advantage of geographic
    information systems (GIS) to manage geographic data. GIS are, however, tools which
    require a great deal of training and programming expertise and, furthermore, have
    little support for decision makers during their planning activities. This paper
    presents WOrkflOw-based spatial Decision Support System (woodss) — a software
    developed at the University of Campinas, Brazil, to be used in conjunction with
    a GIS in order to provide spatial decision support involving environmental data.
    woodss was implemented on top of a commercial GIS and tested in the context of
    agri-environmental planning activities. woodss is centered on dynamically capturing
    user interactions with a GIS in real time and documenting them by means of scientific
    workflows. It keeps track of decision procedures, models applied and the choice
    of parameters in running these models. woodss''s workflows can be updated on the
    fly, allowing testing and comparison of alternative planning strategies. They
    can, furthermore, be used as building blocks for the construction of complex decision
    procedures, supporting a divide-and-conquer problem solution style. These workflows
    interact directly with the GIS, sparing environmental planners and decision makers
    the burden of low-level programming. Previous article in issue Next article in

    support systemsEnvironmental planning 1. Introduction Spatial decision support
    systems (SDSS) are decision support systems where the spatial properties of the
    data to be analyzed play a major role in decision making. Usually, these properties
    refer to the data''s location on the Earth''s surface — the so-called georeferenced
    data. The term refers to data about geographic phenomena associated with its location,
    spatially referenced to the Earth [6]. Spatial decision support is one of the
    facilities that must be offered by environmental management information systems
    (EMIS) [18]. These are systems which are conceived to help users administer environmental
    information within an enterprise. One of the most important activities that must
    be supported by EMIS is environmental planning. This term encompasses a large
    set of planning and policy enforcement activities that have to deal with two (sometimes
    conflicting) objectives: exploitation of existing resources, to maximize profit;
    and preservation of these resources, to protect the environment. This type of
    planning is usually conducted collaboratively by groups of experts in different
    fields (e.g., earth and environmental sciences, agriculture, remote sensing, operations
    research) and may cover the entire life cycle of a given decision chain. For instance,
    in an agriculture context, it involves determining what to plant where (and when),
    how to prepare the soil, irrigation and fertilization policies, harvest and distribution
    logistics. The combination of {what, when and how} to {where} constitutes the
    core of spatial decision support, which must take into account the fact that solutions
    are valid for a specific temporal and spatial frame. A major tool in the framework
    of EMIS is provided by geographic information systems (GIS). A GIS is a software
    that provides mechanisms to store, analyze, manipulate and visualize georeferenced
    data. GIS are used to help decision makers in identifying geographic regions that
    satisfy one or more criteria, exploring spatial and temporal relations among georeferenced
    data and providing data for analysis and simulation models [40]. GIS are increasingly
    used to improve decision processes in environmental, urban and socio-economical
    applications. Even though the importance of GIS in spatial decision making is
    recognized, the capability of such systems is limited (e.g., Ref. [28]). They
    are, above all, pieces of software that provide a wide variety of analysis functions
    over georeferenced data, and offer advanced (cartographic) visual presentation.
    However, they do not provide any means for helping users select the appropriate
    functions to apply or to guide them in interpreting results. GIS can only be considered
    as SDSS insofar as they provide tools to generate different types of maps, from
    which EMIS users identify solution alternatives. Each map reflects the choice
    of a given set of models and decision procedures. The spatial decision process
    goes through two stages: (1) map generation using a GIS and (2) critical analysis
    of these maps. These stages can be iterated (e.g., critical analysis leads to
    generation of new maps), until planners are satisfied. Since environmental planning
    is a very recent activity, these stages are performed in an ad hoc manner, with
    insufficient documentation and very little support for interchange of expertise
    among groups of planners. Thus, a considerable amount of time is spent in reinventing
    solutions to problems, and much money is wasted in not profiting from past experience.
    The role of GIS within an EMIS and in spatial decision support is discussed in
    several contexts (e.g., Refs. 9, 18, 39). There is, however, consensus that more
    powerful tools have to be provided in order to help decision makers. This paper
    presents a computational tool which was developed with this objective in mind.
    This system, named woodss (WOrkflOw-based spatial Decision Support System), was
    developed in the Institute of Computing of UNICAMP. It is based on combining the
    concept of GIS as spatial decision support tools within an EMIS to the notion
    of scientific workflows [48]. The latter are a special kind of workflow suited
    to documenting and specifying scientific experimental activities within a laboratory.
    woodss captures planners'' interactions with a GIS in real time during their decision
    process, and has three main goals. ⋅ Documentation. Users'' interactions with
    GIS are monitored and transformed into an intermediate representation — scientific
    workflows. These are stored in a database (called WorkflowBase) to document previous
    solutions to similar spatial decision problems. This allows faster comparison
    between different methods for data analysis, promoting better conditions for participatory
    planning. As shown subsequently, this documentation format has the advantage to
    be easier to use and understand than standard GIS programming or interaction modes.
    ⋅ Support for decision making. This is ensured by the kinds of operations allowed
    by woodss. Indeed, workflows are not just yet another means of documenting planning
    activities, but also serve as executable specifications of these activities. This
    supports reproducibility of steps leading to a decision (an important asset in
    decision support systems). Furthermore, woodss allows interactive updating of
    workflows (thereby generating alternative decision procedures), their re-use as
    partial solutions to larger problems (again, fundamental in decision making) and
    their validation against predefined criteria (equivalent to validation of steps
    leading to a decision). ⋅ Modelbase construction. Scientific workflows present
    a concise notation for simulation models in environmental planning. Thus, at the
    same time that it allows documentation of user decision procedures, woodss also
    supports progressive construction of the Modelbase of the decision support system
    (dss). woodss was developed using the object oriented language Java™, and works
    in conjunction with idrisi [14], a GIS widely used in the environmental area.
    It is now being used by researchers and students of the Agriculture Engineering
    Faculty in UNICAMP, to document and speed up planning for agri-environmental problems.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 2 Spatial decision support, 3
    Workflowsintroduce SDSS, and the application of scientific workflows to spatial
    decision support within EMIS. Section 4presents the woodss system architecture
    and Section 5mentions some implementation aspects and a case study. Finally, Section
    6presents related work and Section 7presents conclusions and future work. 2. Spatial
    decision support 2.1. Main issues A dss is a computer-based system designed to
    improve decision maker effectivity, by providing mechanisms to facilitate user
    interaction with data and analysis models 21, 45.4 A SDSS is a dss in which the
    spatial dimension of the data is fundamental to the analysis of decisions. Spatial
    decision support relies heavily on maps, which form the backbone upon which plans
    and policies are defined. Problems can roughly be classified into siting (i.e.,
    where to place some given object — e.g., a dam, a house, a park) and spatial allocation
    (i.e., for a predefined location, what is the best object among a class of objects
    to place there (e.g., a crop or building type). In the first case, the main issue
    is determining the location, whereas in spatial allocation the unknown is the
    object itself. Some problems may require combination of both characteristics (e.g.,
    in routing or urban expansion planning). Environmental planning, furthermore,
    involves studies of risk/impact assessment, and contingency planning, which combine
    what and where to when and how. Spatial decision making has traditionally been
    associated with the use of GIS. However, as stressed in Refs. 10, 28, GIS do not
    adequately support the spatial decision process because they lack the appropriate
    modeling capabilities and do not accommodate variations in context or process.
    If, on one hand, GIS lack support for spatial decision making, on the other hand
    current decision support systems do not provide adequate tools to solve spatial
    problems, especially those concerning environmental issues, which are fuzzier
    in nature than urban spatial problems. Indeed, traditional dss (e.g., Refs. 34,
    45) lack the cartographic presentation facilities essential to spatial decision
    making. Furthermore, traditional dss are frequently based on models which consider
    only one criterion, e.g., distance or cost functions to be optimized. In the spatial
    context, more complex realities must be considered, which must be analyzed through
    the combination of multiple criteria. Multiple criteria decision making techniques
    (e.g., Refs. 20, 24, 29, 47) allow users to select a satisfactory solution among
    alternative solutions, based on analysis of multiple criteria with different priorities.
    For example, erosion forecasts must consider factors such as land use, climate,
    slope, aspect and digital elevation model. 2.2. The spatial decision process The
    spatial decision process within an EMIS can be described as the repeated iteration
    of four steps, which are based on the methodology in Ref. [37]for the development
    of environmental planning applications. These steps, which have an immediate correspondence
    to the (non-spatial) decision steps described in Ref. [11]are: 1. Planning. This
    is a group decision making process and involves the definition of the objectives,
    the geographic area and the data and models to be applied. 2. Inventory/gathering
    of data. It consists in determining the relevant data and in collecting these
    data through, for example, air photos and satellite images. 3. Development. It
    corresponds to the implementation in a GIS of the models, using the data defined
    by the previous step. Models are implemented by constructing programs which invoke
    GIS functions. 4. Assessment. It involves impact assessment, interpretation of
    results and specification of policies. The first three steps correspond to the
    generation of a set of maps, whereas assessment consists in analyzing the maps
    to take decisions and calibrate the models employed. From a dss perspective, each
    map is the result of the execution of a model. Each map in the set may reflect
    an alternative solution scenario for a given problem, or the map set may describe
    complementary actions to be taken in a given situation. The entire process is
    complicated by the fact that data are very heterogeneous (e.g., collected by different
    devices, for distinct geographic scales and non-homogeneous spatial and temporal
    units) and that models vary according to the geographic region to which the problem
    applies. Thus, whereas map production for cartographic purposes is relatively
    straightforward (e.g., produce a map of the State of Parana in Southern Brazil,
    or the state of Bahia in NE Brazil), map production for spatial decision support
    is very complex. For instance, the models and simulations necessary to produce
    an erosion map for the State of Parana are very different from those applied to
    the State of Bahia, due to enormous differences in soil, climate, vegetation,
    relief and land use management. Data and models are furthermore temporally sensitive
    (e.g., seasonal changes) and subject to socioeconomical constraints. Assessment
    — map interpretation — is again dependent on the goals and expertise of the analysts,
    and on legislation and cultural issues. Thus, given one specific problem in environmental
    planning — e.g., define a schedule for sugar cane crop rotation for a specific
    region in Brazil — a multitude of map sets may be generated and, subsequently,
    multiple (and even conflicting) policies may be devised based on the maps. woodss
    provides support to the creation of maps, i.e., steps 1 through 3 of the decision
    process. 3. Workflows woodss is based on the concept of scientific workflows.
    A workflow denotes the controlled execution of multiple tasks in an environment
    of distributed processing elements [41]. It can be defined a set of tasks involved
    in a procedure along with their interdependencies, inputs and outputs. Each task
    is called an activity, and can be executed by one or more agents, in a given role
    — it is a unit of work. An agent is a person or software component able to execute
    one or more activities. Workflows are gaining increasing acceptance in the business
    world as a means of documenting and organizing procedures, as well as helping
    the coordination of groups. Workflows were conceived as a means for describing
    procedures in business environments which can be repeated over and over again.
    The goal of a workflow management system (WFMS) is to provide facilities to specify
    and execute workflows [8]. Traditionally, these systems distinguish between workflow
    modeling and execution. The modeling phase consists in creating a workflow specification,
    which is a description of activities, dependencies and agents. Activities may
    be automatic (executed by a software component) or manual (performed by a person).
    Dependencies describe constraints among activities and can be data, temporal and
    execution dependencies [41]. The execution phase consists in running (executing)
    a given workflow specification. 3.1. Scientific workflows The term scientific
    workflow 43, 48was coined to denote a specific kind of workflow which can be used
    to document and control the execution of scientific experiments and procedures
    — e.g., in DNA sequencing [33]or in geoprocessing 4, 32. Scientific work is characterized
    by a great degree of flexibility and presents a much higher amount of uncertainty
    and exceptions than business work. Thus, standard workflow mechanisms are insufficient
    to describe this kind of work. In business applications, the main motivation for
    introducing workflow management is the desire to “re-engineer” work to enhance
    efficiency. The motivation for workflow management in scientific applications,
    however, is less to enhance efficiency, but to control experiments, and to make
    available to scientific users the information on how experiments were conducted.
    Intuitively, scientific workflows differ from standard business workflows in two
    senses: (a) activities are experiment-oriented (as opposed to business-oriented);
    and (b) the “flow of the work” being modeled and the interactions among activities
    must support the trial-and-error and ad hocness of scientific experimentation.
    More precisely, scientific workflows are defined as extending traditional workflow
    functionality to support the following aspects 2, 43, 48. ⋅ Ad hocness and incompleteness.
    Scientific workflows can be executed even when incomplete. being progressively
    built during their execution. Modeling and execution phases are interleaved —
    it is only upon the completion of an activity that subsequent activities may be
    specified. Traditional workflows, on the other hand, must be totally specified
    before being executed. ⋅ Partial re-use. Scientific workflows differ from the
    traditional ones in the sense that they are considered to be building blocks for
    experiment specification. Thus, one can re-use partial workflows to specify new
    ones. ⋅ Abandon/rewind and dynamic modification. Scientific workflows allow not
    only re-executing an activity but also rewinding to a previous one, re-establishing
    its context and continuing the execution through another course of action, which
    corresponds to specifying a new workflow on the fly. ⋅ Tracing of invalid processes.
    In the scientific domain, decision processes are based in a trial and error mechanism
    (learning from mistakes). Hence, unlike business workflows, scientific workflows
    serve as a means to document both successful and unsuccessful processes. The latter
    should be, moreover, amenable to re-execution. ⋅ Specification from case. Traditional
    workflows are specifications that are expected to be executed frequently. Each
    such execution is called a case. Scientific workflows, on the other hand, may
    be executed only once (e.g., for unsuccessful trials). Furthermore, since they
    may be specified on the fly, their specification may be prompted by the case —
    i.e., the case defines the workflow, instead of the specification guiding the
    case. 3.2. Using scientific workflows to document environmental decision making
    We recall that map production is an important stage in spatial decision support.
    Users interact with GIS during their decision process to generate maps over which
    decisions are based. Some types of spatial decision procedures, especially in
    network-related problems, are already well understood (e.g., Ref. [36]). Environmental
    decision making is however still in its infancy, in part due to our yet incomplete
    knowledge of natural phenomena. Among the particularities of environmental decision
    processes, Mann [31]mentions: • The lack of precision in goal definition (e.g.,
    no standard definition for “sustainability” or “biodiversity”); • The complexity
    and dynamicity of the natural environment, where feedback paths entail evolution
    and continuous change; • The dependency of problems on the geographic scale, and
    the fact that the decision making process straddles many different approaches,
    reflecting planners'' varying views of natural phenomena; • Finally, several problems
    are new, sometimes one-of-a-kind, and do not occur frequently enough to warrant
    generalization of solutions or rigorous mathematical treatment. Environmental
    decision making has thus a strong component of empirical experimentation, with
    a long cycle of successive approximations through trial and error. It can thus
    be naturally expressed as a scientific experiment, in which the goal is to produce
    a map which will indicate how to solve a problem. woodss takes advantage of this
    analogy and uses scientific workflows to document and support spatial decision
    procedures for environmental problems. Environmental decision making through a
    GIS corresponds to defining and calibrating a model by using the GIS'' functions
    to construct a set of maps. Map generation is a partially ordered sequence of
    activities, which are related by data and control links. These activities intermingle
    direct interaction with the GIS (with the mouse) and coding (of macros or programs).
    This can be appropriately modeled by scientific workflows in the following aspects.
    ⋅ Ad hocness. Map generation in environmental planning has a strong empirical
    component, not being specified in advance but being determined during the decision
    process according to the GIS being used and the participants in the decision process.
    ⋅ Partial re-use. In spatial decision making, (parts of) maps can be combined
    to produce more complex maps. ⋅ Abandon/rewind and dynamic modification. The map
    sequences built during environmental planning are often discarded when users detect
    a trend that is not of interest. Map construction parameters can furthermore be
    dynamically modified by invoking distinct GIS modules to perform one given function.
    Decisions on which module to choose are data and context-sensitive — i.e., according
    to the way intermediate/partial maps look. ⋅ Tracing of invalid processes. Environmental
    planners often need to reproduce unsuccessful map generation procedures in order
    to identify error sources. ⋅ Specification from case. Many models are constructed
    while creating a map, rather than being specified in advance. This is a consequence
    of the fact that environmental planning involves many unknowns, and that often
    models have to be experimentally built from scratch. 4. The woodss system woodss
    is a system based on scientific workflows whose goal is to support spatial decision
    processes. woodss supports all characteristics of these workflows as defined in
    Section 3. Scientific workflows are used by woodss in three roles: (i) as a means
    for documenting a decision process; (ii) as high-level specifications of an environmental
    simulation model; and (iii) as executable parametrized specifications of decision
    procedures, which can be re-used and adapted for similar situations. Workflows
    stored in woodss can be queried to give a global vision of the work developed
    to solve a problem or to guide the resolution of similar problems. Furthermore,
    they can be launched to automatically re-execute analogous activities with different
    parameters. 4.1. woodss from a dss perspective A traditional dss architecture
    considers the interaction of three components: Interface, Database and Modelbase
    [11]. The interface interacts with a database management system (DBMS), which
    manipulates data, and a modelbase management system (MBMS), which manipulates
    models to be applied on these data. Fig. 1, adapted from Ref. [22], illustrates
    the architecture of woodss in this context.5 Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 1. woodss from a dss perspective. The GIS is responsible for handling georeferenced
    data and providing functions to execute the spatial analysis models. 4.1.1. Database
    A dss must manipulate internal (application) and external (for example, national
    and international policies) data, and user''s estimatives. Data may be queried
    by users or provided as the input to models. The DBMS must allow the combination
    and visualization of heterogeneous data and the manipulation of subjective data.
    In woodss, the Database encapsulates two kinds of data: georeferenced data used
    in the planning process, and which is manipulated by the GIS; and a WorkflowBase,
    which stores scientific workflow specifications and which use the other data to
    describe the map generation process in GIS. Both bases are stored in a relational
    database system. 4.1.2. Modelbase Models provide analysis capabilities to the
    dss. There are different kinds of models, depending of their purpose, the use
    of random parameters, their generality and their structure. The Modelbase of woodss
    consists of spatial analysis models (specified in terms of combination of GIS
    functions) and decision techniques employed by the users. The decision process
    for environmental planning often combines four types of models [18]: transport
    model (migration of substances in air, water or ground), process model (simulation
    of interactions of economical and natural agents), resource utilization model,
    and ecosystem model. The heterogeneity of issues encountered is exemplified by
    the variety of analytical and probabilistic models proposed (e.g., see Ref. [16]),
    whereas Ref. [35]presents over 100 methodologies for implementing models in environmental
    planning. Each model, in environmental decision making, can be specified in terms
    of its inputs (data files and parameter values), outputs (materialized in maps)
    and states [39]. Inputs, states and outputs can assume different values during
    a given simulation/experiment. The workflows of woodss document the execution
    of models, for specific parameters and inputs. They can, however, be re-executed
    with distinct parameters and inputs, thus, constituting a high-level specification
    of a set of simulation models. The Modelbase of woodss is geared towards process
    models, resource utilization models and some types of ecosystem models (for medium
    and small geographic scales). Transport models and ecosystem models for large
    scales would require the use of a more versatile DBMS, with active and object-oriented
    capabilities. 4.1.3. Interface The interface allows users to interact with models
    and data. This component requires a great part of the effort of system development.
    In woodss, the interface is coupled to a monitoring layer which intercepts user
    interactions, translating them into workflows stored in the WorkflowBase. 4.2.
    Architecture The architecture of woodss — illustrated in Fig. 2 — consists of
    five modules: Interface, Monitor, Update, Query and Workflow Manager. The Monitor
    module captures users'' interactions with the GIS, informing them to the Workflow
    Manager. The latter is responsible for managing the WorkflowBase. The Interface
    module allows users to graphically visualize and create planning processes and
    models in terms of workflows. It mediates user requests for browsing (Query module)
    and update (Update module) the WorkflowBase. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 2. woodss architecture. Coupling to the GIS is achieved by means of the Monitor
    module, which ensures adaptability of woodss to several GIS. Workflows, models
    and data are encapsulated in a database, managed by a relational DBMS. Spatial
    models are specified as workflows and executed within the GIS. This architecture
    isolates users from internal data storage details — scientific workflows can be
    stored in a standard database, and thus take advantage of standard DBMS functions
    such as query optimization and indexing. Furthermore, the architecture can be
    coupled to several GIS, since the Monitor is the only module that interacts with
    the GIS. Thus, coupling woodss to a GIS requires only customizing the Monitor.
    4.2.1. WorkflowBase The WorkflowBase is a relational database. It consists of
    set of scientific workflows and related metadata, stored in database relations
    (i.e., tables). Each workflow is specified in terms of activities, data, dependencies
    and agents, translated into a set of relation tuples (i.e., table rows). Metadata
    have a very important role in supporting browsing and data transfer in environmental
    information systems, serving as additional online documentation for automated
    tools and human users [8]. In woodss, metadata are used to document facts related
    to a workflow and to the associated decision making process. Each workflow is
    linked to a metadata record. This record contains information about the objectives
    of a decision process and the geographic area considered, both being necessary
    to identify the nature of the environmental planning problem being handled [37].
    The metadata record may include, furthermore, information about the author of
    the workflow and other additional data considered relevant (e.g., quality of data
    used). 4.2.2. Interface The Interface is the only module visible to the user,
    and transforms user query and update requests into appropriate sequences of commands
    to the other modules. It allows two types of interaction modes: • Textual — The
    user fills in parameters in predefined query and update forms. • Direct Manipulation
    — The user uses the mouse to manipulate workflow elements or click on some interface
    button. The first type of interaction is employed to browse the WorkflowBase —
    retrieving all workflows that satisfy a given set of conditions (e.g., concern
    a specific region). The second type of interaction typically occurs when the user
    has already retrieved the workflows of interest and either wants to examine or
    update them, or to select sub-workflows for execution or re-use. Both interaction
    modes hide from the user the fact that the storage and data management system
    is a relational DBMS. The interface just forwards user requests to the Update
    and Query modules, which interact with the Workflow Manager to transform these
    requests into SQL commands (to the database) or GIS macro programs (to the GIS).
    All the user ever sees are workflows (e.g., Fig. 3) or query/update forms (e.g.,
    Fig. 4). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. woodss main interface. Download

    4.2.3. Query module The Query module handles querying and navigation in the WorkflowBase.
    Users can request access to a specific workflow (by name) or sets of workflows
    (by keywords). Other typical queries are as follows. ⋅ Area-based queries. Users
    search for decision processes and/or models executed involving a specific geographic
    area. This allows finding out, for instance, all studies conducted in a given
    region. One example would be to find out if there is a crop yield forecast model
    for the area in question. ⋅ Problem-based queries. Users look for decision processes
    developed to solve problems with similar objectives, to take advantage of experience
    gotten in the resolution of the same problem over other geographic areas. For
    instance, a given erosion modeling procedure in one region may be adopted for
    other areas with similar characteristics. ⋅ Process-based queries. Users request
    to see the sequence of activities that originated a given map set. This could
    help determining the quality or precision of the set and, indirectly, of the decisions
    taken based on the data. 4.2.4. Update module The Update module mediates creation,
    removal or modification of workflows. A workflow can be updated in two ways. ⋅
    Component modification — The user requests insertion/deletion/modification of
    any workflow component (individual activities, data files, dependencies and agents).
    Metadata records can only be created by invocation of the Update module (equivalent
    to writing annotations on sets of activities). ⋅ Workflow creation — The user
    requests combination of existing workflows (e.g., by concatenating them). Commonly,
    experts approach a decision problem by solving sub-problems and combining the
    solutions. This type of update contemplates this approach to decision taking.
    Workflow creation is also performed by the Monitor module. 4.2.5. Workflow Manager
    The Workflow Manager is responsible for managing the WorkflowBase, handling the
    communication between the other modules and the DBMS, by translating the stored
    relations into workflows and vice-versa. Basically, it manages workflows according
    to two main functionalities: ⋅ Query/browse — retrieves workflows from the WorkflowBase.
    A user''s request via the Interface is transformed by the Query module into a
    set of SQL commands to the underlying database. The tuples retrieved are graphically
    presented to the user as workflows. These queries act both on metadata and on
    the workflows themselves. ⋅ Update — creates, deletes and modifies workflows by
    requesting updates on the corresponding relations stored in the WorkflowBase.
    Updates may be requested either by the Update module (user-originated) or the
    Monitor (during workflow generation). 4.3. Interaction User–GIS–woodss woodss
    caters to three kinds of user interaction modes (see Fig. 2). These modes support
    the aspects of scientific workflows defined in Section 3. (1) User–GIS. Users
    ignore woodss and interact with the GIS, to generate maps according to some model,
    which is translated into executing sequences of GIS functions. woodss monitors
    this interaction in real time and generates the corresponding scientific workflow
    specification (specifying workflows from the case). (2) User–woodss. Users interact
    only with woodss, querying and updating the WorkflowBase. Typically, this occurs
    when decision makers want to find out about previous solutions to a similar problem.
    woodss stores both successful and unsuccessful workflows, which allows not only
    re-use of past experiences (partial re-use), but also learning from past mistakes
    (tracing invalid processes), a very important factor in decision making. (3) User–GIS–woodss.
    This mode of interaction combines the previous ones. Users alternate between woodss
    and the GIS, using the information in the WorkflowBase to continue their decision
    process. This allows creating alternative scenarios and designing new decision
    strategies. In practice, this corresponds to querying the WorkflowBase to find
    the workflows of interest, selecting and combining parts of these workflows to
    create a new workflow, and having the GIS execute this new workflow (ad hocness
    and dynamic modification). 5. Implementation woodss was implemented on a PC platform,
    and the target GIS was idrisi for Windows version 2.0. The implementation was
    developed with the object oriented language Java™. The WorkflowBase is implemented
    as relations in a relational database, which is connected to Java through the
    JDBC interface. This section gives a brief description of the implementation.
    For more details, the reader is referred to Ref. [42]. 5.1. idrisi and woodss
    idrisi is a GIS developed to be used in microcomputers. It is widely used in environmental
    monitoring and natural resources management. idrisi records user interactions
    in a sequential log file, which was used as input to the Monitor module of woodss.
    User interactions (activities) with idrisi to generate maps are of three kinds:
    clicking at maps and invoking functions from a set of menus; typing commands;
    and running programs (macro files). Lines in the log file correspond to the execution
    of an idrisi function, or to an error or warning message. In the first case, the
    line contains the name of the function and its parameters, which vary according
    to the function and, possibly, a option in it. For instance, the log record “c:
    idrisiw Overlay w421 1 image1 image2 image21” indicates that function overlay
    was executed with option 1, using as input images stored in files image1 and image2,
    and producing as output image stored in image21. An image overlay corresponds
    roughly to adding the contents of the images to obtain a third image — e.g., an
    overlay of a soil and a vegetation maps will result in a composite map. This operation
    may be weighted — e.g., attributing weights to different values of soil and vegetation
    may result in a map indicating areas where conditions are good for planting a
    given type of crop. The Monitor module was implemented to read the log of idrisi
    in real time while it is being updated with user operations. It performs a syntactic
    analysis of the log file, identifying activities actually executed (which did
    not generate errors), disregarding messages and identifying activities that were
    not executed because of errors. The log analysis also allows detecting data dependencies
    among activities. Other types of dependencies cannot be derived from the log and
    must be provided by the user directly via the Update module. 5.2. WorkflowBase
    woodss WorkflowBase is implemented in the relational DBMS Visual FoxPro™, version
    5.0. Each workflow corresponds to a set of tuples stored in five relations: Activities,
    Data, Workflow, Metadata and Dependencies. The Metadata relation contains information
    about authors, objectives, geographic area and relevant comments. The Workflow
    relation maintains a record of the workflows in the WorkflowBase. Each activity
    corresponds to a tuple in the relation Activities. It contains an internal woodss
    identifier, a name descriptor, an indication if it is a manual activity or if
    it was executed in idrisi, pointers (i.e., in relational database terminology,
    foreign keys) to its input and output files, and activity-dependent parameters.
    Input and output files are used by the Workflow Manager to derive data dependencies
    between activities. The Data relation records all data files used and produced
    in a given decision process. Each file corresponds to a relation tuple, containing
    a woodss internal identifier and other parameters (e.g., file name). The Dependencies
    relation maintains data dependencies, as well as a restricted set of temporal
    and execution dependencies. Each tuple in this relation associates an activity
    (precedent) to another activity (subsequent) through pairs of internal identifiers
    (foreign keys). Furthermore, each tuple contains additional information which
    depends on the type of dependency being stored. For data dependencies, the tuple
    stores the file identifiers of files which are produced by one activity and used
    as input by another. Execution dependencies are represented in a similar way,
    signalling when the beginning of an activity depends on the successful termination
    of other(s). Temporal dependencies allow synchronizing activities. In woodss,
    they are specified only for documentation purposes, since their enforcement would
    require modification of the transaction mechanism of the underlying DBMS (e.g.,
    Ref. [41]). 5.3. Workflow Manager The Workflow Manager does not use a commercial
    WFMS. Rather, it is implemented within woodss to manage scientific workflows.
    Each log entry corresponding to an activity executed in idrisi is transformed
    in a tuple in the relation Activities. The Workflow Manager inserts a tuple in
    the Data relation each time a new file is referenced. It inserts a tuple in the
    relation Dependencies each time it determines that an activity uses a file generated
    by a previous activity in the workflow. This requires that the Monitor keeps track
    of all files mentioned in a log until the end of a given decision process (either
    successfully or unsuccessfully). Manual activities (e.g., command editing) and
    temporal and execution dependencies must be directly provided by the user through
    the Update module. 5.4. Query and Update modules Query and Update modules are
    responsible for the access to the WorkflowBase. Once a workflow is selected, users
    can query and update information about activities, data, dependencies and metadata.
    Query and update requests are forwarded by the Interface to the Workflow Manager,
    which translates them into SQL query and update (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE commands)
    to the five relations within the WorkflowBase. The result of these operations
    is returned to the Workflow Manager, and shown graphically to the user by the
    Interface module. 5.5. Interface The interface is responsible for the communication
    of users with the Query and Update modules. Fig. 3 illustrates the main interface
    of woodss. It depicts a partial workflow which is part of the case study discussed
    in Section 5.7. It consists of a set of buttons for user interaction and a workflow
    display window. Each rectangle represents an activity, and each arrow a dependency,
    which is labeled by file names (data dependency) or conditions (temporal or execution
    dependencies). Each activity is labeled with its name and, if executed in idrisi,
    the idrisi function is used. For instance, in the figure, activity Slope Calculation
    is linked to UserDefined Classification via the Slopes file, which is produced
    as output by the former and used as input by the latter. This means that there
    is a data dependency from Slope Calculation to UserDefined Classification. Slope
    Calculation is an activity performed by invoking idrisi function surface. Users
    can access the current workflow by clicking on the Current Workflow button (the
    third interaction mode), and navigate through the WorkflowBase clicking the WorkflowBase
    button. Once a workflow is shown in the workflow display window, users can query
    or modify its metadata record through the Metadata button, insert manual activities
    or dependencies through New Activity and New Dependency, respectively, or update
    workflow components. Finally, Begin Selection and End Selection buttons let users
    select a partial workflow. Activities and dependencies can be queried by clicking
    on the corresponding workflow graphical elements. Parameters displayed on the
    window are activity-dependent. Fig. 4 shows the result of querying the contents
    of the Slope Calculation activity. The Modify button, in the figure, is the one
    that allows update of activity details. 5.6. Re-execution and definition of new
    decision processes woodss provides the facility of re-executing sequences of activities
    performed in idrisi and that were documented through workflows. This way, users
    need not repeat their manual interaction with idrisi, which is time consuming
    and error-prone. If a workflow is updated for re-execution, it is considered to
    be a new workflow — akin to defining a new/alternative decision process for a
    given problem. Ideally, workflow launching would invoke a GIS directly. Unfortunately,
    because idrisi is a proprietary software, this is not possible. So, woodss automatically
    creates a macro file from the workflow. This file is made available to users,
    who can execute it on idrisi. This is a powerful feature of woodss, since it is
    equivalent to programming applications directly in a GIS using a workflow notation.
    It is a means of ensuring reproducibility of a sequence of steps in a decision
    process. Re-execution has two roles in a decision support process: (a) independent
    observers can analyze past procedures, to audit or validate them; (b) at the same
    time, similar problems can be approached in an analogous way. Users can select
    activities to be updated or re-executed. Fig. 5 illustrates the re-execution window
    after selection of four activities from the workflow in Fig. 3. The possibility
    of updating existing workflows is another plus offered by woodss. When the updates
    performed are just the change of input files or of parameters, without changing
    activities, this is tantamount to parameter tuning in dss. The most complex update
    is building new workflows from partial workflows. It corresponds to constructing
    the solution of a problem by combining solutions of its parts. Download : Download

    of workflow of Fig. 3. 5.7. Example of environmental planning using woodss We
    now give an example of an environmental decision making process using woodss.
    The workflow of Fig. 3 represents part of the solution for a siting problem described
    in Ref. [14], and which was adapted to Brazilian agri-environmental data. Given
    a certain region in the state of São Paulo, planners must identify areas which
    are appropriate for planting sugar cane. The main constraints are that these areas
    are characterized by (a) little or no declivity (to allow mechanical harvesting
    procedures), (b) close to waterways (for irrigation purposes), while at the same
    time keeping a certain minimum distance from (c) natural reserves and (d) forest
    areas, to avoid environmental degradation. Finally, they must be (e) close to
    highways, to ensure appropriate transportation of the cane to the mills, and (f)
    respect urban distance constraints (to avoid increasing urban air pollution).
    5.7.1. Beginning a planning session The user initially activates woodss and browses
    the WorkflowBase to check if there have been similar planning activities already
    performed for the same area (combination of area-based query and problem-based
    query). Browsing is initiated by clicking on the WorkflowBase button (see Fig.
    3). The user is next presented with a query form, with the options of indicating
    a specific workflow (by name) or filling in one or more fields. Suppose the user
    enters data in form fields Area — entering region coordinates — and Keywords —
    typing “sugar cane”. Query form parameters are checked by woodss against the Metadata
    relation, to retrieve all workflows that obey the conditions. 5.7.2. Situation
    1 — a previous solution for the solution for the problem exists Assume first that
    woodss finds a workflow that answers the request. It is then presented to the
    user, who can either re-execute it on idrisi, or update it and execute the new
    updated version. Updating includes, among others, changing input files (e.g.,
    running the workflow for the new region), changing parameters (e.g., tuning),
    modifying workflow dependencies and attributes or creating new dependencies and
    activities (by clicking on New Activity and New Dependency interface buttons).
    Workflow (re)execution corresponds to asking woodss to translate the workflow
    into idrisi executable code. Fig. 6, for instance, corresponds to the idrisi code
    generated by woodss for the partial workflow of Fig. 3. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. idrisi code generated by execution of workflow of Fig. 3. 5.7.3.
    Situation 2 — no previous solution exists Suppose, on the other hand, that woodss
    does not find any workflow to satisfy the request. In this situation, the user
    must start a new decision procedure by interacting directly with idrisi. As soon
    as the user switches to idrisi, woodss initializes a new (empty) workflow called
    Current Workflow, and the Monitor module will start capturing into it user interactions
    in real time. According to the user''s decision strategy, the first constraints
    to be checked will be those concerning declivity (a) and forest/reserve (c, d)
    constraints. The actual interaction with idrisi is as follows. First, the user
    invokes the idrisi Surface operation on relief data, to obtain a declivity map,
    and then classifies the areas in this map according to the gradient (e.g., feeble,
    medium, high) using a Reclass operation. Next, the user finds out which areas
    are under environmental protection (by identifying reserves and forests in a land
    use map), and pinpoints regions according to distance from the reserves (Distance
    operation), again reclassifying the result into distance zones. The user then
    combines all these maps into an intermediate map by applying successive Overlay
    operations. The result is an intermediate map that indicates areas where sugar
    cane can be planted as far as (a) declivity, (c) forest and (d) reserves constraints
    are concerned. There still remains to further restrict these areas according to
    (b) irrigation, (e) transportation and (f) urban constraints. Suppose however
    the user wants to interrupt this decision procedure, to check the steps taken
    so far. In order to do this, the user can switch to woodss main interface window
    and click on the Current Workflow button. Immediately, the user will see the current
    execution state displayed on Fig. 3. Internally, this is handled as an SQL query
    (Query module) to the WorkflowBase, asking for the Current Workflow. Once the
    user examines the current workflow, there are three options to choose to continue
    the spatial decision process: (i) to go back to idrisi, in which case the current
    workflow will continue being constructed in real time by woodss (the user is happy
    with what has been done so far); (ii) to select just part of this workflow, optionally
    editing it by adding activities and dependencies, and having it executed as the
    beginning of a new decision procedure (just some of the steps taken were appropriate)
    — see Fig. 5; or (iii) to abandon the current execution and start a new one. In
    the last two cases, the user can indicate whether the abandoned current workflow
    should be stored in the WorkflowBase as an incomplete/erroneous solution. Also,
    at any time, the user can enter metadata and update and query information on the
    WorkflowBase. After several such interactions, the user comes up with the final
    map which indicates the regions suitable for sugar cane plantation. This map must
    be examined in a context which involves other related information, which does
    not concern this paper. Fig. 7 shows a partial screen copy of this map, in the
    area of the county of Campinas. The corresponding full workflow will not be shown
    here, for readability reasons. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Regions
    suitable for planting sugar cane. 5.7.4. Situation 3 — participatory planning
    Even though the example describes the work of a single user, it can also concern
    several users cooperating to develop a solution using the workflows as a communication
    means. For instance, one user can develop the first part (Fig. 3), and some other
    user can develop another part, and the final result is obtained by combining the
    workflows and executing this composite workflow. Or groups of users can develop
    partial or alternative solutions at different times, and keep track of what everyone
    is doing by looking at the respective workflows. 6. Related work The work presented
    in this paper is related to two research fields: use of scientific workflows for
    experimental activities in a laboratory, and use of GIS in spatial decision support,
    within an EMIS. This paper reports the first attempt to link both contexts and
    implement them into a single tool. Scientific workflows are a relatively new concept
    in the area of workflow management, and their use is still a matter of research.
    They have been reported as a means of documenting and keeping track of activities
    in a scientific environment. Research in the area is related to their use in specific
    domains, varying from their capacity to support collaborative scientific task
    execution (e.g., Ref. [2]), long transaction capability [43]and, more specifically,
    their suitableness for documenting geoprocessing tasks 4, 50. The emphasis, however,
    is on task execution and documentation, and not their role in decision support.
    Furthermore, unlike woodss, there is no implementation which allows direct linking
    to a GIS. On the other hand, there are many proposals for extending GIS to provide
    spatial decision support. These proposals can be roughly classified into (a) case
    study presentation, (b) model implementation and (c) architecture and system design.
    Approaches vary between considering a GIS as the spatial dss itself, to building
    or proposing a dss which will take advantage of data stored within a GIS. Case
    study presentations are centered on showing how the use of a GIS'' functions and
    cartographic display improves decision making in specific problems. The examples
    in Ref. [23]show how environmental problems often fall into a multi-criteria multi-objective
    situation, complicating the decision process. Other examples of case studies solved
    by extending GIS are found in Refs. [13](evaluation of health risk awareness and
    assessment in the Philippines), [7](use in environmental study support), or [49](role
    in strategic policy analysis concerning the environment). Model implementation
    studies concern the building of tools that help spatial analysis studies within
    or in parallel to a GIS. This approach consists in “hardwiring” a set of models
    into a GIS for a given problem domain. As remarked by Ref. [28], the GIS will
    provide the database and interface component of the dss and the added module will
    contain the models. Examples are Refs. [46](tools which apply probabilistic Bayesian
    networks to combine geographic information), [15](application of expert systems
    to environmental planning), 24, 30(application of multi-criteria techniques to
    GIS tools for decision support), [12](facility location in an urban environment),
    [36](transportation planning) and [47](industrial siting). The three last studies
    are also examples of the growing work which integrates GIS and operations research
    for decision support. Even though helpful in understanding the variety of issues
    involved in spatial decision processes, these studies do not help the more general
    problem, namely, how to construct SDSS. woodss can be placed within this category.
    Examples of this type of research are the work of Refs. 1, 5(both of which propose
    a general architecture for environmental decision support), [27](which provides
    an analysis of the multiple roles of GIS in spatial decision support), [25](environment
    for group work) and [26](for collaborative environmental planning on the www).
    Except for this last work, which actually implemented a documentation and mediation
    system on the Web, the others present architectures without implementation. This
    is not to say that implementations do not exist. However, they are of limited
    scope, and usually do not take advantage of combining GIS facilities to decision
    support capabilities. The emphasis in Ref. [26], as opposed to woodss, is in the
    collaborative (discussion) issues involved in environmental planning, rather than
    on the modeling itself. From a functionality point of view, woodss approaches
    the work in Ref. [17]. The latter is based on the fact that modeling is one of
    the key activities necessary to solve a complex problem, and that therefore a
    system which supports modeling will enhance decision making activities. Their
    system is based on allowing users to define and simulate several types of models,
    and storing these models in a model base. The system is geared towards users who
    are able to understand equations, motivated by environmental modeling. A similar
    system is described in Ref. [44], in the context of environmental process modeling.
    The paper describes a computational environment for characterizing scientific
    modeling methods, in order to support representation, manipulation and evaluation
    of scientific concepts. Models are constructed in terms of R-structures (representation
    structures), which are abstract representations of a concept (similar to the concept
    of abstract data types). The dynamics of real world processes are modeled through
    sequences of R-structure instance transformations. These ideas were applied to
    building a computational modeling environment — Amazonia — which supports large
    scale hydrologic research. Finally, the work in Ref. [39]concentrates on building
    an object-oriented modelbase for environmental systems. This allows flexible model
    construction and enhances the possibility of smooth modelbase expansion. woodss,
    though based on the same premises as Refs. 17, 39, 44(i.e., considering model
    definition and documentation as central to a spatial dss), generalizes them by
    the following. ⋅ It is not restricted to users who understand mathematical models
    (or a specific GIS programming language), but also directed towards managers,
    planners and environmental scientists. ⋅ Its use of scientific workflows unifies
    activities of model specification and execution. Indeed, due to their nature,
    workflows act both as a documentation media (similar to the R-structures in Ref.
    [44]) and as executable entities (as in the models in Ref. [39]). ⋅ Rather than
    demanding that users always specify a model, it allows the construction of the
    model by capturing user interactionswith a GIS. Thus, it can both be used in a
    spatial dss sense (when pre-existing models are selected for execution) as well
    as a model construction tool (as in Ref. [39]). ⋅ Unlike all other approaches,
    it is integrated within a GIS context. Therefore, users can simulate their models
    directly on the GIS. Furthermore, woodss is loosely coupled to the GIS via the
    Monitor module. Thus, it can be used in other GIS environments, contingent on
    coding the interface between the GIS and the Monitor module. 7. Concluding remarks
    This paper presented woodss — an SDSS for an EMIS, whose goal is to help experts
    in the environmental area to solve their decision problems. woodss is centered
    on dynamically monitoring user activities in a GIS and documenting them using
    scientific workflows. Besides documenting decision processes on the fly, these
    workflows also constitute a means of progressively enriching the modelbase. They
    can be used to guide experts in solving analogous problems, or as partial solutions
    to a bigger problem, allowing a global view of the current state of a decision
    process, and helping to justify decisions. This is especially important in environmental
    planning, which involves a large volume of activities and data, and where decision
    making is primordially multi-participant. woodss was tested with real environmental
    data and applications for agri-environmental planning, for the state of São Paulo,
    Brazil. More specifically, it was used in constructing alternatives for implementing
    a soil erosion model, in a study of land suitability for sugar cane plantations
    (superficially described in Section 5) and in delimitation of conservation areas
    for sustainable agriculture. Some of the users involved in these applications
    did not know how to use the GIS, but adapted easily to the workflow representation.
    Among the basic characteristics that DSS should satisfy, and which are contemplated
    by woodss, we can cite: • To help users who have different kinds of knowledge
    and expertise. • To adapt to changes in computational environment and decision
    styles. • To offer an interactive user-friendly interface. • To support non linear
    executions, allowing users to give up or re-consider solution scenarios. • To
    facilitate the dynamic addition of new knowledge obtained from previous expertise.
    • To document decision and decision processes to justify decisions or re-use them
    in other processes. Ongoing work involves extensions to the implementation and
    extensions to the architecture of woodss. From an implementation point of view,
    extensions being explored involve building a Monitor module for another GIS and
    generalizing the WorkflowBase to accommodate dynamic constraints. The WorkflowBase
    must also be ported to a more sophisticated DBMS, in order to handle large data
    sets. From a theoretical point of view, the notion of metadata must be extended
    to accommodate geographic metadata standards (e.g., Ref. [19]) and enhance metadata
    indexing. Another important issue will be analyzing the use of woodss in other
    spatial decision support contexts (e.g., utility management or transportation).
    A possible extension would be to add an intelligent learning module to the monitor,
    to help detect work patterns and identifying, from user interactions with the
    GIS, already stored workflows. This will be approached using case-based reasoning.

    Abstract Water management in the Netherlands applies to a dense network of surface
    waters for discharge, storage and distribution, serving highly valuable land-use.
    National and regional water authorities develop long-term plans for sustainable
    water use and safety under changing climate conditions. The decisions about investments
    on adaptive measures are based on analysis supported by the Netherlands Hydrological
    Instrument NHI based on the best available data and state-of-the-art technology
    and developed through collaboration between national research institutes. The
    NHI consists of various physical models at appropriate temporal and spatial scales
    for all parts of the water system. Intelligent connectors provide transfer between
    different scales and fast computation, by coupling model codes at a deep level
    in software. A workflow and version management system guarantees consistency in
    the data, software, computations and results. The NHI is freely available to hydrologists
    via an open web interface that enables exchange of all data and tools. Graphical

    people living in the territory that is today the Netherlands have been both battling
    against and enjoying the benefits of water from the sea, the major rivers Rhine
    and Meuse, precipitation and seepage of groundwater (Van de Ven, 1993). As a result
    of their need to maintain habitable, arable and pasture land in deep, reclaimed
    polders close to the sea and in peaty areas around higher-lying sandy infiltration
    areas, a sophisticated water management system has evolved (Huisman et al., 1998).
    The economic developments over the last five centuries have resulted in a dense
    and highly efficient network of canalized rivers, large canals, lakes, local and
    regional water storage systems, dams, weirs and sluices, by means of which almost
    throughout the country, surface water can be manipulated in virtually any direction
    (Huisman et al., 1998). Nowadays, the surface water is managed according to whether
    there is a surplus or shortage of water, and in light of its salt content, nutrient
    load or temperature, the aim being to ensure optimal use with respect to safety,
    agriculture, nature, shipping, drinking water supply, cooling water for power
    plants, and recreation (Anonymous, 2009). The drought of 1976 focused national
    attention on water shortage and triggered the idea of constructing a national
    water modeling instrument (Abrahamse et al., 1982) for use in the Policy Analysis
    for Water in the Netherlands: PAWN (Pulles, 1985). Since then, PAWN has been regularly
    improved in light of the national water management plans, which have been published
    at intervals of 3–5 years. During periods of drought, PAWN has been used to optimize
    the distribution of water throughout the country. The distribution depends on
    the water availability, the type of demand (e.g. drinking water, agriculture,
    inland navigation, cooling) and on the transport capacity of the system. The actual
    water distribution is governed by consensus among the national and regional water
    managers. Around the year 2000, numerous regional and national models for both
    groundwater and surface water simulation existed that were based on different
    technologies, schematizations and data. The different models generated different
    results that had impact on the strategic and applied water management of national
    and regional authorities. In response to the problems arising from these different
    results, the scientific/technical and policy/water management communities in the
    Netherlands started activities to achieve consensus on technologies, schematizations
    and data. In 2005, the national research institutes and national and regional
    water authorities pooled their water expertise and finances (about 1M€/y) in order
    to construct and maintain an enhanced national water modeling instrument: the
    Netherlands Hydrological Instrument NHI (http://www.nhi.nu) (Van der Giessen,
    2005). After a significant effort to consolidate available data and technologies,
    a major consensus–driven activity started in 2010, which resulted in improvement
    of data, concepts and validation of results. In 2013, a consensus-based NHI was
    achieved, thanks to the cooperation of virtually all the national and regional
    water management organizations in the Netherlands. The cooperation of many parties
    in sharing different data and models has resulted in the development of appropriate
    tools and data management systems for both surface water and groundwater in the
    Netherlands. There are few comparable instruments for integrated water management
    and policy making issues. Compared with the NHI, however, those that do exist
    describe the water system less comprehensively, are less embedded in a sustainable
    data management system, or are not directly applied both to support long-term
    policy analysis and for daily water management during drought. For instance, (Højberg
    et al., 2013) presented an instrument for water management in Denmark, based on
    MIKE-SHE (Abbott et al., 1986a, Abbott et al., 1986b) and focus on the sustainable
    management of hydrogeological datasets that were built consensually by regional
    and national authorities. Another example is the model for climate change effects
    in the basin of the river Elbe (Hattermann et al., 2011). Unlike other comparable
    instruments, the NHI consists of five physically different models for different
    water domains with different concepts and different temporal and spatial scales
    that are explicitly connected using scaling, transformation, implicit iteration
    and single-to-many and many-to-single coupling. The chain from basic data to model
    data to results comprises differently-owned national and regional databases and
    is embedded in an appropriate data management system. In addition, all model data,
    results and software are intended to be open access and free of charge, while
    the costs of maintenance and development are intended to be shared by organizations
    representing all the water authorities in the Netherlands. This paper presents
    an overview of the NHI after its most recent overhaul and recent use in policy
    analysis for adaptive long-term measures to climate change. The overview starts
    by describing the five hydrological models. The connectors linking these models
    are described, together with the data management systems. An extensive set of
    results is presented, and their calibration and validation are described. The
    long-term management of the instrument and the impact of the NHI in the consensus
    on long-term decisions on adjusting the water system in light of climate change
    are discussed. The present work adds to the increased interest for multi-user,
    integrated models for water management e.g. under climate change conditions (Carmona
    et al., 2013, Hattermann et al., 2011, Højberg et al., 2013, Welsh et al., 2013)
    as well as to the development of open source modeling tools (Knapen et al., 2013,
    Werner et al., 2013, water.usgs.gov/ogw/modflow/MODFLOW.htm) and developments
    on open data (http://www.globalopendatainitiative.org). 2. The five hydrological
    models in the NHI 2.1. General description Typical aspects of subsurface and surface
    water in the Netherlands (see also Huisman et al., 1998) are sketched in Fig.
    1 together with the domains encompassed by the models of NHI. The surface water
    domain is classified at three levels of operation: at national level few large
    canals, rivers and lakes with large weirs are available to manage the major transport
    and storage capacity both during water surplus and shortage. The major resources
    of water are the river Rhine and the precipitation (850 mm/y) from the maritime
    climate. At regional level, a large number of intermediate surface water bodies
    provide regional water distribution. Along the coast in the west and north of
    the country sub-catchments consist of polders (reclaimed lakes) with abrupt changes
    of several meters in elevation at short distances. In the rest of the country,
    most of the brooks and streams have been canalized and seepage zones have been
    drained to improve the economic value of the land. At local scale, numerous dense
    drainage pipe systems and ditches operate as the major interaction with the groundwater
    domain. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. The water domains covered
    by the five hydrological models in NHI. The major groundwater domain consists
    of Pleistocene sands and is overlain by fluvial and marine Holocene peat and clay
    deposits in the lower-lying areas and by glacial and Aeolian sands in the higher
    areas. The ice-pushed ridges merely occurring in the center of the country, include
    steeply sloping layers that cause anisotropy in groundwater flow. In the south-eastern
    region, faults generate discontinuities in aquifers. The low-permeable base of
    the groundwater system rises from about 600 m below sea level in the north-west
    to the surface in the south-east. In a wide zone (50 km) along the entire west
    and north coast seawater intrusion in the past has caused a wide variation in
    the salt concentration of groundwater (Fig. 1). The vegetation on top of the groundwater
    system merely consists of crops and pasture with forest mainly in the higher areas
    and designated nature reserves mainly in the lower areas. Local relief affects
    the presence and amount of infiltration and seepage which, in turn, results in
    differences in the water quality in the root zone. A core task of the NHI national
    model is to optimize the distribution of water throughout the Netherlands during
    periods of shortage. This task is performed by the Surface Water model for Optimized
    Distribution (SWOD, Fig. 2) which comprises the main, national surface water system
    and the major regional surface waters. The water availability and demand from
    the hinterland is derived from the Surface Water model for Sub-Catchments (SWSC,
    Fig. 2) and are based on the water balance including surface water and sub-surface
    water. The sub-surface water flow is simulated by two models: the Soil Vegetation
    Atmosphere model for the Transfer of water (SVAT, Fig. 2) and the GroundWater
    (GW, Fig. 2) model. The model for Surface Water Flow and Transport (SWFT, Fig.
    2) computes changes in the salt concentration and temperature distribution of
    the surface water for operational water management under circumstances of water
    shortage. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. The relations between the
    five hydrological models in NHI, see text for abbreviations. The model ID''s used
    in the present paper (Table 1, column on left) are different from the names of
    operational models (Table 1, column on right) because the NHI is continuously
    being refined and improved to account for the best available standards in software
    and modeling concepts. Table 1. General characterization of the models in the

    processes and occurs at different spatial and temporal scales. The five models
    of NHI adapt to these differences by using different computational units (line,
    polygon, cell) and different scales (Table 2). To achieve NHI functioning as a
    single working system, connectors have been built to calculate temporal and spatial
    scaling of parameters and variables between the models (section 3 see below).

    model domains but in different ways. Transport of salt is computed in SWFT (1-D),
    SVAT (1-D) and GW (3-D), while SWOD and SWSC apply a salt balance approach. Computation
    of salt is fully integrated in SWOD, SWFT and SWSC and is calculated by additional
    models for SVAT and GW. The exchange of water between the five models enables
    a complete water balance to be derived for the entire country and for each region.
    Table 3 shows the major input and output flows between the models and across the
    national borders. A brief overview of each model is presented in the following
    sections. Table 3. Overview of input and output water flows and levels. ID Input

    level to SVAT; drainage discharge to SWSC 2.2. The model for optimized distribution
    of surface water SWOD The SWOD model allocates water on the basis of conditional
    optimization of the demands for water quantity and quality (salt and temperature)
    from various water users and the availability of water revealed by the water balance
    of groundwater and surface water computed by the SWSC model. The water distribution
    network of the Netherlands is schematized as a network of connected nodes, with
    maximum flows as constraints of the optimization model. The system allows for
    alternative routing of water, e.g. if the salt concentration of intake water is
    too high. The conditions in the optimization come from user priorities and distribution
    rules. At national level, the highest category of use is the maintaining of surface
    water levels to prevent irreversible damage, e.g. to dikes on peat land or to
    nature areas. The second category of use concerns the availability of surface
    water for drinking water and for cooling water for electricity generation. Categories
    3 and 4 contain the other water users such as agriculture, industry, navigation
    and recreation as formalized in regional water agreements. The optimization is
    done heuristically, allocating water first to the highest priority water users
    and then stepwise to lower priorities while accounting for discharge capacity
    limitations. Use of a formal optimization algorithm is foreseen in the near future.
    2.3. The model for surface water flow and transport SWFT The SWFT model computes
    changes in flows, water levels, salt concentrations and temperature in the national
    surface waters and is based on SOBEK, a package for 1D and 2D modeling of hydrodynamics,
    water quality, salt intrusion and morphology (http://www.deltares.nl/en/software-alg).
    The SWFT model incorporates branches, nodes and parameters of the national network
    of the SWOD model and of other existing SOBEK models from regional and national
    water authorities. The detailed, regional models have been scaled up for use at
    national level (Prinsen et al., 2013a). The SWFT model uses water allocation fluxes
    from the SWOD model. The results of SWFT are used to compute how changes in temperature,
    cooling water, water quality, salinization and water depth for navigation will
    impact on operational management during periods of water shortage and on policy
    analysis (Klijn et al., 2012). 2.4. The model for surface water in sub-catchments
    SWSC The distribution of surface water computed by the SWSC model is based on
    the water balance per sub-catchment, which includes groundwater fluxes from the
    GW model and precipitation and evaporation from the SVAT model. In the low-lying
    (coastal) area of the Netherlands, the polygons encompassing the sub-catchments
    follow the shape of the polders (flat areas in which target surface water levels
    are maintained); in the higher areas, the polygons are GIS-determined zones based
    on the national available shapes of local surface water catchments. The routing
    of water across sub-catchments consists of discharge-level relationships for the
    regional surface waters in hilly regions and volume within time step in the polder
    regions. The water demand and allocation volumes per time step are calculated
    to provide constant water levels, flushing and abstraction for drinking water,
    industrial use and sprinkler irrigation. The salt concentration of the surface
    water is computed per time step from the salt loads and water volumes of surface
    water and groundwater. The SWSC model combines all relevant salt loads; from the
    surface water in the national distribution network, from shallow groundwater discharged
    by tile drains and ditches, and from the deeper groundwater exfiltrating through
    boils (De Louw et al., 2010). 2.5. The model for soil–vegetation–atmosphere water
    transfers SVAT The SVAT model computes the vertical water transfers in a column
    between saturated groundwater and the atmosphere, via root zone and vegetation.
    The evapotranspiration is modeled with a crop coefficient approach, including
    interception evaporation, plant transpiration and soil evaporation (Van Walsum
    and Supit, 2012). The flow in the unsaturated zone is based on the Richards concept
    for 1D uniform flow, as yet not accounting for hysteresis, preferential flow or
    cracks. A meta model (MetaSWAP, Van Walsum and Groenendijk, 2008) is used to reduce
    the computational effort needed in NHI to much less than required when applying
    a classical Richards type column model (SWAP, Kroes et al., 2008). The partial
    differential equation of Richards equation is replaced by two ordinary differential
    equations; one for the variations in the vertical column (using the steady state
    flow equation) and the other for the variations in time. At pre-set time steps
    in the calculation process, the separate solutions are combined in the final result.
    The steady-state solution comprises a database of pre-computed profiles of the
    water saturation at discrete intervals of soil moisture status and depth to the
    groundwater level covering the full range of possible situations by smart combinations.
    These profiles are used in a non-steady model by conversion into up to 18 aggregation
    boxes, starting with the root zone and ending with a box extending into the saturated
    groundwater. The meta model computes through time by means of a ‘quasi-steady’
    state concept that uses the available profiles in the database flexibly in such
    a way that each box has its own dynamics, with varying intensity of the vertical
    flux (percolation or capillary rise). The boxes are linked as a chain of reservoirs.
    At the pre-set time steps in the calculation process, each stage of saturation
    is updated at the aggregation level of the boxes. Via a reversal of the aggregation
    procedure, the associated detailed saturation profiles are derived from the database
    to calculate the moisture stress factor needed for the computing the actual transpiration
    that is fed back into the aggregated model. The detailed profiles are also used
    in the additional salt model (section 2.1) and in water quality modeling (section
    9). The soil of the Netherlands is characterized by 72 units given in Wösten et
    al. (2013). The meta concept has been verified for these soil units by comparing
    the results of non-steady state simulations to the results of the SWAP model from
    which the meta concept has been derived (Van Walsum and Van der Bolt, 2013). 2.6.
    Model for saturated groundwater GW The GW model computes semi-3D (Strack, 1984)
    flow in a model with 1.6 M cells of 250 × 250 m, using MODFLOW 2005 (http://water.usgs.gov/nrp/gwsoftware/modflow2005/modflow2005.html).
    Seven aquifers and aquitards represent the more than fifty hydrogeological layers
    distinguished in the national hydrogeological database REGIS (http://www2.dinoloket.nl/nl/about/modellen/regis.html).
    Large amounts for drinking water and industry are abstracted from the deeper aquifers,
    while sprinkler irrigation mainly comes from the upper aquifers. The surface water
    levels in the GW model are adjusted by the SWSC model during the NHI''s computations.
    The phreatic storage coefficient, phreatic head and flux to or from the unsaturated
    zone are determined during iteration (section 3) with the SVAT model. Groundwater
    discharges from and to surface water change during seasons and, in terms of boundary
    conditions, can be highly non-linear with respect to differences between the levels
    of groundwater and surface water. Surface water networks in the country vary from
    densely-distributed discharge systems (including tile drains) to extensive systems
    that fall dry during summer. After being classified (mainly by wet perimeter),
    these different discharge systems are translated into a set of parameter values
    in the RIVER package of MODFLOW by using a uniform upscaling procedure (De Lange,
    1999, De Lange, 1996). A separate version of the GW model computes full-3D variable-density
    groundwater flow and coupled salt transport. To account for groundwater density
    effects, this model contains forty layers instead of seven (e.g., Oude Essink,
    2001, Oude Essink et al., 2010). The model is currently being overhauled; this
    entails transfer to a SEAWAT setting (Langevin and Guo, 2006) and extension to
    parallel computation e.g. of temporal changes in the density (salt) distribution.
    3. The connectors between the hydrological models 3.1. Technical description The
    data shared between the models described in section 2 are exchanged by connectors
    as presented in Table 4, in which the terminology applies to the hydrological
    purpose of the models. Each connector is specific to the two adjacent models it
    links and, in some cases, also to the direction of the transfer. Many connectors
    include data transformation by simple or complex calculations that can be both
    a many-to-one combination of data and a change of data type (line, polygon, cell).
    The connectors provide spatial and temporal scaling and maintain consistency of
    fluxes and heads between the models. In effect, they form the “intelligence” of
    the NHI by describing our physical understanding of how the different hydrological
    systems act and are connected. Table 4. Description of connectors between the
    hydrological models. Connector Concept of connection Coupling level Exchange variables

    head is a function of recharge and phreatic storage, and recharge/storage is a
    function of phreatic head Internal iteration (Picard) GW to SVAT: Phreatic head
    None SVAT to GW: unsaturated-to-saturated flux, storage coefficient An example
    is the connector between the SVAT and GW models (Van Walsum and Veldhuizen, 2011),
    with the phreatic head as a ‘shared state variable’ for providing a seamless integration
    of two models. The basic idea is that the phreatic head is updated alternately
    by the SVAT model and the GW model. In the implementation of the method, the SVAT
    model prepares its update of the GW model by first computing an unsaturated-to-saturated
    flux and also a non-linear storage-head relationship; together they form a non-linear
    boundary condition of the third kind for the GW model. This boundary condition
    is then used in a within-time-step iteration to a single head at the phreatic
    surface in both models, while exchanging the variables summarized in Table 4.
    The basic principle in the software code behind the connectors is that a single,
    main driver program is used, in which all connectors are managed. Each model code
    (section 2) is split into parts (initialization, do time step, do iteration, finalize,
    etc.), similar to what occurs in the code of HECRAS-MODFLOW (Fenske et al., 2008).
    This splitting at the deepest level in software enables the complex computation
    process to be managed in great detail. It supports understanding of the numerical
    and physical processes within the NHI as a whole. The splitting also enables connectors
    and model codes to be updated independently. A few minor adjustments are needed
    for the software to comply with the Open-MI standard (Gregersen et al., 2007).
    3.2. Operation of connectors during water allocation in periods of scarcity A
    major task of connections in the NHI is to transfer and translate data throughout
    all models when calculating water demand and water allocation (and salt concentrations)
    during a period of water scarcity (Fig. 3). The water demands are specified either
    as pre-described input (e.g., a timetable of desired lake water levels, or desired
    discharges for flushing to combat salt intrusion) to the SWOD model, or are computed
    by the SWSC model interacting with the SVAT model and GW model. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Connectors transferring water demand and allocation (green
    and blue arrows) in periods of water scarcity. From a computational point of view,
    the demand and allocation come down to modeling a non-linear process of interactions
    in groundwater and surface water. The national distribution or allocation (Fig.
    3, green arrows) follows from the water demand in all sub-catchments in the country
    (Fig. 3, blue arrow). The water demand per sub-catchment (SWSC, Fig. 3) is compared
    with the water volume available through the distribution network (SWOD, Fig. 3),
    taking into account the available surface water and groundwater and the needs
    of the users in each sub-catchment. If there is a shortage of fresh water, the
    water allocation is optimized (Fig. 3, green arrows) while accounting for the
    demands of different user categories (section 2.2). The optimization occurs in
    a decade time period, which is 10 days, except for the last period of each month,
    which ranges from 8 to 11 days. The scaling to 36 decades per year generates acceptable
    computation times and enables a water balance approach to be used instead of a
    full-scale 1D surface water flow model. 4. Data and workflow management The data
    sets involved are usually very large. Many developers and users work with these
    tools, and all have their own field of interest. In order to manage all the activities
    consistently, it is essential to have a version management system for the data
    and computer codes. All the tools in this system have been constructed to perform
    well with very large data sets. The basic principle of the data management in
    the NHI is to decouple data in files into metadata and bulk data. The metadata
    is stored in SubVersion (Collins-Sussman et al., 2004) and the bulk data is stored
    read-only in a file server that is reachable by the File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
    The metadata describes the file content and the file access protocol and location.
    The data management system is schematized in Fig. 4. The workflow management tool
    is based on the open software VisTrails (Bavoil and Callahan, 2005) and applies
    to all activities in the schematization phase and the post-processing (Fig. 4).
    The actions performed in the run phase are formalized in a Python run script.
    This combined workflow tool is integrated with the new version control tool called
    FileSync, which handles all data in the run phase, the schematization phase and
    the post-processing phase. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Data flow
    and management in the NHI. Access to the input and output data of the NHI is open
    and free to any person after registration. The access (purple area in Fig. 4)
    consists of a Web-based viewer directly linked to an OpenDAP (Cornillon et al.,
    2003) server with a (one-way) link to the NHI data. On the OpenDAP server the
    NetCDF (Rew and Davis, 1990) file format is used, following the Climate Forecast
    convention (Gregory, 2003). 5. Pre and post-processing Pre-processing tools produce
    model-specific input data from data in external databases (Fig. 4, green box).
    Major external databases comprise data on daily weather, land use (e.g. agriculture),
    surface water levels, topography and land elevation, subsoil type and abstractions.
    A key pre-processing tool is used to compute the parameters in the interaction
    between surface water and groundwater in the GW model. Certain model input (e.g.
    surface water level, drainage parameters) are used in several models and require
    different transformation for the different models. Post-processing tools (Fig.
    4, box on lower right) transform the results into formats for visualization and
    interpretation. Recently, Delft-FEWS (http://www.deltares.nl/en/software/479962/delft-fews)
    has been applied to analyze the results of the NHI in support of national, strategic
    decisions to adapt the water management system for climate changes (Prinsen et
    al., 2013b). Post-processing models have been developed for the same application
    to assess the cost and benefit for agriculture (Ruijgh and Kroon, 2014) and the
    impact on nature (Haasnoot and Van de Wolfshaar, 2009). During periods of water
    shortage, Delft-FEWS is used to obtain daily predictions of levels of groundwater
    and surface water that are used to support operational decisions on national water
    distribution. 6. Sharing data with stakeholders Since its inception in 2006, a
    major aim of the NHI has been to achieve stakeholder participation. The national
    government, regional water authorities, drinking water companies and the participating
    research institutes have supported the development of NHI both financially and
    in kind, with the aim of achieving a set of sustainable data and state-of-the-art
    tools for use nationally and regionally. In 2011 and 2012, significant effort
    was put into the exchange of knowledge on concepts and data in surface water and
    groundwater models, in order to secure regional consensus about the national instrument.
    Workshops were given, and were attended by hydrologists from almost all the water-related
    organizations in the Netherlands. The consensus-generating process will be repeated
    periodically. As a result of discussions during the workshops, it has been agreed
    that the responsibility for keeping input data up to date should be set at the
    lowest possible organizational level (local, regional or national). At national
    level, consistency is maintained in the entire process of model building. Below,
    we give some examples of data sharing with stakeholders from the consensus process
    sketched above, grouped per model in the NHI. The SWFT model has been expanded
    to the major regional surface water systems, which are based on the existing calibrated
    regional models of the water authorities. The aim of all parties is to derive
    a consistent set of national and regional schematizations by using consensus-based
    transformation (e.g. scaling, condensing) procedures. The representation of sub-catchments
    in the SWSC model has been improved with input from the field hydrologists of
    the water authorities. The priorities for water usage in sub-catchments during
    drought are specified by regional water authorities and are used directly in the
    SWOD model. The SVAT model has been improved by field hydrologists visually inspecting
    maps of input data region by region. Farmers have been recognized as stakeholders
    by incorporating into the model the status of agricultural land-use (including
    the presence of drainage pipes and information on sprinkling) from a statutory
    annual internet-based survey of farmers. Participation in the survey is mandatory,
    prescribed by laws on national environmental responsibilities. The GW model has
    been compared with existing calibrated regional groundwater models, each built
    by different groups of stakeholders. To deal with existing differences in the
    number of aquifers and aquitards, tools (www.imod.nu/downloads/Deltares_Flyer_NL.pdf)
    have been developed as part of the national Groundwater Model Data Base GMDB (www.gmdb.nhi.nu),
    in which all models used in the comparison are stored and can be visually compared.
    For the national schematization, regional and national geohydrologists have determined
    the best available parameter values and extents of layers based on comparison
    at the finest distinction of hydrogeological units from the REGIS national hydrogeological
    database (see section 2.6). Large abstractions are administered by authorities
    and drinking water companies; this entails the issuing of statutory permits. Their
    locations and abstraction rates are made available in the GMDB, insofar as they
    are needed by the GW model. 7. Calibration and validation In 2012, a limited number
    of parameters on the interaction between surface water and groundwater in version
    3.0 of the NHI were manually calibrated, to represent the dry year of 2003 as
    a typical dry year with known operational water management. It is not yet possible
    to calibrate by parameter optimization of the entire modeling system, but ideas
    have been advanced on how to do so, and expert meetings have been held on the
    topic. Automatic calibration of all parameters in the NHI is a huge task and will
    require expertise from many. At present, calibrated model data in the NHI come
    from existing regional models and apply merely to the surface water schematization
    in the SWFT model. Experience gained from calibrations in the regional groundwater
    models (e.g., parameter values and extents of separating layers) has been used
    to improve the consensus data set in the GMDB (section 6), which is used directly
    in the NHI. Each major release of the NHI national model is validated against
    measurements selected from a period of 15 years that includes extremely wet and
    dry years. These comprise fluxes measured at about 25 sites in the main surface
    water system and 45 sites in regional surface waters and measurements of the phreatic
    surface and heads in deeper aquifers at thousands of locations. For about 20 sites,
    measurements of salt distributions in surface water are used in the validation.
    National and regional experts on integrated water management have set up a benchmark
    (Kroon and Ruijgh, 2011) that gives the permissible percentages of deviations
    allowed between the measured and computed values of a major output variables used
    for national policy making, such as surface water discharges, water deficit in
    the root zone during drought, typical highs and lows in the phreatic heads, and
    salt concentrations in surface water in the coastal zone. The NHI national model
    of 2013 does not entirely satisfy the benchmark for two recent years (2003 and
    2006) with significant periods of drought (Hoogewoud et al., 2013). However, it
    has been accepted for use in national policy analysis, largely as a result of
    involving stakeholders and experts in building a consensus input dataset. The
    recent policy analysis in the Netherlands (Klijn et al., 2012) is mainly intended
    to predict water demand in future scenarios under climate change conditions. It
    was found that a limited number of output variables accounts for the decisions
    and are computed sufficiently accurate for policy decisions to be made (Marchand
    and De Lange, 2013). 8. Overview of output of the NHI In Fig. 5 we present different
    types of results in three different regions, selected from nationwide covers of
    the 2013 version of NHI. These results are applied in national policy making as
    described in section 9. The description follows the four panes (A, B, C, D) shown
    in Fig. 5. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Overview of results of
    the NHI, in four panes: A) water balance of subcatchments and main surface waters,
    B) salt in surface water system, C) fluxes and heads in unsaturated and saturated
    groundwater, D) salt concentration in saturated groundwater and salt flux to surface
    water. Detailed description in section 8. 8.1. Upper left corner Between the nodes
    in the distribution network for this region (map on right, bold nodes and lines)
    of the SWFT and SWOD models, the surface water fluxes over time are calculated
    in accordance with the water balance (top-left figure). The light blue (dotted)
    line in the lower left figure represents the calculated surface water flux in
    2003 and the black line represents the measured fluxes. Each node in the network
    is connected to a group of sub-catchments (map on right, groups of sub-catchments
    in shades of blue, linked by light arrows to and from a bold node). In each sub-catchment,
    the water balance (top left-hand figure, mm/day water averaged over the entire
    area) is evaluated, resulting in water allocation in response to the water demand
    and taking account of groundwater seepage (pane C). 8.2. Upper right corner The
    transport of salt is computed in the surface water network (left-hand figure,
    colored lines). The chloride concentration in the surface water is calculated
    in each sub-catchment (right-hand figure, colored domains) from the salt balance
    in the surface water and includes salt from groundwater seepage (pane D). 8.3.
    Lower left corner The water volume per sub-catchment allocated by the SWOD and
    SWSC models is distributed per 250 × 250 m cell as presented in the top grid (cover
    1). Major components in the water balance per cell are (top – down order in pane
    C): The water demand (cover 2) for agriculture comes from the soil water deficit
    for crops and other vegetation calculated by the SVAT model, and includes the
    evapotranspiration (cover 3). The surface water is fed by groundwater seepage
    (cover 4) and drainage (cover 5) computed by the GW model, which supplies the
    flux across the upper aquitard (cover 6) and head distribution (cover 7) to the
    connector between the SVAT and GW models. 8.4. Lower right corner In each sub-catchment,
    the chloride concentration of the surface waters (pane B) and the flux and concentration
    of the groundwater seepage (middle cover) result in the salt load (top cover)
    in kg/ha. The groundwater seepage comes from direct flow into ditches as well
    as from leachate into drains in the unsaturated zone. The salt concentration in
    the groundwater model is described by a fully 3D distribution (bottom figure)
    based on approximately 65,000 measurements. 9. Discussion The NHI serves two major
    aims, the first being a model for long-term national policy making and real-time
    forecasting for daily water management (Berendrecht et al., 2009), the second
    being a state-of-the-art toolbox and a source of sustainably managed data available
    for all hydrologists in the Netherlands. Although developed for the Netherlands,
    the experience, tools and management system are considered valuable for many applications
    in other parts of the world. The national model for policy analysis by the Dutch
    government has been developed according to the four phases in DTAP: Development
    – Testing – Acceptance – Production (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development,_testing,_acceptance_and_production).
    In practice, this means that computations are carried out only with the tested
    and accepted version that runs in a separate production environment. This was
    found to be important for stable and continuous computations of runs that may
    take up to several weeks of computation time using parallel computing and that
    generate several terabytes of output data each run. The applications described
    in this paper are examples of integrated water system analysis. As a first example,
    the national model computes all the hydrological effects that are needed for post-processing
    tools that translate these results for use in cost – benefit analysis for agriculture,
    shipping, cooling water, etc. (Fig. 5, left-hand side). A second example is the
    assessment of the effects of climate change on salt intrusion in surface water
    as well as in groundwater. The NHI computes the salt load on the water system
    and the subsoil, which can be translated into the effects on the availability
    of fresh water for drinking water, irrigation, natural vegetation, etc. (Fig.
    5, right-hand side). A third example is the application for operational water
    management during water scarcity, by using Delft-FEWS to obtain daily predictions
    of heads and fluxes in groundwater and surface water. Output – in terms of fluxes
    per layer – of the NHI national model is planned to be used in models for the
    leaching of nutrients (Wolf et al., 2003) and pesticides (Tiktak et al., 2012,
    Tiktak et al., 2002) to the groundwater and surface waters. The purpose of these
    models is to support policy evaluation and pesticide registration. The connectors,
    the version management system, the workflow and data management (section 3) and
    the model codes (section 2) can be seen as a set of tools that can also be applied
    in less complex situations and with smaller datasets. The use of different model
    codes enables the physically relevant processes to be modeled at appropriate scales.
    The smart operations between model codes by the connectors, including the scaling
    in time and space, can also be used in combination with other model codes available
    elsewhere. In addition, the model codes in The NHI will soon become open-access
    software, which will enable universities to participate in the development of
    the NHI by supplying state-of-the-art technology and will also allow commercial
    users to provide feedback that can be applied to improve NHI''s applicability.
    The experience of sharing data with stakeholders (section 6) has shown that when
    jointly building an integrated model instrument, it is crucial for regional and
    national water authorities to have the same focus and share the same challenge
    at all levels of water management. The development of joint rules for the upscaling
    of surface water schematizations has enabled one-to-one comparison of results
    from regional models and the national model. In addition, the boundary conditions
    of regional models have been improved on the basis of the two-sided consistency
    of the national model at these boundaries. The result of the collaboration is
    a tool for comparing groundwater models with different schematizations and different
    numbers of aquifers. Using this tool, calibrated results from regional models
    have been translated into improvements in the national model. Consensus on the
    schematization and parameterization of the subsoil has been obtained successfully
    by open discussion between experts. 10. Concluding remarks We have presented an
    overview of a comprehensive instrument that is the outcome of 35 years of development
    and collaboration between water-related governmental and private organizations.
    Given the support of the water authorities in the Netherlands, it is envisioned
    that the NHI will become the hydrological instrument and toolbox (tools and data)
    for model-based solutions to surface water and groundwater issues at national,
    regional and local scale. Many aspects of the NHI have only been mentioned briefly
    in the present paper and will be elaborated in future publications. Acknowledgments
    The present team acknowledges that the NHI is the product of 35 years of developing
    tools and gathering data for integrated water management, including groundwater,
    in the Netherlands. We thank all our predecessors for their essential contribution
    to the present NHI. We acknowledge the former project leaders Bennie Minnema,
    Judith Snepvangers and Neno Kukuric (formerly TNO) for their vision and enthusiasm
    in bringing the NHI significant steps forward. We are grateful to a large group
    of specialists who supported the development of the NHI over a long period. In
    particular, we thank Rien Pastoors (formerly RIVM), Anton van der Giessen, Aaldrik
    Tiktak (PBL), Jan van Bakel (formerly Alterra) for their support in different,
    crucial aspects. We thank our present colleagues Bernhard Becker, Perry de Louw,
    Erik Ruijgh and Toine Vergroesen (Deltares) and Frank van der Bolt (Alterra) for
    their significant support to the present version of the NHI. The authors'' editor

    \ integrated carbon observation and anal-\nysis system is needed to improve the\
    \ fundamental under-\nstanding of the global carbon cycle, to improve our ability\
    \ to\nproject future changes, and to verify the effectiveness of poli-\ncies aiming\
    \ to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase\ncarbon sequestration. Building\
    \ an integrated carbon obser-\nvation system requires transformational advances\
    \ from the\nexisting sparse, exploratory framework towards a dense, ro-\nbust,\
    \ and sustained system in all components: anthropogenic\nemissions, the atmosphere,\
    \ the ocean, and the terrestrial bio-\nsphere. The paper is addressed to scientists,\
    \ policymakers,\nand funding agencies who need to have a global picture of the\n\
    current state of the (diverse) carbon observations. We identify\nthe current state\
    \ of carbon observations, and the needs and\nnotional requirements for a global\
    \ integrated carbon observa-\ntion system that can be built in the next decade.\
    \ A key conclu-\nsion is the substantial expansion of the ground-based obser-\n\
    vation networks required to reach the high spatial resolution\nfor CO2 and CH4\
    \ ﬂuxes, and for carbon stocks for address-\ning policy-relevant objectives, and\
    \ attributing ﬂux changes\nto underlying processes in each region. In order to\
    \ establish\nﬂux and stock diagnostics over areas such as the southern\noceans,\
    \ tropical forests, and the Arctic, in situ observations\nwill have to be complemented\
    \ with remote-sensing measure-\nments. Remote sensing offers the advantage of\
    \ dense spatial\ncoverage and frequent revisit. A key challenge is to bring\n\
    remote-sensing measurements to a level of long-term consis-\ntency and accuracy\
    \ so that they can be efﬁciently combined\nin models to reduce uncertainties,\
    \ in synergy with ground-\nbased data. Bringing tight observational constraints\
    \ on fossil\nfuel and land use change emissions will be the biggest chal-\nlenge\
    \ for deployment of a policy-relevant integrated carbon\nobservation system. This\
    \ will require in situ and remotely\nsensed data at much higher resolution and\
    \ density than cur-\nrently achieved for natural ﬂuxes, although over a small\
    \ land\narea (cities, industrial sites, power plants), as well as the in-\nclusion\
    \ of fossil fuel CO2 proxy measurements such as ra-\ndiocarbon in CO2 and carbon-fuel\
    \ combustion tracers. Addi-\ntionally, a policy-relevant carbon monitoring system\
    \ should\nalso provide mechanisms for reconciling regional top-down\n(atmosphere-based)\
    \ and bottom-up (surface-based) ﬂux esti-\nmates across the range of spatial and\
    \ temporal scales rele-\nvant to mitigation policies. In addition, uncertainties\
    \ for each\nobservation data-stream should be assessed. The success of\nthe system\
    \ will rely on long-term commitments to monitor-\ning, on improved international\
    \ collaboration to ﬁll gaps in the\ncurrent observations, on sustained efforts\
    \ to improve access\nto the different data streams and make databases interopera-\n\
    ble, and on the calibration of each component of the system\nto agreed-upon international\
    \ scales.\n1\nIntroduction\nGlobal mean atmospheric levels of CO2 have increased\
    \ by\n40 % from about 280 ppm in pre-industrial times (Etheridge\net al., 1996)\
    \ to 393.6 ppm by the end of 2012 (WMO,\n2010; Dlugokencky and Tans, 2012). Levels\
    \ of CH4 reached\n1813 ± 2 ppb in 2011 (WMO, 2012), nearly 2.5 times their\npre-industrial\
    \ value of 700 ppb (Etheridge et al., 1996). The\nincrease of CO2 and CH4 is caused\
    \ by fossil fuel combus-\ntion and land use change. The primary anthropogenic\
    \ CH4\nemissions are leaks from natural gas extraction and distribu-\ntion, the\
    \ oil industry and coal extraction, livestock and rice\npaddies, landﬁlls and\
    \ human-caused biomass burning (Den-\nman et al., 2007). Natural emissions of\
    \ CH4 are dominated\nby wetlands and lakes, with smaller contributions from geo-\n\
    logical natural venting, wildﬁres, and termites.\nBiogeosciences, 11, 3547–3602,\
    \ 2014\nwww.biogeosciences.net/11/3547/2014/\nP. Ciais et al.: Current systematic\
    \ carbon-cycle observations\n3549\nFossil fuel emissions increased at a rate of\
    \ 3.1 % per year\nover the last decade (Le Quéré et al., 2013). Rates of land\n\
    use change CO2 emissions have slightly declined in the past\ndecade (Friedlingstein\
    \ et al., 2010).\nEmission reduction programs are developed in support\nof international\
    \ agreements, such as United Nations Frame-\nwork Convention on Climate Change\
    \ (UNFCCC). Yet, an-\nthropogenic emissions of CO2 and CH4 estimated from in-\n\
    ventories cannot be validated by independent observations.\nThe ability of nations,\
    \ provinces, and local municipalities to\nimplement policies that reduce emissions\
    \ or create sinks of\nCO2 and CH4 (de Richter and Caillol, 2011; Kucharczyk,\n\
    2011; Stolaroff et al., 2012) will partly depend upon their\nability to measure\
    \ progress, and evaluate effectiveness of na-\ntional and sub-national actions.\
    \ Uncertainties in inventories\nneed to be dramatically reduced to support effective\
    \ poli-\ncies. To date, efforts to monitor and report emissions of CO2\nand CH4\
    \ have been based mostly on limited large-scale, sub-\nsampled land use observations,\
    \ self-reported data on land and\nenergy use, and extrapolated emission factor\
    \ measurements.\nThese data have uncertainties that limit their ability to sup-\n\
    port greenhouse management strategies (e.g. Schulze et al.,\n2009). For instance,\
    \ even in developed nations where uncer-\ntainties in annual fossil CO2 emissions\
    \ are ∼ 5 % (Andres\net al., 2012), the total uncertainty associated with those\
    \ esti-\nmates over multiple years exceed the magnitude of the trends\ndeﬁned\
    \ as the target of emission reduction policies (e.g. the\nKyoto Protocol target\
    \ set by EU15 members of a collective\nreduction of 8 % of during 2008–2012 of\
    \ their emissions be-\nlow the 1990 level; EEA, 2009, p. 9).\nImproved scientiﬁc\
    \ understanding of the carbon cycle is\na critical foundation to providing policy-relevant\
    \ informa-\ntion regarding climate change mitigation and adaptation in\nthree\
    \ ways: (1) by providing understanding of the processes\ncontrolling the carbon\
    \ cycle to estimate ex ante the likely\nimpacts of implementation the greenhouse\
    \ gas (GHG) man-\nagement strategies, (2) by informing the construction of an\n\
    accurate baseline of GHG ﬂuxes and carbon stocks against\nwhich climate policies\
    \ can be evaluated, and (3) by monitor-\ning the variability and long-term trends\
    \ of GHG ﬂuxes over\neach region ex post assessment of the efﬁcacy of mitigation\n\
    policies (most of which span decades).\nAnthropogenic emissions would need to\
    \ be measured not\nonly for global annual totals but also for their spatiotemporal\n\
    distribution. Timely delivery of such information is critical\nfor policy. For\
    \ example, Reduced Emissions from Deforesta-\ntion and Degradation (UN-REDD, 2008)\
    \ projects under the\nUNFCCC have been held back due to technical and institu-\n\
    tional barriers, with one analysis suggesting that only 3 out of\n99 tropical\
    \ countries have the capacity to produce good qual-\nity forest area change and\
    \ forest inventories (Herold, 2009).\nAs an example, Panama’s deforestation would\
    \ need to in-\ncrease by 50 % in absolute value before it could be detected\n\
    by the current national capability (Pelletier et al., 2011). The\nscope of climate\
    \ policies will have a signiﬁcant impact on the\ndesign details of the monitoring\
    \ system and their costs. Issues\nof economies of scale, i.e. single country or\
    \ even projects\nversus a global system, and economies of scope generated\nby\
    \ constellations of monitoring systems are crucial determi-\nnants of choice (Böttcher\
    \ et al., 2009).\nNatural ﬂuxes need to be measured in order to un-\nderstand\
    \ the mechanisms controlling atmospheric concen-\ntrations. Globally, natural\
    \ land and ocean sinks have ab-\nsorbed 56 ± 6 % of CO2 from anthropogenic emissions\
    \ since\n1959 (Ciais et al., 2013). Regionally, ocean gyres and sub-\ncontinental\
    \ ﬂuxes can be either sources or sinks of CO2. At\nsynoptic scales, the uncertainty\
    \ of natural ﬂuxes is as large\nas their mean value (NRC, 2010; Denman et al.,\
    \ 2007). The\nglobal growth rate of CO2 exhibits interannual ﬂuctuations\nthat\
    \ reﬂect climate-induced changes in terrestrial (mainly\ntropical) ecosystem ﬂuxes\
    \ (Le Quèrè et al., 2009; Alden\net al., 2010). Regionally, interannual variability\
    \ of ocean\nﬂuxes can also be signiﬁcant, for example, in the tropical\nPaciﬁc\
    \ and the North Atlantic (Watson et al., 2009; Feely\net al., 1999). This interannual\
    \ variability of ﬂuxes requires\nlonger time series of atmospheric measurements\
    \ to detect\nslow changes in CO2 and CH4 emissions and sinks. The cur-\nrent state\
    \ of research-based observations can neither conﬁ-\ndently account for regional\
    \ ﬂuxes that control the CO2 and\nCH4 average growth rate nor their interannual\
    \ changes.\nMaking accurate future projections requires a quantiﬁca-\ntion of\
    \ the history of ecosystems’ carbon pools and their\nlikely changes in response\
    \ to business as usual (BAU) human\nbehavior and climate policy interventions.\
    \ Further, changes\nin the role of the ocean as a global sink for atmospheric\
    \ CO2\ncan have huge consequences for greenhouse gas (GHG) man-\nagement, so that\
    \ monitoring ocean ﬂuxes, and their changes\nin response to climate, is also a\
    \ key for making accurate fu-\nture projections.\nThe RECCAP (REgional Carbon\
    \ Cycle Assessment and\nProcesses) project (Canadell et al., 2011) attempts to\
    \ recon-\ncile bottom-up and top-down ﬂux estimates. However, it also\nexposed\
    \ large data gaps and uncertainties that prevent cur-\nrent systems from delivering\
    \ information to support climate\npolicies or to resolve carbon–climate feedbacks.\
    \ Unlike other\nemission reduction efforts, such as the 1987 Montreal proto-\n\
    col, reducing CO2 and CH4 emissions will have to involve\nmany economic sectors\
    \ of society. It will also require many\ndecades of sustained effort (Pacala and\
    \ Socolow, 2004), and\nsufﬁcient spatial resolution to be able to monitor and\
    \ man-\nage impacts resulting from speciﬁc governmental policies.\nLarge-scale,\
    \ non-carbon emission reductions in the past have\nall required some approach\
    \ to monitoring and veriﬁcation\nto ensure that the desired outcomes are achieved\
    \ (e.g. mea-\nsurements of pH in lakes and rain for sulfur emission reduc-\ntion;\
    \ measurements of ozone and ozone-depleting gases for\nstratospheric ozone recovery;\
    \ and measurements of ozone,\nreactive gases and particulate matter for regional\
    \ air quality\nimprovement). However, the global scale of the problem, the\nnatural\
    \ and anthropogenic components, the many sources of\nwww.biogeosciences.net/11/3547/2014/\n\

    \ carbon-cycle observations\ncarbon and other GHGs, and links to many sectors\
    \ of the\neconomy make independent monitoring and veriﬁcation of\nthe effectiveness\
    \ of GHG management strategies a necessary\nalbeit daunting task. Thus, the ability\
    \ to measure GHG ﬂuxes\nand carbon pools at high spatial and temporal resolution\
    \ is\nfundamental to making this task tractable.\nLast, it is possible that continued\
    \ climate change driven\nby GHG emissions could cause CO2 and CH4 losses from\n\
    natural ecosystems, acting as positive feedbacks on climate\nchange. These feedbacks\
    \ could become particularly intense.\nA detailed spatially resolved observing\
    \ system with the ca-\npacity of accurate monitoring of trends or abnormal vari-\n\
    ability in CO2 or CH4 ﬂuxes, and changes in carbon stor-\nage, could be used in\
    \ an “early warning” mode to detect\n“hotspots” and to guide adaptation planning.\
    \ Observations\nwith particular emphasis over sensitive regions of the global\n\
    carbon cycle (permafrost, tropical forests, North Atlantic and\nsouthern oceans\
    \ where deep water formation occurs) are thus\nessential to improve our knowledge\
    \ of carbon-cycle feed-\nbacks.\nThis paper describes the current state of research-based\n\
    carbon observations (Sect. 3) and a strategy for a globally in-\ntegrated carbon-cycle\
    \ monitoring system (Sect. 4) designed\nto make possible the estimation of the\
    \ distribution of CO2\nand CH4 ﬂuxes with sufﬁcient accuracy to assess natural\
    \ pro-\ncesses and human intervention. In addition, the monitoring\nsystem will\
    \ be able to assess the spatial and temporal distri-\nbution of fossil fuel and\
    \ land use related emissions to support\nthe veriﬁcation of emission reduction\
    \ at national and regional\nscales, while linking them back to global emission\
    \ quantities\nand growth in atmospheric CO2 and CH4.\n2\nFramework for the carbon\
    \ monitoring system\nAlthough research priorities for carbon-cycle science are\
    \ es-\ntablished, climate policies including detailed provisions of\nemission\
    \ reduction treaties, national legislation, and volun-\ntary programs are only\
    \ partially deﬁned and will continue to\nevolve over the coming decades. This\
    \ complicates the for-\nmulation of requirements for an integrated carbon monitor-\n\
    ing system, and the assessment of relative strengths of dif-\nferent observational\
    \ approaches and model-data integration\nschemes. In order to provide a necessary\
    \ context for the pro-\nposed strategy, we establish in this study a framework\
    \ for a\ncarbon monitoring system based on the following questions:\n– What are\
    \ and were the magnitudes, distribution, vari-\nability and trends of anthropogenic\
    \ CO2 and CH4 emis-\nsions, including their attribution to relevant sectors?\n\
    – How effective will national, regional, and city- and\nproject-scale policy interventions\
    \ be in reducing green-\nhouse gas emissions and/or increasing carbon seques-\n\
    tration?\n– What are the magnitudes, distribution, variability, and\ntrends of\
    \ regional natural CO2 and CH4 ﬂuxes, and what\ndoes this information tell us\
    \ about the underlying natu-\nral and human induced mechanisms in each region?\n\
    – What and were are the magnitudes, distribution, vari-\nability, and trends of\
    \ regional carbon stocks in natural\nand managed ecosystems?\n– How are CO2 and\
    \ CH4 sources and sinks likely to be-\nhave in the future under higher atmospheric\
    \ CO2 con-\ncentrations and altered patterns of atmospheric com-\nposition (nitrogen\
    \ deposition, elevated ozone), climate,\nland vegetation, and ocean circulation\
    \ as well as from\nhuman appropriation of terrestrial and marine resources\nimpacting\
    \ the carbon cycle?\n– How soon might positive/negative feedbacks that may\nenhance/reduce\
    \ natural CO2 and CH4 emissions, re-\nduce/enhance sinks, possibly associated\
    \ with thresh-\nolds, come into play over different sensitive regions, and\nhow\
    \ could these feedbacks be detected and quantiﬁed\nby observations?\nThis study\
    \ builds on the Integrated Global Observing\nSystem-Partnership (IGOS-P) Carbon\
    \ Theme Team report\n(Ciais et al., 2004) and on a more recent report prepared\
    \ for\nthe Group on Earth Observations (GEO) (Ciais et al., 2010),\nand the US\
    \ National Research Council report on quantify-\ning and verifying greenhouse\
    \ gas emissions (NRC, 2010).\nThe carbon observing system outlined in this study\
    \ will ul-\ntimately need to address all carbon greenhouse gases and\nN2O, but\
    \ we are focusing on a “carbon system” for CO2 and\nCH4 because these two gases\
    \ represent the highest share of\nincreased radiative forcing (Hofmann et al.,\
    \ 2006). An in-\ntegrated observing system with the capacity to enable esti-\n\
    mations of N2O ﬂuxes is not described here, but could be\nestablished following\
    \ similar principles and technology as\nfor CH4 (Hirsch et al., 2006; NRC, 2010;\
    \ Phillips et al.,\n2007; Corazza et al., 2011). National and sovereign circum-\n\
    stances will naturally dictate the complexity and type of na-\ntional monitoring\
    \ systems that individual countries might\nagree to establish for reporting emissions\
    \ to the United Na-\ntions Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)\nand\
    \ for avoiding greenhouse gas losses from ecosystems. Or-\nganizations like the\
    \ Group on Earth Observation (GEO), the\nWorld Meteorological Organization (WMO),\
    \ and the Food\nand Agriculture Organization (FAO) can play an impartial,\ninternational,\
    \ scientiﬁc role here in coordinating global ob-\nservations and facilitating\
    \ unencumbered access by all coun-\ntries to relevant data, information, tools,\
    \ and methodologies.\nExisting institutions could also be improved to fulﬁll such\
    \ a\nrole (Le Quéré et al., 2010). Policy frameworks on how to\nmanage the biospheric\
    \ carbon cycle for GHG mitigation are\nstill in a primordial state. In this paper\
    \ we do not foresee yet\nspeciﬁc climate policy implementation mechanisms such\
    \ as\nBiogeosciences, 11, 3547–3602, 2014\nwww.biogeosciences.net/11/3547/2014/\n\

    \ base payments or activity-based mechanisms,\nwhich would obviously drive the\
    \ design of speciﬁc observa-\ntional components.\n3\nCurrent carbon-cycle observations\n\
    3.1\nState of the art\nThe spatial and temporal scales of coverage of current\
    \ ter-\nrestrial and oceanic observation assets are depicted in Fig. 1a\nand b,\
    \ along with processes impacting the carbon balance of\necosystems and air–sea\
    \ ﬂuxes (Fig. 1c and d). There is (to\nour knowledge) no global data-product providing\
    \ the global\nspatial distribution of fossil fuel CO2 and CH4 emissions,\nor of\
    \ land use change CO2 emissions, including detailed\n(e.g. hourly) temporal proﬁles.\
    \ One can see from Fig. 1 that\nthe mechanisms controlling carbon ﬂuxes in the\
    \ long term\nwill evolve during the next decades, and are not well sam-\npled\
    \ by current observing systems.\nOver the past ten years, carbon measurements\
    \ have been\ncollected through various programs and projects. Spatial cov-\nerage\
    \ has either stagnated (many regions still un-sampled)\nor moderately increased\
    \ through the establishment of in situ\nmonitoring stations (e.g. ICOS – Integrated\
    \ Carbon Ob-\nservation System in Europe; http://www.icos-infrastructure.\neu),\
    \ and better access and continuity to key space-based\nremote-sensing platforms.\
    \ Implementation has largely re-\nmained through research programs, rather than\
    \ being de-\nsigned with an operational integrated monitoring system in\nmind.\
    \ There is attrition (e.g. closure of Canadian Carbon Pro-\ngram ﬂux sites, risks\
    \ for the National Oceanic and Atmo-\nspheric Administration – Earth System Research\
    \ Laboratory\n(NOAA-ESRL) ﬂask sampling network (Houweling et al.,\n2012) and\
    \ some atmospheric monitoring stations in Europe).\nAnother obvious gap is the\
    \ lack of global biomass monitor-\ning capacity.\n3.2\nFossil fuel emissions\n\
    Current data sets of fossil fuel CO2 emissions averaged\nby country, sector and\
    \ year are maintained by the Inter-\nnational Energy Agency (IEA, 2012) (http://www.iea.org/\n\
    co2highlights/co2highlights.pdf), the Carbon Dioxide Infor-\nmation Analysis Center\
    \ (CDIAC) (Boden et al., 2012) based\non the United Nations Statistics Division\
    \ (UNSO) energy\ndata set, and Emission Database for Global Atmospheric\nResearch\
    \ – EDGAR4.2 (a product of the Joint Research\nCenter of the European Commission\
    \ (JRC) together with\nthe Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL)\n\
    (EDGAR4-database, 2009) based on IEA energy data set.\nEmission maps exist over\
    \ the globe from different data prod-\nucts (Andres et al., 1996) with limited\
    \ temporal information\n(e.g. monthly in Andres et al., 2011).\nBecause fossil\
    \ CO2 emissions are currently prescribed as\nboundary conditions of atmospheric\
    \ inversion models, they\nmust be measured at the same space/time resolution as\
    \ the\nnumerical simulation of transport. This implies the objective\nof characterizing\
    \ emissions at the scales of 1 km each hour,\nincluding geo-referenced information\
    \ on large point sources,\nas appropriate to meso-scale inversion models (Broquet\
    \ et\nal., 2011; Lauvaux et al., 2012). This is why over some re-\ngions, like\
    \ North America (Gurney et al., 2009; Pétron et\nal., 2008), Europe (Pregger et\
    \ al., 2007) and Southeast Asia\n(Ohara et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2013) pilot\
    \ fossil CO2 emis-\nsions data products exist at higher spatial resolution, parti-\n\
    tioned between economic sectors and temporal proﬁles. Usu-\nally, no error structure\
    \ is associated with fossil fuel emission\ndata products, although Rayner et al.\
    \ (2010) described an al-\ngorithm to generate one.\nThree examples of global\
    \ and regional fossil emission geo-\nreferenced data-products are shown in Fig.\
    \ 2. The ﬁrst one\nis the above-listed EDGAR (www.edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu) at\n\
    10 km spatial resolution, with no temporal proﬁle. The sec-\nond is the VULCAN\
    \ detailed US fossil fuel emission inven-\ntory here given hourly at 10 km resolution,\
    \ obtained from\nlocal/regional air pollution monitoring data complemented\nwith\
    \ census, trafﬁc, and digital road data sets (vulcan.project.\nasu.edu/index.php;\
    \ Gurney et al., 2009). The third one is a\n∼ 1 km spatial resolution map of emissions,\
    \ with temporal\nallocation, covering Europe (here we show France only) ob-\n\
    tained by disaggregating national emission totals using var-\nious activity data\
    \ for industry, road trafﬁc, and urban use\n(www.carboeurope.ier.uni-stuttgart.de/).\n\
    Global annual fossil fuel CO2 emission values are esti-\nmated to have an uncertainty\
    \ in the range 3–10 % (1-sigma;\nmost of the uncertainty can be considered as\
    \ bias, e.g. from\nthe use of different statistical data), depending on whether\n\
    or not the data of three primary fuels (gas, oil, and coal) are\nindependent of\
    \ each other (Marland et al., 2009). Estimates\nfor individual countries can have\
    \ much larger uncertainty,\nup to several tens of %, especially for developing\
    \ countries\n(NRC, 2010). A comparison between the CDIAC and the\nDutch National\
    \ Institute for Public Health and the Environ-\nment (RIVM) of fossil CO2 emissions\
    \ at the country level\nshowed that the largest percentage emission differences\
    \ are\nfor some developing countries (Marland et al., 1999) but that\nthe largest\
    \ absolute differences remains for high-emission\ncountries with the best statistical\
    \ system. The two estimates\nfor the USA, for example, differed by only 0.9 %,\
    \ but in abso-\nlute terms this difference was larger than the total emissions\n\
    from 147 of the 195 countries considered. Better data on fos-\nsil fuel consumption\
    \ and the human activities that are most\nrelated to fuel-consumption will be\
    \ essential in establish-\ning priorities, evaluating success, and conﬁrming agreements\n\
    (NRC, 2010). Potential approaches for this are addressed in\nSect. 4.\nwww.biogeosciences.net/11/3547/2014/\n\

    \ stations,\nand ﬂask air-sampling stations\nMeasurements of atmospheric CO2 and\
    \ CH4 complement lo-\ncal (i.e. ∼ 1 m2 to ∼ 1 km2) observations of ﬂuxes and pools\n\
    at the ocean and land surface to verify measurements of car-\nbon stock changes\
    \ and process-level variables at large spa-\ntial and temporal scales. The integrative\
    \ properties of at-\nmospheric mixing mean that atmospheric concentrations of\n\
    CO2 and CH4 reﬂect ﬂux processes over large spatial scales.\nWhile lacking the\
    \ process speciﬁcity of small-scale ocean or\nland reservoirs, atmospheric measurements\
    \ implicitly incor-\nporate all sources and sinks (known and unknown) of a given\n\
    gas.\nInversion of ﬂuxes from concentrations to derive surface\nﬂuxes using transport\
    \ models has already proved capable of\nproviding global-scale, and in some instances\
    \ continental-\nscale, information on ﬂuxes with uncertainties. Some pilot\nstudies\
    \ have applied atmospheric inversion models at a ﬁner\nscale down to ∼ 1 km, constrained\
    \ by regionally denser at-\nmospheric measurements (Schmitgen et al., 2004; Zupanski\n\
    et al., 2007; Lauvaux et al., 2012; Göckede et al., 2010; Bro-\nquet et al., 2011;\
    \ Lauvaux et al., 2009). However, the current\nsparseness of the ground-based\
    \ network of atmospheric sta-\ntions cannot constrain the patterns of CO2 sources\
    \ and sinks\nat the scale of nations, states/provinces, or cities (Hunger-\nshoefer\
    \ et al., 2010; Chevallier et al., 2010), although some\ncountry-level estimates\
    \ have been derived for CH4 in Europe\n(Bergamaschi et al., 2010).\nThe current\
    \ atmospheric concentration surface network\ncontains 200 ﬂask and in situ continuous\
    \ measurement sta-\ntions. Its density is higher in North America, Europe and\n\
    Japan (Fig. 3). Data from stations reporting to the World\nMeteorological Organization\
    \ (WMO) Global Atmosphere\nWatch (GAW) program can be found at the World Data\
    \ Cen-\nter for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG; www.gaw.kishou.go.jp/\nwdcgg/) (WMO,\
    \ 2009). Atmospheric CO2 observations over\nthe ocean are made on ships and moorings\
    \ at a few loca-\ntions. The current situation is that no accuracy information\
    \ is\nreported with atmospheric measurements from each station.\nThe tropics and\
    \ Southern Hemisphere are under-sampled.\nAircraft vertical proﬁle measurements\
    \ of CO2 and CH4\nare particularly important for the independent evaluation of\n\
    vertical mixing in atmospheric transport models (Stephens\net al., 2007) as well\
    \ as elements of remote-sensing val-\nidation. Regular vertical-proﬁle sites using\
    \ dedicated air-\ncraft exist at about 30 sites around the world without long-\n\

    \ is a new concept that has to be evaluated over\nan extended period. But large\
    \ gaps in atmospheric observa-\ntions still exist in northern Eurasia, Asia, Africa,\
    \ and South\nAmerica because very few research sites exist.\nA key element of\
    \ surface and aircraft in situ atmospheric\nobservation programs is their unique\
    \ capability to closely\nlink all observations to a single CO2 and CH4 dry air\
    \ mole\nfraction scale deﬁned by the WMO. However, while most re-\nsearch groups\
    \ make a concerted effort to calibrate their mea-\nsurements to the WMO scale\
    \ very frequently are obtained\nvia regular analysis of standard gases. The current\
    \ situation\nis that there is no regulatory quality-assurance system en-\nsuring\
    \ the monitoring of the compatibility and traceability\nof measurements at each\
    \ site to the WMO scale. Ongoing\nvoluntary-based comparisons of both standard\
    \ gases and en-\nvironmental air samples provide means to assess the quality\n\
    of linkages between given sites or laboratory measurements\nto the international\
    \ scales. If the effort to link measurements\nfrom multiple networks is to succeed,\
    \ it is of the utmost im-\nportance that observed CO2 and CH4 concentration differ-\n\
    ences can be attributed unequivocally to physical processes\n(and not to differences\
    \ in calibration).\n3.3.2\nSatellite observations of column CO2 and CH4\nmixing\
    \ ratio\nSatellite remote sensing of column CO2 and CH4 mixing ra-\ntio with global\
    \ coverage offers options to complete atmo-\nspheric observations over regions\
    \ with too low surface net-\nwork density (Fig. 4). Progress has been achieved\
    \ in the\nexploitation of existing multipurpose sensors and towards\nthe design\
    \ of dedicated GHG satellite instruments. Accu-\nrate quantiﬁcation of regional-scale\
    \ GHG surface ﬂuxes is\nhowever challenging, as demanding relative accuracy re-\n\
    quirements have to be met, especially for CO2 (Bréon and\nCiais, 2009). The initial\
    \ version of the GOSAT (Greenhouse\ngases Observing SATellite) operational total\
    \ column dry air\nmole fraction XCO2 and XCH4 retrieval algorithm suffered\nfrom\
    \ signiﬁcant biases and large scatter when compared\nto ground-based Total Carbon\
    \ Column Observing Network\n(TCCON) observations, but this has been improved (Yoshida\n\
    et al., 2013). Consequently, some preliminary CO2 ﬂux es-\ntimates have been produced\
    \ (Maksyutov et al., 2013; Basu\net al., 2013). For methane the situation is better\
    \ than for\nCO2, but satellites still need to be used with in situ data to\ninfer\
    \ methane surface ﬂuxes, as shown by Bergamaschi et\nal. (2009) using XCH4 retrievals\
    \ obtained from the SCanning\nImaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric\
    \ CHartog-\nraphY (SCIAMACHY) together with ﬂask measurements.\nExisting/near-launch\
    \ instruments for column GHG mix-\ning ratios make measurements either in the\
    \ thermal infrared\nspectral domain, with peak sensitivity in the middle tro-\n\
    posphere: Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), Infrared\nAtmospheric Sounding\
    \ Interferometer (IASI), and Thermal\nEmission Spectrometer (TES), Greenhouse\
    \ gases Observing\nSATellite (GOSAT), or in the solar infrared domain: SCIA-\n\
    MACHY (2002–2012), Greenhouse Gas Observing Satellite\n(GOSAT), Orbiting Carbon\
    \ Observatory-2 (OCO-2), with a\nmore uniform sensitivity to CO2 and CH4 throughout\
    \ the\natmospheric column, including the boundary layer (Fig. 4).\nThe thermal\
    \ infrared sounders are not well adapted to infer-\nring surface ﬂuxes as illustrated\
    \ by Chevallier et al. (2009a),\nin contrast to near-infrared sounders. Despite\
    \ this drawback,\nseveral groups have used thermal infrared sounders to pro-\n\
    vide information on column variability (Crevoisier et al.,\n2004; Chahine et al.,\
    \ 2008; Xiong et al., 2008).\nThe precision and accuracy of space-based remotely\n\
    sensed GHG column concentration products vary with in-\nstrument and sampling\
    \ strategy. Unlike in situ sensors, the\nconcentrations of gases in the measurement\
    \ path cannot be\ncontrolled. Thus the direct calibration to the WMO mole\nfraction\
    \ scale cannot be established for space-based GHG\ncolumn concentration. An indirect\
    \ data evaluation can be\nmade using TCCON total column measurement network\n\
    data, which themselves can be evaluated against WMO mole\nfraction scale airborne\
    \ in situ vertical proﬁles (Wunch et al.,\n2010, 2011a). For middle-tropospheric\

    \ for TES (Kulawik et al., 2010)\nare reported. For XCO2 from solar backscatter\
    \ measure-\nments, precision estimates for single soundings of 3 ppm dry\nair\
    \ mole fraction for SCIAMACHY (Reuter et al., 2011),\nand 2 ppm for GOSAT (Yoshida\
    \ et al., 2013) are reported.\nSpatially and temporally aggregation of SCIAMACHY\
    \ and\nGOSAT data further improve the precision, if errors are\nmainly random,\
    \ depending on cloud cover and spatial sam-\npling. Future missions like OCO-2\
    \ and Carbon Monitoring\nSatellite (CarbonSat) target aggregated precisions of\
    \ 1 ppm\nand better.\nBiases of XCO2 at various space and timescales have ham-\n\
    pered inversion studies from these products (Chevallier et al.,\n2005) despite\
    \ the progress (Maksyutov et al., 2013). These\nbiases can be caused by uncertainties\
    \ in the spectroscopy\nused in the retrieval model, or aliasing with other atmo-\n\
    spheric signals like aerosols (Houweling et al., 2005). Bi-\nases (e.g. aerosol\
    \ concentrations or albedo) are likely to be\ncoherent over space and time, requiring\
    \ signiﬁcant care to\navoid interpreting them as geophysical signals. The launch\n\
    of GOSAT and the planned launch of OCO-2 in 2014 have\nraised expectations for\
    \ CO2 inversions because these two\ninstruments are the ﬁrst ones to have been\
    \ speciﬁcally de-\nsigned for the detection of atmospheric CO2 (see for exam-\n\
    ple, Chevallier et al., 2009b, their Fig. 4). In addition, the\nmethods are under\
    \ development to account for large-scale bi-\nases using TCCON data (Wunch et\
    \ al., 2011b).\nFor current mid-to-upper tropospheric concentrations of\nmethane\
    \ (CH4) from thermal infrared sounders like IASI,\nreported precision estimates\
    \ are in the range of 17–35 ppb\non 5◦ spatial and monthly temporal scale (Crevoisier\
    \ et al.,\n2009b). For XCH4, reported precision estimates for indi-\nvidual soundings\
    \ are about 17–35 ppb for SCIAMACHY\n(Frankenberg et al., 2006) and 12.5 ppb for\
    \ GOSAT (Yoshida\net al., 2013). Spatially and temporally aggregated precisions\n\
    of SCIAMACHY and GOSAT can reach the 10 ppb level\n(and even below for GOSAT)\
    \ depending on cloud cover\nBiogeosciences, 11, 3547–3602, 2014\nwww.biogeosciences.net/11/3547/2014/\n\
    P. Ciais et al.: Current systematic carbon-cycle observations\n3557\nand spatial\
    \ sampling. Future missions like CarbonSat tar-\nget aggregated measurement precisions\
    \ of 5 ppb. As shown\nby Bergamaschi et al. (2009), biases in satellite XCH4 re-\n\
    trievals can be (arbitrarily) corrected when calculating ﬂuxes\nby anchoring the\
    \ inversion with surface in situ station mea-\nsurements. More development is\
    \ required in the rigorous sta-\ntistical weighting of sparse, but high-accuracy\
    \ in situ ob-\nservations with much more numerous, but potentially noisy\nand\
    \ biased satellite observations. This opens the possibility\nof a decadal monitoring\
    \ of global CH4 ﬂuxes from SCIA-\nMACHY and GOSAT, in orbit since March 2002 and\
    \ January\n2009, respectively, combined with surface in situ network.\nThe critical\
    \ potential contribution of satellite XCO2 and\nXCH4 observations to improving\
    \ atmospheric ﬂux inver-\nsions is clearly their ability to increase the density\
    \ of ob-\nservations. Well-calibrated and precise satellite observations\nshould\
    \ offer the potential to reduce some of the uncertain-\nties associated with sparse\
    \ sampling. However current assets\nare far from perfect in terms of spatial coverage,\
    \ spatial res-\nolution, near-surface sensitivity, and temporal sampling. The\n\
    current satellites have fairly large “footprints” (surface pixel\nscale), for\
    \ example, IASI = 13 km, and GOSAT = 10 km. This\ntranslates into relatively few\
    \ cloud-free scenes necessary to\nachieve good retrievals. These, combined with\
    \ repeat inter-\nvals measured in days or weeks on polar orbits, result in\nfairly\
    \ infrequent sampling of a given surface location, trans-\nlating to information\
    \ gaps on the variability of ﬂuxes on\ntimescales shorter than about a month.\
    \ Additionally, many\nof these satellites are in sun-synchronous orbits so they\
    \ are\ntypically limited to providing one observation at a given local\ntime on\
    \ a given day rather than offering sampling of diurnal\nvariations in atmospheric\
    \ gases.\nTable 1 summarizes the estimated precision of XCO2 and\nXCH4 retrieved\
    \ products, surface (orbital along track) spatial\nresolution, and vertical sensitivity\
    \ offered by current satel-\nlite atmospheric GHG sounders. In addition to CO2\
    \ and CH4\nsounders, there are several satellites currently in operation\nthat\
    \ offer column-averaged soundings of other atmospheric,\nshort-lived species such\
    \ as CO (e.g., Measurements of Pol-\nlution in the Troposphere – MOPITT) and NO2\
    \ (e.g., Global\nOzone Monitoring Experiment – GOME-2, Ozone Monitor-\ning Instrument\
    \ – OMI) associated with combustion processes\nthat might be useful in improving\
    \ source attribution (if prop-\nerly integrated with XCO2 data). Such data fusion\
    \ has not yet\nbeen systematically investigated (Berezin et al., 2013).\n3.3.3\n\
    Emerging airborne remote-sensing observations\nof CO2 and CH4 mixing ratio\nAirborne\
    \ remote-sensing sensors offer emerging capabilities\nthat complement surface\
    \ and satellite observations. Those\nsensors are often signiﬁcantly more capable\
    \ than current\nsatellite sensors – either due to lower operation altitudes\n\
    (higher signal to noise ratio) or because they represent pro-\ntotypes of next\
    \ generation technology that has yet to com-\nplete space qualiﬁcations. One example\
    \ of such a system\nis the NASA Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Ex-\n\
    periment (CARVE) which provides aircraft remote sensing\nof XCO2 and XCH4, backed\
    \ by a comprehensive suite of\nﬂasks and in situ sensors, and a microwave soil-moisture\n\
    sensor. Another example is the Methane Airborne Mapper\n(MAMAP) that includes\
    \ a grating spectrometer offering re-\nmote sensing of CO2 and CH4 column averaged\
    \ mixing\nratios (Gerilowski et al., 2011). Data from MAMAP gath-\nered during\
    \ several campaigns and its analysis using inverse\nplume modeling demonstrated\
    \ that single CO2 and CH4\npoint source emissions can be detected and quantiﬁed\
    \ in-\ndependently using remote-sensing data (Krings et al., 2011,\n2013). In\
    \ addition, light detection and ranging (lidar) air-\nborne measurements of CO2\
    \ and CH4 have been performed,\nthe latter in preparation of the Methane Remote\
    \ Lidar (MER-\nLIN) mission (Fig. 7).\n3.3.4\nSurface network of remote-sensing\
    \ measurement\nstations\nThe Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON)\nground-based\
    \ network (www.tccon.caltech.edu/, Wunch et\nal., 2011a) measured at some 18 stations\
    \ in 2012 (Fig. 3b) in\nthe near-infrared solar absorption spectrum. The current\
    \ TC-\nCON standard product already consisted of XCO2, XCH4,\nXCO, XN2O, XH2O,\
    \ XHCl, XHF, XHDO, and all routinely\nsubmitted to TCCON data archive. More species\
    \ are possi-\nble and could be retrieved from the already existing mea-\nsured\
    \ spectra. An extension of the TCCON wavelength range\nwould allow measurements\
    \ of XOCS, XC2H6, and many\nother species, although it will require an upgrade\
    \ of instru-\nment and lead to costly logistics.\nThe TCCON instruments currently\
    \ work to retrieve\ncolumn-average mixing ratios with a precision of ∼ 1 ppm\n\
    for XCO2 and 3 ppb for XCH4. These data are crucial for\nsatellite column measurement\
    \ validation. They can also be\nreliably used in inversions (Chevallier et al.,\
    \ 2011). Unlike\nsurface in situ observations where the concentration of the\n\
    gases in the observation path can be deﬁned by introduction\nof standard gases,\
    \ less certain, “vicarious” means of linkage\nto the WMO scales must be used (Wunch\
    \ et al., 2010), which\ncauses uncertainty in the calibration of TCCON to the\
    \ WMO\nmole fraction scale. The “vicarious” means are typically air-\ncraft measurements\
    \ with instruments that are commonly used\nfor continuous in situ measurements.\
    \ The uncertainties are\nmostly due to parts of the atmosphere that are not easily\
    \ ac-\ncessible to in situ measurements (stratosphere) but are seen\nby both ground-based\
    \ and space-borne remote-sensing in-\nstruments. Both the calibration factors\
    \ for XCO2 and XCH4\nand their uncertainties have been well established (Wunch\
    \ et\nal., 2010; Messerschmidt et al., 2011; Geibel et al., 2012).\nTCCON does,\
    \ however, provide a way to assess the compati-\nbility of satellite measurements\
    \ with the WMO mole fraction\nscale (Keppel-Aleks et al., 2012).\nwww.biogeosciences.net/11/3547/2014/\n\

    Surface ocean 1pCO2 measurements together with atmo-\nspheric CO2 measurements\
    \ are essential for determining air–\nsea CO2 ﬂuxes. The current situation is\
    \ illustrated by a pub-\nlished global ﬂux map, based on a compilation of ∼ 3\
    \ million\nmeasurements, for a typical “normal” non-El Niño year taken\nto be\
    \ 2000 (Takahashi et al., 2009). The number of annual\nsurface 1pCO2 observations\
    \ has been growing since the late\n1960s such that today well over one million\
    \ observations are\nreported to data centers each year. This increase in the num-\n\
    ber of observations provides new opportunities to look at the\npatterns of air–sea\
    \ CO2 ﬂuxes in greater detail to understand\nthe seasonal to interannual variations\
    \ and the mechanisms\ncontrolling them. Air–sea ﬂux calculation from 1pCO2 re-\n\
    quires knowledge of gas transfer velocities, which depend on\nwind speed, adding\
    \ accuracy to ﬂux estimates from 1pCO2\nmeasurements.\nA key ongoing international\
    \ effort, the Surface Ocean CO2\nAtlas (SOCAT) aims to synthesize 1pCO2 data collected\n\
    over the last 40 years into a quality controlled data base,\nalong with uniform\
    \ metadata, that can be used to examine\n1pCO2 variability over a range of time\
    \ and space scales\n(Pfeil et al., 2013; Sabine et al., 2013). The current version\n\
    of the SOCAT 1pCO2 database contains more than 6 million\nobservations collected\
    \ by research ships, commercial volun-\nteer ships, and moorings (Fig. 5). It\
    \ is expected to reach more\nthan 10 million in the second release. Over the best-sampled\n\
    ocean regions, such as the North Atlantic and the equato-\nrial Paciﬁc, mean air–sea\
    \ CO2 ﬂuxes can be reconstructed to\nwithin 20 %, and their interannual variation\
    \ to within 10 %\n(Watson et al., 2009). However, the majority of the ocean\n\
    is still under-sampled despite the 40 yr data set (Fig. 5). The\nuse of autonomous\
    \ platforms for making surface carbon mea-\nsurements is a cost effective technology\
    \ for mapping areas\nnot typically covered by standard shipping routes.\nBiogeosciences,\

    Ocean interior measurements\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, carbon samples\
    \ in the\nocean interior were collected and analyzed from 95 research\ncruises\
    \ run over about a 10 year period, part of the Joint\nGlobal Ocean Flux Study\
    \ (JGOFS) and World Ocean Cir-\nculation Experiment (WOCE) (Fig. 5). Based on\
    \ these data,\nSabine et al. (2004) estimated that the total inventory of an-\n\
    thropogenic carbon that had accumulated in the ocean up\nto 1994 was 118 ± 19\
    \ Pg C, accounting for 48 % of CO2 re-\nleased from fossil fuel burning between\
    \ 1800 and 1994. Re-\ncent work shows that several marginal seas, not directly\
    \ sam-\npled by the data used by Sabine et al. (2004), stored more\nanthropogenic\
    \ carbon per unit area than the open ocean, and\nthat they contributed signiﬁcant\
    \ carbon to their adjacent ma-\njor ocean basins (Lee et al., 2011).\nSystematic\
    \ and global re-occupation of select hydro-\ngraphic sections was initiated by\
    \ the international commu-\nnity in the early 2000s to quantify changes in storage\
    \ and\ntransport of heat, fresh water, carbon dioxide (CO2), and\nrelated parameters\
    \ (internationally coordinated through the\nGlobal Ocean Ship-Based Hydrographic\
    \ Investigation Pro-\ngram (GO-SHIP); www.go-ship.org). The current situation\n\
    is that data from these repeat occupations have already re-\nvealed substantial\
    \ changes in the ocean interior carbon stor-\nage in response to the continuing\
    \ uptake of anthropogenic\nCO2 (e.g., Wanninkhof et al., 2010; Sabine et al.,\
    \ 2008; Mu-\nrata et al., 2007; Feely et al., 2012) as well as the presence of\n\
    a substantial amount of decadal variability in the ocean car-\nbon cycle. In addition\
    \ to documenting changes that already\noccurred since the ﬁrst occupation, these\
    \ repeat hydrographic\nmeasurements continue to serve as a baseline to assess\
    \ future\nchanges. Repeat surveys of the ocean with physical parame-\nter measurements\
    \ are also suited to detect changes in oceanic\ntransport of heat, as well as\
    \ changes in oxygen (Keeling et\nal., 2010) and nutrients. Below the level of\
    \ the ARGO array\nof automated ﬂoats (www.argo.ucsd.edu/) repeat hydrogra-\nphy\
    \ is the only global method capable of observing long-term\ntrends in ocean carbon.\
    \ The program also provides data for\nsensor calibration and to support continuing\
    \ model develop-\nment that lead to improved forecasting skills for oceans and\n\
    global climate.\nFor the global ocean, the Global Ocean Data Analysis\nProject\

    \ carbon-cycle observations\nthe data from the ﬁrst global survey has become a\
    \ benchmark\nfor testing biogeochemical ocean general circulation models.\nIt\
    \ also has served as the basis for ﬁrst data assimilation efforts\nto estimate\
    \ global-scale ocean–atmosphere CO2 ﬂuxes (Gru-\nber et al., 2009; Gloor et al.,\
    \ 2003). For different oceans or\nocean basins, new repeat hydrography data syntheses\
    \ have\nbeen created (e.g. CARbon dyoxide IN the Atlantic Ocean\n– CARINA, Key\
    \ et al., 2010) or are emerging (e.g. PA-\nCIFic ocean Interior CArbon – PACIFICA\
    \ data set through\nthe North Paciﬁc Marine Science Organization (PICES) and\n\
    other partners). The data collected so far through the repeat\nhydrography program\
    \ are too sparse to unambiguously doc-\nument the global-scale accumulation of\
    \ anthropogenic CO2\nsince the 1990s, although the data collection PACIFICA is\n\
    now ﬁnalized and published at http://cdiac.ornl.gov/oceans/\nPACIFICA/ and ongoing\
    \ synthesis work will likely resolve\nthis challenge soon (e.g. Sabine and Tanhua,\
    \ 2010).\nCurrently, monitoring programs do not exist for oceanic\n1pCH4, as the\
    \ ocean is considered to be only a minor source\nof this greenhouse gas (Ciais\
    \ et al., 2013). However, the po-\ntential for enhanced destabilization of CH4\
    \ gas hydrates un-\nder climate change requires attention, especially in vulnera-\n\
    ble regions such as coastal slopes and the Arctic (Biastoch et\nal., 2011).\n\
    3.4.3\nOcean in situ biological measurements related to\ncarbon cycle\nPrimary\n\
    production,\ncarbon\nand\nnitrogen\nﬁxation,\nmetabolism,\nand\nbiological\nspecies\n\
    composition\ncon-\ntribute to an understanding of the ocean carbon cycle. Those\n\
    biological observations provide insight to marine population-\nand community-level\
    \ changes and could ultimately lead\nto development of biological indicators,\
    \ for example to\ncharacterize the biological effects of ocean acidiﬁcation. In\n\
    addition, measurements of ocean partial pressure of N2O\nand CH4 on research cruises\
    \ have enabled partial/regional\nestimates of air–sea ﬂuxes of these greenhouse\
    \ gases. New\nobservations of O2 vertical proﬁles within the ocean from\nARGO\
    \ free-drifting buoys have shown promising results,\nand an increase in the number\
    \ of buoys carrying O2 sensors\nis expected as the technology improves the reliability\
    \ and\npower consumption (Gruber et al., 2010). The development\nof optical sensors\
    \ has allowed the measurement of phy-\ntoplankton ﬂuorescence onboard ARGO buoys\
    \ (Johnson\net al., 2009; Claustre et al., 2010) providing a new tool\nto monitor\
    \ biological productivity, and thus the carbon\ncycle, within the ocean interior.\
    \ The increase in the number\nof bio-optical ARGO buoys in forthcoming years will\n\
    complement available satellite ocean color data of surface\nchlorophyll concentration.\
    \ Furthermore, the advent of pH\nand nitrate sensors provides the potential to\
    \ expand the\nsuite of measurements to assess the trophic status as well\nas ocean\
    \ acidiﬁcation (Johnson et al., 2009). A number of\ncarbon-related (1pCO2, TA,\
    \ pH, DIC) sensors for ocean use\non autonomous vehicles are being developed and\
    \ tested.\n3.4.4\nRemote sensing of ocean carbon-cycle parameters\nFor the oceans,\
    \ remote sensing is critical for understanding\nglobal patterns of ocean physics\
    \ (e.g., temperature, dynamic\nheight), biology (e.g., ocean color), chemistry\
    \ (e.g., salin-\nity) and air–sea forcing properties (e.g., surface winds, wave\n\
    height). Two long time series of satellite data have greatly\ncontributed to a\
    \ better estimation of carbon ﬂuxes: the Ad-\nvanced Very High Resolution Radiometer\
    \ (AVHRR) initi-\nated sea surface temperature (SST) since the early 1980s, and\n\
    the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) initi-\nated chlorophyll a\
    \ concentration (a proxy of the phytoplank-\nton concentration in surface waters)\
    \ available since the late\n1990s (http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/) (McClain,\
    \ 2009).\nThese records advanced the understanding of the temporal\nvariability\
    \ and spatial distribution of physical and biological\nparameters in the ocean,\
    \ leading to important improvements\nin ocean modeling during the last decades.\
    \ More recent sen-\nsors such as MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spec-\ntroradiometer)\
    \ (Franz et al., 2006) and MERIS (MEdium-\nResolution Imaging Spectrometer) (Rast\
    \ et al., 1999) have\nstrengthened and extended this space-based ocean observing\n\
    system (Fig. 5). A third satellite data product of high impor-\ntance for ocean\
    \ carbon-cycle studies are direct wind speed\nmeasurements from a range of scatterometers,\
    \ such as Quick\nScatterometer – QuikSCAT/SeaWinds (http://winds.jpl.nasa.\ngov/missions/quikscat/).\n\
    Currently, estimating air–sea CO2 ﬂuxes from combined\nsatellite and in situ measurements\
    \ remains a challenge be-\ncause the carbon content in the ocean surface layer\
    \ de-\npends not only on the surface temperature and phytoplankton\nbiomass (that\
    \ can be monitored from space), but also on the\nmixed layer depth and water-mass\
    \ history. Recent attempts\nthat combine satellite data and model simulation showed\
    \ the\npotential of this approach (Telszewski et al., 2009). Develop-\nment of\
    \ operational ocean circulation models associated with\nsatellite products will\
    \ probably lead to an acceleration of\nthe use of these approaches to routinely\
    \ produce ocean CO2\nﬂuxes. In the near term, these methods will beneﬁt from the\n\
    sea surface salinity (SSS) measurement using the Soil Mois-\nture Ocean Salinity\
    \ (SMOS) sensor launched in 2009, and\nthe Aquarius sensor launched in 2011. In\
    \ regions affected by\nthe discharge of large rivers, such as the equatorial Atlantic\n\
    with the Amazon and Congo rivers’ plumes, the thermody-\nnamic processes that\
    \ control 1pCO2 depend not only on the\nSST but also on the SSS (De La Paz et\
    \ al., 2010).\nNew satellite products are expected to enhance ocean\ncolor products.\
    \ The detection of the phytoplankton functional\ntypes is an example of product\
    \ useful to better understand\nthe biological pump of carbon in the ocean (Alvain\
    \ et al.,\n2005; Uitz et al., 2010), because phytoplankton species play\nvery\
    \ different role in carbon uptake and export. All these\nBiogeosciences, 11, 3547–3602,\

    \ carbon-cycle observations\n3561\nnew measurements and methods will allow more\
    \ precise esti-\nmates of carbon ﬂuxes in the open ocean, but their equivalent\n\
    for the coastal ocean is still in the future. Despite its impor-\ntance in global\
    \ CO2 (Laruelle et al., 2010) and CH4 ﬂuxes\n(Bange, 2006), the coastal ocean\
    \ is particularly challenging\nto observe from space for reasons that range from\
    \ the diur-\nnal cycle of the biology to speciﬁc atmospheric corrections,\nand\
    \ to the complex water optical properties (Borges, 2011).\nOcean color sensors\
    \ onboard geostationary platforms such\nas the Korean Geostationary Ocean Color\
    \ Imager (GOCI)\nsatellite (www.kosc.kordi.re.kr) are likely the most suitable\n\
    approach to tackle the issue of monitoring coastal waters be-\ncause of their\
    \ high frequency of observation. New sensors\nmaking observations in ultraviolet\
    \ wavelengths could enable\ndetection of dissolved organic matter.\n3.5\nTerrestrial\
    \ Domain\n3.5.1\nEddy covariance ﬂux tower networks\nThe FLUXNET program (www.ﬂuxnet.ornl.gov/ﬂuxnet/\n\
    index.cfm; www.ﬂuxdata.org; Baldocchi et al., 2001) is a\ncollaboration of regional\
    \ networks monitoring CO2, water\nvapor and energy ﬂuxes (together with microclimatic\
    \ and an-\ncillary data), intended to combine data for global synthesis\nof terrestrial\
    \ sources and sinks of CO2. These measurements\nhave a very limited spatial footprint\
    \ for ﬂuxes (1 km2) and\nrather high uncertainties (Hollinger and Richardson,\
    \ 2005)\nbut they seem to possess a large representativeness through\nup-scaling\
    \ of site measured ecosystem responses (e.g. Jung\net al., 2011; Xiao et al.,\
    \ 2011). The network expanded from\n∼ 100 towers in 2000 to almost 500 in 2009\
    \ (Fig. 6a). In\nthe recent years, the number of ﬂux towers stabilized af-\nter\
    \ 2010 and declined in North America and Europe. The\nincreased number of towers\
    \ (now broadly representing dif-\nferent vegetation types, climates, and disturbances,\
    \ although\nsome biomes such as tropical forest and savanna are under-\nsampled;\
    \ Williams et al., 2009), and the increased length of\ntime series (many sites\
    \ have been operating for a decade or\nmore) allow scientists to address more\
    \ complex scientiﬁc\nquestions and produce information more useful to decision\n\
    makers (Baldocchi, 2008).\nAn effort to compare and standardize large parts of\
    \ the ﬂux\nprocessing has been made with respect to quality control,\ngap-ﬁlling,\
    \ ﬂux-partitioning, and uncertainty analysis (Re-\nichstein et al., 2005; Papale\
    \ et al., 2006; Desai et al., 2008;\nLasslop et al., 2010). A standardized data\
    \ set containing more\nthan 950 years from 250 sites globally has been established.\n\
    Research is ongoing with respect to ﬂux correction and ac-\ncuracy estimation,\
    \ although uncertainties have been assessed\nby comparing data from co-located\
    \ measurement systems at\n84 sites in the US (Schmidt et al., 2012). Information\
    \ from\nremote-sensing measurements of surface biophysical param-\neters (see\
    \ list for instance in Law et al., 2008a), gridded cli-\nmate data (using data\
    \ mining), and empirical models based\nupon pattern recognition, optimal interpolation,\
    \ and machine\nlearning algorithms (Jung et al., 2009, 2011) allows produc-\n\
    tion of global maps of photosynthesis (gross primary produc-\ntion – GPP) (Beer\
    \ et al., 2010) (Fig. 6b), water, and energy\nexchange ﬂuxes (Jung et al., 2010;\
    \ Jiménez et al., 2011).\nCurrent attempts to produce maps of Net Ecosystem CO2\n\
    Exchange (NEE) (Jung et al., 2011) from ﬂux towers have\nbeen much less successful\
    \ than for GPP and energy ﬂuxes.\nAdditional information on disturbance history\
    \ and forest age\n(Pan et al., 2011a) must be considered in up-scaling NEE\nfrom\
    \ sites to regions. Disturbance alters the balance of ter-\nrestrial CO2 exchange\
    \ with the atmosphere, increasing respi-\nration and reducing photosynthesis,\
    \ thereby making ecosys-\ntems carbon sources. Disturbed ecosystems cover a variable,\n\
    small, but unknown fractional area of the land, and are in-\ntense sources of\
    \ CO2 to the atmosphere until plant produc-\ntion recovers, leading to a gradual\
    \ change in activity towards\na carbon sink. In recent years, there have been\
    \ developments\nin the use of the eddy covariance measurement technique\nfor measuring\
    \ CH4 and N2O ﬂuxes (Hargreaves et al., 2001;\nRinne et al., 2007; Smeets et al.,\
    \ 2009; Kroon et al., 2010)\nbut no global product exists to our knowledge.\n\
    3.5.2\nForest biomass inventories\nDeveloped countries have forest-cover change\
    \ mapping pro-\ngrams and national forest inventories that span decades and\n\
    contain data from a large number of sampling locations\n(e.g. > 150 000 in the\
    \ US). Forest inventories were set up\nto inform the national wood industry and\
    \ therefore often\nexclude woodlands that do not contribute to wood harvest.\n\
    Tropical countries have little or no inventory data, nor have\ncomprehensive estimates\
    \ of all relevant carbon pools, except\nfor research networks such as RAINFOR\
    \ in South America\n(Phillips et al., 1998, 2009), and CARBOAFRICA (Henry,\n2010),\
    \ AFRITRON (Lewis et al., 2009) and other regional\nstudies (e.g. Ryan et al.,\
    \ 2011) in Africa.\nThe main source for global data sets covering each coun-\n\
    try remains the periodic reports of the Food and Agricul-\nture Organization (FAO)\
    \ Forest Resource Assessment (FAO,\n2009, 2010). These reports suffer from data\
    \ gaps, sampling\nbiases, inconsistent methods, a lack of spatial information\n\
    and unrepresentative samples (Grainger, 2008). These limi-\ntations suggest that\
    \ FAO data are not accurate enough at re-\nquired scales for constraining regional\
    \ patterns in forest car-\nbon stock changes. In forest inventories, individual\
    \ plot data\nare not provided, and few data are available at sub-country\nscale.\
    \ Estimation of whole stand biomass is based on mea-\nsurement of stem diameter\
    \ using empirical allometric rela-\ntions elaborated by different methods in each\
    \ country (Henry\net al., 2010; Parresol, 1999; Wirth et al., 2004). These meth-\n\
    ods are not comparable between countries, or between differ-\nent forests, which\
    \ leads to regional bias.\nRevisiting inventory plots allows one to measure biomass\n\
    changes over the time period between two inventories,\nwww.biogeosciences.net/11/3547/2014/\n\

    High-resolution satellite data are used in some national\ninventory programs (e.g.\
    \ USA). Usually, uncertainties are\nnot reported with inventory data. By combining\
    \ inventory\nand model estimates of North American terrestrial carbon\nsources\
    \ and sinks, King et al. (2012) were able to reduce un-\ncertainty to 25 %. In\
    \ an earlier study, Phillips et al. (2000)\nestimated an error of up to 40 % for\
    \ the US forest stock an-\nnual volume change, mainly due to sampling errors.\n\
    Forest inventories provide important structural informa-\ntion such as age structure\
    \ allowing for model-based ap-\nproaches to factor out the impacts of age related\
    \ changes in\nthe assessment of additional sink.\n3.5.3\nSoil carbon inventories\n\
    Very few national/regional systematic soil carbon inventories\nare carried out\
    \ to allow the quantiﬁcation of carbons stocks\nand stock changes in soils. The\
    \ National Research Council\n(NRC) report (NRC, 2010) concluded that the most\
    \ impor-\ntant component to improve is agriculture, and other land use\nemissions\
    \ of CO2 and CH4, because they have the greatest\nuncertainties in national inventories,\
    \ mostly driven by large\nuncertainties in emission factors. The best soil carbon\
    \ inven-\ntories sample countries with a typical grid of a few km and\na revisit\
    \ time of 10 years (Bellamy et al., 2005). Repeating\nsoil inventories multiple\
    \ times allows detection of regional\nchanges driven by trends in climate or land\
    \ use change. The\ndepth over which soil carbon is sampled varies among soil\n\
    carbon inventories, which is a major source of uncertainty.\nWhile most of these\
    \ surveys suffer from the poor quality\nof data, they represent the only source\
    \ of information cur-\nrently available. At global scale, various efforts have\
    \ been\ndeveloped to harmonize the different soil classiﬁcations in\nalready existing\
    \ soil data, and to establish a world soil map\nBiogeosciences, 11, 3547–3602,\

    standardized, and geo-referenced soil carbon inventories, nor\na consistent network\
    \ of detailed soil carbon measurement\nplots for use in model parameterization.\
    \ Particularly in car-\nbon rich soils such as those in frozen soil and peat,\
    \ uncertain-\nties are very large (Ping et al., 2008; Tarnocai et al., 2009),\n\
    as are the estimates of carbon stocks. Peat carbon stocks and\ntheir past evolution\
    \ are also poorly documented at global\nscale, with large data gaps for tropical\

    \ carbon transport through rivers\nOver land, signiﬁcant amounts of carbon are\
    \ transported\nfrom ecosystems to other places, where it is either stored\nor\
    \ returned to the atmosphere by decomposition and respi-\nration. This lateral\
    \ transport of carbon is associated mainly\nwith rivers, with a smaller contribution\
    \ from agricultural\nand wood product transport for processing and trade. Lateral\n\
    transport through rivers counts globally ∼ 3 Pg C yr−1 (Auf-\ndenkampe et al.,\
    \ 2011; Ciais et al., 2007; Battin et al., 2009).\nAlthough individually, lateral\
    \ transport may not be a very\nlarge ﬂux, the sum of individual contributions\
    \ is signiﬁcant\nin the calculation of regional carbon budgets (Cole et al.,\n\
    2007; Ciais et al., 2008; Raymond et al., 2008; Battin et al.,\n2009; West et\
    \ al., 2009; Bastviken et al., 2011). Outgassing\nof CO2, originating from terrestrial\
    \ ecosystems, by freshwa-\nter systems, is a signiﬁcant CO2 ﬂux to the atmosphere,\
    \ im-\npacting regional CO2 budgets. Incorporating lateral carbon\ntransport by\
    \ rivers and associated CO2 outgassing and burial\nin freshwater sediments in\
    \ a global carbon observing system\nis needed to balance the carbon budget of\
    \ each region and to\ncompare top-down CO2 ﬂux inversion results with bottom-\n\
    up ecosystem stock change observations.\nLand–ocean transport of the various forms\
    \ of carbon (in-\norganically and organically dissolved and respective partic-\n\
    ulate forms) also contributes to the biogeochemical state of\ncoastal seas and\
    \ on the large scale is essential to close the\nocean carbon budget. These ﬂuxes\
    \ are not measured system-\natically, apart from few river basins. Measurements\
    \ of lateral\ncarbon ﬂuxes from land to the oceans are needed to accu-\nrately\
    \ access carbon budgets of single countries or groups\nof countries for emission\
    \ veriﬁcation purposes. Recent data\nsyntheses on riverine delivery data to the\
    \ ocean (involving\nhydrological modeling on land) have signiﬁcantly improved\n\
    our ability to quantify land–ocean carbon ﬂuxes (Mayorga et\nal., 2010).\nDue\
    \ to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of riverine car-\nbon transport to the ocean,\
    \ intermediate ﬁltering processes\n(Borges, 2005) and associated release of CO2\
    \ to the at-\nmosphere by freshwaters and estuaries, to the complexity\nof the\
    \ interaction between shelf-seas and the open ocean\n(Walsh, 1991), a quantiﬁcation\
    \ of land–ocean carbon trans-\nport is a substantial challenge (Regnier et al.,\
    \ 2013). A\nrough estimate of total land–ocean carbon transfer amounts\nto ca.\
    \ 0.8 Pg C yr−1, where 0.2 Pg C yr−1 become buried in\nmarine sediment (Liu et\
    \ al., 2010). The state of current ob-\nservation systems is as follows.\nRiver\
    \ CO2 outgassing/carbon burial in reservoirs\nThere is no coordinated observation\
    \ network of river car-\nbon ﬂuxes. The Global River Chemistry (GloRiCh) database\n\
    (Hartmann et al., 2009) provides measurements of pCO2\nin rivers with ∼ 6000 data,\
    \ but incomplete spatial coverage.\nThere is no global data set of carbon burial\
    \ in lakes and reser-\nvoirs.\nEstuaries\nFor estuarine carbon releases/burial,\
    \ no global consistent ob-\nservational data set exists as yet. A global synthesis\
    \ taking\ninto account spatially explicit typologies of estuaries and\ncontinental\
    \ shelves estimated an estuarine CO2 ﬂux to the\natmosphere of 0.27 ± 0.23 Pg\
    \ C yr−1 (Laruelle et al., 2010).\nOnly for speciﬁc estuaries, regional observational\
    \ carbon\ndata sets are available (e.g. Frankignoulle et al., 1998; Green\net\
    \ al., 2006; Salisbury et al., 2008).\nRiver carbon ﬂuxes to the ocean/carbon\
    \ budget of coastal\nocean\nRecent data syntheses (involving hydrological modeling\
    \ on\nland) have improved our ability to quantify carbon delivery\nfrom land to\
    \ estuaries and oceans (Mayorga et al., 2010).\nThe CMTT (Continental Margins\
    \ Task Team from the In-\nternational Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) core\n\
    projects JGOFS, LOICZ and IMBER) synthesized carbon\nbudgets from all major continental\
    \ margins including the\nproximal as well as distal domains (Liu et al., 2010).\
    \ The\nongoing international Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT)\nproject (see Sect.\

    3.5.5\nRemote sensing of terrestrial carbon-cycle\nparameters\nRemote sensing\
    \ is an essential component of current car-\nbon observation assets, for detecting\
    \ trends and variabil-\nity in land components of the carbon cycle. Past stud-\n\
    ies in vegetation dynamics have had to rely on vege-\ntation indices such as the\
    \ normalized difference vegeta-\ntion index (NDVI) using the Advanced Very High\
    \ Reso-\nlution Radiometer (AVHRR) data since the 1980s (Tucker\net al., 2005;\
    \ Myneni et al., 1997), and MODIS, MERIS\nmore recently. Since 1972, Landsat satellites\
    \ have collected\nwww.biogeosciences.net/11/3547/2014/\nBiogeosciences, 11, 3547–3602,\
    \ 2014\n3564\nP. Ciais et al.: Current systematic carbon-cycle observations\n\
    high-spatial-resolution data (30 m) at lower temporal fre-\nquency than AVHRR\
    \ or MODIS (http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.\ngov/references/recent_pub.html). These\
    \ data have been used\nin various applications (Vogelmann et al., 2009) but primar-\n\
    ily for land cover, and cannot be used to quantify ecosys-\ntem state variables\
    \ except by correlation. As satellite sensors\nhave increased spectral and spatial\
    \ resolution and stability of\nsensor calibration, biophysically based alternatives\
    \ to veg-\netation indices have emerged (e.g. photosynthetic light-use\nefﬁciency;\
    \ Hilker et al., 2011). In addition, new technolo-\ngies (lidar, microwave, hyperspectral)\
    \ instead of retrieving\nindices, can infer actual key ecosystem states such as\
    \ leaf\narea, canopy architecture, foliar chemistry (nitrogen, photo-\nsynthetic\
    \ pigments), and other properties that govern photo-\nsynthesis, growth, and decomposition.\n\
    Satellite radar data, both C-band and L-band, have been\nused over the past several\
    \ decades to document land cover\nand disturbance. They have some sensitivity\
    \ to canopy vol-\nume and have been used to estimate aboveground biomass\nin low\
    \ to medium biomass ecosystems. Passive microwave\nmeasurements for freeze-thaw\
    \ conditions have been used to\nestimate growing season length and infer GPP in\
    \ northern\nhigh-latitude ecosystems. More recently, forest height and\ncanopy\
    \ proﬁle metrics have been derived from Ice, Cloud,\nand Land Elevation Satellite\
    \ (ICESat), Geoscience Laser\nAltimeter System (GLAS) measurements and then used\
    \ to\nestimate above-ground biomass and carbon storage. Radar\nand lidar remote-sensing\
    \ approaches hold great promise for\nreducing uncertainties in global carbon inventories,\
    \ pro-\nviding direct observations of the three-dimensional struc-\nture of above-ground\
    \ vegetation that can be used to rather\nstraight-forwardly calculate global terrestrial\
    \ carbon storage\nin above-ground biomass. Remote-sensing techniques are,\nhowever,\
    \ unable to measure below-ground biomass and car-\nbon in soil.\nBiophysical and\
    \ phenological parameters\nOn the ground, photosynthetically active radiation\
    \ (PAR) is\nmonitored at many FLUXNET sites and fewer ecological re-\nsearch sites.\
    \ In the AMERIFLUX eddy covariance ﬂux tower\nnetwork (http://public.ornl.gov/ameriﬂux/)\
    \ PAR sensors are\ncalibrated to quality assurance laboratory standards (Law et\n\
    al., 2008a). The fraction of photosynthetically active radia-\ntion absorbed by\
    \ vegetation (FAPAR) is an important param-\neter in land surface simulation of\
    \ carbon (and water, energy)\nﬂuxes, especially in light-use efﬁciency models\
    \ (Sellers et\nal., 1997; Running et al., 2004; Myneni et al., 2002) that\nestimate\
    \ photosynthesis using this parameter. Many remote-\nsensing products have been\
    \ available for more than a decade\n(Gobron et al., 2010; Knyazikhin et al., 1998;\
    \ Plummer et\nal., 2006; Pinty et al., 2007). The leaf area index (LAI) is the\n\
    one-sided total area of green leaf material per m2 and is used\nto parameterize\
    \ interception and photosynthesis models.\nIn addition, the land surface albedo\
    \ is recognized as an\nimportant ancillary variable for terrestrial carbon studies.\n\
    Albedo corresponds to the ratio of the radiant ﬂux reﬂected\nfrom the Earth surface\
    \ to the incident ﬂux and controls the\nplanetary radiative energy budget as well\
    \ as the partitioning\nof radiative energy between the atmospheric and surface\
    \ lay-\ners.\nMany remote-sensing products have been available for\nmore than\
    \ a decade (Gobron et al., 2010; Knyazikhin et al.,\n1998; Plummer et al., 2006;\
    \ Pinty et al., 2007). Various space\nremote-sensing albedo products derived from\
    \ optical sen-\nsors are currently available at both regional and global scales\n\
    (Schaaf et al., 2008).\nLAI for only a relatively small number of vegetation\n\
    classes and FAPAR are generated as global products by space\nagencies and other\
    \ institutional providers as a global product\nat various spatial resolutions\
    \ for daily to monthly periods,\nusing optical space-borne sensors (Myneni et\
    \ al., 2002; Go-\nbron and Verstraete, 2009). When tested against local site\n\
    measurements, there are large discrepancies between differ-\nent LAI products,\
    \ as shown, for instance, in Garrigues et\nal. (2008). Note that there are also\
    \ uncertainties in measuring\nLAI on the ground – that is, it is largely an indirect\
    \ measure-\nment, with large uncertainty at ﬁeld scale. New efforts with\nweb-cams\
    \ may provide a solution to monitoring canopies in\nthe ﬁeld for comparison to\
    \ remote sensing. Surface albedo,\ntransmittance, and FAPAR derived from remote-sensing\
    \ ob-\nservations are not spatially and temporally consistent with\neach other,\
    \ limiting applications that use data assimilation\ntechniques. The compatibility\
    \ of LAI products with the spe-\nciﬁc requirements of models, especially in the\
    \ context of data\nassimilation systems is not assessed. For instance, the frac-\n\
    tions of scattered and absorbed radiant ﬂuxes cannot be used\ntogether with the\
    \ retrieved values of LAI, because this yields\nerroneous descriptions of the\
    \ redistribution of energy within\nthe vegetation layer (Pinty et al., 2007).\
    \ Long time series of\nland remote-sensing parameters are relevant for monitoring\n\
    the seasonality of vegetation, which is crucial to account for\nthe seasonality\
    \ of the atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Piao\net al., 2008; Keeling et al., 1996)\
    \ and the terrestrial compo-\nnent of the carbon cycle (White et al., 1999).\n\
    Recently, Joiner at al. (2011) and Frankenberg et al. (2011)\nsucceeded in deriving\
    \ plant ﬂuorescence using high spec-\ntrally resolved solar Fraunhofer lines from\
    \ earth radiance\ndata measured with GOSAT. The data shows good correla-\ntion\
    \ with GPP. Chlorophyll ﬂuorescence provides therefore\ndirect observational constraints\
    \ on GPP which opens a new\nviewpoint on the global carbon cycle. Future missions\
    \ which\ncover the spectral range of the O2 A-Band and includes solar\nFraunhofer\
    \ lines with sufﬁcient high spectral resolution like\nOCO-2, GOSAT-2 or CarbonSat\
    \ will also provide this infor-\nmation when launched. The cross validation or\
    \ calibration of\ndifferent data products may help to explore more uniformed\n\
    vegetation traits and key satellite-based parameters of terres-\ntrial productivity\
    \ in the future.\nBiogeosciences, 11, 3547–3602, 2014\nwww.biogeosciences.net/11/3547/2014/\n\
    P. Ciais et al.: Current systematic carbon-cycle observations\n3565\nBiomass\n\
    Until recently, remote-sensing-based estimates of above-\nground biomass and carbon\
    \ storage have been limited to\napproximations based on (1) combining remotely\
    \ sensed\nland cover type with biomass measurements derived from in\nsitu inventory\
    \ samples and (2) the sensitivity of radar scat-\ntering to biomass in low to\
    \ medium biomass ecosystems.\nRadar sensitivity to canopy biomass ceases for moderate\
    \ to\ndense canopies where the signal no longer penetrates through\nthe entire\
    \ canopy. This saturation level depends on the fre-\nquency, the polarization\
    \ mode, incidence angle, the type of\nforest, foliage structure, and moisture\
    \ conditions. As a result,\na wide range of sensitivities has been reported, but\
    \ rarely\ndoes the sensitivity exceed 100 Mg ha−1 for L-band polari-\nmetric algorithms\
    \ (Kasischke et al., 1997; Mitchard et al.,\n2012). The Phased Array type L-band\
    \ Synthetic Aperture\nRadar (PALSAR) instrument on Advanced Land Observing\nSatellite\
    \ (ALOS) builds on the Japanese Earth Resources\nSatellite (JERS-1) L-band Synthetic\
    \ Aperture Radar (SAR)\ntechnology, provided the ﬁrst systematic global observations\n\
    for generating forest change and derived biomass maps, but\nfailed in 2011. A\
    \ replacement satellite is planned.\nWhile there is currently no satellite instrument\
    \ in space\nspeciﬁcally designed to map global forest biomass, recent\nadvances\
    \ in active remote-sensing technologies demonstrate\nthe possibility of high-resolution,\
    \ globally consistent esti-\nmates of aboveground biomass and carbon stocks with\
    \ sig-\nniﬁcantly reduced uncertainties in the estimates. Remote-\nsensing techniques\
    \ integrating space-borne imaging and\nairborne lidar with pattern recognition\
    \ methods (e.g. the\nCarnegie LANDSAT Analysis System Lite – CLASLITE;\nwww.claslite.ciw.edu/)\
    \ have demonstrated a strong capa-\nbility for tracking and quantifying biomass\
    \ and structural\nchanges in forest undergoing deforestation at the national and\n\
    county scale (Asner et al., 2010). Forest height and canopy\nproﬁle metrics have\
    \ been derived from the Geoscience Laser\nAltimeter System (GLAS) on the ICESat\
    \ satellite and used\nto estimate aboveground biomass (Lefsky et al., 2005). ICE-\n\
    Sat height samples and MODIS data have been merged to\ncreate the ﬁrst global\
    \ canopy height product (Lefsky, 2010).\nICESat, MODIS, QuikScat, and Shuttle\
    \ Radar Topography\nMission (SRTM) data have been used to spatially extrapolate\n\
    ICESat observations and create a benchmark map of carbon\nstorage, along with\
    \ uncertainties, for tropical forests (Baccini\net al., 2012; Saatchi et al.,\
    \ 2011). Comparison of these maps,\nhowever, shows signiﬁcant differences indicating\
    \ uncertainty\nin the data processing methods. Further, these maps are not\ntemporally\
    \ discrete (data from multiple years were used), and\nthe main source of data,\
    \ from ICEsat, no longer exists. A\nreplacement mission may be launched in 2016.\
    \ Preliminary\nresults using polarimetric interferometric SAR (PolInSAR)\napproaches\
    \ have demonstrated sensitivity to biomass in some\nhigh-biomass ecosystems (Treuhaft\
    \ et al., 2003; Hajnsek and\nPapathannassiou, 2009).\nSeveral research programs\
    \ are underway to implement\nthe use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as well\
    \ as air-\nborne/spaceborne lidar, to derive estimates of vegetation\naboveground\
    \ biomass (e.g. Saatchi et al., 2007). Satellite\nmissions such as the BIOMASS\
    \ P-band radar of European\nSpace Agency (ESA) (Le Toan et al., 2011) or a concept\n\
    based upon the Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and Dy-\nnamics of Ice (DESDynI)\
    \ mission of the National Aeronau-\ntics and Space Administration (NASA) (Hall\
    \ et al., 2011;\nwww.desdyni.jpl.nasa.gov/) are currently being considered\nfor\
    \ this purpose.\nLand cover and land cover change\nSeveral land cover data products\
    \ based upon visible satel-\nlite data at a resolution of 1 km or better are available.\
    \ For\nexample, the ESA GLOBCOVER project has released a\nglobal map of 300 m\
    \ spatial resolution using MERIS data\n(Arino et al., 2008) both for the year\
    \ 2005 and recently 2009,\nand this is being comprehensively revisited in the\
    \ ESA Cli-\nmate Change Initiative (CCI) Program (www.esa-cci.org).\nMODIS land\
    \ cover product provides maps at 1 km spatial\nresolution (Friedl et al., 2002).\
    \ However these two prod-\nucts cannot be compared to detect land cover change.\
    \ Global\nchanges in forest cover have been derived from AVHRR\nat decadal increments\
    \ (Hansen et al., 2003) and MODIS\nat ﬁve-year increments (Hansen et al., 2010).\
    \ In some re-\ngions, particularly tropical forests of the Amazon basin, de-\n\
    forestation is monitored on a regular basis using the INPE\nPRODES (Instituto\
    \ Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais, Mon-\nitoramento Da Floresta Amazonica Brasilieira\
    \ Por Satel-\nlite) system (www.obt.inpe.br/prodes/), though most tropical\ncountries\
    \ do not have operational forest monitoring systems\nin place (DeFries et al.,\
    \ 2007). Most land cover analysis to\ndate has relied on low-resolution (> 300\
    \ m) satellite-based\noptical data.\nSatellite observations using Synthetic Aperture\
    \ Radar\n(SAR) are also beginning to provide land-surface informa-\ntion, in particular\
    \ over cloud-affected regions in the tropics\nand high latitudes, where optical\
    \ data are sparse. A system-\natic acquisition strategy was developed for the\
    \ ALOS L-band\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) for global tracking of\nland\
    \ use change. Up to its failure in 2011, ALOS-PALSAR\nprovided ﬁve years of systematic\
    \ global forest (and wetland)\nobservations and the ﬁrst systematic global observations\
    \ for\ngenerating forest change as well as derived biomass maps in\nlow biomass\
    \ zones (Saatchi et al., 2011). The GEO-initiated\nGlobal Forest Observation Initiative\
    \ (GFOI) aims to provide\nbetter access to Landsat-resolution optical and imaging\
    \ radar\ndata worldwide in support of REDD+ projects and/or na-\ntional Measurement,\
    \ Reporting and Veriﬁcation (MRV) pro-\ngrams. There is, however, no current capacity\
    \ to generate\nrepeated global biomass maps for determination of biomass\nchange\
    \ (Houghton et al., 2009). Such a capacity will better\nconstrain the magnitude\
    \ of land carbon storage changes, of\nwww.biogeosciences.net/11/3547/2014/\nBiogeosciences,\

    and their locations.\nNew analyses using temporally dense time series (i.e. an-\n\
    nual intervals) of Landsat imagery are beginning to be used\nto create continental-scale\
    \ land cover maps over the Land-\nsat data record (1972–present) that quantify\
    \ the extent and\nrecovery associated with forest disturbance (Masek et al.,\n\
    2008). These products are providing new insights in to the\ncarbon dynamics associated\
    \ with disturbance and recovery\nprocesses (Goward et al., 2008). While currently\
    \ limited to\nNorth America, it should be possible to extend this work\nglobally.\
    \ In related research, a ﬁrst continental-scale forest\nage map of the United\
    \ States and Canada was established by\ncombining this Landsat disturbance record\
    \ with forest inven-\ntory data, historical ﬁre data, and other optical satellite\
    \ data\n(Pan et al., 2011b). Forest age, related to time since distur-\nbance,\
    \ can be a useful surrogate in analyses of the impact\nof disturbance on the ability\
    \ of forests to sequester and store\ncarbon.\nFires\nThe AVHRR ﬁre record goes\
    \ back to 1982, providing the\nlongest global record of ﬁre but the data are sparse\
    \ and in-\ncomplete. The European Space Agency (ESA) World Fire\nAtlas (Arino\
    \ and Plummer, 2001; Arino et al., 2012), pro-\nvides another long continuous\
    \ global record of active ﬁres\nusing the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR)\
    \ instru-\nment, and has recently been upgraded using a new nighttime\nalgorithm\
    \ and extended back to 1991. Other polar orbiting\nsatellites, such as Advanced\
    \ Very High Resolution Radiome-\nter (NOAA-AVHRR), Visible and Infrared Scanner\
    \ (VIRS)\non board the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM),\nand geostationary\
    \ satellites (Meteosat Second Generation\n(MSG); Geostationary Operational Environmental\
    \ Satellites\n(GOES)) extend these observations to better characterize the\ndiurnal\
    \ cycle of active ﬁres (Pu et al., 2007; Ji and Stocker,\n2002; Beaudoin et al.,\
    \ 2007). MODIS is currently the best\npolar orbiting sensor for this phenomenon,\
    \ measuring both\nactive ﬁres and burned areas (Giglio et al., 2003). However,\n\
    landscape analysis indicates that Landsat derived ﬁre prod-\nucts (e.g. Monitoring\
    \ Trends in Burn Severity – MTBS) are\nmore reliable for burned area and severity,\
    \ partly due to the\nspatial resolution of the data that is appropriate for the\
    \ patch-\niness of ﬁres (Meigs et al., 2011). For ﬁre radiative energy\n(FRE),\
    \ which can be used as a direct proxy of CO2 emis-\nsions (Freeborn et al., 2008;\
    \ Roberts and Wooster, 2008;\nWooster et al., 2003, 2005), Spinning Enhanced Visible\
    \ and\nInfrared Imager (SEVIRI) onboard MSG and MODIS have\ndemonstrated the capability\
    \ to make measurements to the re-\nquired speciﬁcations. FRE products from SEVIRI\
    \ are gen-\nerated every 15 min over Africa, Europe, and part of South\nAmerica;\
    \ with operational production at the European Or-\nganisation for the Exploitation\
    \ of Meteorological Satellites\n(EUMETSAT) Land Satellite Applications Facility\
    \ (Land-\nSAF) (http://landsaf.meteo.pt/). Such products are already\nbeing used\
    \ for ﬁre emission calculations within the European\nMedium Range Weather Forecasting\
    \ (ECMWF) system and\nsteps are being taken to integrate FRE data from the con-\n\
    stellation of geostationary meteorological satellites into the\nsystem (Kaiser\
    \ et al., 2012).\nIntegrated ﬁre emission products are based upon satellite-\n\
    based ﬁre data incorporated in ecosystem models. The\nGlobal Fire Emission Database,\
    \ GFED (Van der Werf et\nal., 2003); www.globalﬁredata.org), is an integrated\
    \ prod-\nuct, combining MODIS, ATSR, and VIRS satellite products\nof ﬁre activity\

    \ species from 1997 to the present (van der\nWerf et al., 2010). Other products\
    \ also exist, but, even if the\nspatial and temporal pattern of ﬁres is relatively\
    \ well doc-\numented, the uncertainties in global ﬁre emission estimates\nremain\
    \ substantial (Csiszar et al., 2009). An assessment of\nemissions estimates from\
    \ several ﬁre emission products, in-\ncluding GFED, showed differences in model\
    \ assumptions,\nincluding canopy consumption and changes in fuel mois-\nture,\
    \ were the main causes of uncertainties, and results varied\nby location, vegetation\

    The GCP has also established a ﬁrst synthesis (RECCAP;\nBiogeosciences, 11, 3547–3602,\

    \ bottom-\nup and top-down CO2 ﬂuxes decadal-scale estimates over\nlarge regions\
    \ of the globe, but there is no operational plan to\nrevisit this effort periodically.\n\
    3.7\nData delivery and archiving\nCurrently, there is no single system for the\
    \ operational dis-\nsemination and archiving of carbon-cycle observations and\n\
    data products. But there are several systems in parallel ar-\neas on which one\
    \ can draw. Both seismology and meteorol-\nogy have operational networks for automatic\
    \ data dissemina-\ntion. These have evolved over decades in response to obvi-\n\
    ous needs, characterized by global cooperative governance,\ncomplete openness\
    \ of data and no-cost access. Such global\nnetworks usually lag the state of the\
    \ art in technology since\nglobal accessibility is a requirement. The meteorological\
    \ net-\nwork is currently undergoing a major upgrade to take account\nof contemporary\
    \ networking technology (the existing system\npredated the internet). Such networks\
    \ also require careful\noversight and speciﬁcation of standards for data interchange.\n\
    A parallel development has occurred as a by-product\nof the extension of numerical\
    \ weather prediction schemes\nto include atmospheric tracers (including GHGs).\
    \ The\ndevelopment of the Global Monitoring of Environment and\nSecurity (GMES)\
    \ Atmospheric Service (Hollingsworth et\nal., 2008), now Copernicus (European\
    \ Earth Observation\nProgramme,\nhttp://www.copernicus.eu/pages-principales/\n\
    services/atmosphere-monitoring/) and land surface carbon\nmodeling efforts (Boussetta\
    \ et al., 2013), requires that the\nﬁelds generated by the assimilation system\
    \ be distributed\nto end-users and hence an extension of the list of variables\n\
    carried on this network. This could serve as a point of\ndeparture for a carbon-cycle\
    \ network.\nSome properties of existing global networks may not carry\nover easily\
    \ to a carbon-cycle system. Various trace gas ob-\nservations are used in verifying\
    \ compliance with air qual-\nity directives and these are governed by special\
    \ conﬁden-\ntiality provisions in the data sharing agreements, usually in-\nvolving\
    \ delays (but not prevention) in public availability.\nShould any international\
    \ enforcement of mitigation agree-\nments come into play, the same arrangements\
    \ may be nec-\nessary for carbon-cycle observations.\n4\nKey elements required\
    \ for a policy-relevant global\ncarbon observing system\nThis section outlines\
    \ a set of needs/attributes for a global car-\nbon monitoring system (or system\
    \ of systems) that can be\nbuilt in the next decade based on existing or known\
    \ technol-\nogy. It begins with a set of general system attributes/caveats.\n\
    It is followed by a gap analysis and the formulation of spe-\nciﬁc requirements\
    \ organized for anthropogenic emissions,\natmosphere, oceans, terrestrial ecosystems,\
    \ and “hot spots”\nsuch as vulnerable pools or ﬂuxes in the natural cycle of CO2\n\
    and CH4.\nFinally, the carbon cycle does not operate in isolation. It\nis intimately\
    \ linked to other global cycles of water, nitrogen,\nphosphorus, oxygen, and also\
    \ the global climate system, that\nmust be studied to fully understand the carbon\
    \ system. It is\nbeyond the scope of this document to identify the aspects of\n\
    these other cycles that are most critical, but it is anticipated\nthat a wide\
    \ ﬁeld of related studies will need to be linked to a\ncarbon observing system.\n\
    4.1\nGeneral attributes\nA carbon observation and analysis system relevant for\
    \ policy\nefﬁcacy will need to differentiate (factor out) the large, rela-\ntively\
    \ non-linear natural source and sink processes from the\nanthropogenic emissions.\
    \ It should also monitor the short and\nlong-term efﬁcacy, or speciﬁc beneﬁcial/negative\
    \ impacts of\nclimate mitigation policies and measures at global, national,\n\
    provincial state, and perhaps down to city scales. It will\nneed to identify the\
    \ activities, types and sources of emissions\n(i.e. measure separately fossil\
    \ fuel emissions, ocean and land\nbiosphere ﬂuxes). For the latter, it should\
    \ be able to track the\nactivities associated with agricultural and forest CO2\
    \ sources\nand sinks, and CH4 emissions, by detecting relatively small\ndepartures\
    \ from reference levels.\nFirst, an operational global carbon monitoring system\
    \ will\nhave to be grounded in observations that are sustained, and\nminimize\
    \ gaps. Given the need to track long-term trends in\ncarbon ﬂuxes and pools over\
    \ several decades, the observa-\ntional ground and satellite networks must be\
    \ designed and\nfunded to offer continuity of critical data records. This ro-\n\
    bustness and sustainability has implications on reliability and\nredundancy of\
    \ individual system elements, as well as con-\ntingency response options (particularly\
    \ for long-turnaround\nsatellites) in the form of spares and rapid re-deployment\
    \ ca-\npability. These attributes are more common with contem-\nporary weather\
    \ observing systems than current exploratory\ncarbon-cycle science assets.\nSecond,\
    \ information products generated by such a system\nwill have to obey a high standard\
    \ of accuracy, with careful\nquantiﬁcation of uncertainty (if possible, documentation\
    \ of\nknown biases and random errors), and be open to and able to\nwithstand intense\
    \ scrutiny. Rigorous and relentless attention\nto bias and other systematic errors\
    \ introduced by observa-\ntions, models, or interpretation must be a key feature\
    \ of any\nglobal monitoring system. Provisions for sustained and reg-\nular intercomparison\
    \ and calibration between observational\nassets and between models must be a core\
    \ provision of the\nsystem. And thus, there needs to be substantial effort in\
    \ quan-\ntifying (with adequate data accuracy reporting) what the ref-\nerence\
    \ levels are, especially if the anticipated deviations will\nbe small. Representativeness\
    \ error should also be the object\nof detailed case studies, given speciﬁc attributes\
    \ (e.g. resolu-\ntion) of models used to assimilate data.\nwww.biogeosciences.net/11/3547/2014/\n\

    \ carbon-cycle observations\nThird, in order to be useful in providing independent\
    \ vali-\ndation of policy efﬁcacy, an integrated carbon observing sys-\ntem will\
    \ have to incorporate mechanisms for comparing and\nreconciling the information\
    \ produced by the observing and\nanalysis system with other information sources\
    \ used as pri-\nmary policy instruments. For example, estimates of emis-\nsions\
    \ derived from atmospheric inversions will only prove\nrelevant as checks on reported\
    \ emission inventories if the\ntwo estimates can be compared or combined within\
    \ a consis-\ntent statistical framework/spatiotemporal resolution. A key\nattribute\
    \ of the system must therefore be a comprehensive\napproach to uncertainty quantiﬁcation\
    \ and propagation. This\nrequires end-to-end transparency and traceability in\
    \ the form\nof open access to the raw observational data, calibration and\nvalidation\
    \ data, core models and analysis software, interme-\ndiate and ﬁnal data products,\
    \ and documentation describing\nthe processes and procedures for collecting, assimilating,\
    \ and\nanalyzing the data. All information products must include\nmetadata to\
    \ support traceability and independent reconstruc-\ntion of the production process.\n\
    In addition to robust products, a policy-relevant carbon ob-\nserving system will\
    \ need to include services in the form of\nproviding sustained end-user access\
    \ to expert practitioners\ninvolved in data collection, modeling, data assimilation,\
    \ and\nanalysis. The observing system will have to meet the needs\nof operational\
    \ agencies as well as those of research. Of these,\noperational requirements are\
    \ probably more stringent or, at\nleast, require more precise deﬁnition.\n– All\
    \ data must be associated with as much information\nas possible on their uncertainty\
    \ (bias wherever possi-\nble and random errors). This goes beyond measures like\n\
    precision since most types of data are subject to sys-\ntematic errors. Thus,\
    \ there must be enough metadata to\nassign each datum to a class for consistent\
    \ bias correc-\ntion.\n– Metadata must be sufﬁcient to allow automatic and valid\n\
    comparison with model output. This means supplement-\ning location information\
    \ with descriptions of space–\ntime averaging, weighting functions, etc. Data\
    \ must ad-\nhere precisely to standard formats. Most automatic sys-\ntems for\
    \ ingesting data include an error-checking com-\nponent which rejects data that\
    \ might be corrupted by in-\nstrument or transmission error and these can only\
    \ work\nreliably when valid data is guaranteed to be correctly\nformatted. Given\
    \ the heterogeneity of providers that\nwill be required to ﬁll the data requirements\
    \ listed above\nthis is a very large task in training and software devel-\nopment.\n\
    – The system must also serve the needs of researchers, so\ndata must be globally\
    \ catalogued with sufﬁcient infor-\nmation for knowledge discovery and exploratory\
    \ analy-\nsis.\n– Where possible, information from the observing system\nshould\
    \ also support operational decisions for local car-\nbon management trigged by\
    \ more aggregate incentive\nschemes.\n4.2\nNeeds for effective interactions with\
    \ the policy\ncommunity\nAn integrated global carbon observing system to support\
    \ cli-\nmate policies will only be relevant and adopted by end-users\nif the system\
    \ developers make an early and sustained effort\nto engage those stakeholders\
    \ (research councils, project de-\nvelopers, companies, policymakers, regional\
    \ authorities and\ncities authorities). A critical precursor to developing detailed\n\
    policy-relevant requirements for future observing and anal-\nysis systems is to\
    \ craft well-posed questions to ensure the\nright issues are being addressed.\
    \ One should expect the need\nto periodically re-evaluate end-user needs as policies\
    \ are im-\nplemented and evaluated, and we learn more about the carbon\ncycle\
    \ and the coupling between it and anthropogenic activity.\nThis engagement between\
    \ the science community, engineers,\nand end users has started, but at present\
    \ a consensus set of\nrequirements does not exist. This is particularly true for\
    \ in-\nformation needs associated with policy compliance assess-\nments. These\
    \ involve agreements with signiﬁcant economic\nand political implications and\
    \ the long-term forms of such\nagreements are not yet clear.\nIn the meantime,\
    \ in order to help set the context/scope\nof a global carbon monitoring system,\
    \ we present the fol-\nlowing summary of anticipated requirements based on stake-\n\
    holders involvement, and assessment of what will be needed\nto support policy\
    \ efﬁcacy assessments and climate adapta-\ntion assessments. Requirements for\
    \ policy efﬁcacy and cli-\nmate adaptation assessments are perhaps more straightfor-\n\
    ward to deﬁne than compliance assessments. The former are\nstrictly concerned\
    \ with whether a given policy is meeting\nthe intended end-objective of limiting\
    \ greenhouse gas con-\ncentrations in the atmosphere, which is primarily a scientiﬁc\n\
    question of “what are the carbon stocks and ﬂuxes on spa-\ntiotemporal scales\
    \ with sufﬁcient resolution and precision to\nattribute their causes”. This is\
    \ quite distinct from verifying\npolicy compliance with negotiated legal language\
    \ from in-\nternational agreements or national legislation. We acknowl-\nedge\
    \ that the observational requirement for compliance mon-\nitoring must be revisited\
    \ once we can frame it. In addition\nto policies informing observing strategies,\
    \ ideally, more efﬁ-\ncient future policies and mitigation strategies will be\
    \ crafted,\nwith knowledge of what is objectively quantiﬁable by a glob-\nally\
    \ integrated observation system.\nAs a contribution towards national-level Measurement,\n\
    Reporting and Veriﬁcation (MRV) systems and policy, as\nwell as reporting to the\
    \ UNFCCC, a global carbon observ-\ning system will need to have the necessary\
    \ spatial resolu-\ntion to accommodate, where possible, the constraints that na-\n\
    tional governments have in terms of the scales and temporal\nBiogeosciences, 11,\
    \ 3547–3602, 2014\nwww.biogeosciences.net/11/3547/2014/\nP. Ciais et al.: Current\
    \ systematic carbon-cycle observations\n3569\naggregation of their emissions estimates\
    \ (Baker et al., 2010).\nNational governments also need to regularly provide access\n\
    to dedicated United Nations (UN) review panels and build\nsystems, which are sufﬁciently\
    \ transparent in terms of mod-\nels and observational data. This may complicate\
    \ the inter-\nfacing between global/regional carbon assessments from an\nobserving\
    \ system and the bottom-up national emissions ac-\ncounting approaches required\
    \ by the UN review teams, hence\nthe need of early/sustained stakeholders involvement.\n\
    4.3\nSpatiotemporal resolution of carbon ﬂux products\nand pool products\nThis\
    \ section addresses the performance attributes of the prod-\nucts that would be\
    \ delivered to decision-makers, rather than\nthose of the observations from which\
    \ they are inferred (cov-\nered in succeeding sections). The precision and space–time\n\
    resolution needed for global observing system products de-\npends on their intended\
    \ end use. For example, as a short-term\nobjective, generation of weekly CO2 and\
    \ CH4 ﬂuxes over\nthe globe with spatial resolution of 100–500 km over land\n\
    (i.e. covering the territory of large countries) and 1000 km\nover the ocean (i.e.\
    \ the scale of gyres inﬂuenced by coher-\nent circulation changes) would enable\
    \ estimates of interan-\nnual, ﬂuxes, and over time, to reduce uncertainty on\
    \ decadal\nmean ﬂuxes. Typical error reduction by a factor of two com-\npared\
    \ to current ﬂux diagnostics seem to be achievable by at-\nmospheric inversions\
    \ using existing dense atmospheric net-\nworks in some regions (Broquet et al.,\
    \ 2013) for the ICOS\nnetwork. This performance should be achievable in a ﬁrst\n\
    phase, in the next 5–10 years, if funding is provided to greatly\nincrease the\
    \ spatiotemporal density of coordinated ground-\nbased and space-based observations\
    \ and integrate them in\ndata assimilation systems with rigorous attention to\
    \ error\npropagation. Given uncertainty in the structure of carbon-\ncycle models,\
    \ it is preferable that several data assimilation\nmodels can be applied to the\
    \ problem.\nIn a second phase, within 10–15 years, depending upon the\nregion\
    \ considered, provision of weekly CO2 and CH4 ﬂuxes\nover the globe with spatial\
    \ resolution of 50–100 km over\nland and 500 km over the ocean should be a target.\
    \ At these\nscales, ﬂux uncertainties in the range of 20–50 g C m−2 yr−1\nfor\
    \ CO2 (1-sigma uncertainty) will be necessary to provide\nassessments of natural\
    \ ﬂuxes with a precision of 2 to 3 times\ngreater than current estimates. Fossil\
    \ fuel CO2 emissions will\nneed to be measured at a smaller spatial scale (1–10\
    \ km) at\na typical precision of 20–50 g C m−2 yr−1. This scale is ap-\npropriate\
    \ for high-resolution atmospheric models applied to,\nfor example, urban emissions\
    \ (McKain et al., 2012). Assess-\ning emission trends will depend on the magnitude\
    \ of local\ntrends and variability and the time allowed for measuring\nchanges.\
    \ Maintaining long-term accuracy will be more im-\nportant than reaching high\
    \ precision with biases, in this con-\ntext. It is likely that monitoring emission\
    \ trends will require a\nhigher accuracy than 10 g C m−2 yr−1 in regions where\
    \ those\ntrends are small. The cost of a high-accuracy system will in-\ncrease\
    \ dramatically with increasing precision, so careful re-\nturn on investment analysis\
    \ is needed to evaluate the value\nof completeness and its dependence on sensitivity\
    \ of the ob-\nserving system (Fig. 9).\nA consistent global framework will have\
    \ to be im-\nplemented to include the different components and inte-\ngrate them.\
    \ This is needed to carry out internal consis-\ntency checks and assessments/attribution\
    \ of greenhouse gas\nbudgets and emission reductions. Finer spatial resolution\n\
    will likely be needed for assessing emissions of individ-\nual cities or sites\
    \ (0.1 to 10 km), project-based carbon se-\nquestration/conservation monitoring\
    \ (0.1 to 1000 ha), mech-\nanistic studies of disturbance events such as drought\
    \ or\nﬁre impacts on carbon budgets (0.1 to 1000 ha). For urban\nﬂux estimates\
    \ (at ∼ 1 km scale), random uncertainties of\n100 g C m−2 yr−1 should be sufﬁcient\
    \ to measure the instan-\ntaneous value of ﬂuxes (typically 5–10 000 g C m−2 yr−1).\n\
    These advances will require further major improvements in\nobservational densities\
    \ and advances in modeling, including\nﬂux up-scaling algorithms, small-scale\
    \ atmospheric transport\nmodels and pertaining assimilation schemes. Such goals\
    \ will\nwarrant longer-term investments in observational and com-\nputing facilities\
    \ as well as an expanded community of people\ntrained with the necessary skill\
    \ set. Alternatively and perhaps\nadditionally, prioritized nested sampling in\
    \ high-priority ar-\neas (e.g. megacities, industrial regions) may be necessary\
    \ to\naccelerate and focus coverage.\nIn all cases, the complex interplay between\
    \ spatiotempo-\nral resolution and precision of an information product re-\nquires\
    \ optimization to achieve the best ﬁt with the desired\nend-use. Optimization\
    \ requires the use of numerical analysis\n(e.g. Hungershoefer et al., 2010) to\
    \ study the parameter space\nfor each end-use scenario. In the following sections,\
    \ we pro-\nvide notional requirements for each component of a future\nglobal carbon\
    \ observing system that could be assembled in\nthe next decade. These requirements\
    \ have been obtained by\nworkshops and web-based consultation of an international\n\
    community of more than 100 researchers and agency rep-\nresentatives, as part\
    \ of the preparation of the GEO Carbon\nObserving Strategy Report (Ciais et al.,\
    \ 2010).\n4.4\nAnthropogenic emissions information needs\n4.4.1\nAnthropogenic\
    \ CO2 and CH4emissions products,\nbased upon inventories\nEmissions of CO2 from\
    \ fossil fuel combustion occur at a va-\nriety of temporal and spatial scales.\
    \ Temporally, some emit-\nters (e.g., power plants) can be relatively constant\
    \ over min-\nutes to hours, while others are quite variable (e.g., buses)\nover\
    \ the same timescales. All react to the rhythms of soci-\nety and may increase\
    \ or decrease emissions depending on if\nit is a workday, rest day, or holiday.\
    \ These daily dependencies\nare a function of local/national customs and vary\
    \ around the\nwww.biogeosciences.net/11/3547/2014/\nBiogeosciences, 11, 3547–3602,\
    \ 2014\n3570\nP. Ciais et al.: Current systematic carbon-cycle observations\n\
    world. On top of all this, are the short-term variations from\nday–night cycles\
    \ and weather, and longer-term perturbations\nbrought on by the change in seasons.\
    \ Spatially, some emitters\nare ﬁxed (e.g., the tall stacks of power plants) and\
    \ others are\nmobile (e.g., vehicles). Individual, ﬁxed-location emitters are\n\
    the largest single source of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.\nMobile sources\
    \ collectively account for a signiﬁcant fraction\nof fossil CO2 emissions (roughly\
    \ one-quarter of the total)\n(EDGAR emission data set, http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu).\
    \ It\nwill not be achievable in the next decade for cost and report-\ning reasons\
    \ to put a sensor for CO2 and CH4 on every fos-\nsil fuel combustor. However,\
    \ there are strong relationships\nbetween the types of fuel combusted, how they\
    \ are com-\nbusted, and resulting CO2 and CH4 emissions. These rela-\ntionships\
    \ form the basis of the currently prevalent statistical\nbasis for accounting\
    \ emissions (as the Carbon Dioxide Infor-\nmation Analysis Center - CDIAC and\
    \ the International En-\nergy Agency – IEA do for national, annual CO2 emissions).\n\
    This presently accepted methodology, however, is likely in-\nsufﬁcient for approaching\
    \ the temporal and spatial scales\nnecessary for a global carbon observing system\
    \ that would\nserve the policy and scientiﬁc goals of such a system. The\nreason\
    \ for this insufﬁciency is the lack of statistical data at\nthe relevant temporal\
    \ and spatial scales for all emitters.\nTo improve estimates of global fossil\
    \ fuel emissions and\nutilize those emissions estimates within forward and inverse\n\
    carbon-cycle modeling, emissions estimation and uncertain-\nties at a resolution\
    \ of 1 km, hourly over the globe, is needed.\nThis scale is policy relevant in\
    \ the context for instance of\ncity-scale mitigation projects and/or trading mechanisms.\
    \ It\nis also scientiﬁcally relevant since it is the typical scale at\nwhich meso-scale\
    \ models can be run with inventories to\nbe checked against independent atmospheric\
    \ concentration\nmeasurements. Meeting this objective will require:\n1. Comprehensive,\
    \ consistent, national-level energy (fuel)\nconsumption data of the best possible\
    \ precision such as\nthat achievable in some countries today (3–5 %), partic-\n\
    ularly from developing countries. Where possible, sub-\nnational fuel data (states;\
    \ provinces; counties) energy\nconsumption data will be desirable.\n2. Sectorial\
    \ details (residential, commercial, industrial,\nelectricity production, on-road,\
    \ non-road, air travel, ce-\nment) and fuel types details (different types of\
    \ coal, oil,\ngas fuels) at the national level and at sub-national level.\n3.\
    \ Information on the spatial distribution of CO2 emissions\nfrom (bunker) fuels\
    \ consumed in international commer-\ncial transport.\n4. Improved estimation of\
    \ the temporal variability of fos-\nsil fuel CO2 emissions. Generally, better\
    \ quantiﬁcation\nof the diurnal, weekly and seasonal cycles of emissions\nwill\
    \ allow for better interpretation of the fossil fuel\nsignal in the atmosphere\
    \ for speciﬁc economic sectors\n(e.g. diurnal and weekly on-road transportation).\n\
    5. Improved estimation of spatial variability of fossil fuel\nCO2 emissions from\
    \ the transportation sector with fuel\ndata (see 2.) and improved Geographic Information\n\
    System (GIS) road networks and monitoring of traf-\nﬁc ﬂows. This requirement\
    \ could beneﬁt from high-\nresolution satellite imagery in the visible–infrared\
    \ spec-\ntrum for evaluation against urban-scale modeling of fos-\nsil fuel consuming\
    \ activity.\n6. Improved spatiotemporal variability on ancillary com-\nbustion\
    \ emissions tracers (CO, NOx, aerosols, some\nvolatile organic compounds – VOCs)\
    \ consistent with\nthe fossil fuel CO2 emissions data\n7. Improved estimation\
    \ of temporal variability of anthro-\npogenic CH4 emissions, in particular fugitive\
    \ emissions\nrelated to extraction, distribution and use of fossil fuels,\nof\
    \ waste treatment systems (landﬁlls, water processing\nplants), and agricultural\
    \ activity (rice cultivation, rumi-\nnant densities and diet).\n8. Estimation\
    \ of sectorial emission factors fugitive emis-\nsions of CH4 from the fossil fuel\
    \ upstream sector (gas\nproduction, coal mines, gas distribution).\n9. Systematic\
    \ monitoring of large point sources at the\npoint of emissions (electricity production,\
    \ metal man-\nufacturing), including measurement of CO2 concen-\ntration and ﬂow\
    \ rate in the stack (Ackerman and\nSundquist, 2008). Additionally, estimation\
    \ of emission\ninjection heights and exit velocities and temperatures\nwill further\
    \ improve atmospheric modeling of these\nlarge sources.\n4.4.2\nAnthropogenic\

    \ and\nquantiﬁcation of uncertainties. This approach will re-\nquire reporting\
    \ of accuracy estimates, including report-\ning of biases and random errors analyses\

    \ maps such as geospatial economic activity in-\nformation, land cover, emission\

    \ are two barriers to providing policy-relevant carbon\nﬂux estimates using atmospheric\

    even rarer 14C–CH4 can be used insofar only for a global\nconstraint of fossil\
    \ CH4 emissions (Lassey et al., 2007), and\n14C–CH4 is contaminated by nuclear\
    \ power plants emissions\n(Levin et al., 1992)) atmospheric measurements and the\
    \ lack\nof systematic application of combustion tracers (e.g. CO and\nNO2) to\
    \ separate fossil fuel CO2. Second, errors associated\nwith atmospheric transport\
    \ modeling dominate the inversion\nerror budget. The ﬁrst barrier can be overcome\
    \ by increas-\ning the number of 14C observations (both in terms of collec-\n\
    tion and processing) and perhaps through concerted attention\nto data fusion and\
    \ (regularly updated) calibration of CO and\nNO2 as proxies of fossil fuel CO2\
    \ in each region (Levin and\nKarstens, 2007; Berezin et al., 2013). The second\
    \ problem is\nperhaps more challenging and will likely require a large in-\ncrease\
    \ in the density of atmospheric observations (both spa-\ntially and temporally)\
    \ for in situ and satellite observations\nas well as focused attention on reducing\
    \ errors associated\nwith surface winds, planetary boundary layer height and at-\n\
    mospheric circulation in general. These two transformational\nchanges warrant\
    \ a systematic and quantitative study to deter-\nmine the optimal mix of improvements\
    \ to observations and\nmodels. Towards ﬁlling these gaps, the following general\
    \ cat-\negories of improvements are warranted (see Sects. 3.3.1 to\n3.3.4).\n\
    4.5.1\nAtmospheric in situ surface network and aircraft\ndata\nTo achieve homogeneous\
    \ quality of ﬂux diagnostics over the\nglobe, a denser surface stations network\
    \ complemented by\naircraft vertical proﬁles is needed. Stations will need to\
    \ be\nspaced typically apart from each other to be able to constrain\nﬂuxes at\
    \ the scale of synoptic systems (Gloor et al., 2001;\nBroquet et al., 2011; Lauvaux\
    \ et al., 2012) requiring ∼ 4000\nsurface continuous-measurement stations distributed\
    \ accord-\ning to ﬂux heterogeneity across continents (Hungershoefer\net al.,\
    \ 2010) and oceans, for the later using mobile platforms\nsuch as ships of opportunity.\
    \ The biggest challenge will be to\ndevelop atmospheric measurements technology\
    \ and methods\nto measure directly the variability of fossil fuel and other an-\n\
    thropogenic emissions of CO2 and CH4. In addition, OH rad-\nicals being the biggest\
    \ sink of CH4, almost equal to the sum\nof all surface emissions. It is critical\
    \ to quantify OH, using\nproxy tracer measurements (e.g. Montzka et al., 2011).\
    \ The\ntransformational improvement of the surface network into a\nrobust, operational\
    \ system would require over the next 10\nyears the following developments:\n1.\
    \ Deployment of atmospheric CO2 and CH4 networks\naround mega-cities, calibrated\
    \ to WMO dry air mole\nfraction scale, possibly taking stock of the existing air\n\
    quality infrastructure. These data will have to be re-\nported using formats consistent\
    \ with atmospheric in situ\ndata.\n2. Development of surface atmospheric networks\
    \ with\nsynoptic density, in North America (North Ameri-\ncan Carbon Program –\
    \ NACP, http://www.nacarbon.\norg/nacp/; National Ecological Observatory Network\
    \ –\nNEON, http://www.neoninc.org/), Western Europe (In-\ntegrated Carbon Observation\
    \ System – ICOS, http://\nwww.icos-infrastructure.eu/) and China (China Meteo-\n\
    rological Administration – CMA, http://www.cma.gov.\ncn/en/), accounting for private\
    \ ventures and regional\nnetworks.\n3. Improve rapidly the coverage of critically\
    \ under-\nsampled regions (Africa, South America, South and\nSoutheast Asia, eastern\
    \ Europe and Siberia, southern\noceans).\n4. Following up step (3), develop surface\
    \ atmospheric net-\nworks over under-sampled regions with synoptic den-\nsity,\
    \ possibly by an international effort led by the\nWorld Meteorological Organization\
    \ (WMO) Global At-\nmosphere Watch (GAW). The need would be of dou-\nbling the\
    \ number of stations in under-sampled areas ev-\nery 5 years until the required\
    \ density is achieved.\n5. During the expansion of surface networks, the collec-\n\
    tion of CO2 and CH4 vertical proﬁle measurements\nwill need to be pursued, and\
    \ expanded over tropical\nregions using dedicated aircraft (Gloor et al., 2000;\n\
    Gatti et al., 2010) and/or instrumented commercial air-\ncraft (Machida el al.,\
    \ 2008; Matsueda et al., 2008) like\nComprehensive Observation Network for trace\
    \ gases\nby Airliner – CONTRAIL (http://www.cger.nies.go.jp/\ncontrail) and In-service\
    \ Aircraft for a Global Observing\nSystem – Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation\n\
    of the Atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container\n(IAGOS-CARIBIC) (www.iagos.org/).\n\
    In parallel with increasing the number of stations, measur-\ning proxy tracers\
    \ to separate either anthropogenic or natural\nemissions will be required on a\
    \ regular basis, either by ﬂask\nair samples or desirably by continuous measurements.\n\

    \ of radiocarbon (14C) sampling and\nanalysis (cf. Box 4.2 in Pacala et al., 2010).\n\
    2. Measurement of proxy-tracers associated with anthro-\npogenic emission processes:\
    \ combustion tracers CO,\nNO2 for fossil fuel CO2, halocarbon, C2Cl4 and hydro-\n\
    carbon species, and C2H6 and C3H8 for fossil fuel CH4\n(e.g. Levin and Karstens,\
    \ 2007; Berezin et al., 2013).\n3. Sustained and increased collection of tracers\
    \ related to\nthe identiﬁcation/process attribution of natural ﬂuxes:\nstable\
    \ isotopes of CO2 and CH4 (13C, 18O), OCS,\nO2 / N2 ratio if possible using continuous\
    \ in situ instru-\nments.\n4. Continuity of suitable tracers measurements will\
    \ have\nto be ensured to assess atmospheric loss of CH4\nthrough reaction with\
    \ hydroxyl radical (OH) (Prinn\net al., 2001), especially because atmospheric\
    \ methyl-\nchloroform (MCF) emissions are near zero and this\ntracer will no longer\
    \ be useful for OH determination.\n5. In parallel begin measurements of alternative\
    \ tracers to\nMCF such as 14CO (Krol et al., 2008) since MCF con-\ncentrations\
    \ decline rapidly after the Montreal protocol.\n4.5.2\nAtmospheric remote-sensing\
    \ data\nThe strategy is to exploit existing remote-sensing data of\nXCO2 and XCH4\
    \ to improve our knowledge, and invest\ninto new instruments of spacecraft to\
    \ empower capacity for\nglobal observations of greenhouse gases, according to\
    \ the\nfollowing steps:\n1. Develop research programs to calibrate satellite green-\n\
    house gases (GHG) observations to primary WMO-\nscale international standards.\n\
    2. Guarantee the continuity and sustained measurements\nof the Total Carbon Column\
    \ Observing Network (TC-\nCON) that is absolutely critical for validation of existing\n\
    and future satellite missions and independent, contin-\nuous column-average observations.\
    \ This is key to get-\nting at the climate change timescale feedbacks on the\n\
    GPP, R, and disturbance (Wunch et al., 2013). Its exten-\nsion to regions that\
    \ are critical to carbon-cycle science\n(e.g. tropics) as well as satellite validation\
    \ (e.g. oceans,\ndeserts). Strategically placed, it could cover a large re-\n\
    gion that is otherwise difﬁcult to reach with in situ mea-\nsurements.\n3. Exploit\
    \ existing SCanning Imaging Absorption spec-\ntroMeter\nfor\nAtmospheric\nCHartographY\n\
    (SCIA-\nMACHY) and Greenhouse Gas Observing Satellite\n(GOSAT) data in inversions\
    \ of ﬂuxes. Assess biases and\nco-beneﬁts of assimilating SCIAMACHY and GOSAT\n\
    and/or in situ measurements in each region.\n4. Keep GOSAT running as long as\
    \ possible to provide a\nmaximum overlap with Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2\n\
    (OCO-2), GOSAT-2, and other upcoming satellites.\n5. Launch OCO-2. The smaller\
    \ ﬁeld of view of OCO-2\ncompared to GOSAT should offer higher measurement\ndensity\
    \ in partially cloudy conditions (25 vs. 10 % clear-\nsounding probability), open\
    \ the possibility to 10-fold\nreduction in the uncertainty of sub-continental\
    \ ﬂuxes\n(Miller et al., 2007). Implement OCO-3 in a low in-\nclination orbit\
    \ with higher-density sampling of tropics,\ndiurnal sampling of latitudes up to\
    \ 57 degree, and “city-\nmode” (high-density raster scan) at ∼ 3 km resolution\n\
    for major urban areas.\n6. Develop and begin to implement the next gener-\nation/constellation\
    \ of GHG satellite measurements\n(Fig. 7a) from polar (low-earth) orbit to sustain\
    \ and im-\nprove records of XCO2 and XCH4 established with ﬁrst\ngeneration sounders.\
    \ The target is to provide boundary-\nlayer sensitivity XCO2 precisions of 1 ppm\
    \ and no-\ntional XCH4 precision of 9 ppb, for single observations\n(Buchwitz\
    \ et al., 2011), with individual ground foot-\nprints adapted to minimize cloud\
    \ contamination, and\ngood global coverage at 1–4 day repeat pass intervals\n\
    for resolving a fraction of emissions from strong local\nsources (e.g. urban areas\
    \ or power plants) to provide\npolicy-relevant ﬂux estimations at regional- and\
    \ city-\nscales (Bovensmann et al., 2010; Velazco et al., 2011).\nAll of these\
    \ column mixing ratio precisions should be\n“bias-corrected”, single sounding\
    \ retrieval error.\n7. For XCH4, space-borne light detection and ranging (li-\n\
    dar) developments should be pursued for their ability to\nmeasure XCH4 during\
    \ the winter season in boreal and\narctic regions, where emissions may increase\
    \ in the fu-\nture (e.g. the Methane Remote Lidar (MERLIN) mis-\nsion in Fig.\
    \ 7).\n8. Investigate the potential of geostationary platforms. For\ninstance,\
    \ instruments on commercial and other geo-\nstationary platforms offering hourly\
    \ observations of\nXCO2, XCH4 at 1–5 km spatial resolution, with vertical\nproﬁling\
    \ capability. Sampling areas from 60◦ N to 35◦ S\nwill cover > 95 % of anthropogenic\
    \ CO2 and CH4 emis-\nsions (unless one needs to measure permafrost emis-\nsions).\n\
    9. Investigate the use of XCO (typical individual sound-\ning precision of 15\
    \ ppb) and XNO2 as tracers of wild-\nﬁres and fossil fuel/biofuel combustion measurements\n\
    from satellites, possibly simultaneous observations with\nXCO2 and XCH4 sounders/imagers.\n\

    \ transport models and data\ninfrastructure\nImproving atmospheric transport models\
    \ is critical to best\nuse of information expected from the massive data increase\n\
    outlined in Sects. 4.5.1 and 4.5.2. The pertaining needs are\n1. Improvement and\
    \ frequent evaluation of transport\nmodels against observations, in particular\
    \ for bound-\nary layer mixing, vertical convective transport, large-\nscale advection\
    \ (including inter hemispheric exchange),\nand stratosphere–troposphere exchange\
    \ by using tracer\nand meteorological measurements (e.g. boundary layer\nheight\
    \ data from lidar and Rawisond measurements, air-\ncraft vertical proﬁles CO2\
    \ and tracers).\n2. Pursue regular transport models inter-comparison and\nevaluation\
    \ against measurements, for CO2 and CH4,\nand transport tracers (SF6, Radon-222),\
    \ under pro-\ngrams such as Atmospheric Tracer Transport Model In-\ntercomparison\
    \ Project (TRANSCOM) (www.transcom.\nproject.asu.edu) (Denning et al., 1999; Taguchi\
    \ et al.,\n2011). Benchmarking and inter-comparison exercises\nshould be designed\
    \ and carried out for a range of spatial\nscales and terrain, including at regional\
    \ and cities scale.\n3. Develop atmospheric transport models at higher than\n\
    current resolution. A target in one decade would be a\nspatial resolution of 10–50\
    \ km over the globe for trans-\nport models used in inversions, and zooms of 1–10\
    \ km\nover regions/cities. Note that the forward model of\nthe Monitoring Atmospheric\
    \ Composition and Climate\n(MACC-II) system (http://www.gmes-atmosphere.eu/d/\n\
    services/gac/nrt/nrt_ﬁelds_co2/) is currently run with a\nresolution of 15 km\
    \ over the globe.\n4. Work cooperatively with weather forecast centers (Na-\n\
    tional Center for Environmental Prediction - NCEP, Eu-\nropean Centre for Medium-Range\
    \ Weather Forecast –\nECMWF, Global Modeling and Assimilation Ofﬁce –\nGMAO, etc.)\
    \ to improve atmospheric transport models\nand products best suited for accurate\
    \ transport of long-\nlived tracers like CO2 and CH4.\n5. Possibly consider the\
    \ utility and need for leveraging and\nexpanding existing air-quality inversion\
    \ systems em-\nployed by some regulatory agencies (e.g. Centre for Ma-\nrine and\
    \ Coastal Studies – CMACS) to include CO2 and\nCH4 regional inversions.\nIn terms\
    \ of atmospheric data infrastructure, improving the\ncurrent infrastructure to\
    \ accommodate the required measure-\nments will require to\n1. Implement interoperable\
    \ database tools, common for-\nmats, harmonized reporting of data uncertainties\
    \ and\ncalibration, for CO2, CH4, and above-listed tracers.\n2. Statistically\
    \ characterize and report errors on each infor-\nmation piece of atmospheric inversion\
    \ models, includ-\ning measurements, transport models, in terms of bias\nand random\
    \ errors, the latter being desirable under the\nform of the space–time errors\
    \ characterization (full er-\nror covariance matrices).\n4.6\nOceanic data needs\n\
    4.6.1\nOcean in situ data\nTo observe the temporal evolution of the ocean CO2\
    \ sink as\nwell as the chemical changes it induces, i.e., ocean acidiﬁ-\ncation,\
    \ the current observing system needs to be increased\nin sampling capacity and\
    \ frequency. This can be achieved by\ncombining existing programs and technology\
    \ with new ones\nthat take advantage of the emerging autonomous technology.\n\
    The following notional requirements need to be considered:\n1. Expansion of surface\
    \ ocean 1pCO2 observing systems\nusing Volunteer Observing Ship lines (VOS = voluntary\n\
    observing ships; commercial ships equipped with au-\ntonomous measurement systems)\
    \ and autonomous sur-\nface craft and moorings. For instance, to determine the\n\
    regional air–sea ﬂux of CO2 to within ±0.2 Pg C yr−1\nrequires evenly spaced and\
    \ regular crossings in the\nnorthern North Atlantic of 5–9 crossings per year\
    \ every\n1500 km and 6 crossings per year every 1500 km, in the\ntemperate North\
    \ Paciﬁc – 9 crossings per year every 200\nto 600 km, in the equatorial Paciﬁc\
    \ – 15 crossings per\nyear every 200 km, and in the polar South Paciﬁc every\n\
    300 km in summer to every 800 km in winter (Watson\net al., 2009). Recent modeling\
    \ approaches to optimize\ncrossings suggest that in the Southern Ocean, the CO2\n\
    air–sea ﬂux can be determined to within ±0.1 Pg C yr−1\nwith regular 3-monthly\
    \ sampling at a spatial resolution\nof 3◦ meridionally and 30◦ zonally.\n2. Continue\
    \ and enhance time series moorings measure-\nments of ocean surface 1pCO2 partial\
    \ pressure and car-\nbon parameters for long-term climate observations and\nfor\
    \ creating better process understanding. Ideally Eu-\nlerian time series will\
    \ need to be constructed from ar-\nrays covering a wider area (dependent on the\
    \ variability\nin the area of interest) in order to avoid aliasing due\nto slowly\
    \ moving fronts. New technological develop-\nment is needed to provide additional\
    \ carbon sensors on\nmoorings. As a ﬁrst step, carbon sensors should be de-\n\
    ployed on all of the OceanSITES (www.oceansites.org/)\nﬂux reference moorings.\
    \ Most Eulerian ocean carbon\ntime series stations (e.g. HOTS – Hawaii, BATS –\n\
    Bermuda/North Atlantic, ESTOC – eastern North At-\nlantic, DYFAMED – Mediterranean)\
    \ are located in olig-\notrophic stable low variability regions, also in view\
    \ of\nseparating more easily long-term climate induced sig-\nnals from higher\
    \ frequency noise. It is highly desirable\nwww.biogeosciences.net/11/3547/2014/\n\
    Biogeosciences, 11, 3547–3602, 2014\n3574\nP. Ciais et al.: Current systematic\
    \ carbon-cycle observations\nto also install Eulerian marine time series stations\
    \ – and\nspeciﬁcally time series arrays – in eutrophic and high-\nvariability\
    \ regions. These regions are currently under-\nsampled when it comes to long time\
    \ series. Naturally\nin these areas the potential aliasing of measurements\nthrough\
    \ moving fronts becomes more serious. Never-\ntheless, also temporal developments\
    \ of regions with\nhigh-marine-carbon turnover ecosystems must be as-\nsessed.\n\
    3. Pursue the collection of very-high accuracy three-\ndimensional ocean interior\
    \ carbon data (at least total\ndissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity from\
    \ the same\ncast) together with relevant physical and biogeochemi-\ncal measurements\
    \ (see GO-SHIP initiative http://www.\ngo-ship.org and Roemmich et al. (2010).\
    \ Ship-based\nhydrography is insofar the only method for obtaining\nhigh-quality,\
    \ high spatial and vertical resolution mea-\nsurements of a suite of physical,\
    \ chemical, and biolog-\nical variables over the full water column. More speciﬁ-\n\
    cally, two types of survey are required: decadal surveys\nwith full basin resampling\
    \ of any basin over a less than\n3-year period, and a sub-set of the decadal surveys\
    \ sam-\npled at higher frequency (every 2–3 years).\n4. Floats and gliders equipped\
    \ with sensors for simulta-\nneous measurements of two different inorganic carbon\n\
    tracers (ideally of the two master tracers: dissolved in-\norganic carbon – DIC\
    \ and total alkalinity – TAlk) need\nto be developed and applied to the ocean\
    \ at large scale.\nIn addition, ﬂoats that measure vertical particle ﬂuxes\nmust\
    \ be reﬁned and used. Such ﬂoats are currently un-\nder development (e.g., Bishop,\
    \ 2009).\n5. For coastal environments, design studies for a network\nof new hydrographic\
    \ and ecological surveys, moorings\nand ﬂoats will be required to provide integrated\
    \ obser-\nvations.\n6. Collect oxygen and nutrient measurements together\nwith\
    \ carbon, to help in detecting and diagnosing large-\nscale changes in oceanic\
    \ overturning, which cannot eas-\nily be monitored by physical techniques. In\
    \ particular,\ndevelop and deploy sensors for a denser set of oxy-\ngen observations,\
    \ especially on moorings and ARGO\nﬂoats, to help differentiate between biologically\
    \ depen-\ndent air–sea carbon ﬂuxes and inorganic buffering of\nanthropogenic\
    \ CO2. In particular over continental mar-\ngins, where anthropogenic nutrient\
    \ input and a poten-\ntially slower ocean overturning during global warming\n\
    may lead to more oxygen depletion.\n7. Coordinate carbon and ocean acidiﬁcation\
    \ sampling and\nrequirements, given that many of the open-ocean re-\nsearch requirements\
    \ of the ocean-acidiﬁcation commu-\nnity could be met by future research plans\
    \ of the ocean\ncarbon and biological communities, and by adding sen-\nsors and\
    \ moorings where needed (International Ocean\nCarbon Coordination Project – IOCCP,\
    \ http://www.\nioccp.org/).\n4.6.2\nOcean remote-sensing data\nRemote-sensing\
    \ data complements and expands on ocean in\nsitu sampling by providing information\
    \ in regions that are\nunder-sampled. To take full advantage of the remote-sensing\n\
    technology (Fig. 7b), its data will need to be combined with\nin situ data and\
    \ models. The following notional requirements\nare derived\n1. Improvements in\
    \ ocean color products from satellites,\nincluding ground-truth measurements to\
    \ link satellite\nobservations to chlorophyll, phytoplankton groups or\nprimary\
    \ production data (Fig. 7b).\n2. Sediment traps (which are not “remote sensing”,\
    \ al-\nthough that data would be useful for calibration of re-\nmote sensors)\
    \ at more shallow depths in conjunction\nwith measurements of dissolved quantities\
    \ to derive a\nmore precise quantiﬁcation of changes in the biological\ncarbon\
    \ pumps.\n3. Address potential gaps in future ocean color records.\nThe MODerate-resolution\
    \ Imaging Spectroradiometer\n(MODIS) instruments are currently in extended oper-\n\
    ational phases. Net primary production (NPP) and Joint\nPolar Satellite System\
    \ (JPSS) Visible–Infrared Imag-\ning Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instruments, intended\n\
    to provide a replacement for MODIS, will not have\nthe necessary performance to\
    \ fulﬁll this need; NASA\nis planning to expedite a follow-up capability – Pre-\n\
    Aerosol, Clouds, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) but\nthere is a risk of a 2–5 year\
    \ data gap in the middle of\nthis decade. For European Space Agency (ESA), Ocean\n\
    Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3\nwill replace MERIS (see Fig.\
    \ 7b).\n4. Develop advanced multispectral/hyper-spectral satel-\nlite sensors\

    \ (e.g. leaf area in-\ndex – LAI, fraction of photosynthetically active radiation\
    \ –\nFAPAR, gross primary production – GPP). Transforming the\nFLUXNET network\
    \ as a component of a systematic global\ncarbon monitoring system will require\n\
    1. Careful selection of core and supporting sites based\non stratiﬁcation by major\
    \ biomes within eco-regions,\nfor instance with a cluster of sites in each eco-region,\n\
    with a core long-term site, and other towers capturing\nvariation due to disturbance/management\

    \ observing system to have avail-\nable high spatial resolution measurements,\
    \ since the scale of\ndisturbance is often of tens of meters, smaller than the\
    \ grid\nof systematic forest inventories (which can pick up the sig-\nnal of some\
    \ disturbances through statistical sampling of large\nregions). Yet, at ca. 0.1\
    \ ha, biomass distribution is skewed to\nthose plots with a large stem, and the\
    \ error on biomass es-\ntimates for a single large stem is large. Instead, we\
    \ need a\nfew large stems in each plot (i.e. 1 ha minimum). A scale of\n∼ 1 to\
    \ 4 ha deﬁnes the main spatial resolution requirement\nfor satellite observations\
    \ of biomass.\nTransformational change in the current sampling scheme\nwill require\
    \ a high priority to develop forest inventories in\ntropical forests. It is recommended\
    \ to repeat measurements\ntypically every 5 years for trees while allowing 10\
    \ years for\nthe soil compartment to track pool dynamics. Improved for-\nest inventories\
    \ systems as part of an observing system to\nquantify CO2 ﬂuxes from pools changes\
    \ will need to ﬁll in\nthe following gaps:\n1. Increase the number of tropical\

    \ to management and climate, increased accessibility,\nimprovement, and regular\
    \ updates of remote-sensing prod-\nucts are required, supported by cross-validations/calibrations\n\
    campaigns and exercises, as well as continuity in current\nsatellite observations.\
    \ The continuity of such observations\nis expected to be enhanced by new Landsat-,\
    \ and MODIS-\ncontinuity missions in the US, as well as the European Space\nAgency/European\
    \ Commission constellation of Sentinels un-\nder the Global Monitoring of Environment\
    \ and Security –\nGMES program.\nNew “Imaging Spectrometers” (also known as hyperspec-\n\
    tral imagers) that will be launched by various countries such\nas Germany, Italy,\
    \ Japan, and the US in the coming 3–10\nyears, are expected to provide unprecedented\
    \ ﬁdelity in more\ndirect measurement of various chemical and biochemical\nconstituents\
    \ of vegetation, water bodies, oceans, and soils,\nthus providing new opportunities\
    \ for further reﬁnement of C-\ncycle models (see e.g. http://hyspiri.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\
    \ In\nterms of continuity and update of remote-sensing products,\nthe main needs\
    \ are\n1. Validated and regularly updated satellite LAI and FA-\nPAR and remote-sensing\
    \ based global GPP. NPP prod-\nucts will be required over the entire operation\
    \ length of a\ncarbon observing system, including reanalysis products\nusing long-term\
    \ records Advanced Very High Resolu-\ntion Radiometer (AVHRR) to detect trends\
    \ (Fig. 7c).\n2. Validation campaigns to improve LAI, FAPAR and\nGPP, NPP remote-sensing\
    \ products should be initi-\nated over sites (e.g. FLUXNET, inventories) distributed\n\
    globally to sample a large number of biomes, land use\nand canopy structural types.\
    \ Optimal site distribution\nand benchmarking should capitalize on current 3-D\
    \ ra-\ndiation transfer modeling capabilities (e.g. Huang et al.,\n2008).\nIn\
    \ terms of algorithm and products development, speciﬁc\ndata products allowing\
    \ regular assessment of carbon ﬂuxes\nfrom land use/land cover change and disturbances\
    \ will be\nrequired in the next decade (see Fig. 7c for existing and\nplanned\
    \ satellite measurements):\n1. Annual validated land use/land cover mapping products.\n\
    Validation and accuracy assessment of satellite-derived\nland cover will be needed\
    \ against independent data col-\nlected in ground surveys or aerial photos. Accuracy\
    \ as-\nsessments are critical for monitoring treaty agreement\ncompliance (e.g.\
    \ REDD+).\n2. Global remote-sensing data products for mapping ﬁre,\nharvest and\
    \ degradation, forest regrowth, land clearing,\nand insect disturbance. Detection\
    \ of partial disturbances\nor degradation such as high-grade harvest in the tropics,\n\
    will require annual to sub-annual satellite data to de-\ntect changes before forest\
    \ canopies ﬁll in. Due to spatial\nheterogeneity of disturbance and biomass in\
    \ forests, a\nspatial resolution of 50 m at minimum for deforestation\ndetection\
    \ will be required (e.g. the BIOMASS mission\nin Fig. 7c), and a 100–200 m resolution\
    \ product for de-\ntection of forest degradation and regrowth.\n3. Continuous\
    \ programs to derive direct estimates of for-\nest biomass and forest degradation\
    \ through the use of\noptical technologies (hyperspectral) or Synthetic Aper-\n\
    ture Radar (SAR) (multi-wavelength X-, C-, L-, P-band)\nlinked to ground inventory\
    \ plots at appropriate scales.\n4. Develop improved global measures of ecosystem\
    \ func-\ntional response to stress, including water, temperature\nand nutrient\
    \ effects through new optical (hyperspectral)\nor other techniques.\nIn terms\
    \ of satellite capabilities needed to sustain the terres-\ntrial component of\
    \ a global carbon monitoring system, the\nmain requirements are\n1. Reduce dependency\
    \ on single satellite missions. De-\nvelop contingency planning in case of failure\

    \ national inventories.\n2. Develop and deploy advanced lidar, SAR (multi-\nwavelength\
    \ X-, C-, L-, P-band and/or interferometric\nSAR), and new optical sensors (e.g.\

    \ carbon transport in aquatic systems\nMore systematic observations are needed\
    \ to quantify/start\nto monitor lateral carbon ﬂuxes in aquatic systems. Speciﬁc\n\
    new surface water records are required to better map ﬂoods\nand the spatial extent\
    \ of streams and rivers (ﬂoodobservatory.\ncolorado.edu/) including\n1. Remote-sensing\
    \ and model-based data products to as-\nsess the temporal dynamics of inland water\
    \ areas and\nwater residence time in large lakes and ﬂuvial systems.\n2. New remote-sensing\
    \ algorithms to use the color of wa-\nter as a proxy for terrigeneous dissolved\
    \ organic car-\nbon (DOC), and studies of new sensors (ultraviolet) that\ncould\
    \ enable detection of dissolved organic matter.\nIn the next 10 years, increased\
    \ sampling of carbon in aquatic\nsystems is required to complete the terrestrial\
    \ component of\na global carbon monitoring system for boreal, temperate and\n\
    tropical inland waters – including streams, rivers, and estu-\naries – to estimate\
    \ ecosystem gross primary production and\nrespiration, horizontal carbon transport\

    \ to-\ntal alkalinity, pH, pCO2, pCH4 (e.g. Global Lake Ecologi-\ncal Observatory\
    \ Network – GLEON; www.gleon.org/)). No-\ntional requirements are\n1. Monitoring\
    \ of the discharge of inorganic and organic\nriver carbon to the ocean.\n2. Monitoring\
    \ of dissolved (DOC) and particulate organic\ncarbon (POC) river ﬂux of relevant\
    \ rivers with the fre-\nquency of data acquisition capable of capturing the con-\n\
    tribution of ﬂoods/extreme events, which usually make\na dominant contribution\
    \ to annual budgets.\n3. Aquatic carbon parameters monitoring in regions partic-\n\
    ularly susceptible to climate change (e.g. permafrost).\nAt aquatic stations,\
    \ loads and ages of DOC and POC\nshould be determined in addition to measurements\
    \ of\npCO2, pH, DIC, total alkalinity, and CH4.\n4. Local estimates of carbon\
    \ burial in major lakes, im-\npoundments, ﬂoodplains, for example, using sediment\n\
    cores and traps sampled at 5–10-years interval.\n5. Concentration in the soil\
    \ of dissolved and particulate\ninorganic and organic carbon (DOC and POC) moni-\n\
    tored at at least 100 stations located in different biomes\nand ecosystems. Stations\
    \ may be equipped with erosion\ntraps, wells or lysimeters and tensiometers to\
    \ continu-\nously monitor chemical composition and ﬂuxes of car-\nbon in groundwater.\n\
    In the longer term, over the next 20 years, production of DOC\nand POC should\
    \ be monitored at stations located in different\nbiomes and ecosystems (likely\
    \ collocated with FLUXNET\nstations). These future stations should be equipped\
    \ with\nwells, lysimeters and tensiometers that monitor chemical\ncomposition\
    \ and ﬂuxes of carbon in groundwater. Data could\nbe disseminated through existing\
    \ infrastructure (e.g. Glo-\nRiCh – Global River Chemistry Database) for hydrochemical\n\

    \ information about harvest and use of\ncarbon in food and wood products is required\
    \ to close re-\ngional terrestrial carbon budgets, and integrate ecosystem-\n\
    based carbon budgets into regional budgets. Harvest infor-\nmation should be determined\
    \ regularly from agricultural and\nforestry statistics, with the best geospatial\
    \ resolution at which\nstatistics are collected (for instance, counties). Basic\
    \ notional\nrequirements for management data are\n1. Geospatial information on\
    \ crop and wood biomass har-\nvest updated each year, at resolution of at best\
    \ 1 km to 1\ncounty in regions with detailed agricultural and forestry\nstatistics,\
    \ and at worst 100 km in regions with less de-\ntailed statistics.\n2. Conversion\

    \ notional\nrequirements are\n1. Development of spatial ﬂux and pools up-scaling\
    \ algo-\nrithms for application over heterogeneous landscapes,\nfor example, around\

    \ of intensive\nplot biological measurements with remote-sensing data\nfor spatial\
    \ extrapolation of local data to the wider region\n(e.g. Hudiburg et al., 2011).\n\
    2. Continuous programs to improve ecosystem models and\nremote-sensing integration\
    \ in models, to provide ini-\ntial conditions, as well as quantiﬁcation of change\
    \ at\nglobal and regional scale. Development and evaluation\nare required for\

    \ throw dis-\nturbance (including the scale, frequency, and severity\nof each\
    \ type of disturbance and subsequent lagged ef-\nfects, forest growth and demography\

    \ to water, energy, and carbon-cycle processes,\nthe interactions between nutrients\
    \ and carbon cycling\n(both limitations and fertilizations resulting from in-\n\
    creased nutrient supply), export of dissolved/particulate\ncarbon from ecosystems\

    \ Ecosys-\ntem models used to calculate CO2 and CH4 ﬂuxes and\ncarbon stock change\
    \ from observations will need to as-\nsimilate remote-sensing and in situ data\

    Arctic and tropical forest biomes. Examples for the oceans\nare the deep-water\
    \ production areas of the North Atlantic and\nthe Southern Ocean. The regions,\
    \ where CH4 ﬂuxes are sen-\nsitive to climate or land use change (wetlands, permafrost,\n\
    landﬁlls, ﬁre-prone ecosystems, geological gas storage areas,\nand some dams)\
    \ can also be considered as hotspots. The con-\nsequences of their destabilization\
    \ will likely be increased nat-\nural emissions, loss of sink capacity, with positive\
    \ feedback\non climate change.\nIt is beyond the scope of this study to derive\
    \ notional re-\nquirements for regional observing systems oriented to char-\n\
    acterize carbon-cycle hotspots in the context of early warm-\ning systems. It\
    \ is likely that a higher density of observa-\ntions, with sampling strategies\
    \ appropriate to speciﬁc obser-\nvation types, will be required for monitoring\
    \ hotspot carbon\npools/ﬂuxes, detect early changes and/or attribute abnormal\n\
    ﬂux measurements. These observations may include high-\nresolution CO2 and CH4\
    \ concentrations with their isotopes,\nhigh-resolution land cover change, key\
    \ ground-based mea-\nsurements such as local ecosystem or reservoir ﬂux mea-\n\
    surements (e.g. ﬂux towers and ﬂux chambers) and ancil-\nlary data (e.g. permafrost\
    \ active layer dynamics, peatland\ndrainage depth, and carbon densities), and\
    \ emission measure-\nments (plume sampling, dual tracer release) for intense an-\n\
    thropogenic sources (e.g. power plants, some factories and\nindustrial sites,\
    \ landﬁlls, and pipelines).\n5\nHurdles and cross-cutting issues in the deployment\
    \ of\na global carbon observing system\nDeveloping and operating an integrated\
    \ global carbon ob-\nserving system will require a coordinated effort, spanning\n\
    many partner countries and organizations to support instru-\nment development,\
    \ data and model validation, sustained ob-\nservations, quality assessment and\
    \ control, data assimilation,\ndatabase management, carbon-cycle modeling, fossil\
    \ fuel in-\nventories, high-performance computing resources, decision-\nsupport\
    \ analyses, and systems engineering. Advanced data-\nintensive analysis and visualization\
    \ methods will be required\nto evaluate the information collected in the integrated\
    \ observ-\ning system. The system will have to be built in successive\nsteps.\
    \ Figure 8 gives a notional vision of the different accu-\nracy and sampling requirements\
    \ that could be associated with\neach successive step over the next two decades.\n\
    5.1\nIntegration of multiple data streams and\nmodel-data fusion\nThe task of\
    \ carbon data integration has several objectives:\n1. Spatial integration, in\
    \ which measurements from dif-\nferent regional programs are coherently combined,\
    \ and\ndatabases interoperable.\n2. Completeness, in which we try to ensure that\
    \ important\nprocesses of the carbon cycle are observed with clear\nerror assessment.\n\
    3. Temporal integration, to be able to use long-time series\nfor improved model\
    \ prediction, as well as evaluation of\nimpacts associated with climate policy\
    \ decisions.\n4. Process integration, in which data are combined to\nform a consistent\
    \ view of the carbon cycle given infer-\nences from atmospheric, oceanic, terrestrial\
    \ and socioe-\nconomic data, and their uncertainties.\nIt is obvious that any\
    \ coherent observing strategy must take\naccount of how observations will be used.\
    \ The process of\nintegrating multiple streams of observations into carbon-\n\
    cycle models requires assimilation techniques that mod-\nify model behavior to\
    \ match observations within their un-\ncertainty range. This approach is given\
    \ many names such\nas model-data fusion, the multiple constraint approach, or\n\
    carbon-cycle data assimilation. Such techniques were ini-\ntially applied long\
    \ ago to the tuning of the seasonal cycle\nof atmospheric CO2 concentration (Fung\
    \ et al., 1987), but\nthe use of formal data assimilation methods allowed rapid\n\
    development in the ﬁeld (Qualife et al., 2008). Examples of\nsuch applications\
    \ are the estimation of phenology parame-\nters from satellite observations (Picard\
    \ et al., 2005; Stöckli\net al., 2011), estimates of photosynthetic parameters\
    \ using\nCO2 and heat ﬂuxes (Santaren et al., 2007; Knorr and Kattge,\n2005; Randerson\
    \ et al., 2002; Wang and McGregor, 2003).\nOceanographic examples are the optimal\
    \ interpolation of\nVOS line data and respective upscaling to the basin-wide\n\
    scale (Telszewski et al., 2009) and sensitivity estimates of\ncarbon ﬂuxes with\
    \ respect to speciﬁc processes (Tjiputra et\nal., 2007). A conceptual representation\
    \ of a global carbon\ndata integration system is depicted in Fig. 9.\nApplications\
    \ can be divided into two broad categories:\nthose that constrain the internal\
    \ state of the model by op-\ntimizing state variables, and those that estimate\
    \ the poorly\nknown internal parameters of the model. Data assimilation\nfor state\
    \ variables can produce a closer ﬁt to observations\nbecause it uses less hard\
    \ constraints from the underlying im-\nperfect model. It is therefore preferred\

    \ three phases with increasing sampling, resolution and accu-\nracy. The resolution\
    \ and target precision are expected to be reached\nin the best-sampled regions\
    \ at ﬁrst.\nperformance within the observing period is required (i.e. di-\nagnostic\
    \ applications), while assimilation to estimate param-\neters is intended to improve\
    \ the underlying behavior of the\nmodel and targets prognostic applications.\n\
    Key elements needed for policy-relevant carbon observa-\ntions that could be deployed\
    \ with signiﬁcant funding and co-\nordination in the next decade have been set\
    \ out in Sect. 4.\nMost importantly, every observation must be associated with\n\
    error statistics to properly weight its inﬂuence in the data as-\nsimilation system.\
    \ The linkage of observations to accepted\ncalibration scales (and any offsets)\
    \ must also be clear so that\nscale differences between different observations\
    \ are not mis-\ntakenly interpreted as arising from physical processes. Be-\n\
    yond this, the use of observations in a data assimilation sys-\ntem will require\
    \ operators that can map the internal state of\nthe model onto the observed variable.\
    \ Here there are practi-\ncal choices that will have to be made if the published\
    \ data\nare themselves the result of a complex model, such as a ra-\ndiative transfer\
    \ model. Biases in calibration can generate co-\nherent errors that will not be\
    \ captured by point-wise descrip-\ntions of error. Experience with numerical weather\
    \ prediction\nsuggests that the generation of observation operators requires\n\
    close collaboration between modelers and experts in the par-\nticular observed\
    \ variable. As a scientiﬁc task, the generation\nof these observation operators\
    \ is equally as important as the\ngeneration of data sets of observations using\
    \ them.\n5.2\nQuantitative network design and observing system\nsimulation experiments\n\
    Given knowledge of the error statistics of potential measure-\nments, it is possible\
    \ to quantify the value of a given data set in\nterms of the new information it\
    \ brings. This always requires\nsome kind of model of the underlying statistics,\
    \ as well as the\nsystem dynamics. The approach is described in Kaminski et\n\
    al. (2012) for network design. The approach has been used\nto quantify the value\
    \ of in situ measurements of concentra-\ntion for constraining surface ﬂuxes and\
    \ to assess the likely\nvalue of satellite measurements of CO2. One can even at-\n\
    tempt to design an optimal network (e.g. Rayner et al., 1996),\nbut the task of\
    \ deﬁning optimality and the assumptions of\nprior knowledge suggest that the\
    \ more conservative option of\ntesting potential networks is more reliable (Hungershoefer\
    \ et\nal., 2010). Furthermore, experience has shown that “optimal”\nnetworks are\
    \ often governed as much by the reality of logis-\ntical considerations (e.g.\
    \ the development of a tall tower for\natmospheric measurements where reliable\
    \ transport, power\nand scientiﬁc collaborators are) as by quantitative theoretical\n\
    considerations. Thus, both expert judgment and model anal-\nysis must be brought\
    \ to bear in designing networks (e.g. the\nNEON approach to determination of eco-regions).\n\
    5.3\nData management and processing\nBuilding a coordinated carbon monitoring\
    \ system requires\na highly integrated data and information management sys-\n\
    tem. Key to such a system is the ability to synthesize and\nintegrate carbon observations\
    \ from a wide variety of plat-\nforms and techniques within a coherent modeling\
    \ framework\nbased on model-data fusion methods. To achieve these aims,\na distributed\
    \ data management system must enable access,\nunderstanding, use, integration,\
    \ and analysis and visualiza-\ntion of large volume of diverse data at multiple\
    \ scales. The\ndata management and analysis systems for the entire data life\n\
    cycle should deliver high-quality products that will be freely\naccessible to\
    \ the scientiﬁc, resource management, and pol-\nicy communities around the world.\
    \ A lot will depend on the\nfunding mechanisms to make this happen. In the numerical\n\
    weather prediction world, individual countries are sometimes\nprotective of their\
    \ data. Prediction centers can have access to\ndata of direct interest to, but\
    \ for research activities it can be\nmore complicated.\nThe challenge will be\
    \ to manage high-quality, consistent,\nlong-term data in a manner that directly\
    \ supports the data\nassimilation models, while maintaining enough ﬂexibility\
    \ to\nrespond to researcher’s needs, new observations, and evolv-\ning information\
    \ technology. This includes providing trans-\nparent access to the necessary data\
    \ to implement sub-national\nand national mitigation activities and to support\
    \ emission re-\nduction policies. Currently, the data and information systems\n\
    are not in place to support the data requirements of an inte-\ngrated carbon monitoring\
    \ system. It is thus key to the success\nof the data and information system to\
    \ plan at an early stage\nfor improved data calibration, harmonization, and quality\
    \ as-\nsurance and quality control procedures that will ensure that\nobservations\
    \ produced by different networks and observing\nsystems for a broad range of purposes\
    \ and covering differing\nspatial and temporal domains are fully compatible and\
    \ read-\nily integrated in data assimilation systems. While harmoniza-\ntion and\
    \ data quality control is deﬁnitely a good thing, cur-\nrent practice in numerical\
    \ weather prediction is that the data\nassimilation centers do their own quality\
    \ control and bias cor-\nrection, on top of data provided by the data providers.\

    \ frameworks\nprovide a useful tool to check the consistency of observa-\ntions\
    \ under the assumption of a good model constraint. How\nsigniﬁcant the last assumption\
    \ is for carbon-cycle research\n(i.e. how good the model constraint is) is an\
    \ open question.\nExisting sets of well-calibrated, high-precision carbon\nstocks,\
    \ CO2 and CH4 observations should be made avail-\nable openly. Open access to\
    \ data, metadata, and data prod-\nucts within a reasonable time after acquisition\
    \ is the most ef-\nﬁcient and cost-effective way to ﬁll observational gaps. The\n\
    following sections describe data management and processing\nactions required to\
    \ establish and operate the proposed data\nsystem. Results from pilot projects\
    \ to enable seamless inter-\noperability (ability of information exchange and\
    \ use of the\ninformation that has been exchanged) of carbon data sets and\nother\
    \ data need to be exploited.\n5.4\nIntegrated data products and services\nThe\
    \ goal of a policy-relevant carbon observing system is to\ngenerate data products\
    \ that are of value for the user commu-\nnities. Raw observations are rarely adequate\
    \ on their own.\nTo create usable products, in situ measurements from a va-\n\
    riety of sources with the vastly different spatial, temporal,\nand process resolutions\
    \ used in the modeling approach need\nto be integrated with remote-sensing observations\
    \ within a\nmodeling framework. To achieve this objective the following\nactions\
    \ will be needed.\n1. Ensure documentation and harmonization of in situ data\n\
    from diverse sources. The current problems with in situ\ndata include inconsistent\
    \ parameter deﬁnitions of state\nvariables, different data formats, incomplete\
    \ data and\nmissing estimates of realistic uncertainties, various spa-\ntial and\
    \ temporal scales, and sampling bias in measure-\nments.\n2. Harmonize methods.\
    \ Many core measurements of car-\nbon pools and ﬂuxes are nationally based, so\
    \ the har-\nmonization of existing data and the standardization of\nmethodologies\
    \ is a central issue for a global data sys-\ntem. Many pool and ﬂux synthesis\
    \ products exist only\nin research mode. Considerable further development\nis\
    \ required before these products can be included in\nwww.biogeosciences.net/11/3547/2014/\n\

    \ up-\ndates in the context of an operational system. Among\nother international\
    \ initiatives, the Global Terrestrial Ob-\nserving System (GTOS) program (www.fao.org/gtos/)\n\
    has the speciﬁc goal of integrating in situ and space-\nbased observations, and\
    \ can provide standards and har-\nmonization guidelines for data integration (e.g.\
    \ Law et\nal., 2008a).\n3. Facilitate the combination of atmospheric observations\n\
    with observations on the surface and subsurface, both on\nland and in the ocean,\
    \ to include ancillary observations\nof ecosystem condition, and socioeconomic\
    \ status.\n4. Automate, as far as possible, the production and dissem-\nination\
    \ of data.\nTable 2 shows the differences between current numerical\nweather prediction\
    \ systems, current global carbon observing\nsystem, and a future (achievable)\
    \ carbon observing system.\n5.4.1\nPriority data products and services\nThe integration\
    \ of models and data needs strategies involving\ndifferent algorithms and models.\
    \ Using model-data fusion\nschemes, inverse modeling and data assimilation to\
    \ place\nconstraints on the ﬂuxes of CO2 and CH4 between the Earth’s\nsurface\
    \ and the atmosphere and on changes in carbon pools,\nrequires reliable, quality\
    \ assured, and well-calibrated mea-\nsurements of both carbon stocks and CO2 and\
    \ CH4 ﬂuxes\nalong with other measures of system properties and ﬂuxes\nsuch as\
    \ wind ﬁelds. In addition, there are a number of con-\ntrol parameter observations\
    \ that are crucial to data assimila-\ntion and model-data fusion activities:\n\
    1. Acquire the priority data products identiﬁed earlier.\n2. Implement model-data\
    \ fusion techniques to routinely\nassimilate data streams of carbon measurements\
    \ to pro-\nduce consistent and accurate estimates of global CO2\nﬂux ﬁelds. These\
    \ products will need to be indexed\nand made available for assessment, policy,\
    \ and resource\nmanagement.\n3. Merge, synthesize, and eventually fuse carbon\
    \ observa-\ntions within process oriented carbon models. Compre-\nhensive advanced\
    \ Carbon-Cycle Data Assimilation Sys-\ntems (CCDAS) will be required, that are\
    \ expected to an-\nalyze large amounts of data, routinely diagnose carbon\nquantities,\
    \ and provide error diagnostics.\n4. Implement a global data management system.\
    \ This sys-\ntem should be based on open source collaboration prin-\nciples in\
    \ system development efforts (portal design, data\nﬁlters, format conversion,\
    \ web mapping services, or\ncross-platform compatibility).\n5. Implement open\
    \ and agreed protocols.\nThe speciﬁc functions required of the data management\
    \ sys-\ntem to support innovative data assimilation methods need to\nbe identiﬁed\
    \ and plans made to provide that support. Sev-\neral of the required data streams\
    \ exist today, and systems are\nin place for handling many of these individual\
    \ data streams.\nThe data and information management system should build\non these\
    \ existing systems. However, some of the data streams\nare not produced consistently\
    \ at the required time and space\nresolution and the data are not harmonized:\
    \ as a result they\ncannot be readily assembled into an integrated set for data\n\
    fusion.\nFeedback and coordination about data requirements to the\nobserving systems\
    \ are needed to meet the ultimate informa-\ntion needs. Close coordination between\
    \ data managers, those\nmaking the observations, modelers, and other data users\
    \ is\ncritical. Integration and dialogue will be required between\nthe research\
    \ teams and the data systems to deﬁne and im-\nplement data product requirements.\
    \ It is almost impossible\nfor large data users to communicate with each individual\n\
    data provider. Frameworks like NOAA/ESRL/GMD, WMO-\nWDCGG and ICOS are crucial\
    \ as an intermediary.\nThe continuous improvement of a carbon observing sys-\n\
    tem should periodically take stock of the data and infor-\nmation by documenting\
    \ its character and quality in ways\nthat are responsive to the needs of its end\
    \ users, now, for\nboth basic and applied uses, and into the future as they\n\
    provide the climate-quality, long-term records of Earth sys-\ntem change. As the\
    \ system provides information for policy-\nmakers (e.g., through the Intergovernmental\
    \ Panel on Cli-\nmate Change (IPCC) period assessments), the data products\ninput\
    \ to these analyses need to be evaluated and published in\nthe peer-reviewed literature\
    \ or in some equivalent, of docu-\nmented quality.\n5.4.2\nComponent uncertainty\n\
    Any modeling estimation of the global distribution of car-\nbon ﬂuxes and pools\
    \ requires the uncertainty characteristics\nof all data-streams to be an integral\
    \ component of the data\nsystem (Raupach et al., 2005). It is important that uncertain-\n\
    ties of all information pieces that are used in data integra-\ntion schemes, including\
    \ observations, ocean models, ecosys-\ntem models, and atmospheric models, can\
    \ be described in\nterms of random errors, and if possible, in terms of known\n\
    biases. Random errors should be described as far as possible\nby space–time covariance\
    \ matrices (Chevallier et al., 2006;\nKuppel et al., 2013). Equally important,\
    \ many of the ﬁnal\nproducts of a global carbon monitoring system and their un-\n\
    certainties must be presented in a format understandable by\ndecision-makers (not\
    \ necessarily the same audience as sci-\nence user communities). Attention must\
    \ be given to this nu-\nance in the design of the system.\nBiogeosciences, 11,\

    \ An open and transparent data policy will pro-\nvide a continuing commitment\
    \ to the establishment, mainte-\nnance, description, accessibility and long-term\
    \ stewardship\nand availability of high-quality data and information. The\ndata\

    open exchange of data, metadata, and products, in the frame\nof GEO.\n5.4.4\n\

    interoperability principles and metadata standards to facili-\ntate cooperation\
    \ and effective use of collected data and infor-\nmation. The WMO Information\
    \ System (WMO WIS), http:\n//www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/WIS/ developments could\n\
    be followed for carbon data. Metadata enables users to\nBiogeosciences, 11, 3547–3602,\

    \ carbon-cycle observations\n3587\ndiscover data products and understand the content\
    \ of those\nproducts. In addition, the systems and tools rely on consistent\n\
    and interoperable metadata as a means to enable automatic\nprocessing, including\
    \ analysis, visualization, and subsetting.\nContributors will have to promote\
    \ the development and use\nof ﬂexible, open, and easy-to-use community standards\
    \ for\nmetadata (e.g., the Climate and Forecast (CF-1) standards for\nthe Network\
    \ Common Data Form – netCDF). These stan-\ndards should be interoperable and independent\
    \ of speciﬁc\nhardware and software platforms. Guidelines for their use\nshould\
    \ be widely circulated and incorporated into data man-\nagement training courses.\n\
    5.4.5\nData preservation\nData products, including value-added products and the\
    \ al-\ngorithms used to produce them, need to be archived when\nthe data sets\
    \ are ﬁnalized. A data archive plan is criti-\ncal, because of the distributed\
    \ nature of the data manage-\nment system with individual agencies holding active\
    \ data\nproducts. Archiving procedures must take data security, in-\ntegrity,\
    \ and routine technological updating into account, and\narchives should support\
    \ data discovery and access. Many car-\nbon data products are currently being\
    \ archived by agency or\nnational data centers, and a new system should not dupli-\n\
    cate those efforts. However, centers participating in the dis-\ntributed archive\
    \ should meet a range of standards of acces-\nsibility, security and should follow\
    \ agreed protocols. Accu-\nracy estimates need to be put on existing/historical\
    \ data sets\n(e.g. stored in the WDCGG for atmospheric in situ data). The\nplanning\
    \ team should identify agency roles and responsibil-\nities, commitment, and the\
    \ issues/concerns of international\ncollaborators associated with long-term data\
    \ archival. Such\na long-term archiving is essential to create “heritage data\n\
    sets” which must be accessible even several decades after\ntheir creation for\
    \ future generations to come. These must be\nable to optimally use data sets created\
    \ today in order to criti-\ncally calibrate their prediction and adaptation models\
    \ in a fu-\nture world where human-induced climate change has much\nfurther progressed\
    \ than at present. Going back to previous\n“working points” of the climate system\
    \ will be essential for\nthese future generations in order to optimize the sensitivity\n\
    of the then existing Earth system models.\n5.4.6\nData hierarchies\nNot all data\
    \ is of equal quality. Data assimilation systems\ndeal with this by assigning\
    \ different data uncertainties, effec-\ntively giving different weight to different\
    \ observations. All\ndata, however, is potentially useful provided that its uncer-\n\
    tainties are properly characterized. However different tasks\nrequire different\
    \ characteristics because the signals are dif-\nferent. For example data to detect\
    \ early changes in the growth\nrate of atmospheric CO2 demands much higher temporal\
    \ sta-\nbility in its calibration than data used to calculate instanta-\nneous\
    \ ﬂuxes (which may in turn demand precise regional cal-\nibration). Care must\
    \ be taken in the design of the system that\nit can answer both types of question.\n\
    5.4.7\nImplications for researchers\nSerious progress towards the system described\
    \ above would\nmean large changes to the conduct of research, both data pro-\n\
    vision and use. Questions of data ownership would become\nless relevant, in the\
    \ same way as no one attaches a researcher\nname to a given automatic weather\
    \ station. The compromises\nbetween robust and timely delivery and the absolute\
    \ best\nquality, always evident in meteorological data, would also\nenter carbon-cycle\
    \ research. On the other hand the close re-\nlationship between data users and\
    \ providers that has charac-\nterized much of the best research in this domain\
    \ would, on\naverage, weaken. This is an inevitable consequence of the ar-\nrival\
    \ of orders of magnitude more data. Of course focused\nresearch on regions or\
    \ questions would continue and here\nthe main task would be enabling the distribution\
    \ of gathered\ndata.\n6\nConclusions\nA policy-relevant carbon monitoring system\
    \ consisted of a\nmulti-scale, coordinated suite of global carbon observations\n\
    and supporting data integration with a model-data fusion and\ndata distribution\
    \ system will contribute to answering critical\nscientiﬁc and socio-economic questions\
    \ formulated in Sec-\ntion 2. Such monitoring system needs to provide observation-\n\
    ally derived estimates of key carbon-cycle quantities in the\natmosphere, ocean,\
    \ and terrestrial ecosystems. That requires\nobservations offering the possibility\
    \ to derive ﬂux and stocks\nproducts on a range of spatial scales, starting from\
    \ 100 m for\n”bottom-up” emissions and ecosystem carbon stocks, which\ncan then\
    \ be veriﬁed at larger scales using independent at-\nmospheric concentration measurements\
    \ and inversions. Con-\ntinuous sampling at appropriate frequency (e.g. minutes\
    \ for\natmospheric concentrations, and several years for soil carbon\nstocks)\
    \ are needed for (1) ﬂuxes of CO2 and CH4 over ocean\nand land surfaces, with\
    \ denser sampling in regions of high\nemissions, of large sinks and sinks variability,\
    \ and where\nCH4 and CO2 abnormal losses could occur in the coming\ndecade; (2)\
    \ estimates of biomass and biomass change for\nall land surfaces and coverage\
    \ with soil carbon sampling,\nwherever possible repeated over time; (3) biophysical\
    \ param-\neters for terrestrial ecosystems are needed globally to help\nconstrain\
    \ atmospheric ﬂux estimates and/or validate claimed\ncarbon offset credits, in\
    \ particular LAI and FAPAR; and (4)\nocean carbon parameters (both biogenic and\
    \ chemical) re-\nquire measurement of surface and 3-D properties including\nair–sea\
    \ 1pCO2, DIC, DOC, pH, O2, and other state vari-\nables.\nThe above data needs\
    \ can be best achieved with a\nwell-balanced portfolio of observational techniques\

    \ strategies, particularly those that leverage the\nstrengths of each technique\
    \ to offset the weaknesses of an-\nother. An example of this is the complementary\
    \ use of\nsurface-based in situ observations along with satellite remote\nsensing.\
    \ In situ observations represent the “gold standard”\nfor most data types in terms\
    \ of their high accuracy and abil-\nity to calibrate biases and establish robust\
    \ links to reference\nstandards where appropriate. Furthermore, in situ data es-\n\
    tablish the link to structural activity data needed to approx-\nimate points of\
    \ departure to measure effort levels of mitiga-\ntion actions. In situ observations\
    \ also offer visibility into pro-\ncesses or chemical species that cannot be remotely\
    \ sensed\nwith available technology. Satellite observations offer near-\nglobal,\
    \ high-density observations that ﬁll in the gaps between\nsparse in situ observations\
    \ and enable spatial extrapolation.\nThe global coverage provided by satellites\
    \ enables a truly\nsynoptic view of the global carbon cycle. Satellite observa-\n\
    tional data that are disseminated in an open fashion can also\nplay an important\
    \ role in meeting the critical requirement for\ntransparency that a policy-relevant\
    \ monitoring system needs.\nThrough global observation, satellites encourage a\
    \ fair and\ntransparent playing ﬁeld for carbon policy – at least in terms\nof\
    \ global reporting.\nIncreasing the number of observations is necessary, but not\n\
    sufﬁcient to achieve the required improvements in spatiotem-\nporal resolution\
    \ and precision of the ﬁnal data products. Sig-\nniﬁcant progress is needed in\
    \ key model components such as\natmospheric transport models and land/ocean carbon\
    \ models,\nincluding relevant processes of inorganic and organic car-\nbon cycling\
    \ (physical, chemical, biological/ecological, and\ngeological aspects). Additionally,\
    \ improvements in biogeo-\nphysical data alone will not yield the desired reduction\
    \ in\nuncertainty in policy-relevant information, unless these data\ncan be effectively\
    \ reconciled with inventory-based estimates\nin a statistically consistent framework\
    \ for quantifying un-\ncertainties. This suggests a need for both improvements\
    \ in\ninventory processes (increasing their spatiotemporal resolu-\ntion to scales\
    \ comparable with the improved observations)\nand development of integration systems\
    \ that allow intercom-\nparison and reconciliation between inventories and biogeo-\n\
    physical data in a sustained and operational fashion. This\nrequires development\
    \ of a common data processing, analy-\nsis, archival, and distribution system,\
    \ with careful attention\nto user-friendly protocols for end-product formats,\
    \ delivery\nprotocols, and metadata.\nImplementation of a global carbon monitoring\
    \ system will\nneed to be a collaborative effort on an international scale.\n\
    This is necessary both to satisfy the requirement for trans-\nparency (any system\
    \ deployed unilaterally will not enjoy\nwidespread credibility), as well as the\
    \ very practical need to\npool resources in the form of physical infrastructure,\
    \ and sci-\nentiﬁc and engineering expertise.\nWhile the requirements and scope\
    \ of collaboration for the\nproposed monitoring system may seem daunting, there\
    \ are\ntwo factors that indicate this problem is eminently tractable.\nFirst,\
    \ many elements of a global carbon monitoring sys-\ntem exist today in the form\
    \ of various surface observ-\ning networks, data synthesis, community models,\
    \ and data-\nassimilation systems, and coordinated use of ground and\nsatellite\
    \ observations. Indeed, the carbon-cycle science com-\nmunity has for some time\
    \ been executing these kind of\ncoordinated observations, data-model integration,\
    \ and top-\ndown/bottom-up reconciliation, albeit in a research mode\nwith limited\
    \ persistence or geospatial coverage and/or reso-\nlution. Second, at scales larger\
    \ than ∼ 10 km, the relationship\nbetween monitoring system performance and policy-support\n\
    value may be monotonic (i.e. there does not exist a sharp\nbreaking point between\
    \ a ﬂux map with 100 km resolution\nand one with 200 km resolution). This suggests\
    \ that an in-\ncremental or phased deployment process can be employed.\nSuch an\
    \ approach would allow a ﬁrst generation system to\nbe deployed based strictly\
    \ on existing observational assets,\nand therefore focus the initial investment\
    \ on the development\nof the necessary data integration system. However, there\
    \ cer-\ntainly is a strong break towards increased policy support if\nthe scales\
    \ addressed can be of less 10 km, the scale at which\nemissions can begin to be\
    \ monitored (Duren and Miller,\n2012). Given the uncertainties in both the carbon-cycle\
    \ and\nsocio-economic drivers, it is very likely that climate policies\nwill continue\
    \ to evolve in an organic fashion over the next\ndecades. A monitoring system\
    \ put in place sooner rather than\nlater can provide baseline information for\
    \ comparisons, and\nboth inform and grow with new policy developments.\nThe cost\
    \ of an adequately funded monitoring system with\ncurrent technology will be assessed\
    \ in a future study. Such\na system supported by the contributing organizations\
    \ could\nbe deployed by 2020 with performance capabilities based\non reasonable\
    \ extrapolations in available technology and sci-\nentiﬁc understanding of key\
    \ processes. A ﬁrst generation\ndemonstration-quality system could be deployed\
    \ within 3\nyears from the time the initial investment is made, and based\nstrictly\
    \ on observing assets that exist today.\nWe close with a summary of threats to\
    \ this concept. At the\ntime of this writing, some of the existing observational\
    \ assets\ndescribed here are at risk of being canceled due to funding\nconstraints\
    \ or failing due to age. For example, several satel-\nlites in use today are either\
    \ approaching or well beyond their\ndesign lifetimes. Delays in the replacement\
    \ satellites present\na discontinuation risk. These risks are manageable, but\
    \ care-\nful attention is required to preserve critical data continuity\nwhile\
    \ moving forward with deploying new capabilities. In\naddition, commercialization\
    \ of satellite data products is con-\nstraining overall scientiﬁc use and regular\
    \ global monitoring\nanalyses due to unaffordable high costs of accessing the\
    \ data.\nFinally, planning for future monitoring systems needs to con-\nsider\
    \ sustainability and maintainability through at least 2050\nto provide assured\
    \ support for GHG mitigation and adapta-\ntion policies expected to remain in\
    \ effect through that time.\nBiogeosciences, 11, 3547–3602, 2014\nwww.biogeosciences.net/11/3547/2014/\n\

    \ 22\n1.  INTRODUCTION\nMetropolitan Phoenix’s urban heat island (UHI), the\n\
    phenomenon of warmer temperatures at the core of\nthe built-up urban area compared\
    \ with the surround-\ning rural countryside, has been well documented in the\n\
    scientific literature (Balling & Brazel 1987, Brazel et al.\n2000, Baker et al.\
    \ 2002, Hawkins et al. 2004, Fast et\nal. 2005). Large-scale, rapid urbanization\
    \ (from fewer\nthan 1 million people in 1970 to almost 4 million today)\nhas typically\
    \ increased the warm season minimum\ntemperature by 5 K and the daily temperature\
    \ by more\nthan 3 K in a desert environment that is naturally hot\nand was unfit\
    \ for large-scale human habitation before\nthe popularization of air conditioning\
    \ during the 1950s\n(Cooper 1998, Baker et al. 2002). There is an urgent\nneed\
    \ among planners and city officials for a more prac-\ntical understanding of the\
    \ effects of new construction\non the local climate because warmer temperatures\n\
    reduce human comfort, increase energy and water use,\nand compromise the region’s\
    \ capacity to market itself\nas a year-round tourist destination. \n© Inter-Research\

    \ variation in June mean minimum tempera-\ntures for weather stations in and around\
    \ metropolitan Phoenix, USA, for the period 1990 to 2004.\nTemperature was related\
    \ to synoptic conditions, location in urban development zones (DZs), and the\n\
    pace of housing construction in a 1 km buffer around fixed-point temperature stations.\
    \ June is typi-\ncally clear and calm, and dominated by a dry, tropical air mass\
    \ with little change in minimum tem-\nperature from day to day. However, a dry,\
    \ moderate weather type accounted for a large portion of the\ninter-annual variability\
    \ in mean monthly minimum temperature. Significant temperature variation\nwas\
    \ explained by surface effects captured by the type of urban DZ, which ranged\
    \ from urban core\nand infill sites, to desert and agricultural fringe locations,\
    \ to exurban. An overall spatial urban effect,\nderived from the June monthly\
    \ mean minimum temperature, is in the order of 2 to 4 K. The cumula-\ntive housing\
    \ build-up around weather sites in the region was significant and resulted in\
    \ average\nincreases of 1.4 K per 1000 home completions, with a standard error\
    \ of 0.4 K. Overall, minimum tem-\nperatures were spatially and temporally accounted\
    \ for by variations in weather type, type of urban\nDZ (higher in core and infill),\
    \ and the number of home completions over the period. Results compare\nfavorably\
    \ with the magnitude of heating by residential development cited by researchers\
    \ using\ndiffering methodologies in other urban areas.\nKEY WORDS:  Urban heat\

    \ continuum\nwith 7 ‘urban climate zones’ and theorized their effects\non climate\
    \ via variation in roughness, aspect ratio, and\npercent built area. Following\
    \ this logic, but adapting\nthe idea to the built environment and settlement\n\
    history of Phoenix, we divided the area into 5 devel-\nopment zones (DZs): core,\
    \ infill, agricultural fringe,\ndesert fringe, and exurban (hereafter labeled\
    \ CORE,\nINFILL, AGFRINGE, DESFRINGE, and EXURBAN)\nand then empirically investigated\
    \ the effects of resi-\ndential construction and synoptic conditions on June\n\
    mean minimum temperatures between 1990 and 2004.\nUsing a data set that combines\
    \ information from 4 his-\ntorical weather networks and annual information on\n\
    new housing construction from the Maricopa Associa-\ntion of Governments (MAG,\
    \ the local council of gov-\nernments), we evaluated whether DZ affects tempera-\n\
    ture, the changes in temperature over the study period,\nand the way new home\
    \ construction and synoptic con-\nditions affect temperature. Resulting coefficient\

    \ undertaken under the auspices of\na National Science Foundation Project, the\
    \ Decision\nCenter for a Desert City (DCDC), that is charged with\nproducing scientific\
    \ results and decision tools that sup-\nport better water management decisions\
    \ in the face of\ngrowing climatic uncertainty. Although DCDC’s mis-\nsion is\
    \ primarily concerned with long-term climate\nchange and annual climate variability,\
    \ potential inter-\nactions between the UHI and regional and global cli-\nmatic\
    \ processes and the implications of these pro-\ncesses for water demand and supply\
    \ also represent\nimportant avenues of research. Spatio-temporal analy-\nses of\
    \ the heat island and its changes over time are\nvital inputs to other studies\
    \ of the effects of rising\nnighttime temperatures on water use, including\nimpacts\
    \ on lake and pool evaporation. \n2.  LITERATURE\nThe UHI is the most intensely\
    \ studied climate feature\nof cities (Arnfield 2003, Souch & Grimmond 2006).\n\
    Generally, researchers use fixed weather stations or\nmobile transects to study\
    \ the spatial and temporal air\ntemperature structure of cities. Oke (2006) called\
    \ for\na standardization of methods and communication in\nurban climatology, and\
    \ argued that any new place-\nment or use of ongoing fixed stations or mobile\
    \ surveys\nin an urban environment for analysis of the UHI should\nconsider (1)\
    \ the general urban zone within which a site\nis located, (2) the setting of the\
    \ immediate site and its\nsurroundings, and (3) the layer of atmosphere being\n\
    observed, e.g. canopy, roughness sublayer, surface, or\nouter layer. Grimmond\
    \ (2006) noted that there are a\nmultitude of data consistency issues—including\
    \ the\nexposure of sites, data quality, and station representa-\ntiveness—in a\
    \ historical weather network. As a result,\nthere is a continued need to evaluate\
    \ temperature\nfields relative to the role of surface/building geometry,\nland\
    \ use, vegetation, and patterns of anthropogenic\nheat release. \nRecent research\
    \ summarized by Souch & Grimmond\n(2006) shows that the UHI is primarily a nighttime\
    \ phe-\nnomenon, can occur throughout the year, is dependent\non weather conditions\
    \ (wind, cloud cover, etc.), and\ngenerally consists of higher temperatures in\
    \ the urban\ncore and commercial locations, with lower tempera-\ntures in residential\
    \ and rural sites. Previous research\non residential areas and changes in air\
    \ temperature\nsuggest that single-family housing developments raise\nnighttime\
    \ temperatures by 2 to 5 K above rural back-\nground values (e.g. Kuttler et al.\
    \ 1996, Svensson 2004,\nUnger 2004, Grossman-Clarke et al. 2005, Alcoforado\n\
    & Andrade 2006, Hedquist & Brazel 2006, Hartz et al.\n2006). Our approach was\
    \ to evaluate spatio-temporal\npatterns of temperature, by developing relationships\n\
    among factors that are simultaneously operating at\nboth local (within the city\
    \ and in rural areas) and\nregional (climate setting and terrain) scales to gain\
    \ fur-\nther insights into the spatial distribution of tempera-\nture trends across\
    \ an urban environment that is both\ninfilling and spreading outward. \nThe rapidly\
    \ urbanizing region of central Arizona is\nan excellent site for evaluating spatio-temporal\
    \ trends\nin temperature because of the magnitude of recent\ngrowth and urban\
    \ development, and because of the\nvariety of environments in which this new develop-\n\
    ment occurs (Gammage 1999, Gober 2006). Growth\noccurs from infilling of the already\
    \ built-up area and\nfrom development at the urban fringe. Moreover,\ndespite\
    \ the popular image of Phoenix as the epitome of\na sprawling metropolis, new\
    \ residential densities are\nhigher today than in the recent past because of rapid\n\
    growth, growing land prices, and intense competition\nfor land. According to our\
    \ calculations based on files of\nthe Maricopa County Assessors’ Office, the average\
    \ lot\nsize of a single-family home constructed in the 1970s\nwas 784 m2 (8434\
    \ ft2), which reduced to 772 m2 (8308 ft2)\nduring the 1980s, 696 m2 (7482 ft2)\
    \ during the 1990s,\nand 688 m2 (7400 ft2) between 2000 and 2003. This\nmeans\
    \ that the built environment does not correspond\nto traditional expectations\
    \ of declining densities with\ndistance from the urban core; there is a more even\
    \ dis-\ntribution of densities across the Phoenix metropolitan\narea than Oke’s\
    \ (2006) model would suggest. \nPrevious empirical and modeling studies of Phoenix’s\n\
    UHI were either short-term in nature, focused on the\n172\nBrazel et al.: Urban\
    \ heat island in Phoenix\nspatial attributes of the heat island (e.g. Brazel et\
    \ al.\n1993, Hawkins et al. 2004, Fast et al. 2005, Grossman-\nClarke et al. 2005)\
    \ or limited to a coarse urban-rural\ndichotomy when specifying temporal dimensions\
    \ (e.g.\nBrazel et al. 2000, Baker et al. 2002, Stabler et al. 2005).\nNo study\
    \ has made use of the annual housing time\nseries database to link air temperature\
    \ patterns to the\nprocess of urbanization as manifested in new housing\nconstruction.\
    \ Our further contribution is in\nthe simultaneous consideration of space\nand\
    \ time, and in the choice of urban zones\nthat reflect the urban growth processes\
    \ of\nPhoenix in particular, and North American\ncities more generally.\n3.  DATA\
    \ AND METHODS\nFixed point, surface weather station net-\nwork data were used\
    \ and co-located in a\nGeographical Information System (GIS)\nclassified by DZ\
    \ type, together with a spa-\ntial housing completion data set. In addi-\ntion,\
    \ a synoptic variable was developed\nfor the study period of 1990–2004. The\n\
    sub-sections below describe the data, vari-\nables, and methods used in the statistical\n\
    analyses.\n3.1.  Weather stations\nWeather network data of air tempera-\ntures\
    \ within the urban canopy layer (ca. 2 m\nheight) were obtained from 4 networks\
    \ in\nthe metropolitan area: (1) Phoenix Real-\ntime Instrumentation for Surface\
    \ Mete-\norological Studies (PRISMS, Pon et al.\n1998), (2) Arizona Meteorological\
    \ Network\n(AZMET, see http://ag.arizona.edu/azmet),\n(3) Maricopa County Flood\
    \ Control District\n(MCFCD, see http://fcd.maricopa.gov), and\n(4) over 20 co-op\
    \ stations obtained from\nthe National Climatic Data Center of the\nNational Oceanic\
    \ Atmospheric Adminis-\ntration (NCDC, NOAA; data available\nfrom www.ncdc.noaa.gov\
    \ and summarized\nmonthly at www.wrcc.dri.edu). Table 1\nsummarizes site name,\
    \ elevation, numbers\nof homes built within a diameter of 1 km of\na site, and\
    \ the type of weather network.\nFig. 1 shows the distribution of stations and\n\
    their DZ code. Elevations of the stations\nranged from 219 m to over 976 m. How-\n\
    ever, most sites clustered near a range of\n300 to 450 m. For the array of sites\
    \ used, no significant\ncorrelation was found between minimum temperature\nand\
    \ elevation within the station network (r2 = 0.07),\nand thus this was not specifically\
    \ included in our sub-\nsequent multivariate analysis. Data obtained from\nthese\
    \ networks have been quality controlled (by net-\nwork specialists or by the state\
    \ climate office), then\nsystematically organized in a GIS. With the exception\n\

    \ (an energy and power company),\nwhich manages the monitoring sites (data are\
    \ dis-\nplayed at http://data.afws.org/sui/). For this study, we\nrestricted the\

    \ Phoenix experiences\nrelatively hot, clear, calm conditions for most days, an\n\
    excellent time for UHI evaluation (Brazel et al. 2000).\nDue to this desert area\
    \ having over 200 clear days per\nyear and low winds, the UHI phenomenon is evident\n\
    on a year-round basis and June characteristically rep-\nresents the nature of\
    \ the spatial dimension of the UHI. \nWe encountered missing data for approximately\n\
    13% of the data points, and used spatio-temporal geo-\nstatistical tools to estimate\
    \ the value of these observa-\ntions by integrating general knowledge based on\n\
    background information and summary statistics, and\nsite-specific knowledge obtained\
    \ through experience\nwith the specific situation (Christakos 2000, Christakos\n\
    et al. 2001). The majority of missing records occurred\nnear the beginning of\
    \ the time period, because not all\nsites extended back in time to June 1990.\

    \ heat island in Phoenix\nmaximum entropy (BME) method was employed to\nestimate\
    \ missing data and involved 3 steps: (1) a struc-\ntural stage leading to a prior\
    \ probability density func-\ntion (PDF) that uses the mean and covariance functions\n\
    to model space/time dependencies, trends, and the\nbasic physical structure of\
    \ the variable (June minimum\ntemperature), (2) a specification stage in which\
    \ BME\nassesses data uncertainty in a specific set of sampling\npoints, and (3)\
    \ an integration stage in which the prior\nPDF is enriched by blending the 2 knowledge\
    \ bases\nthrough Bayesian conditionalization. The latter stage\nproduces a posterior\
    \ PDF at all points of interest.\nWe modeled spatio-temporal variability in terms\
    \ of a\ncovariance model with 2 exponential elements. The\nfirst accounts for\
    \ the short range of spatio-temporal\nautocorrelation (i.e. 3 decimal degrees\
    \ in space and\n6.5 mo in time), which covers metropolitan Phoenix\nand entails\
    \ a seasonal time scale. The second accounts\nfor the long-range correlation (i.e.\
    \ 46 decimal degrees\nin space and 60 mo in time). The posterior PDF based\non\
    \ space and time significantly increases the accuracy\nof our predictions over\
    \ a purely spatial analytic proce-\ndure. There may still be some uncertainty\
    \ relative to\nthe station network comparability itself, but we con-\nsider that\
    \ less than one-third of the stations (mostly the\nNOAA network sites in Table\
    \ 1) that we used would\nhave any problems in this regard.\n3.2.  MAG housing\
    \ completion data\nWe used an archived data set available from the\nMAG, which\
    \ was based on single-family housing com-\npletions in metropolitan Phoenix for\
    \ each year during\nthe period 1990 to 2004. A completion is recorded\nwhen the\
    \ certificate of occupancy is awarded by its\nrespective municipality. Municipalities\
    \ in turn submit\nthe georeferenced information to MAG, and MAG\nassembles the\
    \ data region-wide and updates the\nrecords quarterly. We recognize that the use\
    \ of this\nreadily available data set acts as a surrogate for the full\nlandscape\
    \ development process from place to place\n(homes, streets, yards, etc.). The\
    \ main advantage is\na consistent, complete annual data set for the entire\n15\
    \ yr study period. \nMaps of housing completions for three 5 yr periods\nillustrate\
    \ the areas of new housing completions during\nthe study period, the continuous\
    \ outward movement of\nthe urban fringe of new development, and the rela-\ntively\
    \ large geographic area in which new housing\nconstruction is occurring (Fig.\
    \ 2). The urban fringe in\nPhoenix is not, as commonly conceived, a narrow band\n\
    of disturbed landscape, but rather a large area that is\ngradually but continuously\
    \ filled in (Gober & Burns\n2002). \n175\nFig. 2. Residential completions from\
    \ 1990 to 2004 in 5 yr incre-\nments. Gray areas are new housing completions\n\
    Clim Res 33: 171–182, 2007\nAlso, using the housing data, we buffered each\nweather\
    \ station with a 1 km diameter buffer, and\nextracted cumulative numbers of homes\
    \ completed\nwithin this buffer for each year from 1990 to 2004. We\nperformed\
    \ this analysis in view of Oke (2006), who\nsuggested that influences closer to\
    \ a site play a major\nrole in driving the variability observed at sites in urban\n\
    areas (Table 1). We acknowledge that our choice of a\n1 km buffer relaxes an idealistic,\
    \ more stringent rule\nfor urban site representativeness; however, it does\nmatch\
    \ the modelling resolution of the PSU/NCAR\nmesoscale model (known as MM5) (Grossman-Clarke\n\
    et al. 2005), and allows for the fact that most network\nweather sites have a\
    \ core inner locale of the station\nitself (ca. 25 × 25 m) before the surrounding\
    \ land cover\nstarts a short distance away from the site, as well as\ngenerally\
    \ allowing for the capture of more of the\nregional development process around\
    \ weather sites.\nNone of the sites are in complex locales—close to\nmajor urban\
    \ canyons—where results would largely\ndepend on the exact placement of the sensor\
    \ in that\nenvironment.\n3.3.  Development zones (DZs)\nBased on the housing completion\
    \ maps and our gen-\neral knowledge of land use patterns in the region, we\ndeveloped\
    \ a DZ typology of weather stations that\nincluded (1) stations in the inner CORE\
    \ of the urban-\nized area where little new construction occurred, (2)\nINFILL\
    \ locations that were clearly part of the urban-\nized area in 1990 but became\
    \ more densely settled by\n2004, (3) AGFRINGE locations centered in areas of\n\
    new construction on former irrigated agricultural\nlands, (4) DESFRINGE sites\
    \ where new construction\nhas replaced open desert land, and (5) EXURBAN\nlocations\
    \ outside the built-up urbanized area (Fig. 1).\nThe EXURBAN sites were mostly\
    \ near agricultural\nlocations or dams and lakes owing to the ease of access\n\
    of these sites in a complex terrain considerably distant\nto the city. \nThe typology\
    \ of the weather station sites generally\nrelates to the recommended spatial classification\
    \ of\nurban forms arranged according to their ability to\nimpact local climate,\
    \ as presented by Oke (2006). Our\nEXURBAN category corresponds to Oke’s (2006)\
    \ Type\n7 category of scattered houses in natural land cover\narea. Our AGFRINGE\
    \ and DESFRINGE sites are rough\nequivalents of Type 5 sites (medium, low density\
    \ sub-\nurban), and our CORE and INFILL sites relate to Type 3\nsites (highly\
    \ developed, medium density urban) in\nOke’s (2006) classification. Our typology\
    \ differs be-\ncause it is based on changes in the built environment in\naddition\
    \ to the nature of built environment itself. We\nnote that little change occurred\
    \ in the CORE and\nEXURBAN sites, and that rapid change occurred in\nINFILL locations\
    \ and in the 2 urban fringe sites\nAGFRINGE and DESFRINGE (Table 1). \n3.4.  Regional\
    \ synoptic variable\nWe used a synoptic variable to account for inter-an-\nnual\
    \ variation in temperatures experienced across the\nweather network. Sheridan’s\
    \ (2002) spatial synoptic\nclassification (SSC2) scheme was employed (available\n\
    at http://sheridan.geog.kent.edu/ssc.html, expressed\nas results for the SSC2\
    \ classification). For June, 64% of\nthe days are typed dry tropical with light\
    \ winds (<5 m\ns–1), and another 20% of days are associated with cool\nair intrusions\
    \ related to troughs that have developed in\nthe Western USA that reduce mean\
    \ monthly minimum\ntemperature. In our analysis, the variable used was\nthe number\
    \ of days in June that a weather type is\ncharacterized by this second category,\
    \ defined in SSC2\nas Dry Moderate (later coded as DRYMOD). We con-\nducted a\
    \ correlation analysis of the frequency of days\nin June classified as a particular\
    \ weather type by SSC2\nagainst June monthly mean minimum temperature.\nThe highest\
    \ correlation (r2 = 0.75, inverse relationship)\nwas observed between the frequency\
    \ of the DRYMOD\nweather type per month and monthly mean minimum\ntemperature.\
    \ In June, the recurrent Dry Tropical\nweather type brings warm nights in general,\
    \ as do\nsome transitional weather types and infrequent moist\nweather types.\
    \ Thus, during the study period, the dry\ntropical frequencies per se only correlated\
    \ with mini-\nmum temperature variation with an r2 of 0.09.\nWhen using SSC2,\
    \ we understand that one should\nexercise caution because the SSC2 and the frequen-\n\
    cies determined from it might conceivably contain an\n‘urban effect’ as a consequence\
    \ of the derivation of\nweather types that enter the catalog. This could be so\n\
    because surface data are used in its derivation, often\nobtained from major first-order\
    \ weather sites within or\nnear urban areas. This would mean that there could\
    \ be\ndiscontinuities in the frequencies of various categories\nof daily weather\
    \ types. This could certainly be the case\nif the main station used showed a very\
    \ significant time\ntrend of weather elements attributable to local effects.\n\
    The Sky Harbor International Airport site (coded PHX\nin the SSC2-derived data)\
    \ may represent an example\nof this influence. However, we consider that this\
    \ is not\nthe case for Phoenix, and that our use of this factor in\nthis study\
    \ is warranted on several grounds: (a) a\nnearby station—Tucson, Arizona—shows\
    \ similar tem-\nporal patterns and variability to Sky Harbor for the\nJune 1990\
    \ to 2004 period, and the Tucson airport locale\nis entirely outside of any Tucson\
    \ urban effect (Comrie\n176\nBrazel et al.: Urban heat island in Phoenix\n2000),\
    \ (b) independent analysis of time trends in tem-\nperature for the Sky Harbor\
    \ Airport station for the\nperiod 1990 to 2004 (and, in addition, our analysis\n\
    herein) shows no major increase or major trend in tem-\nperature (however, prior\
    \ to 1990 there was a consider-\nable trend in temperature at Sky Harbor Airport;\
    \ see\ne.g. Brazel et al. 2000, Baker et al. 2002), and (c) there\nis no obvious\
    \ time trend in the Dry Tropical or DRY-\nMOD types revealed in the SSC2 catalog\
    \ within the\nperiod 1990 to 2004. Dry Tropical and DRYMOD days\nare related to\
    \ the frequency of ridging and troughing\nin the Western USA during June, as determined\
    \ by a\nseparate composite analysis that used the NCEP/NCAR\nreanalysis data (www.cdc.noaa.gov/Composites/Day/).\n\
    As an illustration, we chose a mid-study period year\n(1998) to demonstrate the\
    \ SSC2 weather type and asso-\nciated atmospheric conditions (Figs. 3 & 4). We\
    \ com-\nposited a sample run of days catalogued as DRYMOD\n(June 7 to 10) and\
    \ Dry Tropical (June 19 to 22) in the\nSSC2, and displayed the 500 mb geopotential\
    \ height\nsurface and 850 mb temperature pattern over the USA,\nand Sky Harbor’s\
    \ hourly air temperature and dew\npoint during these 2 periods. Generally, it\
    \ holds true\nthat when DRYMOD is prevalent in the catalog,\ntroughing over the\
    \ Southwestern USA occurs with\ncooler upper level and surface temperatures. A\
    \ more\nthorough analysis of the SSC2 catalog values vs. syn-\noptics and circulation\
    \ characteristics for this time of\nyear is certainly warranted, but is beyond\
    \ the scope of\nthis study. Here we simply chose to use the DRYMOD\ndaily weather\
    \ type code (summed over a monthly time\nscale) for the period 1990 to 2004 to\
    \ evaluate the rela-\ntive role of regional weather effects on the minimum\ntemperature\
    \ from year to year.\n177\nFig. 3. Examples of (a,c) dry moderate and (b,d) dry\

    Our analysis evaluated the effects of the cumulative\nnumber of new homes constructed\
    \ in year j (HOUS-\nINGj), the number of days in a June month correspond-\ning\
    \ to the dry moderate weather conditions in year j\n(DRYMODj), and DZ (including\
    \ AGFRINGE, DES-\nFRINGE, CORE, EXURBAN, and INFILL) on mean\nJune minimum temperature\
    \ in year j (TEMPj). In the\nfirst stage of the analysis, HOUSING and DRYMOD\n\
    were classified as covariates, whereas DZ was ana-\nlyzed as a treatment effect\
    \ (i.e. as a dummy variable).\nFitting the data to the full model allowed us to\
    \ evaluate\ninteractions between DZ and the 2 confounding vari-\nables and test\
    \ for the equality of slopes for each covari-\nate. Our goal was to determine\
    \ whether DZ affects the\nway DRYMOD and HOUSING influence temperature.\nAfter\
    \ using a CONTRAST command in SAS version\n9.0, we were able to conclude that\
    \ there was no reason\nto consider any interaction terms: the slope coefficients\n\
    of the 2 confounding variables do not differ signifi-\ncantly across DZs at the\
    \ 0.05 level of significance (see\nTable 2). \nBased on this conclusion, we proceeded\
    \ with the\nreduced-form analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)\nmodel expressed below\
    \ in Eq. 1\n(1)\nwhere i = treatment effects, j = number of observations,\nx =\
    \ 4 book-keeping variates for DZs, μ = intercept, z =\n2 continuous variables\
    \ DRYMOD and HOUSING, e =\nrandom error term that is assumed to be normally dis-\n\
    tributed and αk and βl are coefficients.\nThe reduced-form ANCOVA allowed us to\
    \ examine\nwhether intercepts vary significantly among the 5 DZs.\nAssuming that\
    \ there are significant differences, we\nproceeded to estimate coefficients (αk\
    \ and βl) that can\nbe used to predict changes in temperature for DRY-\nMOD, HOUSING,\
    \ AGFRINGE, DESFRINGE, CORE,\nand INFILL. We excluded EXURBAN from this phase\n\
    of the analysis because it is known automatically\nwhen AGFRINGE, DESFRINGE, CORE,\
    \ and INFILL\nare known. The constant in the main model could be\ninterpreted\
    \ as representing estimated temperature at\nEXURBAN sites not yet affected by\
    \ the urbanization\nprocess. The α coefficients for AGFRINGE, DES-\nFRINGE, INFILL,\
    \ and CORE represent the change\nin temperature relative to EXURBAN sites.\n4.\
    \  RESULTS\n4.1.  UHI variations from 1990 to 2004\nTo investigate broad trends\
    \ in the areal extent and\nmagnitude of the UHI, we show as an example three\n\
    5 yr mean patterns for June monthly mean minimum\ntemperature using ordinary kriging\
    \ and an exponen-\ntial statistical model to interpolate the air temperatures\n\
    in GIS (Fig. 5). The monthly mean minimum tempera-\nture distribution is characteristic\
    \ of a UHI pattern with\na magnitude of 2 to 4 K, comparable to Fast et al.’s\n\
    (2005) general UHI findings for Phoenix. The series\nshows a heat island in Phoenix\
    \ that expanded as the\npopulation grew from 2.2 million in 1990 to 3.7 million\n\
    in 2004. The shape of the heat island changed only\nslightly between the first\
    \ and second time period, but\nexpanded substantially in the most recent 5 yr\
    \ period.\nThe intermediate 5 years were dominated by higher\nthan normal DRYMOD\
    \ days, resulting in unusually\ncool temperatures in Phoenix. Our results are\
    \ also\ncomparable with those of Alcoforado & Andrade\n(2006), who observed a\
    \ UHI of ca. 3 K for Lisbon (pop-\nulation 2.7 million) in their analysis of sky\
    \ view factor\n(SVF) and percent built up area vs. nocturnal tempera-\ntures.\
    \ Our results are also comparable with a previous,\nlimited analysis by Brazel\
    \ et al. (2000) of selected\nurban CORE sites in relation to a rural desert location\n\
    southeast of the urban area.\n4.2.  Results of statistical analysis\nThe slope\
    \ coefficients of the DRYMOD and HOUSING\nvariables did not vary significantly\
    \ among the 5 DZs\n(Table 2). In other words, location within the urban area\n\
    per se did not affect the process of how the DRYMOD\nand HOUSING variables impact\
    \ the variability of TEMP.\nTEMPij\nk\nkij\nl\nlij\nij\nl\nk\nx\nz\ne\n=\n+\n\

    Automated Surface Observing System (first-order weather \nstation)\nBrazel et\
    \ al.: Urban heat island in Phoenix\nDRYMOD is a broad regional process, and\n\
    we expected that its impact on all sites\nwould be similar. The impact of HOUSING,\n\
    through unifying processes of heat retention\nowing to changing SVF and heat storage\n\
    changes near weather sites, also appeared\nto act similarly among all zones. \n\
    However, there were significant differ-\nences in the intercept coefficients between\n\
    some of the DZs (Table 3). The AGFRINGE\nzone differed from the CORE and INFILL\n\
    sites at p < 0.05, and from the DESFRINGE at p < 0.10.\nAGFRINGE was not significantly\
    \ different from EX-\nURBAN. AGFRINGE and EXURBAN have similar\nintercepts because\
    \ EXURBAN sites used for this study\nwere also either near water bodies (dams\
    \ or lakes)\nor near the strong influences of agricultural, well-\nwatered landscapes.\
    \ The INFILL and CORE sites dif-\nfered significantly (p < 0.05) from every other\
    \ zone,\nindicating that both are distinctive in terms of their\nheat retention\
    \ factors and likely advective properties. \nCoefficients derived from the ANCOVA\
    \ showed the\neffects of the independent variables on TEMP, using\nEXURBAN sites\
    \ as the point of reference. The CORE\nand INFILL temperatures were 2.2 K and\
    \ 1.0 K higher\nthan EXURBAN sites, respectively, whereas the\nDESFRINGE was 0.5\
    \ K higher. The coefficient of\nAGFRINGE was not statistically different from\
    \ that of\nEXURBAN. Overall, the results indicate a strong\neffect of zone type\
    \ on temperature. Given that hous-\ning completion is in the model, it appears\
    \ that\nregional location influences the intensity of the UHI\nabove and beyond\
    \ the local effects of new housing\nconstruction. Results support the call by\
    \ Oke (2006) to\nreport UHI findings by morphology and zones of a city\n179\n\

    \ and\nto unravel the broader influences of urban form on\ntemperatures.\nThe\
    \ DRYMOD and HOUSING variables were sig-\nnificantly related to TEMP, holding\
    \ DZ constant\n(Table 4). The 2 variables acted as expected. High val-\nues for\
    \ the DRYMOD variable resulted in cooler tem-\nperatures, whereas high levels\
    \ of new-home construc-\ntion caused warming owing to the combination of\nreductions\
    \ in SVF and addition of heat-retaining sur-\nfaces (roofs, asphalt, cement, etc.)\
    \ to a given neighbor-\nhood. In June, the average number of SSC2 DRYMOD\ndays\
    \ is ~3 to 4 per month, which on average would\nmean a cooling impact of some\
    \ 1.1 to 1.4 K on the\nmonthly mean minimum temperature. The HOUSING\nimpact coefficient\
    \ is +0.0014 K per home completion,\nor +1.4 K per 1000 homes (equivalent to complete\
    \ build\nup around a weather site in given a buffer size of\n1 km). There is variability\
    \ around this value (SE =\n0.4 K), partly because not all new homes are alike,\
    \ but\nan inventory of the entire home completion data set\nrevealed mostly repetitive,\
    \ single-family, similar style\nresidences. A more detailed breakdown of the HOUS-\n\
    ING impact coefficient across the rapidly developing\nzones of the metropolitan\
    \ area by morphology of house\nstyles would require further analysis with climate\n\
    research sampling that is not possible with the limited\nnumber of fixed sites\
    \ we analyzed in this study.\n5.  THE HOUSING EFFECT\nBased on the HOUSING coefficient\
    \ in\nTable 4 (noted above), the construction of\n1000 new homes in the buffer\
    \ surrounding\na site is estimated to increase temperature\nby 1.4 K within various\
    \ DZ areas. Inspec-\ntion of aerial photos of many of the indi-\nvidual weather\
    \ sites that were surrounded\nby development from 1990 to 2004 (e.g.\nCollier,\
    \ Laveen, Crossroads, Sun Lakes,\nand Corbell; Fig. 1, Table 1) revealed that\n\
    it would take between 700 and 1000 homes\nin the chosen buffer zone to build out\
    \ a dense neigh-\nborhood of typically sized, single-family homes. In\norder to\
    \ provide an interpretation of the theoretical\nheat retention effect through\
    \ factors such as the SVF\n(Svensson 2004, Unger 2004), we estimated a simple\n\
    relation between numbers of homes per unit area\naround a site and a ground reference\
    \ level SVF.\nWe made this estimate for the end points of 1990 and\n2004 by calculating\
    \ typical height/width (H/W) ratios\namong homes, given home density and spacing\
    \ in the\nbuffer, then by converting to a mean SVF for mid-\ndistance among the\
    \ homes using a simple expression\nrelating H/W to SVF (SVF = 0.2905 ln[H/W] +\
    \ 0.4815, a\nrelationship fitting Oke’s [1981] scale model results).\nWe used\
    \ the results of a field study by Hartz et al.\n(2006) to aid in determining the\
    \ relationship between\ndensity, spacing, and house height and size in order\n\
    to estimate the SVF. Hartz et al. (2006) obtained field\nestimates of SVF for\
    \ a range of housing densities by\nmapping the sky horizon among homes and converting\n\
    these data to SVFs. We consider our approximations\nfor all weather sites to be\
    \ reasonable, given the\napproximation we used for SVF. It should be noted that\n\
    our calculation is primarily based on the spacing\namong homes and the impact\
    \ that SVF variability\nwould have on temperature as a consequence of the\nHOUSING\
    \ variable alone.\nOur results of SVF calculations indicated that the\nmajority\
    \ of locations would have experienced a reduc-\ntion in HOUSING SVF of less than\
    \ 0.20 in the weather\nsite buffer zones over the study time period. Only\nabout\
    \ 20% of sites experienced reductions in SVF from\n1990 to 2004 that exceeded\
    \ 0.20. Our estimates of SVF\nfor housing areas (from a mean of 0.99 in 1990 to\
    \ a\nmean of 0.83 in 2004) were somewhat consistent with,\nbut slightly higher\
    \ than, typical SVF values estimated\nby Unger (2004) and Svensson (2004) for\
    \ variations\nwithin their reported single-family neighborhoods,\nand were very\
    \ similar to a single-family residential\nvalue (0.85) reported by Grimmond et\
    \ al. (2001). Most\nof the residential areas around our weather sites were\nnot\
    \ fully built up between 1990 and 2004, with the\n180\nTable 3. Results of tests\
    \ of significant differences between intercept coeffi-\ncients. The ANCOVA model\
    \ should be tested to determine whether there\nare urban development zone effects\
    \ on June minimum temperature. This\ntable demonstrates that not all cases have\
    \ statistically insignificant results,\nwhich allowed us to keep the ANCOVA model.\

    (2006) study of a fully-developed, compact, high den-\nsity desert fringe neighborhood\
    \ in the Phoenix area. \nRegression equations determined by Unger (2004)\nand\
    \ Svensson (2004) imply typical magnitudes of resi-\ndential warming compared\
    \ with rural counterparts,\nranging between 0°C for an SVF of 0.99 and 1.5 to\
    \ 2.5\nK for SVF of 0.83. For an SVF reduction from 0.99 to\n0.83 (mean change\
    \ across all sites), our statistical\nresults would imply a temperature change\
    \ attributable\nto HOUSING around a site of only 0.3 K. For a reduc-\ntion to\
    \ an SVF much lower than 0.80, the temperature\nincrease would approach 1.0 to\
    \ 1.5 K, which is lower\nthan residential warming values estimated by other\n\
    studies. To reconcile this, some points should be noted:\n(1) our SVF buffer calculations\
    \ would not necessarily\nbe explicitly representative of the weather station\n\
    locales, because most stations are not located right\nbetween narrow spacings\
    \ among homes in a neighbor-\nhood, but nearby where the SVF would be greater,\
    \ and\n(2) the DZ (which accounts for the type of develop-\nment landscape) accounts\
    \ for further heating beyond\nthe HOUSING effect. The HOUSING and DZ factors\n\
    together yield an UHI effect ranging from 3.6 K in the\nCORE to 1.9 K at the DESFRINGE,\
    \ assuming the build\nup of 1000 homes. Considering both DZ and HOUS-\nING, our\
    \ results are very close to those of Grossman-\nClarke et al. (2005) and Hedquist\
    \ & Brazel (2006) of 2\nto 3 K heating in residential areas of Phoenix above\n\
    rural background levels (employing MM5 modeling\nfor the former, and mobile transect\
    \ sampling for the\nlatter). In a similar multiple regression approach to\nheat\
    \ island evaluation of Stolberg, Germany, Kuttler et\nal. (1996) found a 0.35\
    \ K or 10% so-called ‘sealed area’\nrate of temperature increase across the city\
    \ (streets,\ncity squares, buildings within 200 m2 of measuring\npoints from mobile\
    \ sampling). This would yield ca. 3 to\n4 K for fully built places and is comparable\
    \ with our\nheating rate due to housing change and associated DZ.\n6.  CONCLUSIONS\
    \ AND REMARKS\nThe UHI spatial and temporal properties are related\nto both climatic\
    \ and human forces operating at a range\nof spatial scales. In this study, we\
    \ attempted to inte-\ngrate climate and urban-growth variables to explain\nthe\
    \ air temperatures in and around the Phoenix metro-\npolitan area between 1990\
    \ and 2004. Results revealed\nthat the spatio-temporal variation in June minimum\n\
    temperature stems from large-scale synoptic processes\nthat bring cooler temperatures\
    \ into the region on about\n20% of June days, and the pace of new housing con-\n\
    struction immediately surrounding weather stations\nwithin a particular DZ. Owing\
    \ to the fact that DZ did\nnot significantly affect the slope coefficients for\
    \ DRY-\nMOD and HOUSING, we concluded that the effects of\nsynoptic condition\
    \ and new home construction did not\nvary significantly across the urban region.\n\
    Our independent variables account for spatial varia-\ntion (DZ), temporal variation\
    \ (DRYMOD), and a combi-\nnation of the two (HOUSING). The size of the coeffi-\n\
    cients indicate the estimated effects of moving from\none type of urban development\
    \ to another. For exam-\nple, the agricultural fringe added just 0.1 K to exurban\n\
    sites, which was not statistically significant. The desert\nfringe added 0.5 K\
    \ and infill locations 1.0 K, and the\nurban core was 2.2 K warmer than the rural\
    \ country-\nside. The additive effects of new home construction\n(1.4 K per 1000\
    \ homes) and DZ produced estimates of\nthe UHI effect that are quite comparable\
    \ with levels in\ncities of comparable size. \nModel coefficients provide planners\
    \ and city offi-\ncials with a tool to estimate the temperature effects of\nnew\
    \ home construction. In Greater Phoenix, where\nmore than 60 000 building permits\
    \ were issued for\nresidential units in 2004, urban growth has a profound\ninfluence\
    \ on localized temperature conditions. It is\ncommonplace for entire neighborhoods\
    \ to sprout up\nin a matter of months and for weather stations to\nbe completely\
    \ ‘surrounded’ by urban development.\nPotential homeowners also can make a more\
    \ accurate\nprediction of the long-term climate consequences of\nnew construction,\
    \ depending on where they are\nlocated and the pace of new construction. The overall\n\
    gained results and coefficients developed in the statis-\ntical approach of this\
    \ study are certainly specific to\nthe Phoenix climate and setting. However, the\
    \ role\nof housing on warming is comparable with findings\nelsewhere. \nAcknowledgements.\

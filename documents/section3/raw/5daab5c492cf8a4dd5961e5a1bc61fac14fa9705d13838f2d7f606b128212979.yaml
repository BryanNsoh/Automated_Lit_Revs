    \ advancing over the past few years. This advancement\nis attributed to the increased\
    \ innovation and availability of new technologies which can enable the\nhigh-throughput\
    \ phenotyping of complex plant traits. The application of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ in\nvarious domains of science has also grown exponentially in recent years.\
    \ Notably, the computer\nvision, machine learning, and deep learning aspects of\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence have been successfully\nintegrated into non-invasive\
    \ imaging techniques. This integration is gradually improving the\nefﬁciency of\
    \ data collection and analysis through the application of machine and deep learning\
    \ for\nrobust image analysis. In addition, artiﬁcial intelligence has fostered\
    \ the development of software\nand tools applied in ﬁeld phenotyping for data\
    \ collection and management. These include open-\nsource devices and tools which\
    \ are enabling community driven research and data-sharing, thereby\navailing the\
    \ large amounts of data required for the accurate study of phenotypes. This paper\
    \ reviews\nmore than one hundred current state-of-the-art papers concerning AI-applied\
    \ plant phenotyping\npublished between 2010 and 2020. It provides an overview\
    \ of current phenotyping technologies and\nthe ongoing integration of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence into plant phenotyping. Lastly, the limitations of the\ncurrent\
    \ approaches/methods and future directions are discussed.\nKeywords: artiﬁcial\

    \ the United Nations, the world population is expected to grow\nto nine billion\
    \ by 2050 [1]. With the increasing need for food production to match the\nprojected\
    \ population growth in order to prevent food insecurity, plant phenotyping is\n\
    now at the forefront of plant breeding as compared to genotyping [2]. Plant phenotyping\n\
    is deﬁned as the assessment of complex traits such as growth, development, tolerance,\n\
    resistance, architecture, physiology, ecology, yield, and the basic measurement\
    \ of individual\nquantitative parameters that form the basis for complex trait\
    \ assessment [2]. Scientists\nare increasingly interested in the use of phenomic-level\
    \ data to aid in the correlation\nbetween genomics and the variation in crop yields\
    \ and plant health [3–5]. In this way, plant\nphenotyping has become an important\
    \ aspect of crop improvement, availing data to assess\ntraits for variety selection\
    \ in order to identify desirable traits and eliminate undesirable\ntraits during\
    \ the evaluation of plant populations [6]. Plant phenotyping has improved\nprogressively\
    \ over the past 30 years, although obtaining satisfactory phenotypic data for\n\
    complex traits such as stress tolerance and yield potential remains challenging\
    \ [7]. The\nlarge data required for the effective study of phenotypes has led\
    \ to the development and\nuse of high-throughput phenotyping technologies to enable\
    \ the characterization of large\nnumbers of plants at a fraction of the time,\
    \ cost, and labor of previously used traditional\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21134363\n\

    \ Traditional techniques previously required destructive measurements whereby\n\
    crops were harvested at particular growth stages in order to carry out genetic\
    \ testing and\nthe mapping of plant traits [8]. Since crop breeding programs require\
    \ repeated experimental\ntrials in order to ascertain which traits are of interest,\
    \ the process was slow, costly and\nsigniﬁcantly lagging behind the DNA sequencing\
    \ technologies which are necessary for\ncrop improvement [9].\nHigh-throughput\
    \ phenotyping has been fostered by non-invasive imaging techniques,\nwhich have\
    \ enabled the visualization of plant cell structures on a wider scale. As these\n\
    imaging technologies develop, images carry more useful extractable information\
    \ that sup-\nports biological interpretations of plant growth [10,11]. These techniques\
    \ include thermal\nimaging [12], chlorophyll ﬂuorescence [13,14], digital imaging\
    \ [15], and spectroscopic\nimaging [16].\nHigh-throughput phenotyping techniques\
    \ are currently being used to enable data\nacquisition in both laboratory and\
    \ ﬁeld settings. They are being employed at the levels of\ndata collection, data\
    \ management, and analysis. They include imaging sensors, growth\nchambers, data\
    \ management and analysis software, etc. [7,17–20]. The integration of\nartiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence into these technologies has contributed to the development of the\
    \ non-\ninvasive imaging aspect of phenomics. Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) technologies\
    \ in the form\nof computer vision and machine learning are increasingly being\
    \ used to acquire and analyze\nplant image data. Computer vision systems process\
    \ digital images of plants to detect\nspeciﬁc attributes for object recognition\
    \ purposes [21]. Machine learning employs various\ntools and approaches to ‘learn’\
    \ from large collections of crop phenotypes in order to classify\nunique data,\
    \ identify new patterns and features, and predict novel trends [22,23]. Recent\n\
    advancements in deep learning, a subset of machine learning, have provided promising\n\
    results for real-time image analysis. Deep learning is a machine learning approach\
    \ that\ntakes advantage of the large plant datasets available and uses them to\
    \ carry out image\nanalysis using convolutional neural networks [24]. In ﬁeld\
    \ phenotyping, AI is being applied\nin ﬁeld equipment for ground and obstacle\
    \ detection, the detection of plants and weeds\nduring data collection, and the\
    \ stable remote control of the equipment [25]. Although\nthe ﬁeld phenotyping\
    \ applications of AI are in relative infancy compared to laboratory\nphenotyping,\
    \ their growth is notable because they provide the phenotypic data of plants in\n\
    their natural environment.\nIn addition to image analysis, AI applications that\
    \ are widely used in other domains\nof science are now being integrated into the\
    \ phenomics data management pipeline. Cy-\nberinfrastructure (CI), a research\
    \ environment that provides linkages between researchers,\ndata storage, and computing\
    \ systems using high-performance networks has been applied\nwidely in the environmental\
    \ sciences [26–28]. CI is now being applied to phenomics in\norder to facilitate\
    \ collaboration among researchers [29]. Open-source devices and tools\nrepresent\
    \ another fast developing application of AI technologies [30]. In phenomics, these\n\
    tools are addressing the challenges of expensive phenotyping equipment and proprietary\n\
    or incompatible data formats. The growth of these applications of AI has expanded\
    \ the\nﬁeld of phenomics with industry companies investing in the manufacture\
    \ and distribution\nof phenotyping technologies alongside government-funded agricultural\
    \ institutions.\nThis review begins by considering the broader area of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence and its inte-\ngration and application in phenomics through machine\
    \ learning and deep learning. Digital,\nﬂuorescence, spectroscopic, thermography,\
    \ and tomography imaging, and the integration\nof artiﬁcial intelligence into\
    \ their individual data management are highlighted. Thereafter,\nadditional applications\
    \ of AI such as cyberinfrastructure and open-source devices and tools\nare discussed.\
    \ The current utilization of phenotyping technologies for ﬁeld phenotyping,\n\
    which is increasingly gaining ground over phenotyping in controlled environments,\
    \ is then\ndiscussed brieﬂy, highlighting their cross applicability with artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence.\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363\n3 of 19\n2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\n\

    \ 1970s, AI research has been focused on machine learning. Statistical ma-\nchine\
    \ learning frameworks and models such as Perceptron, support vector machines,\
    \ and\nBayesian networks have been designed. However, no single model works best\
    \ for all tasks.\nIt is still challenging to determine the best model for a given\
    \ problem [34]. According\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363\n4 of 19\nto Roscher et al.\
    \ 2020 [35], the rise and success of neural networks, coupled with the\nabundance\
    \ of data and high-level computational and data processing infrastructure, has\n\
    led to the comprehensive utilization of machine learning (ML) models and algorithms\n\
    despite the challenge of model determinations for a given task.\nThe utilization\
    \ of a range of imaging techniques for nondestructive phenotyping has\ninﬂuenced\
    \ the development of high-throughput phenotyping (HTP), whereby multiple\nimaging\
    \ sensors collect plant data in near-real-time platforms. These sensors have the\n\
    capacity to collect large volumes of data which has, in turn, made phenomics a\
    \ big data\nproblem well suited for the application of ML. The analysis and interpretation\
    \ of these large\ndatasets are quite challenging, but ML algorithms provide an\
    \ approach for faster, efﬁcient,\nand better data analytics than traditional processing\
    \ methods. Traditional processing\nmethods include probability theory, decision\
    \ theory, optimization, and statistics. ML\ntools leverage these processing methods\
    \ to extract patterns and features from these large\namounts of data in order\
    \ to enable feature identiﬁcation in particular complex tasks such\nas stress\
    \ phenotyping [36].\nAccording to Rahaman et al. 2019 [37], one of the advantages\
    \ of using ML approaches\nin plant phenotyping is their ability to search large\
    \ datasets and discover patterns by\nsimultaneously looking at a combination of\
    \ features (compared to analyzing each feature\nseparately). This was previously\
    \ a challenge because of the high dimensionality of plant\nimages and their large\
    \ quantity, making them difﬁcult to analyze through traditional\nprocessing methods\
    \ [36]. Machine learning methods have thus far been successfully\napplied in the\
    \ identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of plant diseases [38,39] and plant organ\n\
    segmentation, among other tasks as shown in Table 1 below. This has been achieved\
    \ by\nsupervised learning, where the algorithms can identify diseased plants after\
    \ being trained\nwith sample images from large datasets. However, this approach\
    \ prevents the search for\nnovel and unexpected phenotypic traits that would otherwise\
    \ be discovered by the less\naccurate unsupervised ML [40].\nTable 1. Examples\

    \ is a rapidly advancing subset of machine learning tools that has created\na\
    \ paradigm shift in image-based plant phenotyping. It is efﬁcient in the discovery\
    \ of\ncomplex structures in high-dimensional data and is thus applicable to a\
    \ range of scientiﬁc\nresearch tasks [24]. The plant images collected using the\
    \ various sensors have a wide\nvariability, making the use of some machine learning\
    \ techniques challenging [47]. While\ntraditional machine learning involves trial-and-error\
    \ steps in the feature extraction process\nof images, deep learning tools have\
    \ enabled the creation of more reliable workﬂows for\nfeature identiﬁcation. They\
    \ employ an automatic hierarchical feature extraction process\nusing a large bank\
    \ of non-linear ﬁlters before carrying out decision-making, such as\nclassiﬁcation.\
    \ Deep learning approaches have multiple hidden layers in the network, with\n\
    each layer performing a simple operation on the images in succession which increases\
    \ their\ndiscrimination and prediction ability [48]. A wide range of deep learning\
    \ architectures has\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363\n5 of 19\nbeen used in plant phenotyping\
    \ by a process called transfer learning. This involves the use\nof a network that\
    \ was pre-trained on a large dataset somewhat similar to the one under\ninvestigation\
    \ and retraining it with weights for the new dataset. Table 2 details some deep\n\
    learning architectures that have been applied using transfer learning for phenotyping.\n\

    \ still limited availability\nof publicly available annotated agricultural data,\
    \ which reduces the possibility of obtain-\ning high-performance feature extraction\
    \ models through transfer learning. In addition,\nmany agricultural image data\
    \ have high levels of occlusion (especially plant leaves and\nbackground noise),\
    \ leading to higher likelihoods of error from confusing objects of interest\n\
    with the background. This is partly due to the environmental variations (e.g.,\
    \ cloudy sky,\nwindy weather for ﬁeld data collection) that signiﬁcantly impact\
    \ the images and make\nthem harder to work with. Similarly, data samples are also\
    \ sensitive to imaging angles,\nﬁeld terrain and conditions, and variations within\
    \ plant genotypes. Hence, the robustness\nand adaptability requirements are signiﬁcantly\
    \ high for the deep learning models built for\nagricultural applications [55].\n\
    Thus far, deep learning architectures in phenotyping have been used in leaf count-\n\
    ing [56], the classiﬁcation of plant morphology [57], plant recognition and identiﬁcation\
    \ [55],\nroot and shoot feature identiﬁcation [48], and plant stress identiﬁcation\
    \ and classiﬁca-\ntion [58]. A few reported applications of machine learning or\
    \ deep learning for stress\nprediction and quantiﬁcation provide great opportunities\
    \ for new research efforts of plant\nscientists. A key challenge to overcome is\
    \ that the underlying processes for linking the\ninputs to the outputs are too\
    \ complex to model mathematically.\n3. Application of Artiﬁcial Intelligence in\
    \ Phenotyping Technologies\n3.1. Imaging Techniques\nTraditionally, the measurement\
    \ of observable plant traits has been conducted by\ndestructive sampling followed\
    \ by laboratory determinations to characterize phenotypes\nbased on their genetic\
    \ functions. Due to technological advancement in AI, imaging tech-\nniques (overview\
    \ in Table 3) have emerged as important tools for non-destructive sampling,\n\
    allowing image capture, data processing, and analysis to determine observable\
    \ plant traits.\nAccording to Houle et al. 2010 [5], “imaging is ideal for phenomic\
    \ studies because of the\navailability of many technologies that span molecular\
    \ to organismal spatial scales, the\nintensive nature of the characterization,\
    \ and the applicability of generic segmentation\ntechniques to data.” Spatial\
    \ or temporal data of many phenotype classes such as mor-\nphology and geometric\
    \ features, behavior, physiological state, and locations of proteins\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 4363\n6 of 19\nand metabolites can be captured in intensive detail\
    \ by imaging. For that reason, imaging\ntechniques have allowed for high-throughput\
    \ screening and real-time image analysis of\nphysiological changes in plant populations.\
    \ At the laboratory scale, the different imaging\nmethods are tested individually.\
    \ One, or a combination of the best-suited methods for crop\nsurveillance, are\
    \ then used both in controlled and ﬁeld environments [5,59].\nTable 3. Visualization\

    \ state that “computer\nvision aims to bring together factors derived from multiple\
    \ research areas such as image\nprocessing and statistical learning to simulate\
    \ human perception capability using the\npower of computational modeling of the\
    \ visual domain.” Computer vision uses machine\nlearning to recognize patterns\
    \ and extract information from the images. The computer\nvision workﬂow (shown\
    \ in Figure 2) carries out visual tasks ranging from pre-processing\n(e.g., conversion\
    \ of image formats, color space conversions etc.) to object detection applied\n\
    in ML algorithms, resulting in the comprehension of image understanding in a human-like\n\
    way [34]. Computer vision transforms the images so that they can be applied to\
    \ an AI\nsystem. This process has high computational demands, especially when\
    \ working with\nimages of varying formats from a range of sensors, as is the case\
    \ in phenotyping imaging\ntechniques [32]. A few of the different imaging techniques\

    \ also provides information on the size and color of\nplants, which enables the\
    \ quantiﬁcation of plant deterioration arising from, for example,\nnutrient deﬁciencies\
    \ or pathogen infections, etc. Using a combination of careful image\ncapture,\
    \ image analysis, and color classiﬁcation, it is possible to follow the progression\
    \ of\nlesions from infections and deﬁciencies over time quantitatively [8].\n\
    Advances in hardware and software for digital image processing have motivated\
    \ the\ndevelopment of machine vision systems providing for the expeditious analysis\
    \ of RGB\nimages. Being relatively the simplest and most widely used technique\
    \ has served as an\nadvantage, as many machine learning techniques and deep learning\
    \ architecture can be\napplied effectively to RGB images. These techniques have\
    \ been applied in the identiﬁcation\nof plant growth stage [41], classiﬁcation\
    \ of plant images [43–46], disease detection and\nclassiﬁcation [38,52,53,65],\
    \ identiﬁcation of biotic and abiotic stress [49,58], weed detec-\ntion [50,51],\
    \ detection of ﬂowering times [57], and leaf counting [54–56]. Although the\n\
    extraction of useful phenotyping features from 2D digital images has been successful,\
    \ the\nexpansion in computer vision has led to an exploration of the applications\
    \ of 3D imaging.\nThis has been achieved using stereo-vision, where two identical\
    \ RGB cameras are used\nto capture images in a setup similar to the operation\
    \ of the human eyes. These images\nare then used to reconstruct a 3D model of\
    \ the plant for analysis using stereo-matching\nalgorithms [60,77]. Approaches\
    \ using multiple images from more than two RGB cameras\nplaced at different viewing\
    \ angles have been successfully used for larger plants with a\nhigher degree of\
    \ occlusion thereby expanding the applications of digital imaging [78].\n3.1.2.\
    \ Spectroscopy\nSpectroscopic imaging is a widely used imaging technique that\
    \ has been used to\npredict many properties of large plant populations [5]. It\
    \ consists of multispectral and\nhyperspectral imaging. In multispectral imaging,\
    \ the images are captured in wavelengths\nbetween visible and near-infrared, consisting\
    \ of up to ﬁfteen spectral bands, whereas in\nhyperspectral imaging, hundreds\
    \ of continuous spectral wavebands are available. Pre-\nvious phenotyping studies\
    \ have shown that spectroscopy can be used to monitor plant\nphotosynthetic pigment\
    \ composition, assess water status, and detect abiotic or biotic plant\nstresses\
    \ [79]. During plant development, varying growth conditions induce changes in\n\
    surface and internal leaf structure, modifying the reﬂection of light from plant\
    \ leaves or\ncanopies. These changes can be visualized by spectroscopy, either\
    \ in the visible spectrum\nor near-infrared wavelengths undetectable by the human\
    \ eye (0.7–1.3 mm) [18]. The appli-\ncation of spectroscopy is therefore important\
    \ for the ﬁeld monitoring of plant traits arising\nfrom gene expression in response\
    \ to environmental factors [20].\nHyperspectral imaging has thus far been successfully\
    \ applied in both controlled envi-\nronments (i.e., greenhouses and growth chambers)\
    \ and ﬁeld environments [80]. However,\na major limitation to the utility of hyperspectral\
    \ data in ﬁeld phenotyping, besides the\ncost of the equipment, is the variability\
    \ in environmental conditions during measurements.\nSpectrometers are highly sensitive\
    \ and rely on solar radiation as a light source in the ﬁeld,\nand this leads to\
    \ difﬁculty in the analysis of images due to cloud cover, shadows caused\nby phenotyping\
    \ platforms, and changes in solar angle during the photo period [8,80].\nAnother\
    \ challenge in hyperspectral data analysis is data redundancy due to the continuous\n\
    nature of wavelengths and their similarity. This has been alleviated by the selection\
    \ of\neffective wavelengths using algorithms such as the successive projections\
    \ algorithm (SPA),\ngenetic algorithm (GA), the Monte-Carlo uninformative variable\
    \ elimination (MC-UVE),\nand boosted regression tree (BRT) which is also a ML\
    \ technique [81–83].\nAlthough these difﬁculties can potentially be remedied by\
    \ applying robust com-\nputer vision algorithms, hyperspectral images have only\
    \ been successfully applied to\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363\n8 of 19\nmachine learning\
    \ algorithms and not to faster and more advanced deep learning algo-\nrithms.\
    \ Nonetheless, hyperspectral imaging allows for a wide variety of stresses to\
    \ be\ndetected and continues to be a promising way to detect speciﬁc signatures\
    \ for a particular\nstressor [18].\n3.1.3. Thermography\nThermography, also known\
    \ as thermal imaging, is a technique that detects infra-\nred radiation from an\
    \ object and creates an image based on it. Thermographic cameras\ndetect infrared\
    \ radiation (9000−14,000 nanometers) in the electromagnetic spectrum and\ncreate\
    \ images based off of it [84]. Thermography has been used in plant research to\n\
    monitor transpiration and canopy temperature. Transpiration is linked with nutrient\n\
    uptake by the roots and, ultimately, with crop productivity. However, it also\
    \ reﬂects\nwater use efﬁciency. Canopy temperature has been widely used to infer\
    \ crop water use,\nphotosynthesis, and, in some cases, to predict yield. In breeding\
    \ programs aimed at\nselecting plants based on water use efﬁciency, thermography\
    \ improves the speed and\neffectiveness of monitoring transpiration [18]. It has\
    \ also been used in the ﬁeld as a\nremote sensing tool to capture canopy temperature\
    \ data for a large number of plots using\nmicrobolometer-based thermal imaging\
    \ mounted on ﬁeld phenotyping platforms above the\ncrop using helium balloons\
    \ or manned aircraft [8]. Despite the inability of thermography to\ndetect pre-symptomatic\
    \ changes in leaves, it can detect changes in leaf thickness [18]. This\nallows\
    \ for the visualization and monitoring of internal structural heterogeneity resulting\n\
    from stresses or infections.\nIn phenotyping, thermography is used in combination\
    \ with other imaging techniques\nfor effective diagnostics [85]. Photogrammetry\
    \ algorithms such as structure-from-motion\nhave been applied to thermographic\
    \ images [86] collected in ﬁeld environments without\nmuch success. Currently,\
    \ the data collected from the images is analyzed using standard\nequations and\
    \ ML statistical methods such as probability theory, decision theory and\nclassiﬁers\
    \ [87]. Thermography has a range of applications from medical diagnostics to\n\
    metal defect detection in industries where deep learning algorithms have been\
    \ applied to\nthermal images [88].\n3.1.4. Fluorescence\nFluorescence imaging,\
    \ also known as ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, is used as a measure-\nment technique\
    \ for photosynthetic function under stresses such as drought and infections\n\
    by detecting light emitted after the plant has been exposed to a speciﬁc wavelength\
    \ of light.\nThese stresses have adverse effects that lead to a decrease in photosynthesis\
    \ which, in turn,\nlimits crop yield. Chlorophyll ﬂuorescence imaging has enabled\
    \ the early visualization\nof viral and fungal infections due to its ability to\
    \ achieve high resolutions. It has also\nbeen used in studies to determine plant\
    \ leaf area [18]. For the rapid screening of plant\npopulations, portable ﬂuorometers\
    \ are being used to obtain average measurements of\nwhole plants or leaves at\
    \ the same developmental stage. There is potential for portable ﬂu-\norescence\
    \ imaging to be used for the ﬁeld-scale assessment of infections, even for those\
    \ that\nleave no visible trace [8,18,67]. Fluorescence imaging is usually used\
    \ in combination with\nhyperspectral imaging, and image data extracted using this\
    \ technique has been successfully\napplied to algorithms based on AI methods,\
    \ such as neural networks, for analysis [89].\n3.1.5. Tomography\nX-ray computed\
    \ tomography (X-ray CT) is a technology that uses computer-processed\nX-rays to\
    \ produce tomographic images of speciﬁc areas of scanned objects. It can generate\
    \ a\n3D image of the inside of an object from an extensive series of 2D radiographic\
    \ images taken\naround a single axis of rotation [76]. X-ray CT imaging technology\
    \ has been used for several\napplications in plant phenotyping. It has been applied\
    \ in the observation of root growth\nbecause of its ability to capture the intricacies\
    \ of the edaphic environment with high spatial\nresolutions [90,91]. X-ray CT\
    \ has also been used in the high-throughput measurement of\nSensors 2021, 21,\
    \ 4363\n9 of 19\nrice tillers to determine grain yield. It was applied as the\
    \ preferred imaging technique for\nthe rice tiller study because of the tendency\
    \ of rice tillers to overlap and, hence, not be easily\ndetectable by digital\
    \ imaging [92]. According to Li et al. 2014 [76], however, “tomographic\nimaging\
    \ remains low throughput, and its image segmentation and reconstruction need to\
    \ be\nfurther improved to enable high throughput plant phenotyping.” Although\
    \ this technology\nis effective in the early detection of plant stress symptoms,\
    \ its effectiveness is further\nimproved by combined use with other imaging techniques.\
    \ The simultaneous use of CT and\npositron emission tomography (PET) has the potential\
    \ to be used to provide insight into the\neffect of abiotic stress in particular\
    \ [71,76]. Additionally, to provide satisfactory resolutions,\nX-ray CT requires\
    \ small pot sizes and controlled environments, making it unsuitable for\nﬁeld\
    \ applications. For morphological root phenotyping tasks, X-ray CT has been applied\
    \ in\nthe identiﬁcation of root tips and root-soil segmentation tasks using machine\
    \ learning [93].\nDespite the minimal use of tomography in phenotyping, its application\
    \ in the medical ﬁeld\npositions it as a powerful technique that, coupled with\
    \ AI algorithms (and particularly\nCNNs), is beneﬁcial in diagnostics [94].\n\
    3.2. Cyberinfrastructure\nCyberinfrastructure (CI) is described by Atkins et al.\
    \ 2003 [95] as a “research environ-\nment that supports advanced data acquisition,\
    \ storage, management, integration, mining,\nvisualization and other computing\
    \ and processing services distributed over the internet\nbeyond the scope of a\
    \ single institution.” It consists of computing systems, data storage\nsystems,\
    \ advanced instruments and data repositories, visualization environments, and\
    \ peo-\nple (shown in Figure 3) linked together by software and high-performance\
    \ networks [27].\nThis enhances the efﬁciency of research and productivity in\
    \ the use of resources. Some CI\nsystems can provide for in-ﬁeld data analysis\
    \ to point out errors in data collection that can\nbe rectiﬁed and identify further\
    \ areas of interest for data collection.\nSensors 2021, 21, x FOR PEER REVIEW\

    \ to the various components required, CI systems are expensive, with\nthe cost\
    \ of a supercomputer alone being upwards of US$90 million. For this reason, some\n\

    \ a fee to researchers.\nFor example, the University of Illinois at Chicago provides\

    \ sharing through its GeoPlatform (https:\n//www.geo-platform.gov/, accessed on\
    \ 26 June 2021) [98]. In the geospatial domain, one\nexample is the Data Observation\
    \ Network for Earth (DataONE), which is a CI platform for\nintegrative biological\
    \ and environmental research. It is designed to provide an underlying\ninfrastructure\
    \ that facilitates data preservation and re-use for research with an initial focus\n\
    on remote-sensed data for the biological and environmental sciences [99]. Because\
    \ of the\ncomplexities in developing and setting up a CI, Wang et al. 2013 [100]\
    \ put forward the\nCyberaide Creative service, which uses virtual machine technologies\
    \ to create a common\nplatform separate from the hardware and software and then\
    \ deploys a cyberinfrastructure\nfor its users. This allows for end-users to specify\
    \ the necessary resource requirements and\nhave them immediately deployed without\
    \ needing to understand their conﬁguration and\nbasic infrastructures.\nIn plant\
    \ phenotyping, a case for the use of CI has been made similarly in that non-\n\
    invasive high throughput phenotyping technologies collect large amounts of plant\
    \ data.\nAnalysis methods for this data using AI are being developed but face\
    \ the challenge of\nintegrating datasets and the poor scalability of these tools\
    \ [29]. The large amounts of data\ngenerated by HTP platforms need to be efﬁciently\
    \ archived and retrieved for analysis.\nResearchers afﬁliated with the United\
    \ States National Science Foundation (NSF) have\ndeveloped a form of CI called\
    \ iPlant that incorporates artiﬁcial intelligence technologies to\nstore and process\
    \ plant data gathered from the various HTP platforms. This CI platform\nprovides\
    \ tools for data analysis and storage with high-performance computing to access\n\
    and analyze the data. It also has methods for the integration of tools and datasets\
    \ [29].\nIn order to support both genotyping and phenotyping, iPlant uses the\
    \ BISQUE (Bio-\nImage Semantic Query User Environment) [101] software system.\
    \ Its main functionality is\nimage analysis which it supports using its ﬁve core\
    \ services: image storage and manage-\nment, metadata management and query, analysis\
    \ execution, and client presentation. Its\ndesign is ﬂexible enough to support\
    \ the range of variability in image analysis workﬂows\nbetween research labs.\
    \ The plant-oriented version of BISQUE, PhytoBISQUE, provides\nan application\
    \ programming interface integrated with iPlant to develop and deploy new\nalgorithms,\
    \ facilitating collaboration among researchers [29].\n3.3. Open-Source Devices\
    \ and Tools\nOpen-source is a term generally used to refer to tools or software\
    \ that, as stated by\nAksulu & Wade, 2010 [30], “allows for the modiﬁcation of\
    \ source code, is freely distributed,\nis technologically neutral, and grants\
    \ free subsidiary licensing rights.” Characteristically,\nOpen-Source Systems\
    \ (OSS) are voluntary and collaborative in nature and their lifespan\nlasts as\
    \ long as there is an individual willing and able to maintain the system [102].\
    \ Few\ntraditional operation constraints such as scope, time, and cost factors\
    \ affect these systems,\nand they have the added advantage of enhancing the skills\
    \ of the people involved while\nproducing tangible cost-effective technology output\
    \ [30]. Some OSS development teams\ntake advantage of crowdsourcing which widens\
    \ the scope and quality of ideas and reduces\nproject cycle time [103].\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 4363\n11 of 19\nIn phenomics, new crop management strategies require\
    \ the co-analyses of both sensor\ndata on crop status and related environmental\
    \ and genetic metadata. Unfortunately, this\ndata is mostly restricted to larger\
    \ well-funded agricultural institutions since the instruments\nfor data collection\
    \ are expensive. The available phenotyping instruments output data that is\nchallenging\
    \ to interpret because of proprietary or incompatible formats. Many techniques\n\
    that are being applied are ready-made off-the-shelf software packages that do\
    \ not have\nspeciﬁc algorithms for this data interpretation. Phenotyping researchers,\
    \ therefore, have to\naddress the challenges of data interpretation and data sharing\
    \ alongside limited access to\ninstrumentation (especially that which is well\
    \ suited for ﬁeld phenotyping). Open-source\ntools and devices represent a promising\
    \ approach for addressing these challenges. Those be-\ning applied in phenomics\
    \ are more accessible and easy to use while providing a connection\nto a community\
    \ of users with broader support and continuous improvement [104,105]. One\nsuch\
    \ open-source device is the MultispeQ device (PhotosynQ, East Lansing, MI, USA),\
    \ an\ninexpensive device linked through the PhotosynQ platform (https://www.photosynq.com,\n\
    accessed on 1 June 2021) to communities of researchers, providing useful data\
    \ on plant\nperformance. The MultispeQ device is rugged and ﬁeld deployable, open-source,\
    \ and\nexpandable to incorporate new sensors and techniques. The PhotosynQ platform\
    \ connects\nthe MultispeQ instrument to the community of researchers, breeders,\
    \ and citizen scientists\nto foster ﬁeld-based and community-driven phenotyping\
    \ [105].\nAn open-source prediction approach called Dirichlet-aggregation regression\
    \ (DAR)\nwas put forward by Bauckhage and Kersting, 2013 [104], to address the\
    \ challenge of manual\ndata labeling and running supervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ on hyperspectral data.\nHyperspectral cameras record a spectrum of several hundred\
    \ wave-lengths ranging from\napproximately 300 nm to 2500 nm, which poses a signiﬁcant\
    \ challenge of data handling\nin hyperspectral image analysis. Therefore, working\
    \ with hyperspectral data requires\nalgorithms and architecture that can cope\
    \ with massive amounts of data. Their research\nshows that DAR can predict the\
    \ level of drought stress of plants effectively and before it\nbecomes visible\
    \ to the human eye.\nOpen-source software and platforms have also been developed\
    \ that simplify the com-\nputer vision image management pipeline. One such tool\
    \ is the PlantCV image analysis\nsoftware package. It is used to build workﬂows\
    \ that can be used to extract data from images\nand sensors, and it employs various\
    \ computational tools in python that are extendable,\ndepending on the required\
    \ image analysis task, in order to provide data scientists and\nbiologists with\
    \ a common interface [106]. It deploys additional open-source tools such as\n\
    LabelImg for image annotation [107]. PlantCV’s image processing library has been\
    \ applied\nin Deep Plant Phenomics which is an open-source software platform that\
    \ implements deep\nconvolutional neural networks for plant phenotyping [108].\
    \ Deep Plant Phenomics pro-\nvides an image processing pipeline that has been\
    \ used for complex non-linear phenotyping\ntasks such as leaf counting, mutant\
    \ classiﬁcation, and age regression in Arabidopsis.\nAnother group of open-source\
    \ tools that have been applied in phenomics are the\nMobileNet deep learning architectures.\
    \ MobileNet architectures are convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) with reduced\
    \ complexity and model size and are suited to devices with\nlow computational\
    \ power such as mobile phones. MobileNets optimize for latency resulting\nfrom\
    \ low computing power by providing small networks with substantial accuracy that\n\
    can be used in real-world applications [109]. One example is the MobileNetV2 which\
    \ is\nbuilt to be used for classiﬁcation, detection, and segmentation of images.\
    \ It uses ReLU6\nnon-linearity, which is suited to low-precision computation [110].\
    \ These are promising for\nuse on mobile phones which are widely accessible and\
    \ commonplace to be potentially used\nfor ﬁeld phenotyping. MobileNets employ\
    \ TensorFlow Lite, an open-source deep learning\nframework used to deploy machine\
    \ learning models on mobile devices [111].\nLighting problems in outdoor settings\
    \ have the potential to affect open-source tools\nand the performance of CNNs.\
    \ There is, therefore, a need to test and train the networks\non plant images\
    \ collected in the ﬁeld. A mobile-based CNN model was used for plant\ndisease\
    \ diagnosis, and the problem of inconsistent light conditions was solved in this\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 4363\n12 of 19\nstudy [112] by the use of an umbrella. This\
    \ model was employed ofﬂine and displayed\ndecreased performance because of differing\
    \ training datasets from the data collected in\nthe ﬁeld and, therefore, highlighted\
    \ the need to capture more images using mobile devices\nin typical ﬁeld settings\
    \ and to use those very images for the training of the models in\norder to improve\
    \ the accuracy. In deploying open-source platforms and CNNs, there is an\nadditional\
    \ challenge in developing tools that can analyze and determine a wide variety\n\
    of phenotypes from various crops, and it has not been possible to develop a one-size-\n\
    ﬁts-all platform for analysis. However, various platforms are thus far available\
    \ for some\nphenotyping tasks.\n4. Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Field Phenotyping\n\
    In order to screen plants for valuable traits (such as grain size, abiotic stress\
    \ toler-\nance, product quality, or yield potential), experiments with repeated\
    \ trials are required\nin different environments based on the objectives of the\
    \ study. Much of the discussion of\nphenotyping has focused on the measurement\
    \ of individual plants in controlled environ-\nments. However, controlled environments\
    \ do not provide an accurate representation of\nplant growth in open-air conditions\
    \ [7]. Field-based phenotyping (FBP) is now increasingly\nwidely recognized as\
    \ the only approach that gives accurate depictions of the traits in\nactual cropping\
    \ systems. Currently, sensor systems suitable for high-throughput ﬁeld\nphenotyping\
    \ can simultaneously measure multiple plots and fuse a multitude of traits in\n\
    different data formats [17]. Through the use of vehicles carrying multiple sets\
    \ of sensors,\nFBP platforms are transforming the characterization of plant populations\
    \ for genetic re-\nsearch and crop improvement. Accomplishing FBP in a timely\
    \ and cost-effective manner\nhas led to the use of unmanned aircraft, wheeled\
    \ vehicles, or agricultural robots to deploy\nmultiple sensors that can measure\
    \ plant traits in brief time intervals [7]. Therefore, pheno-\ntyping in many\
    \ crop breeding programs is now being conducted by combining instruments\nwith\
    \ novel technologies such as non-invasive imaging, robotics, and high-performance\n\
    computing on the FBP platforms [8].\nUnmanned aircraft are particularly attractive\
    \ for data acquisition because they enable\nsensing with a high spatial and spectral\
    \ resolution for a relatively low cost. Unmanned\nhelicopters (such as the one\
    \ shown in Figure 4) can carry various sensors and have the ac-\ncommodation to\
    \ carry larger sensors. In windy conditions, helicopters enable precise ﬂight\n\
    control and operations in cluttered environments because of their maneuverability\
    \ and\nability to ﬂy at low speeds. Replicated collection of sensor data can be\
    \ achieved through au-\ntomatic ﬂight control when the helicopter is equipped\
    \ with algorithms for ground detection,\nobstacle detection and avoidance, and\

    \ using these FBP systems faces the challenge of instability\nduring motion and\
    \ weather changes, which cause occlusion and mal-alignment in the\nimages. This\
    \ is partially addressed by using proximal sensing at slower speeds in order to\n\
    improve image resolution (although this limits the areal coverage in one ﬂight\
    \ and does\nnot fully solve the misalignment). Data processing for this data has\
    \ signiﬁcantly improved\nin recent years with AI-enabled snapshot and line scanning\
    \ imaging software, optimized\nspeciﬁcally for unmanned aircraft such as structure-from-motion\
    \ photogrammetry [87,116].\nOne approach that has been proposed to enhance the\
    \ application of these platforms for\nsensing in ﬁeld conditions is adapting ﬁeld\
    \ conditions to align with the HTP ﬁeld tech-\nniques (rather than the traditional\
    \ approach of adapting the instruments for the ﬁeld),\ndepending on the crop of\
    \ interest without compromising the realistic crop evaluation in\nﬁeld conditions\
    \ [6].\n5. Phenotyping Communities and Facilities\nThe growth in plant phenotyping\
    \ research coupled with the integration of AI tech-\nnology has fostered the development\
    \ of laboratories and centers equipped with high-\nthroughput phenotyping technologies.\
    \ Some of these plant phenotyping centers are\nmembers of the International Plant\
    \ Phenotyping Network (IPPN), which works with\nvarious member organizations in\
    \ academia and industry to distribute relevant information\nabout plant phenotyping\
    \ and increase its visibility [117]. Partner facilities such as the\nAustralian\
    \ Plant Phenomics Facility, a government-funded national facility, provide access\n\
    to infrastructure such as glass-house automation technologies, digital imaging\
    \ technologies,\nlong-term data storage, etc. [118]. Such facilities have and\
    \ continue to provide subsidized\naccess to advanced AI-phenotyping technologies\
    \ that would otherwise be inaccessible due\nto the costs of operation and maintenance.\
    \ In addition, as high-throughput phenotyping\nbecoming more common, there has\
    \ come the issue of data-merging with many laboratories\ngathering phenotypic\
    \ data that rarely enter the public domain where it could be accessed\nby other\
    \ institutions to foster interdisciplinary research [8]. Networks such as the\
    \ IPPN\ncontinue to provide access to phenotyping information generated by member\
    \ organiza-\ntions which is key in enabling cooperation between the organizations\
    \ and advancing the\nphenomics agenda through collaborative research.\nBesides\
    \ the academic institutions and government organizations, private industry\ncompanies\
    \ (a few of which have been highlighted here) are establishing themselves as\n\
    key providers and facilitators of plant phenotyping AI technology around the world.\
    \ Bio-\npute technology provides high-end research instruments such as multispectral\
    \ cameras\nfor ﬁeld phenotyping, drones for aerial photography, and provides after-sales\
    \ support\nservices to their customers. In partnership with universities and research\
    \ institutes, Bio-\npute provides innovations that are contributing to the progress\
    \ of plant phenotyping\nin China (http://www.bjbiopute.cn, accessed on 1 June\
    \ 2021). KeyGene is an agricul-\ntural biotechnology company providing tools for\
    \ precision breeding and digital pheno-\ntyping investing in deep learning-based\
    \ algorithms and virtual reality for data visual-\nization (https://www.keygene.com,\
    \ accessed on 1 June 2021). PhenoTrait Technology\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363\n14\
    \ of 19\nCo., Ltd. mainly focuses on plant phenotyping using the photosynthesis\
    \ characteris-\ntics of plants and promoting the use of phenotyping technologies\
    \ to improve crop qual-\nity, crop yield, and environmental conditions in China.\
    \ Some of their products include\nhigh-throughput phenotyping instruments, chlorophyll\
    \ ﬂuorescence imaging systems, etc.\n(http://www.phenotrait.com, accessed on 1\
    \ June 2021). Photon Systems Instruments (PSI)\nis a company in the Czech Republic\
    \ that also supplies a range of phenotyping systems,\nboth ﬁeld and laboratory-based,\
    \ including root system phenotyping. They have also in-\ncorporated machine learning\
    \ to integrate robotics into the systems they develop to better\nautomate the\
    \ processes (https://psi.cz, accessed 1 June 2021).\n6. Conclusions\nRecent advancements\
    \ in high-throughput phenotyping technologies have led to signif-\nicant strides\
    \ in plant phenomics. The on-going integration of artiﬁcial intelligence into\
    \ these\ntechnologies promises progression into smarter and much faster technologies\
    \ with signiﬁ-\ncantly lower input costs. In the area of phenotyping image data\
    \ analysis, the integration\nof AI into the data management pipeline of tomography\
    \ and thermography is on a lower\nscale in comparison to the other imaging techniques.\
    \ The application of deep learning in\nthe data analysis of these techniques is\
    \ promising, as it has been successfully implemented\nin analysis of composite\
    \ materials [88] and medical diagnostics [94]. As much as ﬁeld\nphenotyping is\
    \ the most effective way to collect phenotypic data, it is still being conducted\n\
    on a relatively lower scale than is possible. Artiﬁcial intelligence technologies\
    \ also require\nlarge amounts of data from various sources to improve their accuracy.\
    \ This provides an\nopportunity to invest more into the tailoring of current technologies\
    \ for ﬁeld data collection\nand the utilization of already existing AI adaptable\
    \ technologies, such as smartphones, to\nincrease the quantity of quality data.\
    \ Smartphones have become widespread consumer\nproducts, and the simplicity and\
    \ ease of use of their sensors suggest that their use can be\nexplored in agriculture\
    \ [104]. Some of the challenges that would need to be addressed are\nthat advanced\
    \ signal processing on smartphones has to cope with constraints such as low\n\
    battery life, restricted computational power, or limited bandwidth [104]. The\
    \ use of citizen\nscience alongside professional researchers [119] in data collection\
    \ also has the potential\nto aid in increasing the amount of data collected. The\
    \ overall goal of employing these\napproaches and technologies is to provide the\
    \ infrastructure that allows for tracking how\nplant traits progress throughout\
    \ the growing season and facilitate the coordination of data\nanalysis, management,\
    \ and utilization of results using AI methods.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Green Chemistry  Conversion of lignin pyrolysis oil to cyclohexyl methyl ethers
    as a promising biomass-derived solvent† Sohaib Haseeb,a   Jesse R. Vanderveen,
    a   Devni Elamaldeniya, a   Jesse Harris,ab   Kyle J. Boniface,a   Roland Lee,
    c   Pascale Champagne bd  and  Philip G. Jessop *a   Author affiliations  Abstract
    A mixture of cyclohexyl methyl ethers was prepared from Kraft lignin pyrolysis
    oil for use as a biomass-derived aliphatic solvent. Using Kamlet–Taft solvatochromic
    parameters, it was determined that the solvent mixture is somewhat more basic
    and polar than cyclopentyl methyl ether. Neither the biomass-derived solvent nor
    pure cyclohexyl methyl ether formed any detectable peroxides in 12 weeks of exposure
    to air, even though THF formed peroxides rapidly under such conditions. This mixture
    can be used as a biomass-derived aliphatic ether solvent and as a potential replacement
    for THF, dioxane, ethyl acetate, acetone and 2-butanone. Introduction Lignocellulose
    is the most abundant biomass available for use as a renewable feedstock for the
    synthesis of chemical products.1 All three components of lignocellulose: lignin,
    cellulose, and hemicellulose are being explored as alternatives to fossil fuels
    as feedstocks for preparation of a wide variety of materials such as fuels, polymers
    and value-added chemicals.1 These three components can be separated from each
    other by various methods.2,3–6 Lignin, the second-most abundant component in lignocellulose
    after cellulose,7,8 is the main byproduct of the conventional pulp and paper industry.7
    However, currently, the main use of lignin is as a low-grade energy source.8 Holladay
    et al. (2007) pointed out that overall revenue could be increased from $12 billion
    to $35 billion if lignin were used to produce value-added chemicals and transportation
    fuel, rather than power.8 However, lignin is a complex, cross-linked, and non-repeating
    polymer that can require extensive processing before it can be used for a particular
    application or treatment. Pyrolysis of lignin produces a complex liquid mixture,
    primarily of phenols, called lignin pyrolysis oil (LPO).9–11 There are two general
    strategies for making chemical products from this oil. First, one can separate
    LPO into individual compounds, at significant expense, and then sell those compounds
    as specialty chemicals. A historical example is the production of vanillin from
    lignin, which is no longer practiced. The second option is to use the LPO or fractions
    thereof as mixtures, without separating the individual compounds. This second
    strategy is less expensive, but the products can only be used in lower-value applications
    where mixtures, rather than pure compounds, are acceptable. The only product that
    is currently commercially produced from LPO, smoke flavouring, is an example of
    this second strategy. Different approaches have been proposed to extract phenols
    from LPO. Solvent extraction is a technique extensively used to separate phenolic
    compounds from pyrolysis oil, as a mixture.12 Steam distillation separates phenols
    at a lower temperature than their normal boiling points.13 However, the temperature
    of 105 °C was still found to be too high for thermally sensitive pyrolysis oil,
    and further separation was required because the concentration of phenols in the
    distillate was relatively low.13 Molecular distillation can be used to extract
    thermally unstable materials. However, the method requires expensive equipment
    and high vacuum, which makes it cost-prohibitive.14–16 Our group has reported
    a supercritical fluid rectification (SFR) method for separating single ring phenols
    from the heavier components of lignin pyrolysis oil (LPO).10,11 In the same study,
    isothermal supercritical CO2 extraction was also shown to be effective, although
    not quite as selective. The resulting mixtures of single ring phenols can be methylated
    to make polar aprotic solvents (aromatic ethers) as substitutes for petroleum-derived
    aromatic solvents like toluene, xylene, and anisole.11 There is also a need for
    bio-derived aliphatic ether solvents to replace petroleum-derived aliphatic ethers
    such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. Such solvents are not only unsustainable
    but are prone to forming dangerous peroxides over time.17,18 Here we report the
    conversion of LPO into a mixture of cyclohexyl methyl ethers that can serve as
    a biomass-derived aliphatic ether solvent. The composition, Kamlet–Taft properties,
    and risk of peroxide formation of the mixture are reported. This mixture may be
    used as a renewably-sourced alternative to fossil-derived low to medium polarity
    solvents, in applications or formulations where a pure single-compound solvent
    is not required. Such applications may include inks, adhesives, cleaning solvents,
    and paint stripper. Moreover, both the aromatic and aliphatic ether mixtures can
    be used as oxygenates for gasoline or diesel. Several ethers such as ethyl tert-butyl
    ether, tert-amyl ethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, and tert-amyl methyl ether
    have been shown to impart excellent fuel properties.19 Ethers are preferred due
    to their high octane numbers and cause less pollution, because they do not contain
    sulfur and produce lower levels of carbon monoxide when they burn.19 Results and
    discussion The conversion of LPO to aliphatic ethers was envisioned as a process
    involving three steps which could, theoretically, be performed in any sequence:
    (1) methylation of the phenolic components of LPO, (2) isolation of the single-ring
    compounds from the heavier components, and (3) hydrogenation of the aromatic rings
    (Scheme 1). This particular sequence was chosen for two reasons. First, the rectification
    method developed by the Jessop group11 and used in this study is selective for
    single ring aromatic ethers and guaiacols, but rejects catechols and multi-ring
    compounds. Because catechols are anticipated to be a constituent of the LPO that
    could be converted to cyclohexyl methyl ethers, it is desirable to methylate the
    catechols to veratroles prior to rectification in order to obtain greater yields
    of anisoles/veratroles from the rectification step. Second, it is beneficial to
    remove unwanted material earlier in the process to avoid consuming reagents unnecessarily
    and to decrease the likelihood of unwanted side reactions. For that reason, the
    rectification step was performed prior to the hydrogenation step. Scheme 1 The
    synthetic route for converting LPO into cyclohexyl methyl ethers. Methylation
    and supercritical fluid rectification of LPO The phenolic groups present in LPO
    were methylated using stoichiometric amounts of 1,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene
    (DBU) and an excess of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as both solvent and methylating
    agent. This methylation procedure was first tested on several individual compounds
    that are known10 to exist in LPO, including phenol, guaiacol, catechol, and eugenol;
    these model compounds were all successfully methylated with yields in excess of
    95% (Table S1†). The crude isolated product after methylation of the LPO retained
    97% of the mass of the LPO. The crude product was then purified by SFR. The SFR
    procedure involves extracting the lighter components from the LPO using supercritical
    CO2 (scCO2) and passing the scCO2 solution up a progressively hotter steel column
    packed with small steel rings.11 The rectification process produces a mixture
    of aromatic single ring ethers which we refer to as lignin oil methyl ethers (LOME).
    The composition of LOME was determined by GC-MS (Table S2†). The compounds were
    identified using standards and by comparing mass spectra with spectra in the NIST
    MS Library.20 4-Methyl veratrole, veratrole, 4-ethyl veratrole, 2,3-dimethylanisole
    and 4-ethylveratrole were the major components in the LOME mixture (Table S2†),
    which matches the observations of Mudraboyina et al.11 Hydrogenation of rectified
    ethers A procedure for the hydrogenation of LOME was developed using veratrole
    as a model reactant. Catalysts and conditions were screened to identify a procedure
    that would provide a high conversion of veratrole to 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane
    (Table 1). Table 1 Hydrogenation catalyst and conditions screened for the heterogeneously

    90 10 a 24 h reaction. b Veratrole (0.1 g) was dissolved in hexanes (3 ml). Solvent-free
    conditions were used for all the other trials. Initially, different catalysts
    were screened for the hydrogenation at 80 °C (entries 1–5). Using Rh(5%)/C (entry
    2) resulted in a nearly complete reaction of veratrole with 84% yield of the desired
    product 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane. Hydrogenations using other catalysts all had
    large quantities (25–75%) of unreacted veratrole remaining after the reaction
    time. Each catalyst, including Rh(5%)/C, also produced cyclohexyl methyl ether
    as a byproduct. Although this demethoxylation was an unanticipated side reaction,
    cyclohexyl methyl ether would be a welcome component in the aliphatic ether mixture
    we are trying to produce and is likely to also be produced from the methylation
    and hydrogenation of the phenol present in LPO. Further demethoxylation to cyclohexane
    was negligible. Based on the results, Rh(5%)/C was identified as the best catalyst
    of those tested. Hydrogenations of pure veratrole were carried out next using
    Rh(5%)/C under different conditions in an attempt to limit the formation of side
    products (entries 6–11). Reactions at lower temperatures or H2 pressures all had
    unreacted veratrole present, even after extended reaction times. Solvent-free
    conditions were used for the initial reactions. When hexanes was used as the solvent,27,28
    conversion of veratrole to 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane improved, even if the temperature
    was lowered to 50 °C, and apart from cyclohexyl methyl ether, negligible amounts
    of side products or unreacted veratrole were present (entry 11). The combined
    yield of the 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane and cyclohexyl methyl ether was >99%. Therefore,
    the conditions described in entry 11 were selected as the conditions to be used
    for LOME hydrogenation. Prior to LOME hydrogenation, a desulfurization step is
    required to prevent catalyst poisoning. Sulfur is present as an impurity in Kraft
    lignin. Even after rectification, approx. 1 wt% sulfur was present in the LOME
    according to elemental analysis. Attempts at hydrogenation without prior desulfurization
    were not successful. The sulfur was removed using a RANEY® nickel slurry in alkaline
    water following the procedure described by Field et al.21 No sulfur was detected
    by elemental analysis after the RANEY® nickel wash. LOME prepared from raw lignocellulose
    or from lignin separated without use of sulfur-containing reagents would presumably
    not require this desulfurization step. Hydrogenation of LOME was performed using
    the best conditions identified for veratrole (entry 11) in Table 1 and the major
    compounds were identified by comparing mass spectra with spectra in the NIST MS
    Library.20 Methoxycyclohexane, 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane and 1,3-dimethoxycyclohexane
    were identified. The hydrogenated lignin oil methyl ethers (HLOME) were analyzed
    by 1H (Fig. S1†), 13C (Fig. S2†), DEPT 135 (Fig. S3†) NMR and IR (Fig. S4†) spectroscopy.
    It is difficult to determine whether the methylation was complete using NMR spectroscopy.
    However, the IR spectrum of HLOME has a broad peak around 3500 cm−1, which has
    a weaker absorbance intensity than cyclohexanol. This suggests the presence of
    some unreacted hydroxyl groups. The 1H NMR spectrum shows that all peaks corresponding
    to aromatic protons have disappeared (the 13C {1H} NMR spectrum confirms this).
    In the 1H NMR spectrum the peaks at 3.1–4.3 ppm correspond to methoxy and methoxymethine
    protons and the peaks at 0.8–2.1 ppm corresponds to aliphatic protons. Kamlet–Taft
    properties of lignin-derived ethers Kamlet–Taft solvatochromic parameters are
    the most comprehensive measure of solvent properties.22,23 Mathematical combinations
    of these parameters can be used to predict the solvent effect on a variety of
    parameters such as solubility, rate constants, equilibrium constants and spectral
    frequencies.23 Compounds with similar Kamlet–Taft parameters are likely to perform
    similarly as solvents. Therefore, these parameters can be used to determine which
    non-renewably sourced solvents could potentially be replaced by HLOME. Polarity/polarizability
    (π*) and hydrogen bond accepting ability (β) were calculated from the UV/visible
    absorption maxima of 4-nitroanisole and 4-nitroaniline dissolved in the solvent.22
    Taft and coworkers assigned an α (hydrogen bond donating ability) value of 0.00
    for ethers,23 therefore, we assumed that the hydrogen bond donating ability of
    HLOME is negligible. However, the presence of a small amount of unreacted hydroxyl
    groups could give the HLOME some hydrogen bond donating ability. π* is the ability
    of the solvent to stabilize a charge or dipole moment and is therefore high for
    polar or polarizable solvents. HLOME has a π* value of 0.57, lower than anisole
    (0.73), because the aromaticity of anisole increases its polarizability. The π*
    of HLOME is slightly higher than that of cyclopentyl methyl ether (0.42). The
    hydrogen bond accepting ability (β) of HLOME is 0.75. It is unsurprisingly larger
    than anisole (0.22) and somewhat larger than cyclopentyl methyl ether (0.53).
    Aromatic ethers like anisole are known to be much weaker bases than their aliphatic
    counterparts. However, the difference between the β value of the ether mixture
    and cyclopentyl methyl ether was unexpected and may be due to the presence of
    1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane and other more complex structures. Such components in
    the mixture may also explain the higher π*. Peroxide formation in lignin-derived
    ethers A serious safety concern regarding the use of aliphatic ethereal solvents
    is their potential to form explosive organic peroxides over time. For this reason,
    ethers are often discarded after 3 or 12 months even if they have been spiked
    with inhibitors to slow down peroxide formation.6 Nevertheless, explosions due
    to peroxide formation in ethers still occur. Ethers that have low tendencies to
    form peroxides, such as tert-butyl methyl ether24 and cyclopentyl methyl ether,18
    have safety advantages over other ethers and their use is preferred even though
    they are fossil-fuel derived. The rate of peroxidation of methoxycyclohexane,
    a major component of the HLOME, was compared to that of tetrahydrofuran and cyclopentyl
    methyl ether under air to determine whether methoxycyclohexane and, by extension,
    HLOME, are dangerously prone to peroxidation. The ethers were purified, placed
    in 3 amber vials per solvent under air, and stored in a solvent cabinet for a
    period of 12 weeks to allow peroxides to form. A sample of HLOME mixture was also
    placed in an amber vial and stored under the same conditions. All samples were
    opened and exposed to fresh air once per week. After the 12-week period, the solvents
    were quantitatively tested for peroxide content by iodometry. The results (Table
    2) show that tetrahydrofuran forms peroxides much more quickly than cyclopentyl
    methyl ether. This result is in agreement with the report by Watanabe et al.18
    Additionally, no peroxides were detected in either HLOME or cyclohexyl methyl
    ether by iodometry. Therefore, cyclohexyl methyl ether and HLOME have a very low
    tendency to form peroxides, evidently lower than cyclopentyl methyl ether. Table

    solvents are used in large quantities in industrial processes and products such
    as coatings, paint stripper, cleaning solutions, adhesives, and inks. In many
    such applications there is no requirement that the solvent be a single pure compound.
    The volume of solvent usage in such applications greatly exceeds the volume of
    solvents used as media for chemical synthesis. Replacing petroleum-derived organic
    solvents with bio-derived solvents could make solvent usage more environmentally
    sustainable, but only if the bio-derived solvents do not introduce new health
    and environmental concerns. To this end, we compared the health and environmental
    effects of HLOME to THF, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF), cyclopentyl methyl
    ether and methoxycyclohexane in Table 3. Health and environmental effects can
    be compared using experimental or computationally-predicted values such as LD50
    or using GHS (globally harmonized system) classifications. The latter approach
    will be used here. Table 3 Health and environmental impacts of THF, cyclopentyl

    d HLOME is a complex mixture with some batch-to-batch variability in composition
    and therefore liquid range. However, the boiling point of HLOME is assumed to
    be greater than or equal to that of its most volatile component, methoxycyclohexane.
    Similarly, the melting point is estimated as that of methyoxycyclohexane. e Solubility

    the EPA test program for the major components of HLOME. Conventional aliphatic
    ether solvents have significant disadvantages. For example, THF has a low flashpoint,
    strong tendency to form peroxides, high miscibility in water resulting in difficult
    solvent recovery, high energy requirement for manufacture18,25 and is fossil-derived.
    MeTHF is a biomass-derived alternative to THF. However, it also has drawbacks
    such as low flash point, rapid peroxide formation, and difficult recovery from
    water.18 Cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME)18,26–28 is a greener and much safer alternative
    to THF. It has preferable characteristics such as a narrow explosion range, wide
    liquidity range, low rate of formation of peroxides, higher flash point and low
    solubility in water, but it is manufactured from fossil fuels. Ethereal solvents
    that, like CPME, do not form peroxides at a significant rate are particularly
    needed in applications where they may be exposed to oxidants.26,27 Because we
    do not have information about the health hazards of HLOME, we had to make some
    assumptions. First, we assumed that HLOME is no more flammable than its most volatile
    component, cyclohexyl methyl ether. However, flammability is the only hazard class
    measured for cyclohexyl methyl ether. As for the acute toxicity of HLOME, we list
    the GHS code that corresponds to the lowest of the predicted LD50 (rat, oral)
    values predicted by the EPA TEST program for the major components of the mixture.
    We therefore predict that HLOME should have acute toxicity and flammability comparable
    to other aliphatic ethers. HLOME is bioderived and has a very low peroxide formation
    rate. Currently, HLOME mixture has a high energy requirement for manufacture,
    in part because it was prepared on a gram scale. A fully developed, optimized,
    and scaled manufacturing process would likely have lower energy requirements.
    Conclusions A mixture of cyclohexyl methyl ethers (“HLOME”) was prepared from
    lignin pyrolysis oil via methylation, supercritical rectification, and catalytic
    hydrogenation. The final mixture was composed primarily of methoxycyclohexane,
    1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane and 1,3-dimethoxycyclohexane. The cyclohexyl methyl ether
    mixture can be used as a solvent or oxygenate fuel additive. The Kamlet–Taft solvent
    properties of the mixture indicate that it is a suitable alternative to THF, dioxane,
    ethyl acetate, acetone and 2-butanone. Furthermore, the solvent does not form
    peroxides rapidly compared to cyclopentyl methyl ether and especially THF. For
    these reasons, HLOME can be considered a bioderived and safer alternative to petroleum
    derived ethereal solvents or as a fuel oxygenate. Now that the proof of concept
    has been achieved, future work will include the development of a more efficient
    conversion of lignin to HLOME, including the use of sulfur-free lignin so that
    the RANEY® nickel step becomes unnecessary, and a search for reaction conditions
    and methods to decrease the amount of reagents required to generate HLOME. Additionally,
    LOME and HLOME will be evaluated for various practical applications in which they
    could replace more harmful or less sustainable liquids. Experimental methods Softwood

    and finally ramped at 20 °C min−1 to 320 °C, with a dwell time of 3 min. NMR spectra
    were acquired using a Bruker 400.30 MHz spectrometer. UV/visible spectra were
    acquired using an Agilent 8453 UV-Visible spectrophotometer. IR spectra were acquired
    using a Bruker Alpha spectrometer. Methylation of LPO The methylation reactions
    were performed by a modification of the method reported by Mudraboyina et al.11
    LPO (25.54 g), dimethyl carbonate (125 ml), and DBU (31.25 ml) were combined in
    a 500 mL round bottom flask equipped with a stir bar and a reflux condenser. The
    mixture was refluxed in an oil bath heated to 120 °C and stirred at 450 rpm overnight
    (approx. 20 h). Afterwards, the mixture was cooled to room temperature (22–25
    °C). The dimethyl carbonate was removed under reduced pressure. The remaining
    mixture was dissolved in 750 mL ethyl acetate and the resulting solution was washed
    with 3 × 150 mL 1 M aqueous HCl and then 3 × 150 mL brine. The organic phase was
    dried with Na2SO4 and decanted to remove the solids. Finally, the ethyl acetate
    was removed under reduced pressure to afford the methylated LPO with 97% retention
    of mass. Supercritical fluid rectification of methylated LPO The SFR of methylated
    LPO was performed by a modification of the procedure reported earlier.11 The methylated
    LPO sample (24.7 g) was placed into the 160 ml stainless steel reactor vessel
    which was then heated to 40 °C. The CO2 was chilled prior to entering the pump
    by a cooling jacket filled with 1 : 1 v : v ethylene glycol/water mixture maintained
    at a temperature of −11 °C. Liquid CO2 at a pressure of 8 MPa was passed through
    the liquid in the vessel at a flow rate of 8 ml min−1 and up through a rectification
    column packed with Dixon rings. The column had a temperature gradient of 37–95
    °C from bottom to top. The temperature gradient was established by heating the
    column in six different temperature zones with heating tape (37 °C, 43 °C, 56
    °C, 69 °C, 82 °C and 95 °C). A back-pressure regulator, connected to the top of
    the column was set to maintain a pressure of 8 MPa and was heated to 55 °C. A
    250 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 75 mL acetone was placed under the outlet to
    collect the rectified material after the CO2 had vapourized. After 5 h, the contents
    of the Erlenmeyer flask were transferred to a 250 mL round bottom flask and the
    acetone was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford the rectified, methylated
    LPO. The extract weighed 3.12 g (12.6% yield relative to the mass of methylated
    LPO). The composition of the mixture was analyzed by GC-MS. Hydrogenation of rectified
    ethers The sulfur present in LPO was removed using a RANEY® nickel slurry in alkaline
    water following the procedure described by Field et al.21 The RANEY® nickel (15.1
    g) was added to a 500 ml flask containing rectified ethers (3.12 g) and 210 ml
    of 7 : 3 acetone : H2O solution. The mixture was refluxed in an oil bath for 7
    h. Afterwards, the mixture was cooled to room temperature. The Ni was removed
    by gravity filtration and acetone was removed under vacuum. Rectified ethers were
    extracted with 125 ml of hexanes, dried with Na2SO4, and filtered to remove solids.
    Then the hexanes were evaporated under reduced pressure to afford a mixture of
    rectified desulfurized ether (1.82 g, 7.4%). The rectified and desulfurized ethers
    (1.82 g) were then dissolved in 54 mL hexanes and placed in a 100 ml glass insert
    with 0.182 g of 5% Rh/C and a stir bar. The vial was placed in a stainless-steel
    vessel, which was flushed 5 times with H2 to remove oxygen, then heated to 50
    °C and pressurized to 60 bar with H2. The mixture was stirred at 500 rpm for 24
    h. Then, the vessel was cooled to room temperature and depressurized. The contents
    of the vial were passed through a Celite filter to remove the Rh/C and then the
    hexanes were evaporated using a rotary evaporator to afford hydrogenated ether
    mixture HLOME (1.37 g, 5.5%). Kamlet–Taft measurements The π* of HLOME was calculated
    from the average wavelength of maximum absorbance of solutions of 4-nitroanisole
    in HLOME at three different concentrations giving absorbances between 0.5 and
    2.5. The π* was then calculated from that average wavelength using eqn (1).22
    π* = 14.57 − 4270/λmax, OMe (1) Similarly, the β of HLOME was calculated from
    the average wavelength of maximum absorbance of solutions of 4-nitroaniline in
    HLOME at four different concentrations having absorbances between 0.3 and 1.6.
    The β value was then calculated from that average wavelength using eqn (2).22
    β = 11.134 − 3580/λmax,NH2 − 1.125π* (2) Peroxidation measurements Tetrahydrofuran
    was dried and stripped of inhibitor by refluxing over sodium benzophenone followed
    by distillation. Cyclopentyl methyl ether was purified by distillation. Cyclohexyl
    methyl ether was prepared from anisole using the hydrogenation procedure described
    above and purified by distillation. A portion of ethereal solvent was placed in
    a 20 ml dram amber vial under air. The vial was stored in a solvent cabinet with
    the lid firmly screwed on. All samples were opened and exposed to fresh air once
    a week. On the 12th week, the peroxide content was quantitatively determined by
    iodometry following the procedure described in Fábos et al.35 The peroxide content
    of HLOME was measured once and the average peroxide content in three samples were
    taken for other solvents. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest

    Part of the book series: Springer Water ((SPWA)) Abstract Water information and
    data bases are used for addressing environmental, physical, social, political,
    economic, and ecological issues of water supply, consumption, availability, and
    accessibility. Different disciplines of water resources management, such as flood
    risk assessment, water supply management, reservoir operation, and water sanitation
    require incorporation of different types of water information for efficient planning
    and decision making. Therefore, this chapter aims to investigate the main features
    of water information, data sources, water data challenges, water data processing,
    analysis and dissemination which also play a key role in integrated and sustainable
    water resources management. This chapter begins with an introduction to the importance
    of data and information in various water disciplines as well as indication of
    data life cycle. Thereafter, different types of water data and sources (measurements,
    models, remote sensing, and administrative institutes) are proposed. Additionally,
    the challenges and limitation of water data, such as poor data quality, lack of
    integrated water portals, limited funds, and big data problems are discussed.
    This section is followed by indication of water data processing key points and
    steps of water data dissemination. Additionally, the World Hydrological Cyclone
    Observing System (WHYCOS), Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC), and Bureau of Meteorology
    (BOM) are introduced as examples of important water data systems which improve
    development in delivery and use of water data, and evaluation of environmental
    impacts and risks. Finally, the chapter revealed recommendations to improve water
    data information and portals for the purpose of efficient water resources planning
    and management. Keywords Water data Measurements Data processing Data dissemination

    Download chapter PDF 3.1 Introduction Limited access to safe water, sanitation,
    and increased demand threatens human health, environmental sustainability, and
    economic growth, while leading to poor water security and supply. The increasing
    pressure on water resources is the result of global drivers such as rapid population
    growth, industrialisation, inefficient water management, water pollution, climate
    change, serious imbalance between supply and demand, but also poor water data
    (World Bank 2018). Therefore, water security, reliable water supply, as well as
    environment and ecosystem protection are directly dependant on the level of efficiency,
    integration, and sustainability of water resources management. Data and information
    are denoted as the “life blood” of a research with the purpose of efficient water
    management and decision making. Hence, data is the foundation for well-informed
    decisions and sustainability that is required by all decision makers. Water data,
    or in other words measurements, is a key element in water resources management
    projects and planning. Water information is generated from water data through
    a process of analysis, integration, and interpretation. In other words, water
    information is the processed and synthesized form of water data. The generated
    water information should be combined with infrastructure and institution in order
    to reach an efficient water resources planning and management for both the current
    and uncertain future periods (Cantor et al. 2018). Different water management
    disciplines, such as the flood response, drought management, water supply systems,
    reservoir operations, water sanitation, groundwater management, and irrigation
    supply require incorporation of different types of water information for better
    decision making and water planning. Thus, decision makers and water organizations
    need to access water information with proper spatial and temporal resolution (Cantor
    et al. 2018). Additionally, provision of sound data with proper quality is essential
    as it can affect the decisions and management strategies. However, there have
    been debates among organizations and water sector participants that some provided
    data do not meet the need of water users. Additionally, some water information
    is not shared openly. Despite the development of technology and modern measuring
    devices, there are still many gaps in available water data, and the quality of
    some water information is also still unacceptable (BOM 2017). Therefore, unmet
    data needs can interfere the efficient and sustainable water management. Figure
    3.1 indicates the data life cycle (NSF DataONE project 2017) and the required
    steps from the data need evaluation to the data application. The main nine steps
    of the data life cycle are as follow: Fig. 3.1 Data life cycle (Adopted from NSF
    DataONE Project 2017) Full size image Data need evaluation and planning: needs
    of decision makers are fully evaluated; Data collection: observations are performed;
    Data quality assurance: checks and inspections are required to analyse the data
    quality; Data description and documentation: data should be accurately described
    using the metadata standards and guidelines; Data preservation and archival: data
    should be preserved in a specific archive (e.g., data service and data centre);
    Data discovery: both useful and relevant data information should be obtained;
    Data integration: data from different sources should be combined; Data analysis:
    data should be interpreted; and Data release planning: data should be described,
    managed, and made accessible. Globally, water data and information is essential
    for sustainable planning, policy, management, and prediction. Additionally, water
    data provides decision makers with proper information about water demand, weather
    patterns, hydrologic modelling, infrastructure needs, climate change, and extreme
    events. This book chapter examines the important role of water data and information
    in integrated water resources management. It also provides an in-depth understanding
    of different water data types, sources, challenges, processing, and dissemination,
    which are essential for sustainable planning, policy, management, prediction,
    and decision making. Thereafter, examples of two international information systems
    (WHYCOS and GRDC) and a national water portal (BOM) are proposed to indicate how
    water data organisation can enhance climate trend analysis, water information
    products and services, and sustainable protection of water resources systems through
    regional and international cooperation. Finally, conclusions summarizes focal
    points of this work, and recommendations are proposed to help stakeholders discover
    and overcome limitations of current water data. 3.2 Water Data Type Water data
    is a set of information that can address issues associated with physical, environmental,
    social, economic, ecological, biological, chemical, cultural, and political parameters
    in disciplines such as water use, availability, and accessibility. Additionally,
    water data can consist of a complex mix of different formats, including spreadsheets,
    satellite images, geospatial databases, and photographs (Laituri and Sternlieb
    2014). Generally, water data can be classified in two main categories: (1) Primary
    data and (2) secondary data. Primary data indicates the collection of raw data,
    including the data collected through measurements by technician and/or automated
    sensors. Measurements of water quality parameters, streamflow and precipitation
    are examples of primary data. Secondary data are obtained from models, specific
    methods, and lab experiments under controlled condition. Typically, models and
    methods apply primary data from different sources to compile and analyse them
    for estimating a variable. For instance, precipitation pattern, streamflow condition,
    irrigated area, and crop data can be combined through a model or method to estimate
    the agriculture water demand (Ziman 2016). Climatological models, hydrological
    models, processed remote sensing data or satellite images are some examples of
    secondary data (Laituri and Sternlieb 2014). In addition to these classes of water
    data, 12 extensive groups of water data can be developed based on disciplines
    or sectors where water data is applied (BOM 2017). Detailed classifications of
    water data with respective examples are shown in Table 3.1. Table 3.1 Water data
    types together with data sources and examples Full size table All the stated data
    are essential for efficient decision making in different water disciplines, including
    the sectorial water management, integrated water sector planning, climate change
    adaptation, global and regional reporting, as well as operational and emergency
    management. Additionally, the type of required data for a specific project relies
    on the type of activity and plans. For instance, a flood inundation project will
    not require the same data as a peak flood prediction project. Additionally, the
    temporal and spatial resolution of the required water data should be specified
    for each project. For instance, the hourly river flow is generally applicable
    to peak flow prediction, and estimation of flash flood peak flows requires even
    higher temporal river flow resolution (e.g., minutes), while the daily river streamflow
    is required for analysis of river flow due to changes in land use pattern. Thus,
    the researchers and managers are required to consider the required data type and
    resolution from the beginning of a project. 3.2.1 Water Data Source Different
    distinct types of water data are required to determine water quality and quantity
    to achieve efficient integrated water resources management. Water data is obtained
    through different sources and methods. Basically, the water data comes from four
    sources: (1) measurements; (2) models; (3) remote sensing; and (4) administrative
    institutes (BOM 2017). Each of the stated sources will be discussed in the next
    four sections. 3.2.1.1 In Situ Measurements Water resources management constitutes
    a data-driven discipline, which involves consistent measurements of water quantity
    and quality. The measurements are mainly concerned with monitoring meteorological
    and hydrological variables (BOM 2017). In order to measure water variables, including
    physical, chemical, and biological parameters, specific methods and instruments
    are applied. For example, water level can be measured using different techniques
    such as a float and shaft encoder, a radar or an ultrasonic level sensor (NIWA
    2019), turbidity by determining the intensity of light scattered by suspended
    particles in the water column (EHMP 2006–07), and biological contamination using
    E. coli concentration as a marker (Edberg et al. 2000). In addition to the variables
    which come from direct measurement, some other variables are calculated according
    to a mathematical transformation of a direct measurement. For instance, river
    discharge is computed by multiplying the water area in a channel cross section
    by the water average velocity in that cross section (BOM 2017). In situ measurements
    can yield the most reliable water data, provided that the measuring devices are
    precise and properly calibrated. The restriction of direct measurements is the
    high cost of purchasing, installing, calibrating, fixing, and maintaining the
    measuring devices and equipment. Additionally, regular monitoring should be conducted
    periodically to obtain the proper data length and spatial coverage, and therefore,
    constant financial support and effort are required to manage the long and intensive
    monitoring programs (BOM 2017). Due to the discussed high costs, many poor countries
    suffer from improper and inadequate water data, which can directly affect the
    water management planning and strategies. This issue necessitates the provision
    of financial support by international agencies and organizations to improve the
    water monitoring networks in poor countries dealing with critical water supply
    and management problems. 3.2.1.2 Remote Sensing In 1957, the Sputnik 1 was the
    first artificial earth satellite that placed into orbit. This satellite had significant
    impact on humanity’s perception of space, and announcing a new era if earth observation.
    After launching the Sputnik 1, several systems (e.g., Television and InfraRed
    Observation Satellite (TIROS 1), Nimbus 1 etc.) were launched in the following
    year to weather and climate conditions. Such satellite missions led to dramatic
    advances in remote observations and measurements (McCabe et al. 2017). Remote
    sensing refers to the process of inferring surface parameters, which are derived
    from measurements of the emitted/reflected electromagnetic radiations, from the
    land surface (Schmugge et al. 2002). The application of remote sensing in hydrological
    sciences has provided new datasets with high temporal and spatial resolution for
    continuous water resources observations, which addresses the low resolution and
    expensive in situ measurements. Figure 3.2 indicates the earth observing system
    applied in hydrological sciences. The stated system consists of several components,
    signals of opportunity (e.g., cars, mobile phones), Doppler radar, mobile rovers,
    smart phone and citizens science (e.g., simple image capturing, plug-in and Bluetooth
    technologies), cell signals (e.g., antennas), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (e.g.,
    drones), research balloons, airborne vehicles, CubeStas, high definition (HD)
    videos, satellite missions (e.g., Landsat 1–8), sensors aboard the International
    Space Station (ISS), and geosynchronous meteorological satellites (McCabe et al.
    2017). Fig. 3.2 Earth observing system (Adopted from McCabe et al. 2017) Full
    size image There are two types of remote sensing instruments: i) active and ii)
    passive. These instruments are mounted on satellites, drones, vehicles, aircrafts,
    and ground-based structures to measure different water data parameters, such as
    soil moisture, evaporation, water temperature, rainfall rate, sediment concentration,
    flood inundation area, rainfall distribution, surface topography, wind speed and
    direction, cloud composition, and air humidity (BOM 2017). Active sensors provide
    their own source of energy for emitting radiation towards the investigated target,
    and then measure the time of arrival radiation reflected from the target. The
    majority of active sensors are able to perform in the microwave portion of the
    electromagnetic spectrum. Hence, these sensors can potentially penetrate the atmosphere
    under rough conditions. Laser altimeter, radar, Lidar, Ranging instrument, Scatterometer,
    and Sounder are examples of active sensors (NASA 2019). On the other hand, passive
    sensors detect natural energy (light wavelength) which is emitted or reflected
    from the observed scene. The common source of radiation measured by passive sensors
    is the reflected sunlight. Passive sensors include various types of spectrometers
    and radiometers. These sensors are able to perform in the infrared, visible, thermal
    infrared, and microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Accelerometer,
    Hyperspectral Radiometer, Imaging Radiometer, Sounder, Spectrometer, and Spectroradiometer
    are some examples of passives sensors (NASA 2019). Remotely sensed data provides
    continuous spatial coverage and are typically presented in gridded form. The most
    temporally regular remotely sensed data set is obtained from satellites (BOM 2017).
    Since its advent in the 1960s, satellite remote sensing has been widely used as
    a complete source of information. Satellite sensors can measure almost all components
    of hydrological cycle, such as precipitation, evaporation, surface water, soil
    moisture, lake and river levels, surface and sub-surface water storage, and snow
    storage (Sheffield et al. 2018). However, satellites have relatively coarser spatial
    resolution than in situ measurements due to their large distance from the earth
    in relation to the resolution of the sensor and the attenuation effect of the
    atmosphere between the sensor and the observation point. Low earth orbiting satellites
    present much higher spatial resolution with lower temporal resolution (BOM 2017).
    The only issue that should be carefully considered in remote sensing is the requirement
    of significant information technology infrastructure for data management. Additionally,
    complex image processing tasks are needed to provide the data with suitable format
    (BOM 2017). In summary, remote sensing tools play an important role in improving
    water resources management through provision of large spatial and high temporal
    resolution. 3.2.1.3 Models In order to tackle the shortcomings and costs associated
    with in situ measurements and also to address the poor spatial support of in situ
    point measurements, different types of models and methods can be applied to generate
    water data. Modelling approaches are useful tools to address poor spatial support
    of in situ point measurements. For instance, required spatially distributed water
    surface elevations for flood magnitude, extent and timing estimations are derived
    from hydrodynamic models. Therefore, models and methods are applied for different
    purposes. For example, different rainfall-runoff models have been developed for
    generating the runoff data in ungauged catchments. Conceptual rainfall-runoff
    model applications such as Nedbor-Afstromings Model (NAM) (Makungo et al. 2010;
    Faiz et al. 2018; Zhen-lei et al. 2019), Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning
    (HBV) (Engeland and Hisdal 2009; Osuch et al. 2019), and The Hydrologic Engineering
    Center Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) (Gumindoga et al. 2017) are examples
    of model applications, which converts the rainfall to runoff in a defined catchment.
    In the field of water resources engineering, data-driven approaches have gained
    popularity for different water modelling purposes (Kim et al. 2013; Jahandideh-Tehrani
    et al. 2019; 2020a). Artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM),
    and random forest (RF) are few examples of data-driven approaches, which have
    been extensively applied in the area if water related modellings such as ground
    water level prediction (Daliakopoulos et al. 2005; Tsanis et al. 2008; Baudron
    et al. 2013), rainfall-runoff modelling (Daliakopoulos and Tsanis 2016; Berezowski
    and Chybicki 2018; Jahandideh-Tehrani et al. 2020b), reservoir operation (Niu
    et al. 2019; Ahmad and Hossain 2019), flood prediction (Zhou et al. 2019; Ahmadalipour
    and Moradkhani 2019). Some models are also used to extrapolate to past (e.g.,
    paleoclimate) and future conditions, such as climate models. Future precipitation,
    evaporation, wind, and temperature can be generated using different climate models,
    such as Hadley Center Coupled Model (HADCM3), Norwegian Erath System Model (NorESM),
    and The Fifth Version Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC5)
    (Randall et al. 2007). In order to summarize a large amount of information, specific
    approaches such as system dynamics (SD) are applied to analyse and interpret information.
    Using flow diagrams and feedback loops facilitate the analysis and conclusion
    for complex information (Ahmad and Simonovic 2004; Jahandideh Tehrani et al. 2014;
    Christias et al. 2020). In summary, models and methods are used for tasks, such
    as making predictions, data assimilation, and interpreting the large amount of
    complex information. The main limitation of applying models is the uncertainty
    resulting from models due to prior assumptions and scale issues. In water resources
    engineering field, analytical techniques (e.g., Mellin transform technique, and
    Fourier transform technique) and approximation techniques (e.g., first-order variance
    estimation (FOVE), probabilistic point estimation (PE) methods, and Monte-Carlo
    simulation) are the two main uncertainty analysis categories that can be applied
    to address hydrologic, hydraulic, structural, and economic uncertainties (Tung
    2011). Many researchers have discussed model uncertainty analysis and proposed
    methods to reduce the amount of uncertainty. For instance, Wagener and Wheater
    (2006) investigated the sources of uncertainty in a rainfall-runoff model by focusing
    on 10 catchments. They identified that the uncertainty is related to local modelling
    (process of selection and calibration of the local model structure) and regionalization
    procedures. To increase the accuracy of model results, many studies have focused
    on analysing uncertainty and reducing the vulnerability. Her et al. (2019) evaluated
    the associated uncertainties with multi GCMs in runoff and precipitation projections.
    In terms of adaptation planning for uncertain climate change impacts, evaluating
    the robust adaptation decisions to climate change uncertainties was studied by
    Dessai and Hulme (2007). They concluded that water resources are sensitive to
    regional climate response uncertainties in climate change impacts. Also, Fletcher
    et al. (2019) developed a new planning framework to evaluate climate uncertainty
    over time for flexible planning strategies. In summary, despite the wide applications
    of models in improving water data, research is still required to improve the accuracy
    of the model results. 3.2.1.4 Administrative Institutes Two types of data, including
    the water rights data and administrative data (mentioned in Table 3.1) are not
    obtained from measurements or models. Data such as water rights, water pricing,
    water infrastructure inventories, water demand in different economic activities,
    water ownership, and basin borders are basically recorded by water management
    agencies as part of their business purposes. Additionally, such data can be collected
    by conducting household and business surveys (BOM 2017). Water rights data and
    administrative data play a critical role in developing, proposing, and evaluating
    the water management strategies and policies as well as decision making. For instance,
    water system governance, which refers to the structure and administrative process,
    should direct and control operations, decision making, legislation, and finance
    as part of their tasks. Therefore, administrative data is required in order to
    determine operational standards and water regulations. A large number of agencies
    and organizations are involved in the establishment and administration of water
    rights in scale of regional, national and international scopes. In Europe, the
    Water Framework Directive (WFD) is the main foundation of European Union (EU)
    water policy that aims to ensure sustainable water use and protect aquatic systems
    through applying legislations to all surface waters (rivers, lakes, transitional
    and coastal waters) as well as groundwater (Carvalho et al. 2019). In Australia,
    the Department of Natural Resources and Mines is involved in water system administration
    in all states (Productivity Commission 2003). While different countries/regions/continents
    have their own administrative institutes to dictate water related policies (e.g.,
    water pricing, water ownerships, river borders, etc.), there are also international
    foundations, which deal with global water issues. For example, World Water Council
    is an international multi-stakeholder organization that enhance political action
    and awareness to deal with critical water issues through developing partnerships
    between countries (World Water Council 2020). Pacific Institute, Clean Water Action,
    and Water.org are other examples of global organizations that aim to solve water
    conflicts, promote legislation for water protection, and deal with water crisis.
    3.3 Key Characteristics of Water Data Type Different types of water data have
    their own characteristics and use. In other words, each type of water data should
    be applied for a specific purpose of water resources management, such as flood
    management, water quality management, sediment control, and water security management.
    The key characteristics of water data together with examples are listed below
    (BOM 2017): Parameter type (e.g., river flow data for reservoir operation; water
    demand data for irrigation management) Measurement location (e.g., water quality
    data for upstream of water offtakes for drinking water supply; groundwater level
    data for heavily utilized aquifers) Spatial coverage (e.g., flood level data for
    flood prone areas; national scale water assessment) Spatial density (e.g., rainfall
    distribution for rainfall pattern assessment) Temporal frequency (e.g., daily
    or monthly river data for regional water security assessment; high frequency river
    and rainfall data for flood forecasting) Longevity of measurements (multi-decadal
    data of continuous rainfall for rainfall IDF analysis; historical river flow data
    for flood frequency and magnitude analysis) Latency (e.g., basin time concentration
    for rainfall-runoff modelling; real-time rainfall and river level data for flood
    forecasting) Precision (e.g., water quality data should be precise in order to
    confirm safe drinking water supply; water pricing should be assessed carefully
    to prevent probable issues between stakeholders). 3.4 Challenges of Water Data
    In most countries, the nation’s water data arrangements cannot satisfy the need
    of water sector participants, and the processes of data collection are limited.
    There is an increasing need for systematic data collection in order to improve
    monitoring and ensure informed decision making (IWRM 2019). Over the next three
    sections, basic challenges of accessing proper and accurate water data will be
    discussed. 3.4.1 Poor Quality of Water Data There are many gaps in the available
    water dataset, and the quality of some water data is poor. Generally, the available
    water datasets are heterogeneous, dispersed, and poor in quality (BOM 2017). Dispersion
    and gaps in water data are mainly the result of poorly calibrated measuring devices
    as well as inefficient equipment maintenance. Apparently, water management will
    be challenging without good water data. Therefore, policy makers and managers
    are unable to make sound decisions as the provided water data are unreliable and
    contradictory (BOM 2017). Additionally, many poor countries, which are facing
    financial problems, are not equipped with modern and efficient measuring devices
    and techniques, which leads to poor measurements, and subsequently poor quality
    datasets (INBO 2018). Lack of homogeneity in water data causes poor data management
    as the data is useless, and massive investments on water infrastructure and data
    collection is wasted. Heterogeneous data mainly occurs when private organizations
    follow their own specific guidelines and procedures for data collection, and there
    is no general adopted rules for all data collector organizations (BOM 2017). 3.4.2
    Lack of Integrated Water Portal Systems One of the main water data challenges
    in many countries is the lack of information about the available water data, and
    also not openly shared datasets. Basically, there is no single established organization/tool/website
    to provide potential users with information about the different available water
    types, and characteristics of the water date sets. Detailed metadata, i.e. information
    on “how the data is produced”, “how the data can be accessed”, “how the data should
    be used”, “who to contact”, and “what the licence of the data is” are not provided
    by institutions in many countries. Thus, researchers and water data users require
    considerable time, effort, and investment to identify stated information. Therefore,
    data users and researchers need to spend time on basic data gathering and transformation
    rather than scientific analysis. This problem is noticeable when data is collected
    by multiple agencies for a specific task purpose. For instance, the required meteorological
    data models and formats for hydrological purposes (e.g., groundwater and catchment
    modelling) are different from the meteorological data formats for atmospheric
    science analysis. As a result of this data difference, a hydrologist should spend
    significant amount of time on learning the file format and visualization tool
    used by atmospheric science community. To address this problem, data should be
    communicated between scientific sub-disciplines systems through standard protocol/web
    services (Goodall et al. 2008). In this context, organizations such as European
    Flood Awareness System (EFAS), Global Flood Awareness System (GLOFAS), European
    drought observatory (EDO), Watershed Index Online (WSIO), United States Geological
    Survey (USGS) Water Data, BOM climate data online, European Space Agency (ESA),
    Copernicus Space Component (CSC) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) have made efforts to provide users with documented, homogeneous, and well-organized
    data set, which can be accessed through web services, and indicate datasets in
    the form of maps, tables, and graphs. 3.4.3 Limited Access to Data According to
    the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) principle, the public should
    participate in decision making processes. In order to pave this way, water institutions
    and organization should make the water data and information available and accessible
    to the public. However, much water data is not accessible by the public, or the
    water data type is not understandable by people with no expert knowledge. Thus,
    to ensure the participations of the public, water data should be disseminated
    in an informative and comprehensible way (INBO 2018). In addition to the public,
    openly shared and freely access to most water data is limited for water data users,
    particularly researchers. Regarding the fact that in many countries, funds for
    data collections come from private sectors, institutions are mainly reluctant
    to share the data freely. Additionally, many national organizations have no tends
    to share the collected data with the neighbouring countries or other international
    organizations. This situation is observed particularly when the countries are
    facing critical water scarcity, and the countries under such conflicts deny publishing
    information due to security risks (INBO 2018). Additionally, poor countries, which
    are facing financial problems, are unable to build efficient water information
    systems, manage water data, and develop efficient web portals and tools for data
    sharing. As a result, international organizations and agencies play an important
    role in providing financial support as well as remote monitoring to deal with
    the water problem in poor countries (INBO 2018). 3.4.4 Big Data Problems Regarding
    the increased amount of water data, several challenges can appear for big water
    data management. Big water data is associated with increased data volume, variety,
    and velocity. The amount of measured and processed data is growing rapidly. Additionally,
    the growing formats of data can make data management challenging. Considering
    the increased automation in data measurement process, the biases, abnormalities,
    and noise are also increasing in raw water data. As a result, a suitable and massive
    validation process is required to treat raw water data. Citizen science data is
    another aspect of big data complexity. Citizen science refers to the participation
    of the general public in the process of research design and data collection, which
    leads to the collection of large volumes of data (Buytaert et al. 2014). In the
    field of climate modelling, the spatial and temporal dimensions of data are intensive
    as such data indicates complex process of atmosphere and ocean circulation. Therefore,
    such climate data requires high storage space and large computer processing power
    (Cuntz et al. 2007). High volume data with long time periods can lead to high
    potential of data loss or intrusion. Generally, with high increase in the amount
    of data, many challenges are coupled with the process of big water data management.
    3.5 Data Processing Data processing refers to the manipulation of data obtained
    from in situ measurements or remote sensing, before they can be efficiently stored
    or made available (Hughes 1998). Raw data should be processed and transformed
    into formats to be identified and applied by researchers, data users, and decision
    makers (INBO 2018). Regarding the cost, effort, and high volume involved in data
    collection, proper data processing tools and approaches should be adopted (Hughes
    1998). Many tools are available for data processing, including spreadsheets and
    databases, database management tools, geographic information systems (GIS), Extract-Transform-Load
    (ETL) tools, modelling tools, and statistical data analysis tools. However, the
    selected tools and approaches should meet the requirements of the data users and
    researchers: What data format is required? What is the purpose of using the data?
    What kind of research will be conducted? And which organization will use the data?
    (INBO 2018). 3.5.1 Water Data Processing and Analysis The main purpose of data
    processing is to convert raw data into information, which meets the need of researchers
    and decision makers. Key points of water data processing are (Hughes 1998): Data
    encoding and digitizing; Quality control, consistency checking, and error checking;
    Data storage resolution; Data calibration and stability; Data storage and retrieval
    system. The stated key points will be discussed below: Data encoding and digitizing:
    Converting the measurements to digital is the first step of data processing. Hand-written
    field sheets or automatically penned charts mounted on a rotating drum are simple
    forms of data collection, which is still applied in many areas, particularly for
    collecting rainfall, evaporation, and other meteorological variables. Next, this
    data should be transferred to a computer database. Lost or damaged data is the
    main drawback of this manual data recoding. Therefore, modern telemetry, remote
    sensing, and other modern instruments have been developed to record the data automatically,
    particularly collecting the “real time” data (Hughes 1998). The vast quantities
    of recorded data (in situ measurements and remote sensing data) should be transformed
    into the cloud services in order to be stored and classified and then be accessible
    through portals and web services (McCabe et al. 2017). Data quality control: Data
    collection corresponds with issues such as missing data, recorded data over the
    incorrect time, accumulated data, instrument failure, etc. Additionally, most
    databases are not able to identify poor and incorrect data and inform data users
    of data inconsistency (Hughes 1998). Missing data processing, logical error detection,
    repeated data processing, abnormal data detection, and inconsistent data processing
    are main aspects of hydrological data quality control. Prediction methods (e.g.,
    recurrence neural network (RNN), and support vector machine (SVM)), optimization
    methods (e.g., particle swarm optimization (PSO)), and statistical methods (e.g.,
    adaptive boosting, and statistical control) are some examples of data driven approaches
    for data quality control (Zhao et al. 2018). Data storage resolution: Time resolution
    is of great importance in water data, particularly, the data used in hydrological
    analysis. For example, required time step for analysing the rainfall intensity
    in temperate climate is different from the arid and semiarid climates. Normally,
    the rainfall data with a resolution of one hour should be proper in temperate
    climate, while short-term variation of intensity is more important in arid and
    semiarid areas, and hence, minute should be the proper time step in arid areas
    (Hughes 1998). Therefore, disaggregation methods, such as Hyetos based on Bartlett-Lewis
    process and Marcov chain model should be applied in order to break down the data
    into shorter time steps (Koutsoyiannis 2003), which is considered as an important
    task of data processing. Data value accuracy: Accuracy of observations is a numeric
    value that quantifies the data measurements accuracy based on the closeness to
    the standard value. The stated value accuracy measures the associated uncertainty
    with data measurements, which is the result of errors in bias and precision. The
    value accuracy can be estimated using the knowledge of instrument accuracy and
    measurement method as well as statistical analysis of the records from repeated
    measurements (Horsburgh et al. 2008). Additionally, some instrument calibration
    process (either manual calibration or using table and equations) is required to
    ensure accurate measurements. For instance, the stage-discharge relationship is
    commonly used to convert water level measurements of a flume to flow rate or discharge.
    In the case of a flooding event in a river, calibration process is necessary as
    riverbank erosion and massive sediment transport occur over flood events (Hughes
    1998). Data storage and retrieval system: As describe in Sect. 4.4, big data requires
    massive amounts of data to be stored. Metadata catalogues and data storage systems
    help data users to identify the available datasets and check their characteristics
    (Hughes 1998). Within this context, recorded observations should be stored with
    sufficient supporting information (e.g., the location, date and time and type
    of variable that was observed) about the observations to enable data interpretation
    and cross-dimension data retrieval and analysis (Horsburgh et al. 2008). The databases
    should provide users with helpful information on the type measurements, data length,
    instrument details, the latitude and longitude of measurements, data quality,
    missing data, time zone, etc. Additionally, an efficient database is able to allow
    user to access and download the data in different formats, such shape files, text
    file, and excel files. It is also necessary to design a frequent backup system
    for the databases in order to prevent data lost in a case of system failure (Hughes
    1998). In the scope of data storage and retrieval, Internet of Things (IoT) technology,
    which has been developed rapidly in recent years, is considered as a key approach
    in big data processing. Within this context, cloud computing is a new generation
    of computing architecture that supports big data applications and growing data
    processing (Fan et al. 2018). As an example of such applications, the cloud-computing
    services have been applied to watershed management by enabling watershed partnerships
    for focusing primarily on decision-making activities (Sun 2013). Bürger et al.
    (2012) also developed an intuitive Web interface to create an integrated hydrologic
    simulation platform that enables users to access scientific software through a
    web browser. 3.5.2 Water Data Visualization After the data process step and data
    preparation, the next step is to present the data in an understandable and efficient
    way. Regarding the recent improvements of digital culture and information technologies,
    large datasets become complex to understand. Therefore, visual presentation of
    data has been developed, which presents data in the form of a graph, map, video,
    animation, hierarchy, etc. Data visualization can also improve understanding of
    existing trends, patterns and correlation in the datasets that might not detected
    in text and number-based data. As a result, stakeholders and decision makers can
    easily identify the important issues of water resources management to focus on
    as well as adapting new policies. In the scope of data visualization, the quality
    of data presentation is important as a poor or incorrect type of data visualization
    may cause misleading and hinder smart decision making. The visualization tool
    should be selected based on specific criteria, including i) how data viewers interact
    with data, ii) the information that should be obtained by the viewers, iii) the
    function of the data, and iv) the data composition. The three main types of water
    data presentation are as below (INBO 2018): Maps: They indicate the geographical
    distribution of different parameters, such as evaporation, rainfall, temperature.
    Maps can be produced using GIS software. Key figures: They are generated from
    data processing and document analysis. Key figures are understandable by public.
    Factsheet: They show a regular summary of data analysis, information, and graphs
    on different topics such as global warming, climate change, and drought trend.
    3.5.3 Water Data Dissemination After collecting, verifying, processing, and storing
    the water data, the next important task is to release and disseminate the data
    according to the target group (e.g., the general public, researchers, and decision
    makers) (e.g., before and after a flooding event). Data dissemination consists
    of four main steps (SEQwater 2014): (1) Data value identification: The first step
    is to evaluate the data value and information asset to decide on the price of
    the water data. The data value is conducted by surveying business system, water
    companies, and stakeholders about their needs and interests. Some data can be
    accessible free of charge considering the expenses of data preparation process
    and company’s needs and interests. (2) Data assessment: Over the second step,
    the data suitability for release should be assessed based on relevant guidelines,
    policies, and legislations. Additionally, depending on the target group (e.g.,
    scientific, non-expert purposes), data visualizations, data use instructions,
    and data use policies should be defined. (3) Data publication: Over the third
    step, data should be published based on priority factors such as public interest,
    stakeholder feedback, company and institutes need, and economic values. Additionally,
    given the type of requirements of different target groups (e.g., the general public,
    researchers, and decision makers) and required time of hydrological events (e.g.,
    before and after a flood event, before and after a dam construction), data dissemination
    should be specified. (4) Data management: Over the last step, data quality should
    be improved with regard to data user’s feedback. In order to release the water
    data, different strategies and digital tool are available. Below is the list of
    different water data dissemination plans (INBO 2018): Web portals and websites:
    data resulted from monitoring programs is delivered through portals and website.
    Basically, portals provide organized data, and water data is classified based
    on different criteria such as collected data from open stations, water data type
    (e.g., water level, streamflow, and rainfall), collected data from closed station,
    river type, time periods, water data unit (e.g., mega litre and cubic meters),
    and measured interval (e.g., hourly, daily, and monthly). Factsheets: guidelines,
    water issues (e.g., global warming and climate change), water data change trend
    analysis (e.g., temperature trend, major flood event trend and evaporation change
    trend), monitoring programs (e.g., coastal erosion monitoring), management programs
    (e.g., integrated sub-basin management plans) can be published through digital
    books. Social media networks: In addition to portals, websites, and digital books,
    social media networks also play an important role in water data dissemination.
    Social media networks increase people’s awareness of available water data and
    establish contact with internet and data users. Additionally, social media are
    effective way of transferring news and water data updates to users. Smart apps:
    smart and free apps are favourable, particularly among the public. Smart applications
    can potentially target different water users and improve interaction. For instance,
    “Ma Cons’eau” is a useful free application, which can estimate the people’s water
    consumption through providing a set of simple questions. The amount of water consumption
    is calculated based on the water price of resident locations. 3.6 Practical Examples
    Many organizations, systems and programs have been developed to provide high quality
    data and services of weather, climate, hydrological, and environmental fields
    for the purpose of integrated water resources management. Therefore, multiple
    water data, information, and knowledge should be shared to build cross-functionality
    between stakeholders. One example of the water data system is the World Hydrological
    Cycle Observing System (WHYCOS), launched by the World Meteorological Organization
    (WMO) in 1993 to improve sustainable development in delivery and use of hydrological
    data as well as promoting regional and international cooperation. WHYCOS aims
    to enhance the sustainable protection, use and management of water resources systems
    as well as support decision makers through reliable and data provision. In terms
    of regional water resources management, HYCOS promotes data and information products,
    such as flood forecasts and warning data. At global scale, the WHYCOS International
    Advisory Group (WIAG) was introduced to provide support for policy guidelines
    and future development of the projects (WMO 2019). Another example of global water
    data organization is the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC), which was established
    three decades ago. GRDC is an international archive of streamflow data, which
    aims to enhance analysis of global climate trends and evaluate environmental impacts
    and risks. The Global Runoff Data Base (GRDB) at GRDC was built on an initial
    dataset collected in the early 1980s. GRDB is a unique tool for obtaining river
    streamflow data at daily and monthly time step from over 9,500 gauging stations
    in 161 countries. In terms of national scale, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)
    in Australia has developed the Australian Water Resources Information System (AWRIS).
    As shown in Fig. 3.3, the purpose of AWRIS is to receive and manage water data
    and information as well as supporting and disseminating different water information
    products and services. Fig. 3.3 The role of AWRIS in water information in Australia
    (Adopted from AWRIS Information Sheets 2019) Full size image AWRIS is able to
    store and manage information about groundwater levels, river flow, the quality
    of water in rivers and aquifers, water trades, water use and restrictions, and
    water volume in storages in a central database. Next, the stored data is checked
    for quality and standards to ensure that the stored data is consistent with the
    current available data. Over the next step, the Australian Hydrological Geospatial
    Fabric cast the stored water information in a spatial context through encoding
    the spatial connections between Australia’s hydrological features (e.g., rivers,
    lakes, aquifers, dams, channels etc.). As indicated in Fig. 3.3, the final step
    includes analysing, interpreting, and integrating the water data. AWRIS delivers
    variety of water data, reports, and forecasts, such as real-time water reports,
    regular national water resources assessments, improved flood warning systems,
    and seasonal streamflow forecasts. The main advantage of AWRIS is that water users
    are able (i) to identify water resources condition in Australia through integrated
    viewpoint, (ii) to prepare benchmark reports using quality and transparent data,
    (iii) to check the details of standards, (iv) to control the quality of applied
    water data, and (v) to easily use the data for planning, analysis, reporting,
    and modelling (AWRIS information sheets 2019). 3.7 Summary Limited water resources
    and increased demand for the resources leads to growing challenges facing water
    resources systems. This growing pressure on water resources is the result of many
    issues, such as rapid population growth, poor water data, inefficient water resources
    management, and climate change. Therefore, the need to enhance water security,
    sustainable water management, reliable water supply, and environment protection
    necessitate the integrated water resources planning and management. The chapter
    underlines that water data and information are considered as the key components
    of water-based research, which provide decision makers with proper information
    in different water disciplines. Water data can be classified into two main categories,
    primary data and secondary data, where primary data is the collection of raw data,
    and secondary data obtained from models, lab experiments, and specific methods.
    Additionally, water data types can be grouped based on disciplines/sectors that
    water data is used. For instance, hydrometric data, meteorological data, and groundwater
    data are applied in hydrology services, meteorological services, and geological
    and mining institutes, respectively. Different distinct water data is obtained
    from four main sources: (1) measurements; (2) models; (3) remote sensing; and
    (4) administrative institutes. The chapter also discuss the limitation of water
    data, including poor quality, lack of integrated water portal systems, limited
    funds for data provision, and big data problems. In order to efficiently store
    and apply data, water data should be processed and analysed through key steps:
    (1) data encoding and digitizing; (2) quality control, consistency checking, and
    error checking; (3) data storage resolution analysis; (4) data calibration and
    stability; and (5) data storage and retrieval systems. After the data processing
    steps, water data should be visualized and presented in an understandable way
    to find our existing climate trend, pattern and correlation for the purpose of
    adapting new policies and management strategies in the realm of water resources.
    Thereafter, water data should be released and disseminated through web portals
    and websites, E-books, media and social networks, and smart apps to be used by
    decision makers, researchers, and policy makers for efficient water management
    planning. In general, the outcomes of the present chapter will benefit different
    water disciplines sectors through provision of discussion on the role, current
    condition, and importance of water data and information in water resources management.
    3.8 Recommendations Regarding the important role of data provision in integrated
    water resources management, it is recommended: (1) To provide public easy access
    to water data with the purpose to serve many different contexts: In order to improve
    decision making strategies, enhance national and international research studies,
    and ensure efficient water resources management, different water data sources
    and types should be highly accessible. Additionally, free provision of some data
    sources can potentially increase people’s awareness about the responsibility and
    importance of different water sectors. As a results of this increased awareness,
    public tends to have interactions and collaborations with experts, which leads
    to efficient water supply and management. (2) To improve collaboration and engagement
    between water data system or portal developers and users: Identification of the
    intended purpose of data provision is a fundamental need for achieving efficient
    data use. Therefore, before providing the data, sound understanding of the need
    of stakeholders and data users is essential to ensure the relevant data collection.
    (3) To develop a single global data system: Despite the availability of many different
    sources, portals and websites for data users, some researchers have challenge
    to identify the most accurate and efficient source of data for their studies.
    In order to address this issue, multiple sources of water data at different spatial
    and temporal resolutions should be consolidated in a single global data system.
    (4) To provide data in different formats and resolutions to target different decisions
    making strategies: Based on the type of decision-making strategy, research project,
    and water management strategy, different temporal and spatial resolutions of data
    should be provided. Hence, an efficient water data system should provide resolution
    flexibility in data as well as ensuring the quality and integrity of data. (5)
    To propose and build a novel water data system for water data format conversion:
    Many researchers and water data users should convert the format of the collected
    water data into the required input data format of different water software packages.
    The process of data format conversion is time and money consuming. Therefore,
    the generation and provision of different water data formats help users to save
    time in running water software and models. (6) To develop efficient water data
    systems, which are able to generate and update information from water data automatically:
    Water data systems should be improved in order to automatically generate some
    illustrations (maps, figures, and tables) from the input data. Additionally, the
    new collected data should automatically update the water data system by providing
    updated illustrations and information. (7) To develop more accurate data gap filling
    methods: Some data, such as future meteorological data under climate change, should
    be estimated. There are also gaps in some data due to different reasons, such
    as defective measuring device. In order to inform decision making and researchers
    with proper data, the stated limitations and gaps should be addressed. (8) To
    integrate different data sources to ensure quality data: Various organizations
    provide water data based on different standards of data measurements, processing,
    and collection. Water organizations and sectors should integrate water data system
    by satisfying specific level of standards in terms of data quality, processing,
    measurements, and documentations. These recommendations will help water data providers,
    modellers, and researchers to detect the limitations of current water data and
    to identify room for improvements. References Ahmad SK, Hossain F (2019) A generic

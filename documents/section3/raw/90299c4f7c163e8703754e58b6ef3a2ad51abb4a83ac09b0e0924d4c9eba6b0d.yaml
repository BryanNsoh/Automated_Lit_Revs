    4 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract The dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) crop
    is sensitive to irrigation management. Irrigation efficiency, water quality, and
    yield production are concerns in southwestern Colorado. This field study was conducted
    in 1992 and 1994 at the Southwestern Colorado Research Center to study the effects
    of five irrigation rates on dry bean seed yield and dry matter. The soil on the
    site is Wetherill silty clay loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic, aridic
    haplustalf). A surface drip irrigation system was used to achieve the irrigation
    rates of 0.00, 0.33, 0.67, 1.00, and 1.33 of the estimated evapotranspiration
    (ET). The experiment was set up using a randomized complete block design with
    four replications. Optimum conditions during the 1992 season led to higher dry
    matter and seed yields than in 1994. Irrigation rates had a significant effect
    on total aboveground dry matter (TDM) and seed yield in both years. There was
    no significant increase in seed yield and TDM beyond 0.67ET and 1.00ET, respectively,
    in 1992. However, maximum seed yield was obtained at a 0.67ET irrigation rate
    in the cooler year (1992), while 1.00ET or greater was required to achieve maximum
    biomass yield in both years. Total DM and seed yield continued to increase up
    to 1.33ET in 1994, reaching a similar level as in 1992. Irrigation use efficiency
    declined as the irrigation rate increased in both years. The pattern of biomass
    accumulation was similar in 1992 and 1994, as more growth occurred with the greater
    irrigation rates. Visual observations revealed a shallower root system under the
    higher irrigation rates than under the nonirrigated (0.00ET) and the limited-irrigation
    (0.33ET) treatments. This was confirmed by the soil moisture profile at harvest
    in 1992 and 1994. Dry bean can extract soil water from the 0 to 24 in. soil profile
    under dryland conditions, and from the 0 to 12 in. soil profile under well-irrigated
    conditions (1.00ET). Soil moisture content below 12 in. was at or near field capacity
    under the over-irrigation treatment (1.33ET), which suggests the potential for
    deep percolation and leaching of nitrates and other soluble salts. Over-irrigation
    appears to encourage a shallow root system, less than 2 ft. (field plant root
    inspection), which may reduce the use of soil moisture at lower depths and encourage
    deep percolation to the groundwater. Research Question Concerns about irrigation
    efficiency, water quality, and yield have prompted this study. Over-irrigation
    is a key factor that contributes to deep percolation and nutrient leaching to
    the groundwater. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of five
    different irrigation rates on dry bean yield response and water use efficiency.
    Literature Summary The dry bean is very sensitive to irrigation management. Studies
    indicate that dry bean yields can vary significantly as irrigation rates go from
    dryland to optimal rates. However, the increase in yield may not be significant
    with the increase of the irrigation rate beyond optimum water need. It was reported
    that dry bean can extract water from the soil profile much deeper under dry and
    limited-irrigation conditions than over-irrigated conditions. Study Description
    The field study was conducted to investigate the impact of five irrigation rates
    on dry bean growth response. The irrigation rates used in this study were 0.00,
    0.33, 0.67, 1.00, and 1.33 of estimated evapotranspiration (ET). The soil on the
    site is Wetherill silty clay loam. The experiment was a randomized block design
    with four replications. A surface drip irrigation system was used to achieve the
    complete designed irrigation rates. An irrigation scheduling program was used
    to manage irrigation. Weather data from a local weather station on the site was
    used to estimate ET by using the Penman Equation. The water balance approach was
    used to determine the 1.00ET irrigation rate based on estimated ET, precipitation
    (total seasonal precipitation was 7.6 and 5.0 in. from June to September of 1992
    and 1994, respectively), change in soil moisture, runoff, and drainage terms in
    the 1992 and 1994 seasons. Applied Questions How does dry bean respond to different
    irrigation rates? Seed yield and dry matter increased significantly as the irrigation
    rates were increased up to the optimal water use (1.00ET) in 1994. However, maximum
    seed yield was obtained at 0.67ET in the cooler year (1992), while 1.00ET or greater
    was required to achieve maximum biomass yield in both years. Improvement in the
    yield was related to the water and irrigation use efficiencies, where yield production
    (seed or dry matter) per 1 in. of applied or used water was greater when the irrigation
    rate was kept at or below 1.00ET. Therefore, exceeding plant water requirements
    not only leads to waste of water, but also can affect plant performance and soil
    environment. What is the impact of the irrigation rate on soil water use or root
    moisture extraction pattern? Over-irrigation encouraged a shallow root system.
    The effective root depth under an irrigation rate greater than 1.00ET was 12 in.
    Conversely, limited irrigation treatments encouraged the development of a deeper
    root system and water uptake down to 3-ft. Also, the soil moisture profile under
    over-irrigated and 1.00ET was close to field capacity during the growing season,
    which may lead to potential deep percolation and nutrient loss to the groundwater.
    Recommendation Dry bean production in semi-arid climate areas like southwestern
    Colorado can be improved significantly by using proper irrigation scheduling.
    Irrigation scheduling can improve irrigation and water use efficiencies, especially
    in areas such as southwestern Colorado, where water management is critical to
    crop yield and water quality. The dry bean root system can use soil moisture more
    efficiently from lower depths (24 in. or deeper) when optimum irrigation was applied
    (equal to or less than 1.00ET). However, the irrigation scheduling program (SCHED)
    may have overestimated water requirements in the cooler year to achieve maximum
    seed yield, while predicting the water requirements needed for maximum biomass
    yield at 1.00ET or greater in both years. Irrigation provides the means to optimize
    plant water use and to increase crop production in many areas. Implementing sound
    irrigation water management practices is necessary to overcome excessive irrigation
    and eliminate many associated problems, such as nutrient leaching and surface
    runoff. This concept is critically important in areas such as southwestern Colorado,
    where deep percolation associated with over-irrigation combines with a saline
    geological formation (Mancos Shale), which contributes heavily to the salinity
    problem in the Colorado River. Therefore, irrigation scheduling becomes a crucial
    element in reducing deep percolation and improving water quality downstream. Another
    consideration is the efficiency of the water delivery system of the Dolores River
    Project, which was estimated at 87% compared with the actual water delivery efficiency
    of the McPhee Reservoir (97%), due to water losses as seepage and evaporation.
    Many researchers have investigated the relationship between yield and crop water
    use. The dry bean has been found to be sensitive to water stress. Singh (1995)
    reported that water stress during flowering and grain filling reduced seed yield
    and seed weight, and advanced the maturity of the dry bean. Irrigation efficiency
    is an issue in southwestern Colorado due to the salinity problems associated with
    irrigated agriculture and their impact on crop production. The dry bean is sensitive
    to salinity and water availability. Several studies have examined the impact of
    soil moisture status on dry bean production. In a study conducted by Howe and
    Rhoades (1961), yields of dry bean varied by 1269 lb/acre when the number of furrow
    irrigations ranged from one to four. The water requirement for the dry bean is
    approximately 17 in. of water per season in southwestern Colorado (Schwartz et
    al., 1996). The low water use by the dry bean provides an opportunity to reduce
    over-irrigation, compared with other crops grown in southwestern Colorado. Therefore,
    increasing the acreage in dry bean and small grain production, and decreasing
    the acreage in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), would help avoid water shortages
    in dry years in the area. However, the production costs, market availability,
    and price dictate what crop farmers grow. Soil moisture affects nutrient availability
    to crops and their yield response. In studies by Miller and Burke (1983), it was
    found that dry bean yield increased linearly with the increase in water application
    rates. Also, Stegman and Olson (1976) on pinto bean found a linear relationship
    between yield and estimated water use. There have been numerous studies on bean
    response to soil moisture. Miller and Burke (1983), Pandey et al. (1984), and
    Turk et al. (1980) used the line source irrigation system developed by Hanks et
    al. (1976) to study the yield response of crops such as dry bean and cowpea [Vigna
    unguiculata (L.) Walp. subsp. unguiculata]. It was found that different grain
    legumes respond differently to irrigation variability. Also, it was found that
    yield increased with water applied up to 1.00ET. Nielsen and Nelson (1998) reported
    that black bean yields were most sensitive to water stress during the reproductive
    growth stage, and plant height and leaf area were most sensitive to water stress
    during the vegetative growth stage. The top five counties in dry bean production
    in Colorado are Yuma, Weld, Kit Carson, Montrose, and Dolores. In 1997, 135 000
    acres were planted with dry bean in Colorado under dry and irrigated conditions.
    A total of 100 000 acres are harvested under irrigation, with total production
    of 2 120 000 lb, and an average of 2120 lb/acre. In contrast, the total harvested
    nonirrigated acreage in dry bean production was 20 000 acres, with an average
    yield of 800 lb/acre (Colorado Department of Agriculture, 1998). However, this
    left 15 000 acres of the total planted acreage not harvested due to weather and
    other related conditions according to Colorado Agricultural Statistics Service
    (1999, personal conversation). In southwest Colorado, which includes several counties
    including Montrose and Dolores Counties, the total acreage in dry bean is 44 500
    acres, where 22 700 acres are under irrigation with an average yield of 2000 lb/acre
    (Colorado Department of Agriculture, 1998). The very large dry bean acreage in
    irrigation in this area of Colorado, in particular, would benefit from the optimization
    of irrigation rates. This should improve yield, and most importantly, reduces
    over-irrigation that contributes to deep-water percolation and its impact on dissolving
    the natural salt formation (Mancos Shale) into the Colorado River. The objective
    of this study was to determine the effect of five different irrigation rates on
    dry bean yield response and water use efficiency (ETWUE). Materials and Methods
    The study was conducted during the growing seasons of 1992 and 1994 at the Southwestern
    Colorado Research Center at Yellow Jacket. The soil on the site is Wetherill silty
    clay loam. The experiment consisted of five irrigation rates, which were replicated
    four times in a randomized complete block design. The treatments were 0.00, 0.33,
    0.67, 1.00, and 1.33 of estimated ET. Individual plot size was 15 by 20 ft. Plots
    of different treatments in each replication were separated by a buffer zone 10-ft.
    wide and diked to contain the irrigation water and eliminate water runoff. Also,
    the same buffer zone (10 ft.) was established between replications for the same
    purpose. Soil moisture content was measured twice a week in the center of each
    plot by using a neutron probe (CPN model No. 5031) at depths of 6, 12, 24, 36,
    and 48 in. Irrigation water was applied by using a drip system. The irrigation
    system consisted of a 2 in. internal diameter polyethylene tube connected to the
    main irrigation line. A filter was installed in the main line to prevent sediment
    from blocking the emitters. Five 0.5 in. internal diameter, 120-ft. long, lateral
    tubes were connected perpendicular to the polyethylene tube at 30 in. spacing
    on the top of the furrow beds. The drip irrigation system was designed to deliver
    four different rates of water: 0.13, 0.26, 0.38, and 0.51 in./h at 15 PSI with
    a 20 in. space between the emitters. Irrigation scheduling was done with the SCHED
    program (Buchleiter et al., 1988) using data collected from the local weather
    station to estimate daily crop water use. The SCHED program estimates crop water
    use by using the modified Penman Equation (Jensen et al., 1971), along with polynomial
    functions to generate crop coefficients based on the fraction of time from planting
    to full cover and days after full cover (Duke, 1987). Irrigation was applied using
    the manageable allowable depletion, which refers to the acceptable soil moisture
    depletion (40–50% of available soil moisture) at different growth stages for the
    1.00ET treatment by using the water balance approach, which includes estimated
    ET, soil moisture change, precipitation, and drainage to determine irrigation
    amount. The following water balance relationship was used in determining the irrigation
    amount: where the terms on the left-hand side of the above equation represent
    the applied irrigation water (I), precipitation (P), and surface runoff (R). The
    sum of these three terms represents the net addition of water to the soil profile
    over a time period of interest. On the right hand side of the equation are estimated
    ET, drainage or deep percolation (D), and the water storage change (SW) of the
    soil profile. Each of the terms in the above equation represents water flows or
    storage changes over some arbitrary time intervals. All of the terms in the equation
    are positive except for D and SW, which may be either positive or negative depending
    on the direction of the water flow (upward or downward flow) (Jury et al., 1991).
    Surface runoff (R) was negligible due to control of the water application on each
    plot. Deep percolation (D) did not occur, based on soil moisture monitoring at
    4 to 5 ft depths, where no increase in soil moisture was found. The dry bean (cv.
    Bill Z) was planted at 84 000 seeds/acre on 7 June 1992 and 3 June 1994 with row
    spacing of 30 in. No N was applied in 1992, and 40 lb N/acre was applied in 1994
    based on soil test results. Three pounds per acre of Eptam (S-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate)
    and 0.25 lb ai/acre of Treflan (trifluralin) were incorporated into the soil before
    planting. Plant samples for dry matter were taken at different growth stages by
    cutting plant shoots at the ground level (two rows by 5 ft.). Half of each plot
    was harvested for dry matter yield determination. An area of 5 by 20 ft (two rows
    by 20 ft) from each plot was harvested for seed yield and final biomass yield
    assessment. Table 1. Combined analysis of variance of total dry matter and seed

    Results and Discussion Seed yield and dry matter were affected by different rates
    of irrigation. Combined analysis of variance revealed a significant difference
    in yield between the 1992 and 1994 growing seasons (Table 1). The seed yield and
    dry matter means for 1992 were 2802 lb/acre and 4582 lb/acre, respectively, compared
    with 2356 lb/acre and 3970 lb/acre, respectively, in 1994. This may be attributed
    to the weather differences between the 2 yr (temperature and precipitation). The
    amount of precipitation in 1992 (7 June to 14 Sept.) was 7.6 in., and total growing
    degree days were 1617, compared with 5.0 in. and 1899 total growing degree days
    in 1994 (3 June to 29 Aug.). In 1994, there were 13 d from planting to harvest
    during which the maximum temperature was greater than or equal to 90°F., and none
    in 1992. Higher temperatures and high evaporative demands during the growing season
    may lower the bean seed yields (Nielsen and Nelson, 1998). Effect of Irrigation
    Rates on Yield and Dry Matter In 1992, the yield of dry bean was much greater
    than in 1994, especially for 0.00ET, 0.33ET, and 0.67ET treatments, where irrigation
    was limited. It seems that the cooler 1992 growing season contributed to higher
    yields compared with 1994 under limited irrigation (Nielsen and Nelson, 1998).
    Maximum seed yield was obtained in the cooler year (1992) at an irrigation rate
    equal to 0.67ET, while maximum biomass yield was obtained at irrigation rates
    1.00ET and 1.33ET. This may suggest that the irrigation scheduling program SCHED
    that has been used is overestimating crop water requirements for obtaining maximum
    seed yield in the cooler year, while it meets water requirements for maximum biomass
    yield in both years. In 1992, TDM, which included seeds and plant weight at the
    above-ground level, increased significantly as the irrigation rate increased up
    to 1.00ET. There was no significant response when the irrigation rate exceeded
    1.00ET (or 1.33ET). The seed yield was significantly increased as the irrigation
    rate increased to 0.67ET. Total water applied during the 1992 season, which included
    rainfall, was 9.1 in. at 0.67ET treatment (Table 2). Therefore, an increase in
    irrigation plus precipitation of over 0.67ET did not produce a significant increase
    in seed yield. It did, however, increase TDM significantly and delay maturity.
    In contrast, seed yield results from the 1994 season showed significant differences
    in yield response among all irrigation treatments (Table 2). Dry matter and seed
    yields were generally lower in 1994 than in 1992. Table 2. Dry bean dry matter

    multiple range test. Effect of Irrigation Rates on Water Use Efficiency Water
    use efficiency, irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE), and harvest index (HI)
    are summarized in Table 3. The relationships used to describe these functions
    are: (1) (2) (3) Where: SYi = irrigated seed yield TDMi = total irrigated above-ground
    dry matter SYdry = nonirrigated seed yield TDMdry= total nonirrigated above-ground
    dry matter Irrigation water use efficiency for TDM declined as the irrigation
    rate increased in 1992, whereas seed yield showed an increase in ETWUE up to 1.00ET.
    On the other hand, both TDM and seed yield water use efficiencies declined as
    the irrigation rate increased in 1994 (Table 3). Irrigation use efficiency for
    TDM was greater than that for seeds at all irrigation rates. In contrast, crop
    ETWUE decreased considerably for TDM and seeds during both years beyond the 1.00ET
    irrigation rate. This may be related to the small yield increase at 1.33ET, compared
    with lower application rates, and the possibility of deep-water percolation below
    the root zone. The impact of different irrigation treatments can be expressed
    in terms of HI. The ratio of seed yield to TDM did not show any significant difference
    between all treatments for either year, except for the 0.67ET treatment in 1992
    and the 0.00ET treatment in 1994. In general, the HI reflects that seed production
    was higher in 1992 than in 1994. Also, the HI shows that the irrigation treatment
    has significant impact on the seed:dry matter ratio compared with the nonirrigated
    treatment. Effect of Irrigation Treatments on Growth Response In general, irrigation
    treatments had a significant impact on seed yield and total dry matter in both
    1992 and 1994 (Table 2). Plants under limited irrigation (0.33ET), even below
    the water requirement (16–19 in.; Schwartz et al., 1996), showed a significant
    increase in dry matter and seed yield, when compared with the nonirrigated treatment
    (0.00ET) (Table 2). In general, seed yield and dry matter increased as the irrigation
    rate increased. However, an irrigation rate over 0.67ET did not contribute significantly
    to the increase of seed yield, where it did for TDM in 1992. The increase in TDM
    under higher rates of irrigation was consistent during 1992 and 1994 compared
    with seed yield, where a significant increase was observed only in the 1994 season
    (Table 2). Treatments 0.00ET, 0.33ET, and 0.67ET were harvested 7 d earlier than
    1.00ET, and 10 d earlier than 1.33ET. Therefore, greater irrigation rates may
    contribute to late maturity and considerable delay in harvest, and hence is a
    concern, where the possibility of early frost and rainfall exist. Table 3. Dry

    columns within year followed by the same letter are not significantly different
    at alpha = 0.05 as tested by Duncan multiple range test. Dry matter response during
    the growing season as a function of time for different irrigation treatments showed
    a nonlinear relationship (Fig. 1). Total dry matter significantly increased with
    increasing irrigation amounts (40–90 d after emergence). The impact of the 1.33ET
    irrigation rate on dry matter production during different times of the growing
    season showed a slight improvement in dry matter over 1.00ET, especially in the
    1994 season. However, dry matter for all treatments showed no significant difference
    until 40 d after emergence. Furthermore, field observations and plant inspections,
    where plant root samples from different irrigation treatments were dug out and
    inspected, revealed a shallower root system under greater irrigation rates, compared
    with limited or no irrigation. Effect of Irrigation Rates on Soil Moisture Extraction
    The depth of soil moisture extraction by the plant root system is directly related
    to the water availability in the soil profile. The soil moisture profile showed
    considerable differences among the irrigation treatments in both years (Fig. 2).
    Dryland and limited irrigation treatments (0.00ET and 0.33ET) showed deeper soil
    moisture depletion at harvest than the other treatments down to 24 in., compared
    with the high rates of irrigation. This may be attributed to a deeper root system
    that developed under dryland and limited irrigation treatments. Figure 2 shows
    no soil moisture change below 12 in. for the soil profile under the 1.00ET and
    1.33ET treatments compared with lower irrigation rates. In contrast, soil moisture
    content showed little change below 24 in. for the 0.33ET and 0.67ET treatments.
    Therefore, under dryland conditions, dry bean has the potential to extract moisture
    from the soil profile as deep as 24 in. as indicated by Schwartz et al. (1996),
    that the active rooting depth for the dry bean is between 24 to 36 in., where
    the majority of moisture is extracted from the top 18 in. It was also reported
    that roots developed to 30 to 36 in. extract water late in the season when the
    bean plant is nearly mature (Schwartz et al., 1996). Nielsen and Nelson (1998)
    found much deeper water extraction with black bean (6 ft) when evaporative demand
    was high and water supply was limited. The soil moisture profile under the over-irrigation
    treatment was almost at field capacity (4.5 in./ft) for 24 to 48 in. soil depths.
    This means any extra water, such as irrigation or precipitation, after the crop
    season, will have the potential for deep percolation, and consequently, could
    lead to nitrate and other soluble salts leaching to the groundwater. Figure 1
    Open in figure viewer Dry bean dry matter during 1992 and 1994 growing seasons
    under different irrigation rates. Conclusions Water use by dry bean under variable
    irrigation rates was affected by the water application rate. Optimum irrigation
    rates and weather conditions during 1992 led to higher seed yield and dry matter.
    Irrigation rates in both years had a significant impact on seed yield and TDM.
    Maximum seed yield was achieved at an irrigation rate equal to 0.67ET in the cooler
    year, while 1.00ET or greater rate was required to obtain maximum biomass yield
    in both years. Crop ETWUE and IWUE decreased considerably for TDM and seed yield
    during both years beyond the 1.00ET irrigation rate. However, both IWUE and ETWUE
    for dry matter was greater than those for seed yield for all irrigation rates.
    Variable irrigation rates showed a significant effect on the HI (seed:dry matter
    ratio) compared with dryland treatments. Observations of the plant roots confirmed
    that a shallower root system was developed under high irrigation rates, compared
    with dry and limited irrigation treatments. The soil moisture extraction by the
    roots appeared to be primarily at the top 12 in. of the soil profile for high
    irrigation rate treatments, compared with 24 in. under dry and limited irrigation
    treatments, especially in 1992. The soil moisture profile was at or near field
    capacity under the over-irrigated treatments (1.33ET) after harvest, which could
    lead to the potential of deep water percolation and leaching of nitrate and other
    soluble salts. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer Soil water content characteristic

    drip irrigation (SDI) can substantially reduce the amount of irrigation water
    needed for corn production. However, corn yields need to be improved to offset
    the initial cost of drip installation. Air-injection is at least potentially applicable
    to the (SDI) system. However, the vertical stream of emitted air moving above
    the emitter outlet directly toward the surface creates a chimney effect, which
    should be avoided, and to ensure that there are adequate oxygen for root respiration.
    A field study was conducted in 2010 and 2011, to evaluate the effect of air-injection
    into the irrigation stream in SDI on the performance of corn. Experimental treatments
    were drip irrigation (DI), SDI, and SDI with air injection. The leaf area per
    plant with air injected was 1.477 and 1.0045 times greater in the aerated treatment
    than in DI and SDI, respectively. Grain filling was faster, and terminated earlier
    under air-injected drip system, than in DI. Root distribution, stem diameter,
    plant height and number of grains per plant were noticed to be higher under air
    injection than DI and SDI. Air injection had the highest water use efficiency
    (WUE) and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) in both growing seasons; with
    values of 1.442 and 1.096 in 2010 and 1.463 and 1.112 in 2011 for WUE and IWUE
    respectively. In comparison with DI and SDI, the air injection treatment achieved
    a significantly higher productivity through the two seasons. Yield increases due
    to air injection were 37.78% and 12.27% greater in 2010 and 38.46% and 12.5% in
    2011 compared to the DI and SDI treatments, respectively. Data from this study
    indicate that corn yield can be improved under SDI if the drip water is aerated.

    drip irrigationAir injectionCornWUE Introduction Modifying root zone environment
    by injecting air has continued to intrigue investigators. However, the cost of
    a single purpose, air-only injection system, separate from the irrigation system,
    detracts from the commercial attractiveness of the idea. With the acceptance of
    subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) by commercial growers, the air injection system
    is at least potentially applicable to the SDI system. Unfortunately, when air
    alone is supplied to the SDI system it emits as a vertical “stream,” moving above
    the emitter outlet directly to the soil surface. Consequently, the soil volume
    affected by air is probably limited to a chimney column directly above the emitter
    outlet. In this way, air and oxygen can continuously be supplied in solution and
    as micro bubbles, to root zone through the drip tape. Quite simply, subsurface
    drip irrigation (SDI) facilitates the delivery of aerated water directly to the
    root zone. This is defined as ‘‘oxygation.” It can potentially overcome problems
    associated with low oxygen in the rhizosphere as induced by flooding, by irrigation
    itself, by salinity, sodicity, and by compaction [1], [2], [3], [4]. The roots
    of most crop species need a good supply of oxygen in order to satisfy the water
    and nutrient needs of the shoots [5]. Paradoxically, one of the first symptoms
    of excessive soil wetness (i.e. saturation) is drought stress in the leaves. If
    these conditions are prolonged for more than a few days, then further serious
    damage can be affected via nutrient deficiency, build-up of metabolic poisons
    and increased incidence of root diseases [6]. Oxygen is essential for root respiration.
    Immediately after the roots have been surrounded by water they can no longer respire
    normally. The liquid also impedes diffusion of metabolites such as carbon dioxide
    and ethylene. This causes the plant to be stunted because ethylene is a growth
    inhibitor [7]. When air is entrained into the water within the root zone, diffusion
    of ethylene and carbon dioxide away from the roots may be increased. This increased
    diffusion rate should result in improved growing conditions. As drip irrigation
    develops a wetting front near emitters, the root zone of the crop remains near-saturation
    for a portion of the time between irrigation events, especially on heavy cracking
    clay (e.g. Vertisols) making them the least desirable soil types for drip irrigation.
    Particularly in poorly drained soils, flood irrigation and wet weather cause water
    to replace air in the soil thus reducing the availability and mobility of oxygen
    that remains trapped in soil pores [5]. By decreasing the supply of soil oxygen
    to plant roots, heavy rainfall or irrigation on such soils can constrain yields
    to well below their potential [8]. Subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) can significantly
    affect corn yields. For example increased with irrigation up to a point where
    irrigation became excessive; water use efficiency (WUE) increasing non-linearly
    with seasonal crop evapotranspiration (ETc) [9]. WUE was more sensitive to irrigation
    during the drier season and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) decreased sharply
    with irrigation. Irrigation significantly affected dry matter production and partitioning
    of the different corn plant components (grain, cob, and stover) [9]. Plant roots
    require adequate oxygen for root respiration as well as for sound metabolic function
    of the root and the whole plant. SDI minimizes alternate wetting and drying of
    the soil surface, a phenomenon that might otherwise predispose them to the cracking
    that could locally alleviate the lack of aeration. By direct injection of air
    in irrigation water, and by irrigation of a crop with aerated water, aeration
    of the crop root zone can now become a reality [1]. Injection of air alone is
    expensive and the injected air moves away from the root zone due to the chimney
    effect [3]. Oxygation is the delivery of aerated water by way of SDI systems [1],
    [2]. Aerated through a venturi principle, or with solutions of hydrogen peroxide,
    SDI provided yield benefits to a range of crops including cotton, zucchini and
    vegetable soybean [1], [2]. The reported studies on irrigation so far fail to
    offer an option for substantial reduction in water use while maintaining crop
    production. In a recent report on glasshouse and field experiments, [1], [2] confirmed
    that dramatic increases in crop yields, water use efficiency and salinity tolerance
    could be achieved with the use of oxygenated subsurface drip irrigation water,
    especially for crops grown on heavy clay soils [1], [2]. These researches showed
    that for soybean, oxygation increased water use efficiency (WUE) (yield divided
    by seasonal ET) by 54% and 70%, respectively, for hydrogen peroxide application
    and air injection using a venturi valve, and pod yield by 82% and 96%, respectively,
    for the two treatments. Likewise, for crops grown across a range of saline soil
    conditions, aeration using the venturi principle resulted in yields superior to
    those of the non-aerated controls [10]. Benefits of aeration using the venturi
    principle in California [3], [11], or using hydrogen peroxide in Germany [12]
    on crop growth have also reported. Aeration of subsurface drip irrigation water,
    using appropriate techniques such as the venturi, is a significant recent approach
    to economize on large-scale water usage and minimize drainage in irrigated agriculture
    [13]. Recent and ongoing research has shown that the incorporation of air injectors
    in SDI systems can increase root zone aeration and add value to grower investments
    in SDI. Accordingly the aim of this study was firstly to evaluate the technical
    feasibility of injection of ambient air into a subsurface drip irrigation tape,
    as a best management practice for improving growth characteristics and crop production
    of corn (Zea mays L.). Secondary to assess the effect of air injection on soil
    penetration resistance and plant take off force. Material and methods An open
    field experiment was carried out through installing an irrigation system that
    combined subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) tape and an air injection system that
    mixes air with the water delivered within the root zone. Location, soil, and crop
    details The experiment was carried out at Cairo University, Faculty of Agriculture,
    Agricultural Engineering Department experimental station at El-Giza governorate,
    Egypt (latitude 30.0861N, and longitude 31.2122E, and mean altitude 70 m above
    sea level). The corn variety Hybrid single 10 was directly sown on 22 April in
    both growing seasons 2010 and 2011. Plants were spaced 30 cm × 60 cm within and
    between rows, respectively. The experimental area has an arid climate with cool
    winters and hot dry summers. Table 1 summarizes the monthly mean climatic data
    for both growing seasons 2010 and 2011 for the city of El-Giza. Table 1. Monthly

    during the April–July growing season. The soil at the experimental site is classified
    as a sandy clay loam. Physical and chemical properties of the experimental soil
    are given in Table 2. Irrigation water was obtained from a deep well (60 m depth
    from the soil surface) located in the experimental area, with pH 7.2, and an average
    electrical conductivity of 0.83 dS m−1. Table 2. Physical and chemical soil properties

    the soil surface in a trench prepared with an AFT45 tractor mounted trencher (AFT
    Trenchers Ltd., Sudbury, England), laterals were placed at 60 cm between each
    other. Then the trenches were carefully backfilled with the previously removed
    soil. The lateral was 16 mm external diameter and 60 m long, the space between
    emitters was 20 cm, the emitter type was Supertif (Netafim, Israel), that were
    replicated three times in the experiment for each treatment. The emitter features
    were: 3.85 l h−1 flow rate, turbulent flow, completely flow regulated with outstanding
    clogging resistance, a working pressure of 100 kPa, and a built-in no-drain device
    which prevents water draining from the drip line when water has been shut off.
    Daily soil water balance and ETc were estimated with a computer software CropWat
    program. The inputs to the program were daily weather data, including rainfall,
    irrigation date and amounts, initial water content in the soil profile at crop
    emergence, and crop and site-specific information such as planting date, maturity
    date, soil parameters, maximum rooting depth. The CropWat program calculated daily
    ETc. This procedure calculates ETc as the product of the evapotranspiration of
    a grass reference crop (ETo) and a crop coefficient (Kc). ETo was calculated using
    the weather data as input to the Penman–Monteith equation and the Kc was used
    to adjust the estimated ETo for the reference crop to that of other crops at different
    growth stages and growing environments. Air injection An air compressor and an
    air volume meter were used as the air-injector unit. They were installed in-line
    immediately after a gate valve. The air volume meter consisted of a 1 m length
    pipe with a diameter of 2 in., and was used to transform the flow from turbulent
    to laminar. An air velocity sensor was installed in the center of the pipe and
    was used to measure the average velocity (Fig. 1). This way it was possible to
    control the amount of air ingress into the irrigation line (12% air by volume
    of water). Aerated water was delivered to the soil through drippers. The water
    flow was decreased when air was injected and then we increased the time of irrigation
    to compensate for the decrement of water flow. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 1. Hydraulic diagram of the microirrigation system, air injection unit, and
    treatments. Soil moisture monitoring Soil moisture content was measured daily
    using a profile probe calibrated by way of the gravimetric method. The time domain
    reflectometry (TDR) Profile Probe consists of a sealed polycarbonate rod (25 mm
    diameter), with electronic sensors (seen as pairs of stainless steel rings) arranged
    at fixed intervals along its length. Soil moisture was measured 5 cm away from
    the emitter by using the TDR sensor. Soil moisture was maintained between the
    refill point (28% by volume) and field capacity (41% by volume). Irrigation was
    carried out on a 1–3 day interval, between 7:00 h and 12:00 h, based on the readings
    from the TDR. Experimental design and treatments The experiment comprised of corn
    was grown at field capacity with and without aeration; three treatments were applied,
    drip irrigation (DI), subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) and subsurface with air
    injection. The area for each treatment was 6 m * 60 m. The nutrient requirement
    of the crop in both experiments was supplied through fertigation using piston
    pump power by the water pressure system. Fertilizers consisted of 200 kg ha−1
    actual N, 50 kg ha−1 P2O5 and 60 kg ha−1 K2O. Starter fertilizer (10-50-10) was
    applied with the transplant water (500 g in 200 L water and approximately 116
    ml of solution per plant). Evaluation parameters The emitters were evaluated by
    way of the coefficient of manufacturing variation (CV), by measuring the discharge
    of a random sample of 20 emitters under different operating pressures (0.75, 1,
    and 2 kPa) using the following equations: (1) (2) where Xi is the discharge of
    an emitter, the mean discharge of emitters in the sample and S is the standard
    deviation of the discharge of the emitters in the sample and n is the number of
    emitters in the sample. According to the recommended classification of manufacturer’s
    coefficient of variation (CV) [14], the drippers were classified as excellent.
    The CV was 0.03 under 1 kPa operating pressure which represent the nominal pressure
    for the used emitters. The second parameter of evaluation was the water distribution
    uniformity. It was conducted through the catch cans test immediately after installation
    of irrigation system by digging the soil around the emitter and putting a catch
    can under it and collecting the emitted water for 20 min, this operation was repeated
    monthly through the growing season to check the distribution uniformity. It was
    performed in three replicates to evaluate how evenly water was distributed. Twenty
    cans were used to perform this test and were distributed randomly in the area
    under study. Using a stopwatch, the water discharged from each dripper in a period
    of 15 min was caught inside the can and the volume of water caught was measured.
    The discharge in l/h for each dripper was calculated. The distribution uniformity
    of low quarter was calculated according to Burt et al. [15]. (3) where DUlq is
    the distribution uniformity low quarter, dlq the lowest quarter depth (lowest
    25% of the observed depths) and davg is the average depth of the total elements
    (cans). The average of the DUlq for the three replicates was 95.61%. Data recording
    Weather data was recorded from an adjacent weather station. The center three rows
    of each plot were harvested, the grain yield per plot was calculated on a ‘‘wet-mass
    basis” (standard water content of 15.5%). Eight plants from each plot were also
    monitored and hand-harvested to determine growth and development parameters such
    as plant height, leaf area and stem diameter, and reproductive parameters such
    as days to flowering and grain filling duration. The data for leaf area, stem
    and root weight was derived from final plant harvest. Water-use efficiency (WUE)
    and irrigation water-use efficiency (IWUE) values were calculated were calculated
    with Eqs. (4), (5) [16]: (4) where WUE is the water use efficiency (t ha−1 mm),
    Ey the economical yield (t ha−1) and Et is the plant water consumption (mm). (5)
    where IWUE is the irrigation water use efficiency (t ha−1 mm), Ey the economical
    yield (t ha−1) and Ir is the amount of applied irrigation water (mm). Soil penetration
    resistance and plant take off force Penetration resistance was measured by nine
    insertions in each plot before planting, and at every 2 weeks throughout the growing
    seasons. It was conducted using a handheld cone penetrometer (Eijkelkamp – Agrisearch
    Equipment, Netherlands). A penetrologger was used with 11.28 mm cone diameter,
    30° angle and with vertical speeds that did not exceed 5 mm s−1 based on ASAE
    standard [17]. Penetrometer measurements were taken in X direction with 5 cm increments
    over the 0–50 cm depth, and at optimum soil moisture content (where the plowing
    can be performed). The plant take off force (the force needed to remove plants
    from the soil) was measured at harvesting where the soil was dry, by taking 10
    plants for each treatments and measurements were replicated three times in the
    experiment for each treatment. The take off force was conducted using a force
    gauge (Model M4-200, USA). Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were carried
    out using the GLM (General Linear Model) procedure of the SPSS statistical package.
    The model was used for analyzing growth characteristics, WUE, and IWUE as fixed
    effects for the irrigation treatment and growing seasons and the double interactions
    between them, and the replications as the error term [18]. Results and discussion
    Plant populations for years 2010 and 2011 were approximately the same (55,556
    plants ha−1) because a planter was used and the rate of seeding was adjusted accurately.
    The crops were developed at a normal space each year. The first irrigation was
    made on 22 April of each year. The total irrigation water applied each year is
    shown in Table 3. Table 3. Yield, seasonal irrigation, water use, water use efficiency
    and irrigation water use efficiency for corn under different treatments for two

    Note: Numbers followed by different letters with in the growing season are statistically
    different (P < 0.05). The WUE did not differ significantly between the two growing
    seasons but it differed significantly between treatments; the WUE was significantly
    greater for the air injection treatment compared with the DI and SDI (Table 3).
    The IWUE followed the same trend. The cumulative water applied throughout the
    growing seasons was greater for DI for example at 12,970 m3 ha−1 in 2010 compared
    to the SDI and air injection. The air injection had the lowest cumulative applied
    water in 2010 at 11,503 m3 ha−1 (Table 3). The air injection had the highest WUE
    and IWUE on both growing seasons, it was 1.442 kg m−3 and 1.096 kg m−3 in 2010
    and 1.463 kg m−3 and 1.112 kg m−3 in 2011 for WUE and IWUE respectively in comparison
    with the DI treatment that had the lowest values of 0.928 kg m−3 and 0.937 kg
    m−3 in 2010 and 0.705 kg m−3 and 0.712 kg m−3 in 2011 for WUE and IWUE, respectively
    (Table 3). The effect of treatments on grain weight per ear was significant. Aeration
    increased grain weight per ear and length compared to the DI and SDI on both growing
    season (Fig. 2). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. The ear length for

    DI and SDI by 37.78% and 12.27% in 2010 and 38.46% and 12.5% in 2011. The grains
    weight per ear were significantly heavier due to aeration compared to DI and SDI

    followed by different letters with in the growing season are statistically different
    (P < 0.05). Plant height increased with aeration and plants were significantly
    taller than DI and SDI 284 cm versus 260 cm and 265 cm in 2010 for DI and SDI,
    respectively, while it was 290 cm versus 265 cm and 270 cm in 2011 for DI and
    SDI, respectively (Table 4). A marked positive effect of aeration was observed
    on leaf area per plant where the air injection had the highest leaf area per plant
    with the lowest in DI treatment. Larger individual leaves was responsible 10,802
    cm2 versus 7312 cm2 and 10,754 cm2 in 2010 for DI and SDI, respectively, while
    it was 10,856 cm2 versus 7349 cm2 and 10,808 cm2 in 2011 for DI and SDI, respectively
    (Table 4). Stem diameter showed a positive response to aeration, there was a significant
    difference between air injection and both DI and SDI treatments. The air injection
    had the highest stem diameter followed by SDI and DI had the least values in both
    growing seasons (Table 4). The number of leaves per plant showed significant differences
    between the aeration treatment and both SDI and DI treatments. The leaf area per
    plant was 1.477 and 1.0045 times greater in the aeration treatment than in DI
    and SDI respectively (Table 4). The number of grains per plant was greater in
    the aerated treatment in comparison with DI and SDI (Table 4). With the air injection
    treatment, it was greater by 19.4% and 9.9% in 2010 and 20% and 10.2% in 2011
    compared to DI and SDI, respectively. The increase in 1000-grain weight by the
    air injection treatment over the DI treatment was 63.6% in 2010; and the increase
    in 2011 was 65.3%. The corresponding increase in 1000-grain weight for the air
    injection treatment over the SDI treatment was 7.4% in 2010; and in the 2011 was
    8.3%. This result matched those obtained by other researchers in the Unites States
    and Australia [1], [2], [3], [10], [12], who observed increases in yields, improvements
    in growth characteristics and in soil quality related to root zone aeration. Aeration
    had a slight effect on root length and width (Fig. 3); it increased the root dimensions
    in both horizontal and vertical axes related to when air was injected into the
    irrigation water. The aerated treatment had the greatest root length and width,
    followed by SDI, while the DI treatment had the smallest root dimensions (Fig.
    3). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The root shape under different
    treatments. Cone index (soil penetration resistance) differed among DI, SDI and
    air injection treatments (Fig. 4). The maximum values of soil penetration resistance
    were 2.52 MPa, 2.00 MPa and 1.77 MPa for DI, SDI and air injection treatments
    respectively while the minimum values were 0.5 MPa, 0.17 MPa and 0.13 MPa respectively.

    and different irrigation treatment at the optimum soil moisture content. Because
    of the delicate nature of DI and SDI tapes, cultivation does not take place to
    depth, thereby predisposing the soil around the tapes to compaction. DI and SDI
    minimize alternate wetting and drying of the soil surface, a phenomenon that might
    otherwise predispose them to the cracking that could locally alleviate the lack
    of aeration that results in soil compaction and increases soil penetration resistance.
    With regard to the plant take off force (Fig. 5), the maximum value 98.7 kg was
    obtained under DI and the lowest value was 53.2 kg under air injection. The plant
    take off force decreased with air injection by about 80% and 22% comparing with
    DI and SDI, respectively. This suggests that under air injection the cohesion
    force between the root and soil is low, and that the adhesion force between the
    soil particles is low, so the take off force for plant is reduced with air injection.

    treatments at harvest. Conclusion Air injection irrigation systems can increase
    root zone aeration and add value to grower investments in SDI. The increase in
    yields and potential improvement in soil quality associated with the root zone
    aeration implies that the adoption of the SDI-air injection technology primarily
    as a tool for increasing corn productivity. The available indigenous materials
    can be used for aeration in different soil types and conditions in order to increase
    the returns on corn production. The cultivation technique developed in this study
    can be applied to other vegetable and field crops as well as corn and can be utilized
    even in wet lowlands otherwise considered as wastelands. In addition to yield,
    growth characteristics, plant take off force and soil penetration resistance,
    future studies should focus on the impact of air injection on soil respiration,
    soil salinity, soil microbial activity and insect/pest resistance. References

    Media Tables Share Abstract A system has been developed in Nebraska to automatically
    collect hourly weather data from remote agricultural weather stations. Standard
    weather sensors are coupled to an on‐site microprocessor. A central minicomputer
    regularly interrogates the microprocessor, quality‐checks the incoming weather
    data and transfers it to a larger mainframe computer. Weather‐data‐based programs
    are available to users of the mainframe computer through the AGNET system (a management
    tool for agriculture). Programs are currently available for such applications
    as irrigation scheduling, estimating energy requirements for grain drying, predicting
    stage and rate of crop development and predicting livestock weight gains. Nebraska
    now has 17 stations and the number is increasing rapidly since initial costs are
    low, site requirements are simple, and maintenance is minimal. As a result, interest
    is increasing in the use of near‐real time weather data. Formats available You

    \ the challenge of feeding a growing population with limited or depleting\nfresh\
    \ water resources. Advances in irrigation systems and technologies allow site-speciﬁc\
    \ application\nof irrigation water within the ﬁeld to improve water use efﬁciency\
    \ or reduce water usage for\nsustainable crop production, especially in arid and\
    \ semi-arid regions. This paper discusses recent\ndevelopment of variable-rate\
    \ irrigation (VRI) technologies, data and information for VRI application,\nand\
    \ impacts of VRI, including proﬁtability using this technology, with a focus on\
    \ agronomic factors\nin precision water management. The development in sprinkler\
    \ systems enabled irrigation application\nwith greater precision at the scale\
    \ of individual nozzle control. Further research is required to evaluate\nVRI\
    \ prescription maps integrating different soil and crop characteristics in different\
    \ environments.\nOn-farm trials and whole-ﬁeld studies are needed to provide support\
    \ information for practical\nVRI applications. Future research also needs to address\
    \ the adjustment of the spatial distribution of\nprescription zones in response\
    \ to temporal variability in soil water status and crop growing conditions,\n\
    which can be evaluated by incorporating remote and proximal sensing data. Comprehensive\
    \ decision\nsupport tools are required to help the user decide where to apply\
    \ how much irrigation water at\ndifferent crop growth stages to optimize water\
    \ use and crop production based on the regional climate\nconditions and cropping\
    \ systems.\nKeywords: variable-rate irrigation; precision agriculture; irrigation\
    \ scheduling\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture is the largest consumer of the world′s\
    \ available fresh water, as plant growth largely\ndepends on the availability\
    \ of water. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),\ncurrent\
    \ world irrigated area is approximately 300 million ha, and projection to 2050\
    \ suggests growing\nscarcities of water resources for agriculture, although water\
    \ is a renewable resource. This situation has\nampliﬁed the intensity of global\
    \ food insecurity, climate change, and poverty. The greatest challenge\nto agriculture\
    \ is to provide food and ﬁber for almost 8 billion people around the world in\
    \ the advent of\ndepleting freshwater resources [1].\nThe challenge is more prominent\
    \ in the arid and semi-arid regions, where underground water\nsources, especially\
    \ aquifers are used for irrigation, as rainfall provides only a portion of the\
    \ total\nrequirement for crop evapotranspiration (ET) demand [2]. Heavy irrigation\
    \ has caused rapid depletion\nof many aquifers. For instance, comparing the water\
    \ level of the Ogallala aquifer in the 1950s to that\nof 2013, in some wells,\
    \ up to 78 m of water was depleted in the Texas High Plains area [3]. This is\n\
    almost 12 times the average decline of 4.5 m for the whole area of the aquifer.\
    \ Given this depletion rate,\nscientists have predicted that 35% of the Southern\
    \ High Plains will not be able to support irrigation in\n30 years. Many other\
    \ water resources in the world are depleting rapidly in recent years with negligible\n\
    recharge, indicating the need for water conservation solutions in agriculture\
    \ [4,5]. More effective and\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87; doi:10.3390/agronomy9020087\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n2 of 21\nefﬁcient management\
    \ of water is required to better conserve water and improve water use efﬁciency\n\
    for sustainable crop production.\nConventional farming practices manage an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld uniformly without incorporating\nthe intrinsic variability in topography,\
    \ soil, crop growth conditions, and other agronomic factors.\nThis can result\
    \ in nutrient leaching, environmental contamination, and reduced proﬁtability\
    \ especially\nwhen applying high inputs in low yielding areas and vice versa [6,7].\
    \ Precision agriculture can be\nadopted to divide the ﬁeld into small management\
    \ units for optimized production [8]. There are\nseveral deﬁnitions for precision\
    \ agriculture, and it keeps evolving with emerging technologies and\nunderstanding\
    \ of what is achievable [9]. The idea of precision agriculture or site-speciﬁc\
    \ management\nstarted around the early 1980s with the development of various technologies\
    \ to assess ﬁeld variabilities\nsuch as soil survey, soil testing and mapping,\
    \ and crop yield monitoring [10–13]. Precision agriculture\ndepends on detailed\
    \ spatial information, information technology, greater information processing\n\
    capability, and better decision aids [14]. Precision agriculture is a management\
    \ system that measures\nand responds to the spatial and temporal variability of\
    \ soil and crop growth at the sub-ﬁeld level\nwith the aim to enhance proﬁtability\
    \ and reduce environmental impact [15,16]. Major technologies\ninvolved in precision\
    \ agriculture include geographic information systems (GIS), remote and proximal\n\
    sensing, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), yield monitoring and the variable\
    \ rate technology.\nGeoreferenced information about soil and plant characteristics\
    \ can be obtained efﬁciently using GIS,\nproximal sensors and remote sensors [17].\
    \ Application of yield monitors provides the capability to\nprecisely characterize\
    \ yield variability at large scales in the ﬁeld. Moreover, the variable rate technology\n\
    provides the ability to site-speciﬁcally apply irrigation water in the ﬁeld to\
    \ achieve potential water\nsavings [18]. This enables the timely and accurate\
    \ water application incorporating the spatial and\ntemporal soil properties and\
    \ plant demand at different growth stages [15]. In other words, the variable\n\
    rate irrigation (VRI) technology can help to apply the right amount of water in\
    \ the right area of the\nﬁeld at the right time resulting in water savings.\n\
    Recent research suggests site-speciﬁc management of water or VRI could be a solution\
    \ to conserve\nwater and improve water use efﬁciency (WUE), which is the ratio\
    \ between effective water use and\nactual water withdrawal in the ﬁeld [19]. VRI\
    \ can support water and energy conservation with a\npositive inﬂuence on crop\
    \ water productivity and the environment [20]. This is possible by applying\n\
    irrigation at rates that vary to appropriately match ﬁeld variability based on\
    \ speciﬁc water needs\nof individual management zones rather than applying a uniform\
    \ rate throughout the ﬁeld [21].\nThe magnitude of soil water content (SWC) varies\
    \ with time and location, but the pattern of spatial\nvariability usually remains\
    \ similar. This temporal stability of SWC is associated with properties of the\n\
    ﬁeld such as topography, soil texture, apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa)\
    \ and drainage patterns\nthat insigniﬁcantly change over time [22,23]. The feasibility\
    \ and effectiveness of VRI depend on the\nsize of the ﬁeld, crop species under\
    \ consideration, weather, and the underlying ﬁeld properties such as\nelevation,\
    \ slope, soil texture, and ECa that inﬂuence soil moisture content and irrigation\
    \ requirements\nfor the crop [24,25]. Hence, understanding the inﬂuence of agronomic\
    \ factors such as topography and\nsoil properties on soil water and ultimately\
    \ yield can provide a basis for application of VRI in the ﬁeld\nto achieve potential\
    \ water savings together with yield optimization.\nToday, site-speciﬁc water management\
    \ has been made easier with several precision agriculture\ntools, such as GNSS,\
    \ GIS, yield mapping, soil survey and remote sensing [26]. Several decision support\n\
    tools and strategies to reduce groundwater withdrawal without reductions in irrigated\
    \ land area or\ncrop productivity have been developed [4]. The measures to optimize\
    \ the use of irrigation water in\nthe ﬁelds include increasing weather-based irrigation\
    \ scheduling, converting gravity-based irrigation\nto center pivot irrigation,\
    \ subsurface drip irrigation, replacing high water to low water demand\ncrops,\
    \ and deﬁcit irrigation based on evapotranspiration replacement using various\
    \ water-balance\nmodels [27]. Several studies have been done to understand the\
    \ possible water savings with VRI.\nA review on VRI across different crop and\
    \ weather regimes of the world concluded that VRI could save\n10%–15% of water\
    \ [28]. Although the use of VRI seems to be a reasonable measure to improve water\n\
    Agronomy 2019, 9, 87\n3 of 21\nmanagement, many producers are reluctant to adopt\
    \ it because limited research is done at the ﬁeld scale\nto understand its reliability\
    \ and economic potential [25]. A better understanding of ﬁeld variability and\n\
    how it affects crop yield is needed for effective implementation of the new technologies.\
    \ A review for\nsite-speciﬁc sprinkler irrigation [29] focused on the technology\
    \ and challenges for adoption. Another\nreview of 20 years’ research on increasing\
    \ crop productivity with sprinkler and micro-irrigation\ndiscussed the importance\
    \ of understanding the crop response to VRI [30]. The study emphasized the\nneed\
    \ for continuous effort towards management zone delineation based on ﬁeld properties\
    \ integrated\nwith dynamic information from real-time monitoring of climatological\
    \ and crop data. However,\nthis study focused more on the technological aspect\
    \ of irrigation management than the agronomic\naspect of water conservation with\
    \ VRI. The agricultural science behind VRI is equally crucial for\nthe successful\
    \ implementation of this technology. Hence, the objective of this paper is to\
    \ review the\nscientiﬁc background and technologies in precision water management,\
    \ with the focus on agronomic\nfactors and strategies for site-speciﬁc water management.\n\
    2. Variable-Rate Irrigation Technologies\nThe irrigation system changed from gravity-based\
    \ furrow irrigation in the 1950s to sprinkler\nirrigation in late 1990s. Initially,\
    \ the high-pressure sprinkler irrigation system was available in the\n1980s which\
    \ later developed to low-pressure sprinklers and low-energy precision application\
    \ (LEPA)\nin 1990s [31–33]. About 49% of total irrigated land in the United States\
    \ is irrigated with center pivot\nsystems, out of which 44% is irrigated at low\
    \ pressure under 30 psi [34]. The basic requirements for the\nVRI technology are\
    \ sensors and spatial information, prescription maps and a system to incorporate\
    \ VRI\nprescription (e.g., LEPA, lateral irrigation, etc.) to apply in the ﬁeld\
    \ [35]. At present, there are several\nirrigation technologies for conservation\
    \ irrigation, such as sprinkler, drip, and other micro-irrigation\nsystems but\
    \ limited site-speciﬁc studies have been done [30,36–38]. For example, a study\
    \ of the\nvariable-rate drip irrigation system on vineyard found up to 17% increase\
    \ in yield and a 20% decrease\nin water consumption compared to uniform irrigation\
    \ [39]. Researchers in the UK assessed the potential\nof hose-reel boom irrigators\
    \ for precision irrigation in vegetables [40]. Automatic gravity-fed irrigation\n\
    systems in Europe decreased manual labor and supported adoption by innovative\
    \ farmers [41].\nVariable-rate irrigation using center pivot in rice showed better\
    \ performance compared to uniform\nﬂooding irrigation [42]. In this review, we\
    \ will focus more on those irrigation technologies that have\nbeen used for site-speciﬁc\
    \ water management more frequently around the world, such as variable-rate\nlateral\
    \ irrigation systems and center pivot irrigation systems.\nThe components of a\
    \ variable-rate lateral irrigation system commonly consist of a GPS or GNSS\n\
    receiver, custom software-controlled relays and valves, which can apply variable\
    \ water utilizing the\nnozzle-pulsing technique and a variable speed control system.\
    \ This system can control the irrigation\nrate and forward speed with high accuracy\
    \ [43]. Similarly, the components of a center pivot VRI system\ninclude a pivot\
    \ control panel, a VRI control panel, solenoid valves, control nodes, a GNSS system,\n\
    a variable frequency drive and a remote-control system [21]. The pivot control\
    \ regulates the operation\nand speed of the pivot, while the VRI control panel\
    \ regulates the irrigation application rate in response\nto the prescription map\
    \ and the pivot location. Solenoid valves regulate the ﬂow of sprinkler heads.\n\
    The GNSS system at the end of the center pivot provides the pivot position. The\
    \ control nodes along\nthe length of the pivot determine when the valves are open\
    \ or close. The variable frequency drive\n(VFD) helps to regulate the pressure\
    \ while instantaneously changing the rate of irrigation at different\npositions\
    \ of the ﬁeld. The VFD controls the rotation speed of the pump impeller by receiving\
    \ the input\nfrom a pressure switch installed on the pump outlet pipe. This keeps\
    \ water pressure stable within\npreset maximum and minimum thresholds and thus\
    \ saving water and energy. The remote control\nsystem allows to view and control\
    \ the center pivot and the pump from a distance via a smartphone or\na computer\
    \ using the internet [21]. Further, research and development are striving to control\
    \ irrigation\namount with VRI controllers using real-time information from plant\
    \ and soil sensors in the ﬁeld [44].\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n4 of 21\nCurrently,\
    \ several companies work on the manufacture and application of this technology.\n\
    The commercially available VRI control resolution varies with the manufacturers.\
    \ VRI systems\ncan apply zero water to speciﬁc nozzles and as much as 200% of\
    \ the standard application rate\nto other nozzles by opening or closing individual\
    \ nozzles and by changing the speed of the\npivot [45]. Some companies provide\
    \ the ability to control zones of sprinklers, while others can\ncontrol each sprinkler\
    \ independently [46]. For example, Valley (Valley, Valmont Irrigation, Valley,\
    \ NE,\nUSA) provides variable speed control and variable zone control technologies\
    \ for site-speciﬁc water\napplication. The variable speed control system uses\
    \ an advanced control panel that can slow down or\nspeed up the pivot to vary\
    \ water input in different areas (sectors) of the ﬁeld, but the overall pivot\
    \ ﬂow\nrate remains constant. This system does not need additional hardware on\
    \ the existing pivot irrigation\nsystem. The variable zone control system can\
    \ vary the speed of the center and change the application\nrate along the pivot\
    \ lateral. This system applies different irrigation depths to different areas\
    \ of the ﬁeld\nby turning sprinklers on and off for various amounts of time. Trimble\
    \ (Trimble Navigation, Sunnyvale,\nCA, USA) has developed the Irrigate-IQ Variable-Rate\
    \ Irrigation System. This system incorporates\nthe VFD and variable speed drive\
    \ (VSD) into the recent optimal ﬂow VRI that works with standard\npump equipment\
    \ on wells with limited capacity. This system is capable of individual nozzle\
    \ control,\nwhich can apply the right amount of water in the right place more\
    \ accurately [47]. Currently, it is\npossible to achieve sector control with very\
    \ small resolution, and zone control can add irrigation zones\nfurther to the\
    \ sector at the small scales of lateral spans (Figure 1) [48]. A study conducted\
    \ in Canada to\nevaluate the performance of VRI found that the accuracy of water\
    \ application was up to 90% in the\ncenter pivot system [49]. However, the performance\
    \ of these irrigation systems in ﬁeld applications is\naffected by many factors,\
    \ such as ﬁeld attributes, the spatial resolution of the sensors used in irrigation\n\
    management and temporal resolution of data inputs, as well as unexpected environmental\
    \ conditions.\nHence, adaptive irrigation management strategies and active research\
    \ support are required to enhance\nthe adoption and application of VRI [20,50].\n\

    topographic properties combined can explain 28% to 85% of yield variability [51].\
    \ Hence, it is critical\nto quantify the variability of terrain attributes and\
    \ soil properties for VRI applications.\n3.1. Topography\nTopographic variation\
    \ is a common characteristic of large agricultural ﬁelds that result in spatial\n\
    variability of soil water and ultimately crop yield [52]. Topography or terrain\
    \ has two types of attributes,\nprimary and secondary attributes [53]. Primary\
    \ attributes include elevation, slope, aspect, curvature,\nﬂow length, and upslope\
    \ contributing area. Secondary attributes are derived empirically from several\n\
    primary attributes to characterize speciﬁc processes manifesting in the landscape,\
    \ mainly including\nsediment transport index (STI), stream power index (SPI),\
    \ ﬂow direction, ﬂow accumulation, distance\nto ﬂow accumulation lines (DFL),\
    \ and wetness index [53,54]. Topographic properties affect soil physical\nand\
    \ chemical properties such as texture (sand, silt, and clay content), pH, CaCO3,\
    \ extractable Ca and\nMg, available K, base saturation, organic matter, and cation\
    \ exchange capacity (CEC). Topography also\ninﬂuences hydrologic properties and\
    \ processes and can account for up to 50% of water availability\ndifferences in\
    \ the same ﬁeld [52]. Elevation, slope and surface curvatures directly affect\
    \ inﬁltration and\nrunoff as they inﬂuence the surface and subsurface ﬂow of water\
    \ in the ﬁeld [55,56]. This can have a\nsigniﬁcant effect on crop growth and yield,\
    \ resulting in differences in crop production of up to 69% at\ndifferent positions\
    \ in the ﬁeld [57–59].\nA study conducted in central Illinois and eastern Indiana\
    \ showed that topography alone could\nexplain about 20% of yield variability [60].\
    \ Corn yield variability was consistently correlated with\nelevation and slope\
    \ in a three-year study in Southern Portugal [53]. This study showed that topographic\n\
    indices, such as distance to ﬂow accumulation lines (DFL), were negatively correlated\
    \ with yield,\nhence could be used to evaluate spatial yield variability. A research\
    \ conducted on a 7.4-ha ﬁeld in the\nSouthern High Plains of Texas showed cotton\
    \ lint yield was negatively correlated with site elevation.\nThe lint yield and\
    \ nitrogen (N) uptake was higher in bottom slope positions than in upslope, possibly\n\
    due to the accumulation of run-off water and NO3-N eroded from the upper slope\
    \ areas. However,\nthis trend depended on weather conditions. For a wet year when\
    \ there was over accumulation of water\nin bottom slopes, lower yield in bottom\
    \ slopes and higher yield in upper slopes were observed [61].\nRelative elevation\
    \ explained up to 49% of water content variation in the soil and 32% of lint yield\n\
    variation in the ﬁeld. The negative correlation between crop yield and elevation\
    \ could be in part due\nto the effect of erosion and topographical attributes\
    \ on soil properties that inﬂuence inﬁltration and\nstorage of water. Slope length\
    \ also affects crop yield by inﬂuencing N denitriﬁcation, soil N, P, K,\nCa and\
    \ Mg distributions, soil carbon storage, and nitrate distribution, as well as\
    \ the inﬁltration rate of\nwater in the ﬁeld [62].\nThe curvature of the ﬁeld\
    \ surface determines the concentration or dispersion of surface water\nin the\
    \ ﬁeld [55]. Concave surface with negative curvatures concentrates water ﬂow,\
    \ while convex\nsurface with positive curvature disperses water ﬂow [63]. For\
    \ example, SWC was found strongly\ncorrelated with soil surface curvature (r =\
    \ 0.9) [64]. Soil surface curvature can explain up to 15% of\nvariations in the\
    \ crop yield [65]. Corn yield was negatively correlated with surface curvature\
    \ in another\nresearch [53]. In this study, corn yield was 14% higher in concave\
    \ curvatures than convex areas. In a\nsix-year study [55], corn yields were negatively\
    \ correlated with elevation, slope, planar curvature and\nproﬁle curvature for\
    \ the wet years. The impact of surface curvature on crop yield also depends on\n\
    weather conditions and the location to some extent. Weather factors have the largest\
    \ effect on grain\nyield at locations with large curvature values. In some cases,\
    \ surface curvature is positively related to\ncrop yield at locations or years\
    \ with higher precipitation [60]. The magnitude of curvature also has\nan impact\
    \ on crop yield. The effect of curvature on crop yield between wet and dry years\
    \ are highly\ndifferent at locations with small curvature [66]. Hence, understanding\
    \ and incorporating topographic\nattributes of the ﬁeld, such as elevation, slope\
    \ length and aspect, surface curvature and their inﬂuence\non water dynamics can\
    \ be an important input for site-speciﬁc water management to achieve potential\n\
    water savings and optimized production.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n6 of 21\n3.2. Soil\
    \ Properties\nSoil functions as a medium for plant growth, a regulator of water\
    \ ﬂow and nutrient cycling.\nIt is a dynamic entity where complex interactions\
    \ occur among its physical, chemical and biological\nproperties to enable these\
    \ functions [67]. Soil forming factors such as parent material, biota, topography,\n\
    climate, and time are variable in time and space and explain most of the soil\
    \ variability besides the\nmanagement induced variability [11]. Spatial variability\
    \ of chemical properties including nutrients,\norganic matter, and pH can result\
    \ in within-ﬁeld variation in available water content and crop\nproductivity [68].\
    \ Complex spatial patterns of soil physical properties also affect soil water\
    \ availability\nand rooting of a plant, resulting in variability in crop growth\
    \ and yield [69]. Soil texture, organic matter\ncontent, apparent electrical conductivity,\
    \ and biological properties are relatively stable properties of\nthe ﬁeld that\
    \ are usually considered for site-speciﬁc management of the ﬁeld.\n3.2.1. Soil\
    \ Texture\nSoil texture, the relative content of sand, silt, and clay particles,\
    \ is an important soil physical\nproperty that affects crop growth and yield.\
    \ Soil texture determines the rate at which water drains\nthrough saturated soil\
    \ and inﬂuences available water-holding capacity. Therefore, it affects the\n\
    distribution of available water for plant growth and irrigation requirements in\
    \ the ﬁeld. Fine sandy\nloams and silts tend to have the highest water-holding\
    \ capacity, while an increase in either clay\nor sand content in the soil proﬁle\
    \ decreases the water-holding capacity [70]. The matric potential\nof soil, which\
    \ depends on soil particle size, inﬂuences the availability of soil water. For\
    \ example,\nclay particles have higher matric potential and lower soil available\
    \ water compared to sand and silt\nparticles [71]. Soil texture also affects the\
    \ spatial variability of residual NO3-N and the leaching of N.\nMore residual\
    \ was found in sandy loam soils compared to loamy sand, and leaching was higher\
    \ in\nloamy sand compared to sandy loam [72]. Soil texture also affects the pore\
    \ sizes and porosity of the soil,\nwhich ultimately affects crop root growth and\
    \ yield by limiting the water available to the plant and the\ngrowth space for\
    \ the roots [73]. In general, soils with high clay content are more difﬁcult to\
    \ manage\ndue to lack of porosity and water available for plant growth. On the\
    \ other hand, well-drained soils\nhave good soil aeration for healthy root and\
    \ crop growth [74]. The clay content can also inﬂuence soil\nwater and nutrient\
    \ content and result in crop yield variability across the ﬁeld [61,75]. A study\
    \ showed\nthat clay content in the soil could explain up to 17% variability in\
    \ winter wheat yield by affecting\nthe water available in the soil for crop growth\
    \ [76]. A study conducted in the Southern High Plains\nshowed that a very sandy\
    \ soil (the Brownﬁeld soil series) with high slope consistently had low yield\n\
    when given the same amount of irrigation water, fertilizer, seed population, and\
    \ other management\npractices [56]. A cross-correlation study conducted between\
    \ cotton lint yield, soil water, clay, sand and\nelevation in a 45-ha ﬁeld in\
    \ Texas High Plains also showed that correlation among these factors varied\n\
    between 0.72 and 0.63 and cotton crop and soil physical properties could be correlated\
    \ within 60 to\n80 m across the ﬁeld [77]. In summary, soil texture inﬂuences\
    \ variability in water availability and crop\nyield, and hence should be considered\
    \ in VRI planning and implementation [78].\n3.2.2. Soil Organic Matter (SOM)\n\
    The role of SOM in VRI lies in its inﬂuence on water-holding capacity because\
    \ the afﬁnity SOM has\nfor water [74]. SOM has a positive inﬂuence on yield, and\
    \ the inﬂuence is more prominent in soils with\nlow organic matter content [60].\
    \ SOM distribution in the ﬁeld is variable depending upon topography\nand other\
    \ soil properties. Accumulation of SOM often occurs at the bottom of slopes, possibly\
    \ due to\nthe run-off of organic matter from higher areas and increased plant\
    \ growth at low-lying wet areas of the\nﬁeld [60,61]. SOM generally increases\
    \ with increasing clay content. The organic matter in ﬁne-textured\nsoils such\
    \ as clay can be two to four times that of coarse-textured sandy soils under similar\
    \ climatic\nconditions, which in turn, can inﬂuence soil water holding capacity\
    \ [79]. Therefore, understanding the\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n7 of 21\norganic matter\
    \ distribution in the ﬁeld can help in estimation of irrigation requirements for\
    \ the ﬁeld\nand hence should be incorporated in developing site-speciﬁc water\
    \ management.\n3.2.3. Soil Biological Properties\nMost site-speciﬁc studies did\
    \ not consider spatial variability of soil organisms, but recent studies\nhave\
    \ shown that the spatial distribution of soil organisms inﬂuence plant growth\
    \ and possibly yield [80].\nSpatial and temporal distribution of microorganisms\
    \ at the landscape scale is complicated by the\ninteractions among topography,\
    \ soil type and distribution of water in the ﬁeld [81]. The management\nactivity\
    \ in the ﬁeld can inﬂuence the distribution of soil biological components and\
    \ this, in turn,\naffects the efﬁciency of agricultural management [82]. The soil\
    \ has the greatest microbial diversity\namong all ecosystems that support soil\
    \ conditioning and plant growth [83]. A study conducted in\nFrance [84] showed\
    \ that microbial indicators expressed a high spatial heterogeneity at the ﬁeld\
    \ level,\nwhich masked the effects of several soil and crop management treatments.\
    \ The results also showed\nthat the spatial variability due to biological variables\
    \ was similar in magnitude as compared to that\nexhibited by physicochemical parameters,\
    \ which indicated the feasibility of site-speciﬁc management\nof biological variability\
    \ in the ﬁeld using management zones. Such site-speciﬁc management can be\neffective\
    \ since organisms such as earthworms, protozoa, nematodes, bacteria, fungi, and\
    \ different\narthropods play a vital role in soil fertility and productivity [71].\n\
    3.2.4. Apparent Soil Electrical Conductivity (ECa)\nObtaining accurate information\
    \ about the spatial and temporal variability of SWC and irrigation\nrequirements\
    \ is one of the important challenges in site-speciﬁc water management.\nECa is\
    \ a\nmeasurement of ﬁeld variability that can be applied to precise water management\
    \ because it is\neasy to measure and facilitates the spatial understanding of\
    \ the soil-water-plant relationship [85].\nECa is a function of several soil properties,\
    \ such as soil salinity, texture, bulk density, ion concentration,\ntype and amount\
    \ of clay, topsoil thickness, and water content [86]. The effect of ECa on crop\
    \ yield is\nthrough its relation to soil properties, which depends on climate,\
    \ crop type and other speciﬁc ﬁeld\nconditions [87]. In general, high ECa is associated\
    \ with high clay content in the soil [88]. For example,\na study conducted near\
    \ Lamesa, Texas, showed that in four of the six sites, shallow ECa measured\n\
    with a Veris mapping system was positively correlated with clay content. Clay\
    \ content was negatively\nrelated to shallow ECa at one site due to the low bulk\
    \ density of the calcic horizon [89]. Most of the\nresearch conducted did not\
    \ consider the spatial correlation of soil characteristics when evaluating\ntheir\
    \ distributions. However, spatial autocorrelation of soil properties can be more\
    \ important than\nsoil properties themselves in explaining ECa. Therefore, future\
    \ studies need to incorporate the\nspatial correlation of soil characteristics\
    \ in evaluating the impact of ECa on crop yield [90]. ECa has\nthe potential to\
    \ differentiate between soils when the soils have enough water content and can\n\
    be used as an indicator of SWC. In general, areas with high ECa are associated\
    \ with high water\ncontent [91]. Several studies have shown a higher correlation\
    \ of crop growth characteristics and yield\nwith ECa [92,93]. A study showed that\
    \ ECa in combination with topographic attributes and bare soil\nbrightness could\
    \ explain up to 70.1% of the variability in cotton yield [56]. Hence, understanding\
    \ the\nspatial and temporal variability of ECa provides information for site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation management\nfor optimized yield.\nThe association between crop yield\
    \ and soil physical and chemical properties and landscape\nprocesses provide opportunities\
    \ to improve water management at the landscape scale [61].\nSoil properties and\
    \ topography inﬂuence crop yield from microscales to watershed scales and the\n\
    magnitude of complexity increases with the scale due to an increase in soil and\
    \ topographical variability,\nas well as variability in rainfall, temperature\
    \ and other climatic factors [60]. A study showed lower\ncorn grain and stover\
    \ yield in depositional and ﬂat areas which retained water for longer periods,\n\
    and high yield at well-drained summit positions [94]. In the same research for\
    \ alfalfa and poplar,\nthe results showed higher productivity at a site with a\
    \ relatively steep slope and potentially erosive\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n8 of 21\n\
    soils. This relationship was attributed to the above-normal rainfall in both years\
    \ of study. In a six-year\nstudy to understand corn yield in relation to terrain\
    \ attributes, two years with more than normal\nprecipitation showed a positive\
    \ correlation between yield and slope. For the other four years, yield was\nnegatively\
    \ correlated with slope [55]. Crop yield in relation to soil properties and topography\
    \ depends\non different soil management and climate conditions. The correlation\
    \ was found to be stronger for\ndry years in degraded soils and attributed to\
    \ differences in water availability. This suggests that\nvariable-rate irrigation\
    \ strategies might require adjustments in different crop seasons with different\n\
    climatic and management conditions and hence more researches on VRI are needed\
    \ [95].\n4. Crop and Soil Monitoring for Precision Water Management\nWater requirement\
    \ varies with the crop and crop growth and development status, soil water status,\n\
    as well as environmental conditions. Closely monitoring soil water status, crop\
    \ growth conditions and\ntheir spatial and temporal patterns can aid in irrigation\
    \ scheduling and precise water management.\nAmong many tools, remote sensing can\
    \ serve an effective basis by providing images with spatial\nand temporal variability\
    \ of crop growth parameters and soil moisture status for input in precision\n\
    water management.\n4.1. Crop Coefﬁcient and ET\nVRI aims at increasing WUE and\
    \ stabilizing yield, which can be improved by scheduling\nthe irrigation of crops\
    \ using physical and agronomic principles in irrigation management strategy.\n\
    WUE (kg/m3) can be expressed as the ratio of the amount of target product of the\
    \ crop to the amount\nof water applied to produce that output. The amount of water\
    \ used for crop production is the amount\nrequired to overcome the water lost\
    \ by ET from plant and soil surface, and it varies spatiotemporally\naccording\
    \ to weather and vegetation cover conditions [96,97]. Climatological parameters\
    \ such as\nsolar radiation, air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, and crop\
    \ and soil water characteristics,\nincluding management and environmental aspects,\
    \ are important parameters inﬂuencing ET in\nagricultural ﬁelds. Since ET is difﬁcult\
    \ to measure, reference ET from a hypothetical grass reference\nsurface is commonly\
    \ calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith equation based on meteorological\n\
    parameters [98]. The equation is expressed as follows,\nET0 = [0.408 ∆ (Rn − G)\
    \ + γ {900/(T + 273)} u2 (es − ea)]/[∆ + γ (1 + 0.34 u2)]\nwhere, ET0—Reference\
    \ evapotranspiration [mm day−1], Rn—Net radiation at the crop surface [MJ\nm−2\
    \ day−1], G—Soil heat ﬂux density [MJ m−2 day−1], T—Air temperature at 2 m height\
    \ [◦C],\nu2—Wind speed at 2 m height [m s−1], es—Saturation vapor pressure [kPa],\
    \ ea—Actual vapor pressure\n[kPa], es—ea saturation vapor pressure deﬁcit [kPa],\
    \ D—Slope vapor pressure curve [kPa ◦C−1],\nγ—Psychrometric constant [kPa ◦C−1].\n\
    Crop-speciﬁc evapotranspiration needs are calculated based on crop coefﬁcients\
    \ (Kc). By using\nthe FAO Penman-Monteith deﬁnition for ET0, crop coefﬁcients\
    \ at research sites could be calculated by\nrelating the measured crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) with the calculated ET0, i.e., Kc = ET/ET0. The crop\ncoefﬁcient differs\
    \ widely between crops and among growth stages for the same crop. This Kc factor\n\
    serves as an aggregation of the physical and physiological differences among crops\
    \ and averaged\neffects of evaporation from the soil [98]. Several spatial models\
    \ have been developed for ET estimation,\nwhich showed that accurate spatial ET\
    \ and water-balance models could be of great importance in VRI\napplication [61,99,100].\n\
    4.2. Remote and Proximal Sensing\nBesides crop coefﬁcient and ET, mapping soil\
    \ properties in a ﬁeld, such as ﬁeld capacity and\nroot zone water availability,\
    \ is also important for site-speciﬁc water management [101]. Information\nregarding\
    \ variability of plant conditions such as water stress, growth parameters, ground\
    \ cover can also\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n9 of 21\nprovide a basis for VRI. Remote\
    \ sensing using various sensors and platforms is often used to estimate\nseveral\
    \ soil and crop characteristics during the growing season that can provide important\
    \ information\nin decision support. The near-real-time information from several\
    \ sensors, such as spectral reﬂectance\nsensors and infrared thermometers have\
    \ been used to develop ﬁeld maps for water, vegetation,\nand nutrient status [50,102].\
    \ Remotely sensed images can be useful in determining leaf area index and\nground\
    \ cover for a ﬁeld and thus help in yield forecasting [103]. Remote sensing can\
    \ also help estimate\nET more reliably from individual ﬁelds [104]. A study in\
    \ Nebraska evaluated remote-sensing-based\nET and a water-balance model for irrigation\
    \ management [105]. In this study, four irrigation treatment\ncombinations were\
    \ tested: VRI based on water-balance model using remote sensing, VRI based on\n\
    water-balance model using neutron probe, uniform irrigation based on neutron-probe\
    \ measurement\nand rainfed. Landsat 7 and 8 imageries were used for model input\
    \ in a remote sensing-based\nmodel, which included reﬂectance-based crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for ET estimation. The result showed\nthat remote sensing-based treatment had\
    \ the greatest mean prescribed irrigation, which was attributed\nto water-balance\
    \ drift. The study concluded that the remote-sensing-based model might perform\n\
    better when coupled with SWC measurement. This can be helpful in site-speciﬁc\
    \ management of\nirrigation water, as well as weedicide, pesticide and other chemicals\
    \ [106–108]. Various indices\nderived from thermal and multispectral images, such\
    \ as crop water stress index (CWSI), perpendicular\nvegetation index (PVI), normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NDVI) and photochemical reﬂectance\nindex (PRI),\
    \ can predict soil or plant water status and drought stress as a basis for site-speciﬁc\
    \ water\nmanagement [109,110]. Use of digital infrared thermography to measure\
    \ canopy temperature can\nhelp producers to detect early crop water stress and\
    \ avoid yield declines as well as saving water\nwith site-speciﬁc irrigation management\
    \ and irrigation scheduling [111,112]. Recent improvements in\nremote and proximal\
    \ sensing technologies such as wireless soil moisture sensors and unmanned aerial\n\
    systems (UAS) have increased the efﬁciency for farmers to exercise site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation management.\nIndices derived from high-resolution UAS imagery have\
    \ shown the potential to predict crop water\nstress indicators such as water potential\
    \ and stomatal conductance [113]. Such information can aid in\nimproving irrigation\
    \ efﬁciency, reducing pumping costs, and retaining groundwater. Although soil\n\
    moisture sensors are found to be more proﬁtable in the present context, with the\
    \ increasing number\nof manufacturers and clear regulations, UAS-based sensor\
    \ technology for soil moisture estimation\nis gaining momentum [114]. This explains\
    \ the importance of remote sensing as a low-cost tool to\nimprove water management\
    \ in crops.\n5. Precision Water Management Strategies\nSeveral precision irrigation\
    \ technologies have been developed to improve crop productivity under\nwater-limited\
    \ conditions. However, appropriate precision irrigation strategies are equally\
    \ important for\nincreased efﬁciency and proﬁtability for site-speciﬁc technologies.\
    \ The development and application\nof management zones using spatial and temporal\
    \ information of various agronomic factors have\nbeen practiced for site-speciﬁc\
    \ management for several decades. In recent years, the use of artiﬁcial\nintelligence\
    \ in prescription map development for site-speciﬁc water management is also increasing.\n\
    5.1. Management Zones\nVRI is often implemented in the ﬁeld by dividing it into\
    \ a number of sections, or management\nzones with the aim to save water and other\
    \ inputs together with yield optimization [25]. A management\nzone is a subﬁeld\
    \ area that is relatively homogeneous in soil and topographic attributes. The\
    \ use of\nmanagement zones can be a convenient means to capture the spatial distribution\
    \ of yield-inﬂuencing\nfactors within the season. The information on spatial and\
    \ temporal development of abiotic and\nbiotic stresses can be linked with site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation systems via dynamic prescription maps\nto help producers improve\
    \ irrigation WUE, agricultural sustainability and the environment [102].\nVarious\
    \ factors such as soil properties, landscape attributes, crop properties, sensor-based\
    \ information,\nmanagement practice, weed, and pest management as well as crop\
    \ modeling have been considered\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n10 of 21\nin delineating\
    \ management zones for VRI application since several years [115]. Soil properties\
    \ such\nas soil organic matter, texture, nutrient content, pH, color, soil moisture\
    \ content and water-holding\ncapacities, ECa, etc. have been used effectively\
    \ in management zone delineation [116–119]. Landscape\nattributes such as elevation,\
    \ slope, aspect, curvature, and others have also been an important part\nof management\
    \ zone delineation in several studies [118,120–122]. Numerous studies have used\
    \ crop\nproperties such as yield maps and ground-based leaf area index to delineate\
    \ management zones\nfor VRI application [116,117,123,124]. The management zones\
    \ delineated based on yield data from\nmultiple years can effectively capture\
    \ nutrient variability in the ﬁeld [125]. However, the application of\nyield maps\
    \ for site-speciﬁc management can be challenging because spatial and temporal\
    \ variation in\nyield is affected by the interactions among several biotic and\
    \ abiotic factors [126,127]. Information from\nproximal and remote sensing such\
    \ as satellite and airborne imagery, normalized difference vegetation\nindex,\
    \ digital photography, etc. can be a powerful approach for delineation of relative\
    \ productive\nareas [128–131]. The zone information together with early season\
    \ environmental indicators and\ncrop response models can also be used to determine\
    \ the action decisions throughout the season [132].\nSimilarly, the selection\
    \ of factors for management zone delineation is equally important in management\n\
    zone delineation. A study was conducted to compare the site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ with conventional\nuniform irrigation management for potatoes in Idaho [25].\
    \ The available water-holding capacity of soil\nwas used to delineate a 2.9-ha\
    \ ﬁeld into nine management zones. The results showed that six out of\nnine management\
    \ zones produced a higher yield with site-speciﬁc management. However, the study\n\
    suggested that management zones were only based on available SWC and in some management\
    \ cases,\nother non-measured factors unrelated to soil texture or available water\
    \ content could have an impact\non the yield of crops. The study pointed out the\
    \ importance to take into consideration all the known\nfactors affecting yield\
    \ and include them in delineating irrigation management zones for site-speciﬁc\n\
    irrigation management. The optimum number of zones for a ﬁeld depends on the scale\
    \ of the ﬁeld,\neconomical and logistical practicality, and agronomic response\
    \ to irrigation amounts. For example,\nthe quantity and placement of soil moisture\
    \ sensors for determining irrigation amounts may vary\nwith ﬁeld size, cost of\
    \ the sensors and manageability, which, in turn, can inﬂuence the number of\n\
    management zones in the ﬁeld [133].\nThere are several methods to delineate management\
    \ zones, including unsupervised clustering,\nsupervised clustering, user-deﬁned\
    \ thresholds, etc. The clustering technique groups similar data\npoints into different\
    \ classes using algorithms such as k-means, fuzzy k-means, fuzzy c-means [127,134],\n\
    Ward′s method, and Jenk’s optimization procedure [125]. The appropriate factors\
    \ to be considered for\nmanagement zone delineation could be prioritized using\
    \ several methods such as principal component\nanalysis (PCA) [118]. It is equally\
    \ important to determine the number of optimum management\nzones for the ﬁeld\
    \ and their production and economic justiﬁcation [20]. A software program (MZA\n\
    software [135]) was developed for creating management zones using the fuzzy k-means\
    \ method.\nThis program determines the appropriate number of zones for a ﬁeld\
    \ by evaluating the clustering\nresults. Many studies have used management zones\
    \ for VRI and other site-speciﬁc crop management.\nFor example, a study conducted\
    \ in a 4.8-ha ﬁeld in Colorado assessed the effectiveness of ECa in\ncharacterizing\
    \ the spatial distribution of soil water [136]. This study found that SWC was\
    \ signiﬁcantly\ndifferent among different ECa derived management zones using MZA\
    \ software. This justiﬁes the\nimportance of characterizing management zones for\
    \ site-speciﬁc water management.\n5.2. Development of Site-Speciﬁc Water Management\
    \ Strategies\nTo enable the VRI technology in practice, the irrigation management\
    \ strategy is equally important.\nThe use of technology in the ﬁeld may not always\
    \ be effective in terms of ﬁnal yield or proﬁtability.\nFor example, research\
    \ has shown that the use of VRI technology may not be cost effective where\nthere\
    \ is high rainfall throughout the growing season [29]. Several strategies could\
    \ be applied to\nsave water and energy in the ﬁeld to gain yield beneﬁts in the\
    \ ﬁeld. Some of the strategies include\nskipping irritation in non-cropped areas,\
    \ planting different crops in the same ﬁeld, rainfall harvesting\nAgronomy 2019,\
    \ 9, 87\n11 of 21\nin areas with high water-holding capacity, and lowering irrigation\
    \ to areas with low water use (ET) [46].\nNew irrigation strategies such as modifying\
    \ the current irrigation system for site-speciﬁc water and\nchemical applications\
    \ are required to sustain modern irrigated agricultural cropping systems [102].\n\
    Management strategies including placement and timing are crucial in optimizing\
    \ irrigation\nthroughout the growing season. About 9%−19% of irrigation water\
    \ savings were achieved with VRI\ncompared to the uniform application in a research\
    \ conducted in variable soil, which was possible\nwith several strategies such\
    \ as withholding irrigation during speciﬁc growth stages and in particular,\n\
    non-cropped areas of the ﬁeld [137]. Further, the study suggests that areas where\
    \ the optimized or\nincreased irrigation does not produce an increase in yield,\
    \ less water can be applied while the areas\nwith high yield potential can be\
    \ applied optimum irrigation and gain higher returns. A study showed\nthat restricting\
    \ irrigation during the peak water-demand time of cotton (80−100 days after planting)\n\
    from 100% to 60% of potential ET conserves 2.6 inches of water [138]. The VRI\
    \ trial was conducted\nin three farms in New Zealand to compare the VRI to uniform\
    \ rate irrigation (URI) [139]. The URI\ntreatments were provided with the same\
    \ level of irrigation at the same time as the most drought-prone\nsoil zone, but\
    \ VRI treatment was achieved by either delaying the irrigation or reducing the\
    \ amount\nand intensity of irrigation comparing to that with a drought-prone area.\
    \ The results showed that there\nwas a two to three-fold difference in total available\
    \ water-holding capacity at each site, which justiﬁed\nthe decision to use VRI\
    \ systems. Although the study found no signiﬁcant impact of VRI on crop yield,\n\
    water savings of 8 to 36% were achieved in three sites with less drainage. Hence,\
    \ critical management\nstrategies adopted in a decision support system that uses\
    \ real-time monitoring and feedback to\nirrigation control make water conversation\
    \ possible [28]. Deﬁcit irrigation (DI) is a complementary\nmethod that uses irrigation\
    \ scheduling at strategic times of less critical growth for irrigation water\n\
    conservation. In this method, irrigation is applied during the drought-sensitive\
    \ growth stages of a\ncrop. During less drought-sensitive stages, irrigation is\
    \ applied based on rainfall and availability of\nwater for maintenance [140].\n\
    The use of technology and strategies can also affect the level of proﬁt achieved\
    \ from the VRI\ntechnology itself. A study was conducted in a 20-ha wheat ﬁeld\
    \ in Southern Alberta, Canada on\nmodeling economic returns at different levels\
    \ of control [141]. A total of 62 management scenarios\nwere studied, including\
    \ (1) no irrigation, (2) uniform irrigation management, (3) speed control with\n\
    two angular increments of 2 and 10 degrees, and (4) zone control with a combination\
    \ of two angular\nincrements and a different number of independent irrigation\
    \ zones, ranging from 2 to 30. The study\nconcluded that the highest proﬁt was\
    \ obtained with 30 control zones. However, considering the cost\nof the technology,\
    \ the case of ten control zones along the central pivot system was found to be\
    \ the\nmost proﬁtable. Hence, it is essential to set forth effective site-speciﬁc\
    \ water management strategies for\nincreased agricultural sustainability and proﬁtability.\n\
    5.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Deep Learning\nExisting site-speciﬁc management\
    \ utilizes several control strategies such mathematical modeling\nof crop yield\
    \ or the plant-soil-atmosphere environment, optimizing irrigation application\
    \ timing,\nlearning sensor feedback to control the site-speciﬁc ﬂow of water as\
    \ well as using predictive model\ncontrol that executes a model repeatedly to\
    \ determine optimum input. The use of artiﬁcial intelligence\nor neuro-dynamic\
    \ programming that integrates machine learning to determine the water application\n\
    parameter for optimized irrigation is also increasing [50,142–145]. Hyperspectral\
    \ remote sensing\nimaging along with machine learning has been in use in agricultural\
    \ industry, and it is estimated that\nmachine learning/deep learning-based classiﬁcation\
    \ has a signiﬁcant potential for high-dimensional\nbig data produced in agriculture\
    \ [146].\n6. Impact of Variable-Rate Irrigation\nVRI can be highly effective in\
    \ reducing water use and increasing water use efﬁciency (WUE) of\ncrops [147].\
    \ A review on VRI across different crop and weather regimes of the world concluded\
    \ that\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n12 of 21\nVRI could save 10%−15% of water [28].\
    \ A study in a 7-ha sugar beet ﬁeld in Germany reported that\n13% of water was\
    \ saved compared to the uniform application [15]. This was achieved by utilizing\n\
    stored soil moisture and in-season precipitation. In a study in New Zealand comparing\
    \ VRI with\nconventional irrigation system, 9%−19% irrigation water was saved\
    \ with VRI in pasture and corn\nﬁelds, which in turn reduced nitrogen leaching\
    \ [137]. Similarly, the application of VRI by manipulating\nits several components\
    \ can reduce water runoff by avoiding excess water application in the ﬁeld [28].\n\
    At a large scale, water pumpage and use can be reduced by adopting VRI. A geospatial\
    \ method has\nbeen provided for potential VRI technology adopters to achieve potential\
    \ water savings in the ﬁeld\nusing freely available datasets such as soil survey\
    \ data from the Natural Resources Conservation\nService (NRCS) [48]. In this study,\
    \ the difference in application depth between conventional irrigation\nand VRI\
    \ was estimated based on root zone available water capacity. The undepleted soil\
    \ water from\neach management zone was mined using prescription maps allowing\
    \ 50% depletion. VRI in this\nstudy resulted in a reduction in irrigation depth\
    \ of up to 18 mm, pumping reductions, and improved\nwater distribution throughout\
    \ the ﬁeld. In addition, higher VRI control resolution increased energy\nsavings.\
    \ VRI was found to reduce pumpage in more than 13% of center pivot irrigated ﬁelds\
    \ by 25 mm\nper year compared to the conventional irrigation system in Nebraska\
    \ [99]. Another study for VRI\nmanagement based on soil water spatial variation\
    \ was conducted in a 1.64-ha ﬁeld with center pivot to\nunderstand the yield and\
    \ water-saving effects of VRI [148]. In this study, the ﬁeld was divided into\
    \ four\nmanagement zones based on available water-holding capacity and each management\
    \ zone was further\ndivided into two sections for VRI and URI management. The\
    \ results from this study indicated that the\nimpact of VRI on water savings within\
    \ zones depended on weather conditions. Water savings with\nVRI management was\
    \ higher for summer maize when the rainfall was high compared to winter wheat\n\
    grown in no-rainfall weather. The study suggests that although VRI management\
    \ had no signiﬁcant\ninﬂuence on crop growth parameters and yield within a management\
    \ zone, managing the zones with\ndifferent available water-holding capacity might\
    \ improve the uniformity of crop growth, maximize\ncrop yield and gain potential\
    \ water savings.\nCompared to the uniform application, VRI increases crop productivity.\
    \ The results comparing\nthe water productivity of sorghum and corn showed that\
    \ there was more than 20% increase in water\nproductivity for both crops using\
    \ VRI [35]. Another study conducted in a 4-ha ﬁeld, VRI resulted in\na signiﬁcant\
    \ difference in corn yield in a dry year. However, the results were not signiﬁcant\
    \ for the\nyear when the rain was sufﬁcient [100]. Another study was conducted\
    \ in New Zealand to understand\nthe impact of variable-rate irrigation based on\
    \ soil moisture status [139]. This study showed that\nalthough the yield was not\
    \ signiﬁcantly different among different irrigation treatments, water savings\n\
    of 27–55 mm was achieved by limiting irrigation in soil with adequate plant available\
    \ water and\nnon-irrigating poorly drained, wet soil zones. VRI has been found\
    \ effective to reduce water and\nenergy use even in humid areas of the world with\
    \ uncertain and unpredictable rainfall [40]. This study\nshowed that potential\
    \ water savings of 20mm/year could be achieved using VRI in these regions.\nHowever,\
    \ the feasibility and effectiveness of VRI depend on the magnitude of the ﬁeld,\
    \ crop under\nconsideration, weather and the underlying ﬁeld properties [24,25,40].\
    \ The accurate determination of\nwater requirement and its management is crucial\
    \ for crop yield stabilization and improved average\nyield [53]. Several VRI research\
    \ projects attempt to enhance the control scenarios as well as model and\nproduction\
    \ function to improve water savings and reduce pumpage [40,99,141,149,150]. Further,\
    \ it is\nnecessary to understand the impact of soil water availability on crop\
    \ growth to manage irrigation in\nspatial and temporal scales using variable-rate\
    \ irrigation technologies and appropriate strategies.\n7. Challenges and Research\
    \ Requirements\nData collection and management tools, such as yield monitors,\
    \ sensors and sensing systems,\nGIS, GNSS, and decision support systems are available\
    \ today to enable site-speciﬁc management of\nirrigation water for optimized crop\
    \ production. Steady development in irrigation control systems\nprovides the user\
    \ with various options to implement VRI. Many studies have investigated and\n\
    Agronomy 2019, 9, 87\n13 of 21\ndeveloped irrigation strategies, prescription\
    \ methodologies, and proﬁtability optimization involved in\nVRI. However, there\
    \ are some challenges in the implementation and application of this technology.\n\
    Further research and development are required to improve the understanding, implementation,\n\
    and adoption of precision water management strategies and technologies.\n(1)\n\
    Research is required on the integration of technology, agronomy, and proﬁtability\
    \ with VRI\nAlthough several studies have reported the potential of adopting VRI\
    \ system to optimize crop\nproduction and proﬁtability [29,70], some studies conducted\
    \ in experimental ﬁelds have concluded\nthat the VRI technology may not be economically\
    \ viable for all crops under all growing conditions\nand environments [24]. This\
    \ is not because of the yield-related beneﬁt, but due to the cost of the\ntechnology\
    \ itself. For example, research conducted in a 12.6-ha ﬁeld in southwest Georgia\
    \ showed that\nVRI generated $16/ha more return than URI. Although this return\
    \ is not signiﬁcant for this small ﬁeld,\nthe study suggested that proﬁts could\
    \ be ampliﬁed for large ﬁelds and beneﬁt farmers [151]. From the\nagronomic perspective,\
    \ a better understanding of the extremities of ﬁeld variability and how it affects\n\
    crop yield is needed for the effective implementation of new technologies [152].\
    \ In an experiment\nconducted in Tennessee, the same level of irrigation did not\
    \ result in the same cotton lint yield in all\nparts of the ﬁeld due to differences\
    \ in texture and available water-holding capacity [153]. In some cases,\nthe incorporation\
    \ of other crops in a rotation in VRI can make this technology economically viable\
    \ [25].\nAdditionally, most of the VRI studies are concentrated on the control\
    \ scenarios of VRI [149,150].\nAlthough a few studies [40,99,141] determined water\
    \ and energy savings using VRI due to managerial\nlimitations, they were either\
    \ based on some model and production functions or arbitrary in irrigation\nrate\
    \ determination. Hence, there is a need for a comprehensive study on VRI integrating\
    \ the agronomic,\ntechnical and managerial aspects of VRI to determine its proﬁtability,\
    \ sustainability, and adoptability\nfor various conditions.\n(2)\nOn-farm and\
    \ whole-ﬁeld research\nProducers are more likely to adopt VRI if the beneﬁts are\
    \ shown on a “real farm.” Most of the\nprevious studies on VRI were conducted\
    \ in experimental ﬁelds or in small ﬁelds that cannot represent\nthe commercial\
    \ farming practice [28]. Experimental design and implementation in large ﬁelds\
    \ are\nchallenging. This type of research requires close communication and collaborative\
    \ management\nbetween the researcher and the farm owner to ensure the alignment\
    \ of management practices and study\ngoals. Acquiring data and information from\
    \ large ﬁelds is costly and time-consuming. In addition,\nthe statistical analysis\
    \ of on-farm data is challenging due to the lack of adequate tools that integrates\n\
    classical statistical methods and spatial analysis. This creates challenges in\
    \ the understanding of the\nrelationship between crop growth and its environment\
    \ in site-speciﬁc irrigation. More on-farm studies\nare needed to provide information\
    \ for practical VRI applications. In addition, insufﬁcient recognition\nof temporal\
    \ variation and environmental impact are several other factors that hinder the\
    \ adoption of\nprecision agriculture technology [9].\n(3)\nPrescription map development\n\
    The majority of previous studies for prescription maps (management zone delineation)\
    \ are for\nvariable-rate application of fertilizers and seeds and are static [20,133].\
    \ Limited research has addressed\nthe need for dynamic prescription map development\
    \ that could incorporate seasonal changes in\ncrop growth and conditions [133].\
    \ More research is required to evaluate VRI prescription maps or\nmanagement zone\
    \ development integrating different soil and crop characteristics under different\n\
    environments. Use of remote and proximal sensing such as infrared sensors, near-infrared\
    \ and thermal\nimages, along with weather data can provide information on crop,\
    \ soil, and environmental conditions\nin irrigation scheduling and developing\
    \ dynamic prescription maps [97]. Further research needs to\ninvestigate how to\
    \ integrate such data and information to evaluate the effectiveness of such prescription\n\
    maps during the growing season.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n14 of 21\n(4)\nOptimal\
    \ spatial and temporal scale\nFew studies have evaluated the appropriate spatial\
    \ and temporal scales for VRI application.\nMany studies have explored the use\
    \ of sensors in acquiring information for modeling crop\nevapotranspiration, SWC,\
    \ irrigation needs including the nutrient requirements [97,105,152,154,155].\n\
    Most of these studies indicated the high potential of remote and proximal sensing\
    \ technologies in\nunderstanding spatial and temporal variations in crop growth\
    \ conditions in the ﬁeld. Temporal\nvariability in soil water status and crop\
    \ growing conditions require dynamic adjustment of irrigation\namount and spatial\
    \ distribution. Therefore, simulation models or on-farm studies might be considered\n\
    to assess the effectiveness of VRI at different spatial and temporal scales.\n\
    (5)\nComprehensive decision support tools\nPrecision irrigation management requires\
    \ data and information from crop growth conditions,\nsoil physical and chemical\
    \ properties, weather factors, and the interaction among these factors.\nEffective\
    \ implementation of precision irrigation requires a comprehensive decision support\
    \ system to\nprocess and integrate different layers of data and information [48].\
    \ The challenge for the application\nof VRI still exists in the lack of user-friendly\
    \ decision support tools such as for developing dynamic\nprescription maps [105].\
    \ Several decision support systems such as AgriDSS are available [16,156],\nbut\
    \ producers are reluctant to use them to their full potential due to their complexity.\
    \ Also, these tools\nare based on what scientists and developers consider as necessary\
    \ knowledge that should be\nimplemented in the decision support system. However,\
    \ in a real-world situation, they fail to utilize\nthe implicit knowledge of farmers\
    \ and address their needs. The complexity, lack of observability and\nconﬁdence,\
    \ poor user interface design, lack of incentive to learn are some of the other\
    \ reasons behind\nthe hindrance of adoption of different decision support tools\
    \ [16]. The system or tool should help the\nuser decide where to apply how much\
    \ irrigation water at various crop growth stages to achieve the\nhighest proﬁt\
    \ based on the regional climate conditions and cropping systems.\n(6)\nIntegrating\
    \ VRI with other inputs\nFew studies have integrated variable-rate application\
    \ of nutrients with water. Crop yield response\nto water and N are not the same\
    \ at different parts of the ﬁeld [157], indicating the need for studying\nthe\
    \ interaction of water and fertilizer in variable-rate irrigation. Site-speciﬁc\
    \ application of N together\nwith irrigation using remote sensing can help reduce\
    \ N inputs by 50% and leaching by 85% without\nreducing yields [155]. Further\
    \ studies are needed to investigate the interaction between VRI fertilizers\n\
    and other inputs to improve the efﬁciencies of water and fertilizers while reducing\
    \ the environmental\nimpact of fertilizer application and enhancing production\
    \ sustainability.\nAuthor Contributions: The authors contributed equally to the\

    In 1986, two large weighing lysimeters, — one in a peach orchard and the other
    in a grape vineyard — were constructed at the UC Kearney Research and Extension
    Center as a joint effort between UC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture''s
    Water Management Laboratory. Hourly weight changes in the lysimeters have been
    used to measure the daily and seasonal water use of trees and vines for nearly
    20 years. Peaches and grapes exhibit similar seasonal crop-coefficient patterns
    that start as low as 0.1 in March, increase linearly until early July and then
    remain constant between 1.1 and 1.2 for the remainder of the season (provided
    the plants remain disease-, pest-and stress-free). The linear increase phase is
    proportional to the increase in canopy light-interception and leaf area. These
    relationships have facilitated modeling to predict crop evapotranspiration under
    various conditions. The peach lysimeter has also been useful for studying the
    effects of water stress on tree water use and for evaluating other methods of
    estimating water use. Full text Water is a critical resource in agriculture, and
    supplying the right amount is essential for healthy plants and optimum productivity.
    With insufficient water, plants become stressed and unproductive, and eventually
    die. With an excess, they can suffer from diseases, nutritional disorders and
    waterlogged soils. The most accurate way to estimate water use by crops is with
    a weighing lysimeter, which measures water loss from the plants and surrounding
    soil. A weighing lysimeter is simply a large “flower pot” resting on a sensitive,
    underground scale. Short-term weight loss from the system is almost entirely due
    to water transpired through leaves or evaporated from the soil surface. UC pomology
    specialist R. Scott Johnson, above, adjusts the balance beam in one of two lysimeters
    constructed at the UC Kearney Research and Extension Center. These rare research
    tools are large and expensive to maintain, which is why so few of them exist around
    the world. For 20 years they have been the most precise method of understanding
    daily and seasonal water use in the San Joaquin Valley. Every hour soil evaporation
    and plant transpiration — crop “evapotranspiration” — is recorded. When a threshold
    value is exceeded, the trees or vines growing in the lysimeters are automatically
    irrigated. While this technique is generally considered one of the most reliable
    because it is simple and direct (Aboukhaled et al. 1981), weighing lysimeters
    are expensive to install and maintain, so relatively few have been constructed
    around the world, especially to study perennial trees and vines. At the UC Kearney
    Research and Extension Center (KREC), we have had two of these instruments for
    nearly 20 years. They have been particularly useful for determining patterns of
    tree and vine crop coefficients, studying water-stress effects on water use, and
    evaluating other techniques for estimating water use. Lysimeter and field design
    In 1986, two large weighing lysimeters were constructed at KREC as a joint effort
    between UC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture''s Water Management Laboratory.
    Each lysimeter consists of an underground chamber that houses a balance-beam weighing
    system constructed by Fred Lourence (Precision Lysimeters, Red Bluff, Calif.)
    upon which rests a rectangular box measuring 6.5 feet wide by 13 feet long by
    6.5 feet deep (Phene et al. 1991; Williams et al. 2003b). In constructing the
    underground chamber, soil was removed in 6-inch increments so it could be replaced
    in the box at approximately the same depth as the surrounding soil. In spring
    1987, two peach trees were planted in one lysimeter and two grape vines were planted
    in the other, and in each case the surrounding 3 acres were planted to the same
    variety and spacing. The grape variety was ‘Thompson Seedless’ (clone 2A) with
    7-feet-by-11.5-feet spacing. The peach variety was initially ‘O’Henry’ (late-July
    harvest) on ‘Nemaguard’ rootstock, with 6-feet-by-16-feet spacing. In 1997, the
    mature ‘O’Henry’ trees were removed from the lysimeter and surrounding orchard
    and replaced in 1999 with ‘Crimson Lady’ (late-May harvest) peaches, which were
    also on ‘Nemaguard’ rootstock at the same spacing. Fig. 1. Hourly crop evapotranspiration
    (ET) on June 9, 1996, as measured by the Kearney grape and peach lysimeters. Reference
    ETo was obtained from a nearby CIMIS weather station. Each lysimeter has two separate
    irrigation systems, one below and the other above the ground. The underground
    irrigation systems are 12 inches and 24 inches deep in the peach lysimeter, and
    16 inches deep in the grape lysimeter. Each underground system has 1-gallon-per-hour
    (gal/hr) emitters every 12 inches on either side of the plants. The aboveground
    irrigation systems consist of a single in-row line on or above the soil surface.
    The grape lysimeter''s system is suspended 16 inches aboveground and has 1 gal/hr
    in-line drip emitters every 12 inches. The peach lysimeter''s aboveground system
    had a 3.5-foot-diameter circle of ten 0.5 gal/hr drip emitters every 12 inches
    around each tree when planted with ‘O’Henry’, and a single 26 gal/hr emitter that
    fills a 4-foot diameter basin around each tree when planted with ‘Crimson Lady’.
    Irrigation water is supplied by two 80-gallon polyethylene tanks suspended from
    and included in the total mass of the lysimeters. In addition, the lysimeters
    can control the low-volume irrigation systems in the surrounding fields. The vineyard
    is irrigated by a single line of drip tubing suspended 16 inches above the soil
    with 1 gal/hr in-line emitters every 12 inches. Each tree in the peach orchard
    has a 6.7 gal/hr spray emitter with about a 10-foot radius. The lysimeters have
    been in continuous operation since 1987. Every hour, the lysimeter boxes (including
    soil, plants and suspended irrigation tanks) are automatically weighed to determine
    water loss, which includes both soil evaporation and plant transpiration and is
    often referred to as “crop evapotranspiration,” or ETc. The values are recorded
    with a data logger (Campbell Scientific Instruments, 21 XL Micrologger, Logan,
    Utah) and the mass change is compared to a threshold value. When this value is
    exceeded, the trees or vines are automatically irrigated. Generally, low threshold
    values have been used so that multiple irrigations per day are called for in the
    summer. This maintains soil moisture content close to field capacity and minimizes
    any water stress effects. At midnight each day, the water tanks are automatically
    refilled to a preset level, and the new lysimeter mass is set as the baseline
    for the next day. Hourly reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) values are calculated
    by a modified Penman equation using weather data collected from a nearby CIMIS
    (California Irrigation Management Information System) weather station. This equation
    was developed by scientists to estimate grass ET and is used as a standard around
    the world. Daily summed ETc values are divided by daily summed ETo to provide
    a crop coefficient (Kc) for each day. Once a seasonal pattern of crop coefficients
    has been established, this information can be used to guide irrigation amounts.
    The crop coefficient multiplied by ETo for a given time period gives an ETc value
    for that same period of time. Then, after adjusting for irrigation efficiency,
    the amount of water to apply can be determined. Fig. 2. Seasonal pattern of crop
    coefficients for mature grapevines (1996) and peach trees (average from 2001 to
    2003) as calculated from lysimeters. Each data point is a weekly average. Regression
    lines are for data collected from bud-break through early July (about day 180).
    Tree and vine crop coefficients During normal midsummer days in central California,
    with hot temperatures and cloudless skies, the lysimeters generate smooth daily
    ETc graphs with minimal noise (fig. 1). During periods of unsettled weather, the
    lysimeter output is more variable from one hour to the next, but has generally
    followed the same pattern as ETo, resulting in consistent day-to-day crop-coefficient
    values. The typical seasonal crop-coefficient pattern of mature plants for both
    peaches and grapes starts as low as 0.1 to 0.2 early in the spring and increases
    steadily until early July (fig. 2) (Ayars et al. 2003; Williams et al. 2003a).
    Grape is delayed somewhat compared to peach because it is more severely pruned
    and takes longer to develop its canopy. For the remainder of the season, the crop
    coefficients for both crops leveled off at values between 1.1 and 1.2. The seasonal
    pattern of young trees and vines has also been determined (Johnson et al. 2002;
    Williams et al. 2003b). The Kearney lysimeter research has elucidated factors
    affecting the water use of trees and vines, allowing for the better estimation
    of crop coefficients under conditions different from those in the lysimeter fields.
    One factor that has clearly been demonstrated is between canopy light interception
    and tree water use (Johnson et al. 2000), or leaf area and vine water use (Williams
    et al. 2003a). This relationship holds true for both young and mature trees and
    vines. The steadily increasing crop coefficients throughout the spring (fig. 2)
    are primarily due to the tree or vine''s expanding canopy and its increasing interception
    of light. Left and center, construction of the two large weighing lysimeters at
    KREC began in 1986. Each lysimeter consists of an underground chamber that houses
    a balance-beam weighing system with a rectangular “flower pot” measuring 6.5 feet
    wide by 13 feet long by 6.5 feet deep. Right, researchers enter the completed
    lysimeter. The Kearney peach lysimeter yielded a crop-coefficient pattern (Ayars
    et al. 2003) distinctly different from previously published values for deciduous
    fruit crops (Snyder et al. 1989). The published values, which were derived primarily
    from almond trees, start at about 0.5 in the spring and increase to peak values
    of less than 1.0. Thus, the lysimeter-derived peach crop-coefficient pattern starts
    much lower initially in the spring, but by midsummer reaches a higher plateau.
    These differences can be attributed to differences in the canopy development of
    peach and almond trees. Almonds are minimally pruned and quickly develop a spur
    canopy (many short shoots), which has high light-interception in the spring. In
    contrast, peach trees are more heavily pruned and require extensive shoot growth
    before they develop a full canopy. These differences indicate that separate crop-coefficient
    values may be needed for different deciduous fruit-tree species and grapevines,
    depending on pruning and canopy development parameters. The maximum midsummer
    crop-coefficient values of 1.1 to 1.2 are greater than those reported in the past
    for trees and vines. However, these values are not out of line with recent reports
    on a wide range of crop plants including beans, corn, cotton, sugar cane and pistachios
    (Allen et al. 1998). In addition, while other researchers have reported that crop
    coefficients decrease toward the end of the growing season (Williams et al. 2003a),
    these decreases were due to insect pest defoliation (Daane and Williams 2003)
    or irrigation cutoff (Ayars et al. 2003). Such late-season declines in crop coefficients
    were not observed in either lysimeter as long as the plants were kept healthy,
    free of pests and well watered. Therefore, even though there may be horticultural
    or pest management reasons for cutting back irrigation water at the end of the
    season, there does not appear to be a physiological basis for it. The Kearney
    lysimeter research has clearly demonstrated that as long as they are kept healthy,
    peach trees and grapevines are capable of using significant amounts of water throughout
    the growing season. However, it is important to emphasize that the lysimeters
    measure water use under conditions of high soil-water availability, which are
    not necessarily the best conditions for optimum production, tree health and fruit
    quality. A study in the grape lysimeter vineyard showed that yields were maximized
    when moderate water stress was imposed by limiting water applications throughout
    the season to between 60% and 80% of lysimeter water use (full ETc) (Williams
    2000). Likewise, there are many fruit-tree studies showing the benefits of imposing
    moderate water stress at different periods of the growing season. Ongoing research
    is needed to develop deficit-irrigation (less than full ETc) management strategies
    that optimize fruit quality, plant health and long-term productivity. To aid in
    irrigation management, a model to predict peach-tree water use has been developed
    using lysimeters to quantify the relationships among light interception, soil
    evaporation, tree dimensions and tree water use (Johnson et al. 2002, 2004). Water
    stress and water use The lysimeters have also been useful for evaluating how water
    stress affects various parameters, particularly water use. In 1996, the peach
    lysimeter was subjected to a 3-week drying cycle and during that time frequent
    measurements were made of soil water content, predawn leaf water-potential and
    midday stem water-potential (Mata et al. 1999). Water potential is measured with
    a pressure chamber and basically indicates the tension of water in the leaf. All
    three parameters showed strong correlations with tree water use. For soil water
    content, tree water use started to decline when the available water content decreased
    by 20% in the top 33 inches of soil, and then declined steadily as the water content
    continued to decrease. For predawn leaf water-potential and midday stem water-potential
    there was a continual decline in water use across all values, suggesting that
    either measurement could be useful in determining how well irrigation is supplying
    full crop ETc and in assessing tree water stress. Similar relationships have also
    been found for grapevines (Williams and Araujo 2002). A second study of more moderate
    water stress was conducted in the peach lysimeter in 2002. Three short-term drying
    cycles of about 1 week were imposed during 3-week periods in early June and again
    in late July. During each cycle, daily measurements were made of midday stem water-potential.
    As in the 1996 study, there was a linear decline in tree water use with decreasing
    midday stem water-potential values (fig. 3). Absolute water use was higher in
    late July than early June because of greater leaf area. However, the slope of
    the relationship was similar for both of these periods as well as during the 1996
    study, which suggests midday stem water-potential might be a consistent tool for
    irrigation management in peach trees. Indeed, this measurement has proven to be
    useful both for predicting water stress and for helping schedule irrigation for
    a range of tree and nut species in California (Shackel et al. 1997). Fig. 3. Relationship
    between peach tree crop-coefficient (Kc = ETc/ETo) and midday stem water-potential
    (MSWP) for two periods of three dry-down cycles (no irrigation for 5 to 7 days)
    in 2002. MSWP is expressed in units of mega-pascals (MPa), a measure of water
    tension in the plant. Methods for estimating water use Since a lysimeter is the
    most precise technique for measuring ETc, its output can be compared with that
    of other less expensive methods for validation. The peach lysimeter has shown
    that two such methods are inaccurate but that others may be promising. The two
    inaccurate methods are the heat balance technique for estimating sap flow (Shackel
    et al. 1992) and the use of leaf-to-air temperature differences, as measured by
    an infrared sensor to estimate stress (Medawar 1991). Promising methods, such
    as the measurement of stem water-potential mentioned above, also include the continuous
    monitoring of diurnal changes in trunk diameter (shrinking and swelling) as an
    irrigation guide (Fereres et al. 1999; Goldhamer et al. 2003). As more techniques
    for estimating water use are developed, such as those involving remote sensing
    or detailed meteorological data, the Kearney lysimeters will be valuable instruments
    for validation purposes. The Kearney lysimeters have been in constant use since
    1987. One lysimeter measures water use in peaches, top, the other ‘Thompson Seedless’
    grapes, bottom. The lysimeters have provided more accurate evapotranspiration
    values for peach trees and grape vines, information necessary in irrigation management
    decisions that ultimately affect plant health and fruit quality. Return to top

    Get rights and content Highlights • The base concepts of soil water balance (SWB)
    models using the dual Kc approach are discussed. • The use of SWB, transient state,
    and crop growth and yield models is discussed. • The SIMDualKc model is taken
    as example and various extensions of the dual Kc are presented. • Trends for real
    time irrigation are discussed, including remote and proximal sensing data assimilation.
    • Future trends are analysed from the perspective of using remote sensing and
    cloud data. Abstract This study reviews soil water balance (SWB) model approaches
    to determine crop irrigation requirements and scheduling irrigation adopting the
    FAO56 method. The Kc-ETo approach is discussed with consideration of baseline
    concepts namely standard vs. actual Kc concepts, as well as single and dual Kc
    approaches. Requirements for accurate SWB and appropriate parameterization and
    calibration are introduced. The one-step vs. the two-step computational approaches
    is discussed before the review of the FAO56 method to compute and partition crop
    evapotranspiration and related soil water balance. A brief review on transient
    state models is also included. Baseline information is concluded with a discussion
    on yields prediction and performance indicators related to water productivity.
    The study is continued with an overview on models development and use after publication
    of FAO24, essentially single Kc models, followed by a review on models following
    FAO56, particularly adopting the dual Kc approach. Features of dual Kc modeling
    approaches are analyzed through a few applications of the SWB model SIMDualKc,
    mainly for derivation of basal and single Kc, extending the basal Kc approach
    to relay intercrop cultivation, assessing alternative planting dates, determining
    beneficial and non-beneficial uses of water by an irrigated crop, and assessing
    the groundwater contribution to crop ET in the presence of a shallow water table.
    The review finally discusses the challenges placed to SWB modeling for real time
    irrigation scheduling, particularly the new modeling approaches for large scale
    multi-users application, use of cloud computing and adopting the internet of things
    (IoT), as well as an improved wireless association of modeling with soil and plant
    sensors. Further challenges refer to the use of remote sensing energy balance
    and vegetation indices to map Kc, ET and crop water and irrigation requirements.
    Trends are expected to change research issues relative to SWB modeling, with traditional
    models mainly used for research while new, fast-responding and multi-users models
    based on cloud and IoT technologies will develop into applications to the farm
    practice. Likely, the Kc-ETo will continue to be used, with ETo from gridded networks,
    re-analysis and other sources, and Kc data available in real time from large databases
    and remote sensing. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Crop

    demand and supply in agriculture has driven the search for new equilibria through
    adopting modern technologies and management tools to optimize irrigation water
    use (Pereira et al., 2009; Pereira, 2017; Jovanovic et al., 2020). The successful
    use of these tools depends, however, upon their adaptation to prevailing social,
    economic, institutional, climatic, soil and other environmental conditions. Reducing
    the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change, and ultimately decreasing
    the risks associated to food security, requires integrated and sustainable water
    management, including the adaptation of cropping systems and management practices
    adopting an efficient use of both rainfall and irrigation water. The need for
    such sustainable water management practices is particularly critical considering
    the steady increase of global population and the limitations on availability of
    natural resources, particularly in vulnerable agricultural areas where water scarcity
    is of great importance (Smith, 2000; Pereira, 2017). Sustainable water management
    at farm level assumes an enormous relevance, namely in terms of adopting adequate
    irrigation schedules, that should lead to optimal yields and agricultural and
    irrigation practices that allow reducing but optimizing water use, particularly
    non-beneficial ones (Pereira et al., 2009, 2012; Jovanovic et al., 2020). Numerous
    irrigation scheduling simulation models have been produced and made available
    to support irrigation decision-making since the 80’s as reported in various international
    conferences (ASAE, 1981, 1985, 1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995;
    Ragab et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1996). The reported irrigation scheduling models
    were often based upon crop evapotranspiration and yield-water relations proposed
    in FAO manuals 24 and 33 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977; Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979).
    Reported soil water balance (SWB) models include steady state and transient state
    models. Steady state models solve the law of conservation of mass within a selected
    time step, generally a day, while transient state models contain the time variable
    explicitly and computations refer to the fluxes of water within and through the
    boundaries of the control volume of soil. The latter, highly exigent in terms
    of data and using mechanistic approaches to simulate soil water processes, often
    include mechanistic sub-models to simulate plant growth, predict crop yields as
    influenced by various environmental factors, and to assess the transport of salt,
    chemicals and pollutants that impact farm water use and sustainability. Steady
    state SWB models are less exigent in terms of parameterization and, when properly
    calibrated, are very accurate and easier to use for irrigation scheduling, as
    well as to assess the impact of changing environmental conditions on crops evapotranspiration
    and yield, which may be predicted when the model is associated to, or incorporates
    yield-water functions. A variety of tools, namely using hyperspectral reflectance
    data (Melton et al., 2012; Campos et al., 2017; Pôças et al., 2017; Saadi et al.,
    2018), can be used to support improved irrigation scheduling. More commonly, remote
    sensing vegetation indices may be used in combination with ground data after integration
    in current SWB model approaches (Olioso et al., 2005; Er-Raki et al., 2007; Santos
    et al., 2008; Vazifedoust et al., 2009; Pôças et al., 2015; Thorp et al., 2015;
    Corbari et al., 2019), although adopting a variety of data and integrative solutions.
    The current paper is focusing on steady state SWB simulation models having a known
    software and, mainly, when adopting the FAO56 method to determine ETc from the
    reference ETo and a crop coefficient. Particular attention is given to models
    that adopt the dual Kc approach due to the relevance of determining transpiration
    and soil evaporation, the former consisting of the beneficial consumptive use
    of water. Considering the vast panoply of innovation tools that support sustainable
    water use on farms, the overarching aim of this paper is to provide a review of
    the advances gained in modelling with the FAO56 method in the past two decades.
    The specific objectives of this paper are: (a) to discuss simple approaches to
    steady state water balance modelling in contrast with transient state, mechanistic
    soil water, crop growth and yield models; (b) to provide for an overview on models/software
    used to improve irrigation scheduling and management, with focus on dual Kc modelling
    with consideration of water scarcity and saving; c) to show examples of model
    applications and water use assessment based on the SIMDualKc model; and d) to
    analyze current trends and opportunities, focusing particularly on real time irrigation
    scheduling using modern information technologies. This article consists of various
    Sections. After the current Introduction, Section 2 refers to main concepts and
    calculation approaches of the FAO56 method and includes discussions on the one-step
    approach, transient state modeling, crop growth and yield prediction, and water
    use indicators. Section 3 presents an overview of SWB models aimed at improving
    irrigation scheduling and management, and Section 4 focuses on the dual Kc approaches
    taking the SIMDualKc model as an example for adopting and extending the use of
    the FAO56 dual Kc approach. Section 5 discusses real time irrigation scheduling
    and latest developments, namely related to the applications of remote sensing
    and internet platforms aimed at multi-users, while Section 6 presents the main
    conclusions and future trends. 2. Reference concepts 2.1. Crop evapotranspiration,
    crop water requirements and irrigation requirements The FAO56 method (Allen et
    al., 1998) uses the simple Kc-ETo approach to determine crop evapotranspiration
    as the product of a crop coefficient (Kc) and the grass reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) computed with the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (PM-ETo). The PM-ETo equation
    is derived from the Penman-Monteith (PM) combination equation (Monteith, 1965)
    when it was parameterized for the standard grass reference crop (Allen et al.,
    1994a,b, 1998). As analyzed in the next Section, the PM equation is often used
    for direct calculation of crop ET. The FAO56 method adopted the concept of standard,
    optimal crop conditions as the basis for tabularizing the Kc values, which consisted
    of a main difference to the previous FAO24 method (Pereira et al., 2015a). Thus,
    Kc and ETc in FAO56 refer to potential crop ET rates under optimal, well-watered
    crop production conditions, which often differ from the field and common practice
    where crop conditions are often not optimal due to insufficient or non-uniform
    irrigation, low crop density, less adequate soil and agronomic management and/or
    salinity. The tabulated Kc values in FAO56 or in the review papers (Jensen and
    Allen, 2016; Pereira et al., 2020a,b,d) refer to the standard climate and need
    to be adjusted to the local climate (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). The potential ETc
    as computed from standard Kc values is then replaced by the actual crop ET, ETc
    act, and the standard Kc are replaced by the actual Kc act values, with Kc act
    =Ks Kc where Ks is a stress coefficient due to water deficiency or salinity effects,
    and that can be extended to other cultivation stresses. The concept of dual Kc
    was also adopted in addition to the traditional single one. The single Kc represents
    averaged soil evaporation (Es) and crop transpiration (Tc) from a cropped surface
    for typical frequencies of wetting. However, as noted by in the review by Pereira
    et al. (2015a), the single Kc only represents typical conditions that can vary
    with the wetting frequency by precipitation and irrigation, with the type of irrigation
    practiced and with crop management, namely the inter-row management in row crops.
    Adopting the concept of dual crop coefficient, Kc= Kcb+ Ke, where Kcb is the basal
    crop coefficient representing primarily plant transpiration and Ke is the evaporation
    coefficient that represents the contribution of evaporation from soil to total
    ET, the variation of both Es and Tc are considered independently. In view of this,
    the partition of ETc or ETc act into both these components as proposed by FAO56
    (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a) allows to better represent field and management issues
    when acting differently on Es and Tc. The two stage evaporation model of Ritchie
    (1972) is adopted for the calculation of Ke, which implies performing an independent
    water balance of the evaporation top layer of the soil. The FAO56 method is dealt
    in detail with the very recent reviews and updates of the single and basal crop
    coefficients (Pereira et al., 2020a through d). These reviews also focused on
    the accuracy of diverse ET measurement methods, namely the measurement of changes
    of soil water, eddy covariance, Bowen ratio energy balance, sap-flow, and remote
    sensing vegetation indices (Allen et al., 2011b; Pereira et al., 2020a,b). Crop
    water requirements (CWR, mm) consist of the seasonal amount of water required
    by a crop to achieve its potential production under a given environment. CWR correspond
    to the seasonal potential crop ET (ETc, mm) and added the seasonal leaching requirement
    (LR, mm) required to control effects of soil and water salinity in case of cropping
    in saline soils or when using salty water (including treated wastewater). LR is
    herein considered as part of the CWR given the importance for the crop yield and
    the soil environment to adopt appropriate salinity control. Salinity effects and
    related water management control measures were recently reviewed and discussed
    by Minhas et al. (2020). The net irrigation requirements (NIR, mm) consist of
    the amount of water that needs to be applied to the crop to fully satisfy its
    CWR when the water available through precipitation (P, mm), capillary rise (CR,
    mm) and soil water storage variation (SWvar, mm) are insufficient. NIR relative
    to the crop season, or to any selected time period, is given by the soil water
    balance as: (1) NIR = CWR – (P + SWvar + CR) + DP + RO where, in addition to variables
    previously defined, DP is deep percolation from the soil root zone (mm) and RO
    is runoff (mm), with all variables referring to the time period considered for
    the computation. The gross irrigation requirements (GIR, mm) for any time step
    is given as: (2) where BWUF is the beneficial water use fraction of the applied
    irrigation water (Pereira et al., 2012). BWUF is commonly referred as application
    efficiency when referring to the field, or combined conveyance, distribution and
    application efficiency when considering the operational losses in the conveyance
    and distribution canal and/or conduits systems in addition to application on the
    farm (Burt et al., 1997; Bos et al., 2005; Heermann and Solomon, 2007). 2.2. Computing
    the crop evapotranspiration: the one-step vs. the two-step approaches The Penman-Monteith
    combination equation (Monteith, 1965) may be used for computing crop ET as a one-step
    approach contrarily to the FAO56 method that adopts the two-step Kc-ETo product
    referred above. With the Penman-Monteith combination equation (PM-eq), crop ET
    is computed using the aerodynamic and bulk surface resistances of the crop; differently,
    with the FAO method crop ET is given as the product of the grass reference ET
    (ETo) by the crop coefficient (Kc). Kc represents the integrated differences between
    the considered crop and the reference crop in terms of aerodynamic and bulk surface
    resistances. ETo is derived from the PM combination equation parameterized for
    the grass reference crop. The Penman-Monteith combination equation (Monteith,
    1965) is generally written as (3) where λ is the latent heat of vaporization [MJ
    kg −1], Rn-G is the net balance of energy available at the surface [MJ m-2 d-1],
    (es-ea) represents the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of air at the reference (weather
    measurement) height [kPa], ρ is mean air density [kg m-3], cp is specific heat
    of air at constant pressure [MJ kg-1 °C-1], Δ represents the slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure-temperature relationship at mean air temperature [kPa °C-1], γ
    is the psychometric constant [kPa °C-1], rs is the bulk surface resistance [s
    m-1], and ra is the aerodynamic resistance [s m-1]. The transfer of heat and vapor
    from the evaporative surface into the air in the turbulent layer above a canopy
    is determined by the aerodynamic resistance ra between the surface and the reference
    level above the canopy. That transfer is determined by the wind speed, the height
    of wind speed, air temperature and air humidity measurements, as well as crop
    height and canopy architecture (Perrier, 1982). The surface resistance rs for
    full-cover canopies is often expressed as a function of the stomatal resistance
    of a well-illuminated leaf (rl) and of the effective leaf area index (LAIeff).
    The use of the PM-eq for prediction of crop water requirements is difficult because
    crop height and canopy architecture change throughout the crop cycle, thus changing
    the framework for computing ra and rs, which also changes with rl, thus with leaf
    age and water availability conditions, as well as with LAIeff. In addition, for
    the same crop, ra and rs are influenced by differences among varieties, and crop
    management and irrigation practices. Moreover, resistances rl and rs are influenced
    by the climate and water availability, with rs increasing when soil water availability
    limits ET, the VPD increases and ra is higher; rs decreases when the energy available
    at the surface increases. According to Alves et al. (1998) and Alves and Pereira
    (2000), rs may be expressed as dependent of ra and of the weather variables as
    (4) where β is the Bowen ratio (the ratio between the sensible and latent heat
    fluxes). In this equation β plays the role of a water-stress indicator. This equation
    illustrates that the weather variables interact and their influences are inter-dependent,
    which adds to the difficulties in appropriately selecting rs, thus creating challenges
    in applying the PM-eq or “multi-layer” resistance equations such as the two-source
    Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) equation (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985). Various
    applications of the PM-eq (Eq. 3) are reported in the literature and they show
    that the SWB is not required to consider water stress impacts since the parameterization
    of Eq. 3 takes into account the water stress, e.g. through the consideration of
    stomatal conductance or predawn leaf water potential (Rana et al., 1997, 2001;
    Zhang et al., 2011). However, Ortega-Farias et al. (2004, 2006) performed the
    adjustment to water stress using a normalized soil water factor, similar to the
    stress coefficient Ks described in the next Section, which computation requires
    a simple SWB. A few studies compared the PM-eq with the Kc-ETo approach (Lovelli
    et al., 2008; Irmak and Mutiibwa, 2009). The accuracy of ET estimates depends
    upon the parameterization of the PM-eq. The one-step PM and SW equations are excellent
    for ET simulation but they are basically used in research, while the two-step
    Kc-ETo is used both in research and to support field practice as per the recent
    reviews by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo et al. (2020). The PM-eq (Eq. 3)
    is the base for the PM-ETo equation (Allen et al., 1994a,b, 1998), which for daily
    time steps computation takes the form (5) where, in addition to variables defined
    for Eq. (3), T is mean daily air temperature [°C] and u2 is wind speed [m s−1],
    with measurements at 2 m height. This represents a hypothetical crop with an assumed
    height of 0.12 m having a surface resistance of 70 s m−1 and an albedo of 0.23,
    closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height, actively
    growing and adequately watered. This equation is also parameterized for hourly
    time steps (Allen et al., 2006). Kc represents an integration of the effects of
    three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the reference: crop
    height (affecting roughness and aerodynamic resistance); crop-soil surface resistance
    (related to leaf area, fraction of ground covered by vegetation, leaf age and
    condition, degree of stomatal control, and soil surface wetness); and albedo of
    the crop-soil surface (influenced by the fraction of ground covered by vegetation
    and soil surface wetness). It is defined through the ratio between potential crop
    evapotranspiration (ETc) and the reference ETo, thus (6) Kc = ETc/ETo The challenge,
    therefore, has been to summarize all referred differences relative to the PM-eq
    (Eq. 3) between the considered crop and the reference crop to just one parameter,
    Kc. Although, it was demonstrated (Pereira et al., 1999) that Kc values relate
    intimately with the ratios between ra and rs of the considered crop and the reference
    crop, which makes Kc a non-purely empirical parameter but a deterministic one.
    Though when using the two-step approach to compute crop ET, it is possible to
    achieve highly accurate estimation of crop ET, close to the accuracy obtained
    with the one-step PM-eq, despite the high requirements of the latter in terms
    of parameterization (Ortega-Farias et al., 2006; Lovelli et al., 2008; Irmak and
    Mutiibwa, 2009). 2.3. Soil water balance: the FAO56 method With the objective
    of managing irrigation in the day to day practice, instead of Eq. 1, the daily
    soil water balance applied to the entire root zone (Allen et al., 1998, 2007)
    may be expressed through computing the soil water depletion at the end of every
    day (Dr,i, mm), which is given as: (7) where Dr,i-1 is the root zone depletion
    at the end of previous day i-1 (mm), Pi is precipitation (mm), ROi is runoff (mm),
    Ii is the net irrigation depth that infiltrates the soil (mm), CRi is capillary
    rise from the shallow groundwater table (mm), ETc act,i is the actual crop evapotranspiration
    (mm), and DPi is deep percolation through the bottom of the root zone (mm), with
    all terms referring to day i. ETc act refers to both optimal and suboptimal crop
    and irrigation conditions, i.e., under full or deficit irrigation and/or diverse
    cropping practices. Solving the water balance equation (Eq. 7) requires soil water
    content observations (or their estimation from observed soil matric potential),
    which allow to estimate the root zone depletion Dr. A computational algorithm
    is required to perform a daily SWB, which is based upon the knowledge of soil
    hydraulic properties, the field capacity and wilting point ( FC and θWP, m3 m−3)
    of various soil layers down to the bottom of the root zone. To estimate runoff,
    deep percolation and capillary rise, appropriate algorithms are required as discussed
    by Liu et al. (2006) and Allen et al. (2007). RO, DP and CR cannot be just estimated
    when an accurate SWB is to be performed, thus appropriate computational approaches
    are required, including simple spreadsheet applications to just support irrigation
    scheduling. ETc act is computed as: (8) ETc act=Ks Kc ETo = (Ks Kcb + Ke) ETo
    which requires knowing the standard values of Kc and/or Kcb and the daily estimation
    of the stress coefficient Ks, as well as the adjustment to climate of standard
    Kc mid, Kc end, Kcb mid and Kcb end values (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). Kc ini and
    Kcb ini values have to be determined as recommended by Allen et al. (1998, 2005a,2005b).
    Indicative Kc and Kcb values are tabulated by Allen et al. (1998), Allen and Pereira
    (2009), Jensen and Allen (2016) and updated by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo
    et al. (2020). FAO56 expressed Ks as a linear function of root zone depletion
    Dr when depletion exceeds the readily available water, RAW (mm), in the root zone,
    thus: (9a) (9b) where TAW and RAW are, respectively, the total and readily available
    soil water (mm), and p is the soil water depletion fraction for no stress (Allen
    et al., 1998). TAW is defined as the available soil water stored in the root zone
    with depth zr (m), thus computed as 1000 (θFC - θWP) zr, and RAW corresponds to
    the readily available portion of TAW, thus RAW = p TAW. Updated values for the
    p fractions for vegetable and field crops are tabulated by Pereira et al. (2020a,
    b). The value for Ks due to salinity stress is discussed in FAO56 (Allen et al.,
    1998) and in the review paper by Minhas et al. (2020). Referring to Eq. 9, it
    may be deduced that when no water stress occurs (Ks = 1.0) then θ≥θp, i.e. the
    soil water content is not below the threshold θp, which corresponds to the soil
    water content when the soil water depletion equals the depletion fraction p for
    no stress [0 - 1]. Therefore, θp is assumed as the soil water content threshold
    for no-stress or full irrigation: (10a) A management allowed depletion (MAD) larger
    than p is selected when deficit irrigation is adopted, i.e., when the depletion
    fraction exceeds p. The respective soil water threshold is then θMAD < θp: (10b)
    Examples on using these thresholds are given in Section 4.4. When adopting the
    dual Kc approach, it is required to separately compute Kcb and Ke and two SWB
    are required, the one relative to the root zone for computing transpiration, the
    other relative to the top soil layer, from where evaporation occurs, to compute
    soil evaporation. A spreadsheet calculator was provided in Annex 8 of FAO56 (Allen
    et al., 1998). The computation of Ke is based upon the assumption that evaporation
    from the soil is governed by the amount of water available in the upper soil layer
    from where water evaporates, and the amount of energy available at the soil surface.
    The latter depends upon the portion of wetted ground surface exposed to radiation
    and the portion of total energy consumed by transpiration. Ke is then calculated
    as: (11) where Kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient [0-1], few is the fraction
    of soil surface wetted and exposed to solar radiation, Kcb is the basal crop coefficient
    representing transpiration, and Kc max is the maximum value for Kc following rain
    or irrigation (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a). Kc max depends upon mid-season climate,
    through the wind speed u2 (m s−1) and the minimum relative humidity RHmin (%),
    and upon crop height h (m): (12) where u2 = 2 m s−1 and RHmin = 45 % characterize
    the standard climate (Allen et al., 1998). The depth of water depleted from the
    few fraction of soil wetted and exposed (De, mm), is computed from the daily water
    balance of the upper 0.10 to 0.15 m of the soil as (13) where the subscript i
    refers to the day of estimation, Pi is the precipitation [mm], ROi is runoff [mm],
    Ii is the net irrigation depth [mm] that infiltrates the soil in the wetted fraction
    fw, (Ke ETo/few)i is the evaporation from the few fraction of the exposed soil
    surface [mm], and Ts i is the transpiration from the fw fraction of the evaporating
    soil layer [mm]. When De exceeds the readily evaporable water (REW), the evaporation
    rate decreases in proportion to the remaining water. Therefore, Kr (Eq. 11) is
    calculated as: (14a) (14b) where REW and TEW are respectively the readily and
    total evaporable water in the soil evaporation layer of depth ze (m), which depend
    upon the soil textural and hydraulic characteristics of that soil layer. Further
    details on the water balance of the evaporation layer are discussed by Allen et
    al. (1998, 2005a) and Rosa et al. (2012a, b). When the complete soil surface is
    fully wetted by precipitation or irrigation, the fraction few consists of the
    fraction of ground non-shaded by the vegetation (1-fc), thus few p = 1-fc, where
    fc is the average fraction covered by vegetation [0 – 1.0]. When only a fraction
    of the soil surface is wetted by irrigation, few i = min (1-fc, fw). These differences
    in few, thus in few Kc max (Eq. 11), evidence that it is required to compute separately
    Ke for the cases when rainfall and irrigation fully wet the ground, or when irrigation
    only partially wets the soil, e.g. under drip or furrow irrigation. Different
    few fractions then occur. A weighing coefficient for partitioning the energy available
    for soil evaporation depending upon fc and fw (Allen et al., 2005a, b; Rosa et
    al., 2012a) eases the daily Ke computation. The fraction fc should be observed
    in the field as reviewed by Pereira et al. (2020c); otherwise, it may be estimated
    according to Allen et al. (1998) as: (15) where Kc min is the minimum Kc for dry,
    bare soil, generally 0.15. The exponent "1 + 0.5 h" represents the effect of plant
    height on shading the soil and increasing the Kcb given a specific value for fc.
    (Kcb - Kc min) ≥ 0.01 for numerical stability. Eq. 11 is the base for partitioning
    ET. On the one hand, it shows that when the crop develops, from the initial to
    the mid-season stage, Kcb increases and the difference Kc max-Kcb therefore decreases,
    as well as the fraction few since fc also increases. Therefore, Ke decreases as
    much as Kcb and fc increase. Contrarily, during the late season Ke increases because
    Kcb and fc decrease. The rates of Kcb and fc variation, thus of Ke decrease or
    increase, change from a crop to another and with the management practices, with
    Kcb varying also with water and salinity stress (Ks, Eq. 9). On the other hand,
    Ke varies with the water amount available for evaporation, which depends upon
    Kr with the irrigation method and frequency of irrigation. The advantage of the
    adopted approach results from combining the variation of Kcb and Ke and adopting
    Kc max as the upper limit for Kcb+Ke. Therefore, there is the need for performing
    daily the water balance of the soil evaporation layer in addition to the root
    zone water balance, which increases the accuracy of computations. A discussion
    comparing the ET partition using the FAO56 dual Kc approach with that used in
    the popular AquaCrop model has been presented by Pereira et al. (2015b), which
    highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the FAO56 dual Kc approach. As referred
    by DeJonge and Thorp (2017), reported results with maize and cotton have shown
    that crop coefficient simulations with the dual “ETo-Kcb method better mimicked
    theoretical behavior, including spikes in the soil evaporation coefficient (Ke)
    due to irrigation and rainfall events and basal crop coefficient response as associated
    with simulated crop growth.” Consequently, the FAO56 approach has been implemented
    with the DSSAT Crop System Model (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017). 2.4. Soil water balance:
    transient state models Mechanistic approaches to the SWB commonly compute variably-saturated
    water flow as described by Richards’ equation: (16) where θ is the volumetric
    soil water content [L3 L−3], t is time [T], z is the vertical space coordinate
    [L], h is the pressure head [L], K is the hydraulic conductivity [L T−1], and
    S is the sink term accounting for water uptake by plant roots [L3 L−3 T−1]. The
    unsaturated soil hydraulic properties are often described with the van Genuchten-Mualem
    functional relationships (van Genuchten, 1980). These relationships require appropriate
    calibration. The sink term, S, may be calculated using the Feddes et al. (1978)
    approach where the potential transpiration rate, Tp [L T−1], is distributed over
    the root zone using the normalized root density distribution function, β(z,t)
    [L−1], and multiplied by the dimensionless stress response function, α(h, hϕ,
    z, t), that accounts for water and osmotic stresses. In HYDRUS-1D (Šimünek and
    Hopmans, 2009; Ramos et al., 2011) we have: (17) where Sp(z,t) and S(h, hϕ, z,
    t) are the potential and actual volumes of water removed from unit volume of soil
    per unit of time [L3 L−3 T−1], respectively, and α(h, hϕ, z, t) is a prescribed
    dimensionless function of the soil water (h) and osmotic (hϕ) pressure heads (0≤α≤1).
    The actual transpiration rate, Ta [L T-1], is obtained by integrating Eq. (13)
    over the root domain LR: (18) It is generally assumed that the potential root
    water uptake is reduced when water stress occurs due to deficit irrigation and/or
    osmotic potential resulting from soil salinity or the use of saline irrigation
    waters. While the Richards’ equation is commonly adopted in a variety of models,
    the sink term may be different from a model to another. For solving the Richards’
    equation, the formulation of the boundary conditions may be diverse. In SWAP (Vazifedoust
    et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2013), the upper boundary condition is determined by
    the fluxes of potential evapotranspiration computed with the PM-eq (Eq. 3). The
    model does not use the FAO56 method but it allows computing the actual Kc (Xu
    et al., 2013). Differently, with HYDRUS, the Kc-ETo approach is often used to
    define the potential ET flux at the upper boundary (Ramos et al., 2011); alternatively,
    Ramos et al. (2012) used the sum Kcb-ETo and Ke-ETo with Kcb and Ke obtained with
    a dual Kc partition tool. Transient state models may be calibrated purposefully
    for scheduling irrigation under selected conditions, e.g. the model SWB-2D for
    drip irrigated hedgerow orchards (Annandale et al., 2003). Transient state models
    usually perform the partition of ETc act with reference to the crop leaf area
    index (LAI), particularly when knowing its maximum values, LAImax. Because transient
    state models focus on the accurate simulation of water fluxes within and through
    the boundaries of the soil root zone, these models accurately compute DP and CR
    and, often also RO. When applied to rice, they can also simulate water depth in
    the paddies (Bhadra et al., 2013). These models may be used to parameterize steady
    state SWB models, e.g. the WAVE model was used to define the parametric DP and
    CR equations adopted in the model ISAREG (Liu et al., 2006) and later in SIMDualKc.
    Transient state models, since they are mechanistic models that accurately simulate
    the dynamics of transpiration, are commonly integrated with crop growth and yield
    models, e.g. SWACROP (Kabat et al., 1992) and SWATRER-SUCROS (Xevi and Feyen,
    1992). Currently, coupling of transient state and crop growth and yield models
    is commonly adopted, e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and
    EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). The advantage of transient state models is that soil water
    processes can be accurately described mechanistically, e.g. infiltration and water
    redistribution, root water uptake, deep percolation and capillary rise. However,
    the inputs of soil hydraulic properties, such as the soil water retention and
    permeability curves (respectively θ(h) and K(h) curves), are much more exigent
    than for simpler SWB models in terms of data acquisition and θ(h) and K(h) calibration.
    Often, the inverse model simulation needs to be adopted for their calibration
    before application. In addition, the vegetation parameters needed are much more
    complex than for FAO56-based SWB models. Therefore, these models are hard to parameterize
    and calibrate resulting more suitable for agronomic and irrigation research, and
    when assessing nitrates, chemicals and salinity dynamics in relation to crop growth
    and yield. Differently, the SWB models adopting the FAO56 methods are easier to
    use and appropriate to support practical irrigation scheduling and planning, as
    well as to assess the performance of irrigation management options. Along this
    line, the crop simulation models DSSAT-CSM, which basically require an accurate
    prediction of transpiration to predict biomass and yield accurately, recently
    adopted the FAO56 approaches (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017), namely the grass reference
    ETo and the FAO56 dual Kc approach. 2.5. Crop yields prediction and performance
    indicators for irrigation scheduling Knowledge of yield responses to water is
    required to construct irrigation scheduling models, namely aiming at developing
    appropriate irrigation schedules that cope with the variability of climatic conditions,
    water availability limitations, and the need to improve yields and economic returns.
    Crop growth models may then be used to predict biomass and yields in combination
    with predicted or assessed crop and irrigation management practices. The DSSAT-CSM
    models are often used for assessing yields when comparing irrigation management
    options (DeJonge et al., 2012; Thorp et al., 2014). By recently adopting the FAO56
    Kcb-ETo approach (Thorp et al., 2017), their use for assessing irrigation management
    options resulted easier to interpret. The crop growth and yield SWB AquaCrop (Raes
    et al., 2016) is also commonly used but, contrarily to the DSSAT models, its approach
    to calculating ET diverges from the FAO56 method. Another approach consists of
    coupling a crop model with a transient state model. e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D
    (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). These models may be very
    demanding in terms of parameterization and input data, but they are suitable when
    dealing with complex hydrologic and water quality conditions. Simple yield prediction
    approaches, such as the one by Jensen (1968), consist of a multiplicative parametric
    function that combines the effects of limited soil water on yield at various crop
    growth stages. Hanks (1974) developed the model PLANTGRO assuming that total dry
    matter production is directly proportional to the seasonal transpiration. For
    grain yield predictions, Hanks (1974) adapted the Jensen (1968) model and developed
    a multi-stage model (Hanks and Hill, 1980), while Stewart et al. (1977) assumed
    a linear dependence of the relative yield deficit from the relative evapotranspiration
    deficit, which is described as: (19) where Ky is the yield response factor, Ya
    and Ym are, respectively, the actual and maximum (potential) yields (kg ha−1),
    and ETc act and ETc are, respectively, the actual and potential crop evapotranspiration
    (mm) corresponding to the yields Ya and Ym. Ym may be observed or estimated. ETc
    act and ETc may be observed or computed with a SWB model. Ky values are tabulated
    for a wide range of crops (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979) and they were updated recently
    (Minhas et al., 2020). Stewart et al. (1977) also proposed a multiple linear phasic
    model to account for the effects of water deficit during the vegetative, flowering
    and maturation stages using specific yield response factors (βi) for each stage
    i, which were tabulated by Doorenbos and Kassam (1979). Considering that transpiration
    is the ET component directly responsible for yield formation, and that various
    models perform the partition of ET, hence estimating transpiration, a modified
    version of Stewart’s model (Paredes et al., 2014) may be used to estimate Ya:
    (20) where Tc act and Tc are, respectively, the seasonal actual and potential
    crop transpiration (mm), thus replacing ET in Eq. (19). Research has shown that
    both Stewart’s global and phasic models predict yields with appropriate accuracy
    for evaluating irrigation schedules, namely when using Eq. (20) with Tc act data
    computed with the SIMDualKc model. Fig. 1a shows that maize yield predictions
    with Eq. (20) match well the yields observed in experiments carried out in both
    Portugal and Uruguay (Paredes et al., 2014; Giménez et al., 2016), and Fig. 1b
    shows a similar match of soybean yields relative to experiments developed in China
    and Uruguay (Wei et al., 2015; Giménez et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res

    (b0 - regression coefficient of a linear regression forced to the origin; R2 –
    coefficient of determination of the ordinary least squares regression, RMSE –
    root mean square error, NRMSE – normalized root mean square error). Water scarcity
    and global change lead irrigation water use to essentially aim at increased water
    productivity, water conservation and water saving. Water conservation refers to
    every policy, managerial measure, or user practice that aims at conserving or
    preserving the water resources and combating its degradation, namely focusing
    on its quality, while water saving aims at limiting or controlling the water demand
    and use, thus avoiding wastes and the misuse of water (Pereira et al., 2012; Pereira,
    2017). A comprehensive analysis on water conservation and saving measures and
    practices for a variety of agricultural uses was presented by Pereira et al. (2009,
    2012) and Jovanovic et al. (2020). Water productivity in agriculture (WP, kg m−3),
    also known as water use efficiency, may be generically defined as the ratio between
    the actual crop yield achieved (Ya) and the corresponding water use, which may
    refer to the total water use (TWU), hence including rainfall, to the irrigation
    water use (IWU), to the consumptive use (ETc act), or just to crop transpiration
    (Tc act). Therefore, different indicators result to assess diverse irrigation
    scheduling scenarios: (21) (22) (23) (24) where P is rainfall, CR is capillary
    rise or groundwater contribution, ΔSW is the variation in soil water storage in
    the root zone from planting to harvesting, I is the amount of irrigation, ETc
    act is the actual crop evapotranspiration, and Tc act is the actual crop transpiration,
    all expressed in m3 and referring to the crop season. Ya in Eqs. (21) through
    (24) may be observed, or may be estimated with a crop growth and yield model or
    with a simple water-yield parametric function as reported above. The meaning of
    indicators in Eqs. (21), (22), (23), (24) is necessarily different and indicators
    should be selected considering the actual farming objectives, the respective implications
    in terms of resource, environment and climate change, and the data availability.
    An application of similar WP concepts to olive orchards, including a related economic
    analysis, was recently discussed by Fernández et al. (2020). Improving WP could
    lead to water saving in irrigation but it requires the consideration of various
    factors. WP may be increased by minimizing the non-beneficial water uses such
    as percolation through the bottom of the root zone, runoff out of the irrigated
    fields, and losses by evaporation and wind drift in sprinkling. A high WP could
    be attained when increasing yields but, often, a higher WP is obtained when the
    crop is deliberately under-irrigated, thus when water stress is allowed in some
    less-sensitive crop stages; nevertheless, a yield reduction will then occur. 3.
    Overview of models aimed at improved irrigation scheduling 3.1. Soil water balance
    simulation models from FAO24 to FAO56 Many models have been proposed since the
    early 1980’s following the publication of FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    which has been the landmark in the domain of crop water requirements and irrigation
    scheduling. Model papers considered herein limit to those having an identified
    software, adequate reference to calibration and/or validation, and not referring
    to single uses only. In addition, since the objectives of the current review refer
    to FAO56 with focusing on the dual Kc approach and considering that transient
    state models are dealt in Section 2.4, the reviewed SWB refer to models using
    a Kc approach, mainly referring to FAO24 and to FAO56. Numerous SWB models have
    been developed since the 1980’s as early reviewed by Lascano (1991). Related articles
    were often presented in research reports or to scientific conferences (ASAE, 1981,
    1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995; Smith et al., 1996; Ragab et al.,
    1996). These articles show a great variety of approaches, using the FAO Kc-ETo
    and/or transient state models, which received the preference of researchers by
    that time (Belmans et al., 1983). Developments also included landscape and turf
    grass irrigation. ETo equations were diverse because FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt,
    1977) proposed various alternative equations. Howell et al. (1990) presented a
    first application of the Penman-Monteith grass reference equation proposed by
    Allen et al. (1989) when a commonly used ETo equation was the Penman equation.
    Without a common ETo definition and equation, standard Kc values could not be
    defined despite a consolidated set of Kc values was presented in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977) for numerous field, vegetable and woody crops. These authors
    proposed the well-known segmented FAO Kc curve but various curvilinear approaches
    were in use (e.g., Wright, 1982; HiIl, 1991). However, the segmented Kc curve
    was adopted by several authors (Howell et al., 1990; Combre and Kamieniarz, 1992;
    Teixeira and Pereira, 1992). Single Kc models of the 80’s and 90’s were often
    developed for application at farm level and evolved to support farm irrigators’
    communities. A first model has been developed with CIMIS, the California Irrigation
    Management Information System (Snyder, 1986), which keeps evolving nowadays and
    is based on a large grid of weather stations and a very large number of users
    (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/ accessed on 27 May 2020) and partners. Among the
    latter is the Satellite Irrigation Management Support framework (SIMS, Melton
    et al., 2012, 2020). The model CROPWAT (Smith, 1988, 1992) is paradigmatic since
    it consisted of a database built from FAO24 data (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    a supplementary CLIMWAT weather database, a reference ET calculator and a water
    balance computational tool able to propose an irrigation scheduling calendar for
    the selected crop, soil and field. The model was updated after the FAO experts
    consultation on crop water requirements (Smith et al., 1991) and the publication
    of FAO 56, and has been successively upgraded. The version CROPWAT 8.0 has been
    recently released. BIdriCo (Danuso et al., 1995) is updated and is operating with
    real time weather data to support irrigation farmers of the Friuli Venezia Giulia
    region, Italy. IRRICANNE is an irrigation scheduling simulation model (Combre
    and Kamieniarz, 1992) designed to support sugarcane producers and was used for
    many years in the Island of Reunion. The model RENANA (Giannerini, 1995) was applied
    to support farmers irrigation scheduling in the Emilia-Romagna Region and evolved
    to a large-scale web based DSS, IRRINET, in use by farmers of various regions
    of Italy (Mannini et al., 2013), as well as to support irrigation water delivery
    (Genovesi et al., 2019). Three models early reported - IRSIS (de Goes Calmon et
    al., 1992), ISAREG (Teixeira and Pereira, 1992) and PILOTE (Mailhol et al., 1996)
    - were designed for both research and application in the field practice. IRSIS
    (Raes et al., 1988) was modified to produce BUDGET (Raes et al., 2006) that was
    further developed with extensions for improved water balance and yield assessment
    (Shrestha et al., 2010), then becoming the SWB basis of the crop model AquaCrop
    (Raes et al., 2016). ISAREG adopted the PM-ETo equation following the FAO Expert
    Consultation that decided its adoption (Smith et al., 1991). ISAREG was first
    modified to support real time farmers advising with the development of RELREG
    (Teixeira et al., 1995), later turning into a web based DSS, WEBISAREG (Branco
    et al., 2005), and developing GIS facilities, HYDROGEST (Mateus et al., 2007).
    However, since the Irrigation Associations did not develop local support to farmers,
    the model was used essentially for research after adoption of computational tools
    relative to DP, CR and salinity (Pereira et al., 2007, 2009). It is currently
    used in several countries, e.g. Brazil (Saraiva et al., 2017), Bulgaria (Popova
    et al., 2014) and China (Zheng et al., 2014). Meanwhile, ISAREG was the base of
    SIMDualKc (Rosa et al., 2012a), described in the next Section. PILOTE software
    has been continuously improved and it became a crop model with various capabilities
    including irrigation and crop management (Mailhol et al., 2004, 2018). CADSM (Walker
    et al., 1995) was the first distributed SWB model aimed at computing the aggregated
    irrigation demand at the command area of a collective irrigation system using
    the Kc-ETo approach. It was also one of the first models using the PM-ETo equation
    after it was proposed to a wide audience (Allen et al., 1994a,b). Similarly, the
    combined use of the ISAREG model and the paddy basins simulation model IRRICEP
    (Paulo et al., 1995) was adopted to simulate the demand hydrographs at the sector
    level in a collective irrigation system using the FAO methods (Teixeira et al.,
    1996). Buchleiter (1995) presented the model SCHED for scheduling irrigations
    with a center-pivot system. However, this type of approach is currently replaced
    by precision irrigation software, namely variable rate scheduling with support
    of wireless sensors (e.g. O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). Hess (1996) reported on
    a microcomputer irrigation-scheduling model to be available for farmers since
    they were progressively adopting such computing facilities; however, with changes
    in hardware the approach was abandoned. The SIMDSS (Malano et al., 1996) was developed
    for practical irrigation scheduling and improved surface irrigation practices
    aimed at an integrated real-time management for pastures in SE Australia. MARKVAND
    was a DSS system for farmers use in Denmark, which software provides information
    on timing and volumes of irrigation as well as on the expected economic returns
    (Plauborg et al., 1996). Changes in technologies led to abandon these type of
    models. Models including the partitioning of ET into transpiration and soil evaporation
    were rare. The first was reported by Wright (1982) but his pioneer approach aimed
    at deriving Kcb when soil water evaporation could be considered nil, i.e. the
    soil surface was dry but transpiration was near optimal. The approach applied
    well to infrequent water applications but not to highly frequent wettings; however,
    data reported by this author have been fundamental in developing the FAO56 dual
    Kc approach (Allen et al., 1998). Tuzet et al. (1992) developed an approach where
    ET partition was supported by the observed LAI. Many researchers lately followed
    a LAI approach for partitioning ET. Further developments in using a dual Kc were
    initiated after publication of FAO56, mainly using its spreadsheet for calculation
    of Kcb and Ke, which still is used at present. A first SWB model relative to paddy
    rice using the Kc-ETo approach, the IRRICEP model, was reported by Paulo et al.
    (1995). The model required not only the calibration of Kc values but the calibration
    of soil hydraulic properties determining the computation of percolation adopting
    a Darcy approach, as well as lateral seepage to downstream paddies and drainage
    ditches. That model was later used by Mao et al. (2004) adopting the PM-ETo equation.
    Singh et al. (2001) modified the model SAWAH to adopt the Kc-ETo approach and
    a partition of actual crop ET based upon an empirical exponential function of
    LAI. Agrawal et al. (2004) developed a Visual Basic SWB model where the Kc-ETo
    is used, seepage is computed with the Dupuit approach and percolation is determined
    with a soil water simulation using partial differential equations distinguishing
    water ponded conditions and unsaturated conditions when intermittent irrigation
    is used. Transient state approaches for the ponded and the unsaturated conditions
    were also used by Khepar et al. (2000) when modeling intermittent paddy irrigation.
    A different approach is reported by Jeon et al. (2005), who developed PADDIMOD.
    In this model, surface drainage and percolation are estimated with parametric
    equations, which require parameters calibration. These referred models, despite
    posterior to the publication of FAO56, did not adopt the PM-ETo equation but FAO24
    equations. 3.2. Soil water balance simulation models after FAO56 This review focused
    only on SWB simulation models using the FAO56 Kc-ETo approach and which calibration
    and validation procedures are recognizable. Many other publications on SWB models
    not using the Kc-ETo method and not adopting the PM-ETo equation were not considered.
    The selected SWB models are presented in Table 1 for those using the single time
    averaged Kc, while Table 2 refers to the SWB models using the FAO56 dual Kc approach
    (see Section 2.3 above) or a similar approach where LAI replaces fc. Table 1.

    are used: Csalt – Salt concentration in the soil solution; ECe – Electrical conductivity
    of the soil saturation extract; ETsalt – Actual crop evapotranspiration affected
    by salinity; Ksat – Soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation. Abbreviations:
    n/r – not reported; seep – seepage. Single Kc models in Table 1 are diverse in
    terms of the target crops; these can be single annual crops, e.g. maize, wheat,
    cotton or paddy rice, or various annuals and/or perennials. They have in common
    the use of the FAO56 PM-ETo equation, in some cases also considering alternative
    temperature based methods, and the use of the stress coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including
    modifications for paddies water balance. Models have a variety of base input parameters.
    Soil base parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, but θsat and Ksat may also
    be included when deep percolation and capillary rise are among the model outputs.
    Only one model (ISAREG) uses the input of electrical conductivity of the soil
    saturation extract (ECe, dS m−1) to compute the ET reduction due to salinity (ETsalt)
    as described in FAO56 and by Minhas et al. (2020). All reported models were calibrated
    and validated, generally using SWC data, a few using ETc act or Tc act (Consoli
    et al., 2016; Mancosu et al., 2016), and the ponded water depths in case of paddy
    rice (de Silva and Rushton, 2008; Inthavong et al., 2011). The model outputs are
    diverse but all models, in addition to ET, provide DP estimates. Several models
    also compute RO but CR is only provided by few models (Pereira et al., 2003; Shang
    and Mao, 2006; Chopart et al., 2007; Boegh et al., 2009; Consoli et al., 2016).
    Paddy water models outputs refer to the ponded water and to DP, seepage and drainage.
    References to the possible use of remote sensing data are very limited. SWB models
    using the dual Kc approach are referred in Table 2. As for single Kc models, they
    are diverse in terms of the target crops but most of them can be used with both
    annual and perennial crops. A few refer to annuals or only to specific crops (wheat,
    maize, groundnuts and paddy rice). All use the PM-ETo equation and the stress
    coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including those modified for paddies. Models have a variety
    of base soil input parameters. Soil parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, a
    few θsat and Ksat, and some models (Annandale et al., 1999; Ragab, 2002) also
    have a transient state approach and require θ(h) and K(θ). Salinity base data
    on ECe are used in the AQUACROP and SIMDualKc models, while SALTMED and “SWB”
    use the salt concentration in the soil water. Models are calibrated and validated
    with SWC data but some models may be calibrated with ETc act or Tc act data (Rosa
    et al., 2012a, b; Campos et al., 2016); when they also predict actual yields,
    Ya data may also be used for calibration (Ragab, 2002; Raes et al., 2012). Model
    outputs are diverse but all models, in addition to ETc act and Tc act, provide
    for DP while a few also compute RO. The computation of CR is only available from
    the models SALTMED, AquaCrop, SIMDualKc and the model reported by Han et al. (2018).
    The paddy rice model RiceWCA (Yang et al., 2012) outputs are different from those
    referred before and include the predicted applied water, DP, seepage, and tail
    water runoff. A few models refer to the possibility of using remote sensing-retrieved
    data. This review recognized that few models are able to compute groundwater contribution
    from a water table as well as impacts of salinity. DSSAT crop models using Kc-ETo
    with the dual Kc approach (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) could be added in Table 2
    but they are very different from the listed models and rarely used for irrigation
    scheduling. Farmers’ information models commonly using Kcb values derived from
    remote sensing vegetation indices, such as SIMS (Melton et al., 2012, 2020; Cahn
    and Johnson, 2017), consist also of a peculiar group of dual Kc models that require
    mention. For selecting the best crop irrigation schedules, the SWB models adopt
    user-friendly software that helps the users to handle data and, often, to compute
    indicators such as those referred in Section 2.5. Performance scenarios may be
    the object of ranking, e.g. when DSS approaches adopt multi-criteria analysis
    as discussed by Darouich et al. (2014, 2017), namely when the selection of irrigation
    schedules is tied to the performance of the irrigation method. However, the use
    of multi-criteria analysis is rare in irrigation scheduling and, commonly, only
    simple comparisons of indicators are used (Paredes et al., 2014, 2017a,b; Pereira
    et al., 2015b). 4. The dual Kc soil water balance approach using the model SIMDualKc
    4.1. Brief presentation of the model SIMDualKc is a quite unique software model
    that performs a daily soil water balance at the field scale (Rosa et al., 2012a,b)
    adopting the dual Kc approach to compute and partition crop ET into Tc and Es.
    Data inputs and model outcomes are described in Fig. 2 where the flowchart of
    the model is presented. In general, compulsory data inputs are common to other
    SWB models that adopt the FAO56 dual Kc approach, although requirements may change
    with the type of algorithms used in computations. Facultative data differ depending
    upon the specific objectives of the simulation. This is the case for data used
    to compute runoff, deep percolation, groundwater contribution, as well as effects
    of mulches and no-till planting, active ground cover, intercropping, and soil
    and water salinity. Naturally, model outcomes also differ depending on the modelling
    objectives. Download : Download high-res image (919KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Simplified flowchart of SIMDualKc model (modified from Rosa et al.,
    2012a). Model calibration consists of adjusting the influential model parameters
    within their reasonable ranges so that the model results are consistent with available
    observed data, thus estimation errors are minimized. The process of validation
    permits the verification of the goodness of fitting when the model is used with
    the set of calibrated parameters but with different, independent data sets, without
    tuning such parameters. Calibration and validation of models and appropriate goodness-of-fit
    indicators are a must for every model as discussed by several authors (e.g., Moriasi
    et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012) and by Pereira et al. (2015b) relative to SIMDualKc.
    The calibration parameters of SIMDualKc consist of: Kcb and p relative to the
    various crop growth stages; Ze, TEW and REW characterizing the soil evaporation
    layer; the parameter CN relative to the runoff algorithm; and the parameters relative
    to the DP and CR parametric functions. Initial sets of these parameters are inputs
    to the model, which are improved through calibration. Soil water content observations
    are the most commonly used for calibration, e.g. Fandiño et al. (2012, 2015) for
    a vineyard and for hop for industry, Zhao et al. (2013) for maize and wheat, Wu
    et al. (2016) for a groundwater dependent grassland, and Paredes et al. (2017a)
    relative to pea for industry. Calibration may also be performed by comparing observed
    eddy covariance ET with model computed ETc act for field crops (Zhang et al.,
    2013; Tian et al., 2016) and citrus orchards (Peddinti and Kambhammettu, 2019),
    or by comparing observed sap-flow transpiration data with simulated Tc act (Paço
    et al., 2012, 2019; Qiu et al., 2015). Descriptions of the calibration and validation
    processes are provided in the cited applications. Various methods may be used
    to estimate accurately actual crop ET as reviewed by Allen et al. (2011b) and
    Pereira et al. (2020a,b). Methods include the measurement of the soil water content
    for deriving ET from the SWB, the measurement of ETc act using eddy covariance
    (EC) or Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) systems, as well as the measurement
    of Tc act with sap-flow systems. All these methods are potentially very accurate
    as point measurements, and the EC and BREB are used in such a way that their footprint
    may span a relatively large area representative of the vegetation. EC is receiving
    the preference of many ET users, but measurements of the soil water content (SWC)
    and sap-flow continue to be largely used. Fig. 3a shows the comparisons of simulated
    and observed seasonal SWC data of a wheat crop used to calibrate SIMDualKc, and
    Fig. 3b shows a similar comparison of simulated wheat ETc act with EC observed
    data, both obtained at the same location in North China plain (Zhang et al., 2013;
    Zhao et al., 2013). The goodness-of-fit indicators resulted similar, i.e. there
    was no advantage of one calibration over the other, which means that a user may
    select the most convenient approach to calibrate a model if measurements of SWC,
    ETc act or Tc act are accurately performed. Download : Download high-res image

    vs. observed soil water content (adapted from Zhao et al., 2013) and (b) simulated
    vs. observed ETc act (adapted from Zhang et al., 2013). 4.2. Deriving crop coefficients
    Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB simulations is a main capability of SWB models, e.g.
    SALTMED (Silva et al., 2012), which is quite common for vegetable and field crops
    as reported in recent reviews (Pereira et al., 2020a,b); however, it is uncommon
    for fruit trees and vines. In the case of evergreen trees and vines, a full crop
    coefficient curve requires that, in addition to the Kc and Kcb for the initial,
    mid-season and end-season, the Kc and Kcb values for the non-growing period are
    also known. Moreover, due to climate differences between the growing and non-growing
    seasons, the Kc and Kcb curves may be substantially different. Nevertheless, there
    are various examples of derivation of Kc and Kcb for orchards (e.g., Peddinti
    and Kambhammettu, 2019). As an example for evergreen woody crops, a study performed
    with irrigated olives in southern Portugal (Paço et al., 2019) is analyzed. Crop
    transpiration was measured with the sap-flow Granier method, which data provided
    for calibrating SIMDualKc, thus obtaining the best Kcb values for the initial,
    mid-season, end-season and non-growing periods. A few observations of ETc act
    with an EC system were also used for testing. The Kcb curve (Fig. 4) resulted
    in a FAO segmented curve with higher Kcb during the growing season, spring and
    summer, when irrigation was applied, and smaller Kcb in the non-growing period,
    when transpiration is naturally low. Differently, because it depends on soil evaporation,
    the time averaged Kc (=Kcb+Ke) resulted smaller during the active growing period,
    when Es and Ke were low because precipitation was reduced and drip lines were
    located directly in line with the crop and shaded by the crop canopy, thus irrigation
    was applied under trees’ shadow. Contrarily, Kc was larger in fall and winter,
    when rainfall occurred (Fig. 4). A segmented Kc curve resulted with low values
    by the mid-season and a Kcb curve with a higher value during the mid-season. The
    Kc curve changed with rainfall, with Kc mid and Kc in the non-growing season,
    which is higher when rainfall was larger (Fig. 4a) and smaller under dry conditions.
    Contrarily, the standard Kcb values did not change. When considering the daily
    Kcb act, changes occurred depending on the water stress of the olive crop. The
    daily Kc act changed a lot, causing the referred changes in the Kc curve. Download

    Standard and actual basal and single crop coefficient and soil evaporation coefficient
    curves for a super-intensive olive orchard in two contrasting rainfall years:
    a) wet year and b) dry year (Paço et al., 2019). Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB
    simulations is also uncommon for forage crops managed with cuttings. The FAO56
    approach for Kcb and Kc of forages managed with cuttings consists of adopting
    a segmented curve for each cut (Allen et al., 1998). SIMDualKc has proved appropriate
    to support the derivation of Kcb and Kc under these conditions in an application
    to Tifton 85 bermudagrass in Santa Maria, Brazil (Paredes et al., 2018b). The
    cutting treatments were spaced according to selected cumulative growth degree
    days (CGDD), which varied among treatments. With this approach, shorter time spans
    between cuttings resulted in summer and longer ones in winter. Results for Kcb
    and Kc with cuttings at CGDD of 248 °C, which refer to six forage cuttings, and
    372 °C, with only four cuttings, are presented in Fig. 5a and 5b respectively.
    The computed time average Kc before the cuttings are 0.96 for the CGDD 248 °C
    and 0.97 for CGDD 372 °C while the Kc after cuttings, when the forage crop is
    shorter, decreased to 0.92 and 0.95, respectively. Reported time averaged Kc before
    and after cuttings are close due to abundant precipitation during the crop season.
    The standard Kcb before the cuttings are 0.93 for the treatment with CGDD of 248 °C
    and 0.94 for CGDD of 372 °C while Kcb values after cuttings were respectively
    0.83 and 0.84. Values for the standard Kcb would be more distinct if the forage
    height would be smaller after cuttings. Results show that the approach proposed
    in FAO56 for Kc and Kcb curves for forages managed with cuttings was applicable
    with SIMDualKc. Download : Download high-res image (381KB) Download : Download

    where cuttings were performed for cumulative growth degree days of (a) 248 °C
    and (b) 372 °C (adapted from Paredes et al., 2018b). 4.3. ET and crop coefficients
    of relay inter-cropping An approach based on light/shadow effects was used to
    estimate ETc act and its partition for crops cultivated in a relay inter-cropping
    system. The mutual effects of shading by the crops combined in an inter-crop system
    were estimated by considering the height of both crops and the fraction of ground
    covered by each crop throughout the crop season (Miao et al., 2016). This principle
    is based upon the approach of Allen and Pereira (2009) to compute Kcb for a fruit
    crop cultivated with active ground cover. Naming the first planted crop as dominant
    and the second as the subordinate crop, and considering their interaction, the
    Kcb of the intercrop (Kcb inter) may be estimated daily as (Miao et al., 2016):
    (25) where Kcb dom and Kcb sub are, respectively, the Kcb values of the dominant
    and subordinate crops when mono-cropped, and Kd dom and Kd sub are the density
    coefficients of the dominant and subordinate crops. Kd are computed as: (26a)
    (26b) where fsc dom and fsc sub are the fractions of the soil surface cropped
    with the dominant and the subordinate crops, respectively, and hdom and hsub are
    the heights of the dominant and subordinate crops, respectively. The max function
    in Eqs. (25) and (26) aims at considering that the conditions observed at earlier
    stages, Kcb dom > Kcb sub and h dom >h sub, may change with the growth of the
    subordinate crop, thus making Kcb sub > Kcb dom and h sub > h dom. For example,
    this is the case of the wheat-sunflower intercrop, where sunflower develops taller
    than wheat when the latter matures, thus Kcb sunf > Kcb wheat and hsunf > hwheat.
    The application of this methodology to a winter wheat-sunflower relay inter-cropping
    in Hetao, China, is illustrated in Figs. 6a and b, which show the Kcb, Kcb act
    and Ke relative to wheat and sunflower mono-cropped, while Fig. 6c shows Kcb,
    Kcb act and Ke for the inter-cropping of both. Fig. 6a shows that a small stress
    occurred for wheat while Fig. 6b evidences that sunflower was largely stressed
    during the mid- and late-season stages, thus indicating that a large irrigation
    should have been given early in the mid-season. The resulting potential Kcb of
    the inter-cropping system (Fig. 6c) was smaller than that of the crops when single-cropped,
    with Kcb act following the trends evidenced for both crops when cropped alone.
    The Ke values also followed the Ke curves of both crops but they were different
    because basin irrigation was used and water was applied to the entire field, including
    when the second crop was not sowed yet, thus producing high evaporation in the
    non-cropped parts of the field. Fig. 6c shows that four irrigations were applied
    to the intercrop, however too early for sunflower that, contrarily to wheat, exhibited
    large water stress during mid- and late seasons. This is a consequence of avoiding
    irrigation by the end-season of wheat. The example shows that the use of a calibrated
    model helps interpreting and evaluating the irrigation schedules of intercropped
    crops. Download : Download high-res image (580KB) Download : Download full-size

    wheat-sunflower in Hetao, upper Yellow River basin, China, 2011 (adapted from
    Miao et al., 2016). 4.4. Assessing alternative planting dates An important issue
    in developing irrigation calendars is assessing the impacts of changing planting
    dates. Such changes may be desired when anticipating planting dates may increase
    the probability of rainfall early in the season, or to avoid hot waves in the
    late season. This search of better planting dates may be performed with irrigation
    scheduling models and using a statistical analysis of weather time series, namely
    when supplemental irrigation is practiced, such as with small grains and grain
    legumes in the Mediterranean area. However, few examples are available in the
    literature and they mostly refer to the impacts on crop yields rather than on
    water requirements. Abi-Saab et al. (2014) provided a good example relative to
    sunflower and soybean cropped in Lebanon, while Montoya and Otero (2019) reported
    an application to soybean in Uruguay, in both cases using the AquaCrop model.
    A different approach, using BUDGET, consisted of performing an analysis of risk
    relative to maize planting dates (Kipkorir et al., 2007). Various supplemental
    irrigation schedules for malting barley for industry were assessed for two contrasting
    rainfall years (Pereira et al., 2015b; Paredes et al., 2017b) using a cultivar
    that adjusts to a wide planting period, from November to January. Center-pivot
    irrigation was used with depths of 8 mm per event and ceasing 25 days before harvest
    to prevent water-related diseases that could affect malt grain quality. Based
    upon the observed sowing dates, the following alternatives were considered: 16th
    and 30th of December, and 6th and 16th of January. These sowing dates were assessed
    in terms of impacts on the total water use (TWU), forecasted yields (Ya), and
    water productivity (WPtotal, Eq. 21) defined in Section 2.5. They were also assessed
    considering two contrasting rainfall years - wet (2013) and dry (2012) – and various
    supplemental irrigation scenarios: Sc. 1: Full irrigation as practiced by the
    farmer (MAD = p); Sc. 2: Very mild water deficit during the entire season (MAD = 1.10
    p, Eq. 10); Sc. 3: Moderate water deficit during most of the crop season (MAD = 1.20
    p), but very mild (MAD = 1.10 p) during flowering/grain filling; Sc. 4: Moderate
    water stress during the entire season (MAD = 1.20 p); Sc. 5: Rainfed. Fig. 7 shows
    the predicted TWU, yield and WP indicators for the four sowing dates and five
    irrigation management scenarios. The adoption of early sowing leads to a smaller
    TWU than late sowing, particularly in the wet year. In the dry year, differences
    in TWU among irrigation management scenarios are larger than those due to planting
    dates. Yields show to increase for the last two planting dates but, again, differences
    in yields are greater among irrigation scenarios. Under dry conditions, the use
    of supplemental irrigation to meet barley water requirements is essential since
    yields are much lower under rainfed conditions. Differences in water productivity
    are larger among planting dates and quite small among irrigation management scenarios.
    Combining information relative to these three indicators, it was identified that
    the best sowing dates are likely those around the first days of January. The mid-January
    date is discouraged because the crop cycle enters in a period of high water demand
    by the late season, which increases TWU and decreases WP. The consideration of
    economic criteria would also be beneficial. This example shows the usefulness
    of a SWB model in recommending best planting dates to help farmers’ decisions.
    This can also be based on weather forecasts that provide for anticipating crop
    growth conditions. Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download : Download

    various sowing dates and alternative irrigation schedules relative to two contrasting
    rainfall years (adapted from Paredes et al., 2017b). 4.5. Assessing beneficial
    and non-beneficial water uses The analysis of the water use by a crop allows to
    perform the field water balances and assess the time dynamics of its input and
    output terms, thus determining which are the consumptive and non-consumptive uses
    of water and, likely more important, which uses and consumptions are beneficial
    or, contrarily, consist of water waste and losses (Pereira et al., 2012). Molden
    and Sakthivadivel (2011) applied similar water use concepts at the basin scale,
    and Lecina et al. (2010) used this type of assessment to evaluate improvements
    of surface and sprinkler irrigation at the project scale. An application at field
    scale aimed at maximizing beneficial water use and controlling the non-beneficial
    one using the DSSAT-maize model is reported by Jiang et al. (2016). An application
    of the SIMDualKc model to a malt barley cropped under center-pivot irrigation
    in Central Portugal (Pereira et al., 2015b) is used herein as example of assessing
    beneficial and non-beneficial water uses throughout the crop cycle. The model
    was calibrated using field data of the dry year 2012 and was validated with data
    of the wet year 2013. The various SWB terms for both years and four crop growth
    stages are presented in Table 3. Groundwater contribution was not included in
    the balance because the water table was below 10 m deep. Irrigation water application
    depths averaging 7 mm per event were adopted to prevent high water stress. Table

    DP – deep percolation, ETc - crop evapotranspiration, ETc act - actual crop evapotranspiration,
    Tc act - actual crop transpiration, Es – soil evaporation. The non-consumptive
    water use terms, runoff (RO) and deep percolation (DP), were about nil in the
    dry year. RO was 10.5 % of the seasonal precipitation (P) in the wet year while
    DP, a potentially recoverable resource providing for vadose zone and aquifer recharge,
    represented nearly 30 % of P. The consumptive use terms, Tc act and Es, respectively
    beneficial and non-beneficial, showed a similar partition in both years, with
    transpiration representing 77 % of ETc act in the wet year and 79 % in the dry
    year. Es was smaller in the dry year because there was insufficient water supply
    during the late season, with ETc act representing only 64 % of the potential ETc.
    This fact occurred due to irrigation cutoff 25 days before harvesting in both
    years, with stored soil water supplying the crop in the wet year but not in the
    dry year. Otherwise, differences in consumptive water use in both years are small
    and are due to the higher climatic demand in the dry year, when ETc was larger
    by 56 mm relative to the wet year. Performing water use assessment adopting this
    approach is uncommon but could be helpful when considering issues for water conservation.
    4.6. Assessing the groundwater contribution from a shallow watertable The assessment
    of groundwater contribution (GC) to crop water needs in the presence of a shallow
    water table is often performed with a transient state modeling approach (e.g.
    Ragab, 2002; Jovanovic et al., 2004; Acharya and Mylavarapu, 2015). Empirical
    functions are used by others, such as Yang et al. (2007), who computed GC as a
    function of the depth of the water table, the soil water storage and crop ET,
    which consists of a modification of the empirical approach proposed in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977). Differently, Liu et al. (2006) developed a parametric function
    for use in ISAREG and, later, with SIMDualKc, which parameters are calibrated
    during the process of model calibration (e.g., Cholpankulov et al., 2008). With
    this approach, GC is a function of the actual water table depth, the actual soil
    water storage in the root zone, crop evapotranspiration and potential (maximum)
    capillary rise, which depends upon the soil hydraulic characteristics that regulate
    the intensity of upward fluxes. Liu et al. (2006) proposed sets of default parameters
    relative to soil textural and hydraulic properties and that are improved through
    model calibration. The use of SIMDualKc to assess consumptive and non-consumptive
    water use by a groundwater dependent Leymus chinensis grassland in eastern Inner
    Mongolia, China (Wu et al., 2016) is selected as an example of groundwater contribution
    assessment in a wet landscape. The analysis focused on the wet year of 2008 and
    the dry year of 2009. The daily dynamics of P, Tc act, Es and GC (all in mm) during
    the growth season is presented in Fig. 8, which clearly shows that the upward
    fluxes from the shallow water table were the main fraction of the water supply
    to the studied grassland. GC is essential to meet the water requirements of this
    crop. GC was small when there was enough soil water for extraction by the grassland
    but increased when crop water demand was high and the SWC decreased. Comparing
    both years (Fig. 8), it is evident that Tc act was similar in both years because
    GC supplemented rainfall, thus becoming much higher in the dry year, when rainfall
    was insufficient. Considering that ground cover by the grassland was very large,
    Es depended on precipitation only, thus being higher in the wet year. Download

    in Table 4 show that, despite rainfall in the wet year was nearly 3 times that
    of the dry year, ETc act were not very different in both years, and Tc act were
    quite similar because GC effectively supplemented the lack of rainfall. The ratios
    between GC and the total water supply (TWS, mm) were very distinct, with GC/TWS = 33
    % in the wet year and 59 % in the dry year. These ratios quantified well the relative
    importance of GC for the water supply of the considered grassland. The ratios
    between GC and actual transpiration also showed the role of GC in meeting the
    grassland water requirements since GC/Tc act increased from 46 to 63 % from the
    wet to the dry year. Table 4. The terms of the water balance of a groundwater

    irrigation scheduling Real time irrigation scheduling aims at optimizing the timing
    and amount of water applied in the day-to-day irrigation management. It requires
    combining a model with data streaming from diverse sources such as weather forecasts,
    soil and plant sensors, or remote sensing data. Models referred in Table 1, Table
    2 may be adopted for this purpose but they are generally used to support research.
    In the past, several attempts to adapt and use SWB for supporting real time irrigation
    have been performed. Teixeira et al. (1995) developed and tested RELREG, a model
    derived from ISAREG, that could be updated every day, and used weather data predicted
    around three days in advance. Other models were developed and in use at farm level,
    e.g. SCHED for center-pivot irrigation (Buchleiter, 1995) and, for application
    at large scale, models such as RENANA (Giannerini, 1995). The latter has been
    continuously updated and gave origin to IRRIFRAME and IRRINET, widely used in
    Italy (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015), which enter in the
    era of the cloud data models. In South Africa, a review of irrigation scheduling
    atmospheric-based computer models was published by Annandale et al. (2011). Computerized
    real-time irrigation scheduling revolved around a number of historic models such
    as BEWAB (pre-plant seasonal irrigation schedules based on target yields; Bennie
    et al., 1988), “SWB” (providing daily water schedules based on calculated ETc
    act; Annandale et al., 1999), PUTU (De Jager et al., 2001), and various specialized
    models for irrigation management of sugarcane (Singels, 2007). The adoption of
    scientific irrigation scheduling was investigated in a technical project by Stevens
    et al. (2005). The outcomes were that the uptake of scientific irrigation scheduling
    by farmers is low, it is highly dependent on many other day-to-day farming and
    business operations, and there is generally need for engaging dedicated managers,
    extensionists or consultants to run a scientifically-based irrigation scheduling
    program on commercial farms. There are several web-based tools that were purposefully
    designed for supporting farmers in real-time irrigation decision-making such as
    IRRINET (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015) in Emilia Romagna
    Italy, the California Irrigation Management System (CIMIS, https://cimis.water.ca.gov/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), the Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler (AIS, https://irrigweb.uaex.edu/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), or the Mississippi irrigation scheduling tool (MIST).
    The SAPWAT model, originally developed by Crosby and Crosby (1999) with several
    improved versions (van Heerden and Walker, 2016), is used to determine crop water
    requirements and water allocations in South African water management areas. Other
    models with diverse workflows and computational procedures are applied for supporting
    farmers decision making, namely integrating SWB models, but they are rarely the
    object of scientific publications or information about calibration. Examples are

    crops. The developing field of information and communication technology (ICT)
    opened up a variety of opportunities for smart agriculture in general, and irrigation
    scheduling in particular, by making use of Internet of Things (IoT), satellites
    and drones, robotics and artificial intelligence to improve farming operations,
    management of irrigation schedules and fertigation, and to achieve better yields,
    quality of products and profits. Tzounis et al. (2017) provided a review of potential
    applications of IoT technologies in agriculture. The drivers for these technologies
    are large volumes of data that are generated in space and time, and commonly referred
    to as Big Data. Big Data can be defined as huge datasets (commonly in the order
    of magnitude of TB) originating from a diversity of sources that makes them difficult
    to be collected, stored and analysed by conventional tools and techniques (Chen
    and Zhang, 2014; Ylijoki and Porras, 2016). They can be categorized into structured
    data that can be easily stored in tabular format (e.g. soil and plant measurements,
    remote sensing georeferenced data), unstructured data (e.g. text, video, audio
    and images) or semi-structured data (e.g. emails and XML files) that are usually
    inconsistent to store and process in customary databases (Lee, 2017). In order
    to extract usable information from the variety of sources of information to the
    benefit of researchers, practitioners and farm managers, these data need to be
    processed through systems, such as machine learning, and packaged into tools that
    facilitate interpretation and decision-making. Systems of heterogeneous sensors
    and networks for collection and communication of data are commonly referred to
    as Internet of Things (IoT). Given the vast amount of information and storage
    space that is often required, the processing, storage and analyses of these data
    can be done via Internet servers and infrastructure that are specifically designed
    for this purpose (e.g. Cloud Computing) (Tzounis et al., 2017). Ultimately, data
    need to be packaged into information tools, prescriptive/predictive models and
    decision-support systems that can aid decision-making on farms. Depending on data
    volume and computing requirements, irrigation scheduling tools can reside on cloud-based
    platforms (Bartlett et al., 2015). This is particularly the case when the tools/apps
    require information from large databases, e.g. soil properties, climate, satellite-derived
    observations. In other instances, soil input and climatic data can be obtained
    from localized sources, e.g. soil measurements and weather forecasts, and all
    calculations can be performed in reasonable time with algorithms running in the
    background (e.g. Internet apps). Several examples of these IoT applications for
    irrigation scheduling were reported in the literature and described below. The
    IoT infrastructure provides the opportunity to replace models, such as the above-mentioned
    SCHED, with automation-model systems applied to lateral moving systems coupled
    with sensors that provide for variable rate irrigation and nutrients applications,
    thus moving from the simple water scheduling to precision agriculture (Han et
    al., 2009). A review on variable rate issues for sprinkler systems, including
    an analysis of sensor systems usable for such purposes, was recently proposed
    by O’Shaughnessy et al. (2016). Similar approaches are used with drip-irrigated
    horticultural crops (Perea et al., 2017) and woody crops (Fernández, 2017). Payero
    et al. (2017) developed a communication system for transferring wireless soil
    water sensors data to an open-sources platform (https://thingspeak.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020), where data are hosted and visualized in the form of usable information
    to support decision-making. However, SWB models remain popular tools for supporting
    irrigation scheduling. For operational irrigation schedules, using real-time models
    requires daily updated actual weather data, which may not be fully available.
    Thus, alternative sources of climatic data have been tested showing good accuracy,
    such as the use of re-analysis data for estimating PM-ETo (e.g. Paredes et al.,
    2018a), or satellite derived climatic products as referred by Paredes et al. (2020b).
    Since weather forecasts generally provide for incomplete data sets (precipitation
    and temperature), computing ETo requires simplified approaches using temperature
    data only, namely the Penman-Monteith temperature (PMT) and the Hargreaves and
    Samani equation (HS-eq) (Paredes and Pereira, 2019; Paredes et al., 2020a). Thus,
    a main challenge in using models for supporting irrigation scheduling is to use
    short-term weather forecasts that could support real-time irrigation scheduling
    and, considering larger range forecasts, to plan irrigation in advance (Kusunose
    and Mahmood, 2016; Klemm and McPherson, 2017). Studies on the use of short-term
    weather forecasts to support irrigation scheduling focus more on precipitation
    than on climatic demand (ETo). The study by Cai et al. (2009) focused on the use
    of short-term weather forecast messages provided by the National Meteorological
    Institute of China for estimating ETo and supporting irrigation scheduling, showing
    the good adequacy particularly for estimation of crop ET using a SWB model. A
    similar but updated approach is reported by Zhang et al. (2018). Lorite et al.
    (2015) developed a methodology based on the use of weather forecast data from
    freely and easily accessible online information for determining irrigation scheduling,
    reporting good accuracy for ETo estimations. Other studies focus on evaluating
    the use of short-term forecasts for real-time decision support for irrigation
    scheduling in terms of net profit and water savings. Cai et al. (2011) assessed
    the use of rainfall short-term forecasts provided by the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Despite the imperfect forecasts, results showed
    net profit of up to 8.5 % as well as high water savings ranging from 11.0 to 26.9
    % when compared to modelled soil moisture information. The study by Hejazi et
    al. (2014) focused on the use of reanalysis-based short-term weather forecasts
    relative to rainfall and ETo for supporting irrigation decision-making, reporting
    on average an expected profit of up to 3 % and a water saving ranging from 4 to
    6 %. Jamal et al. (2018), using the Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model,
    reported an overall good performance of using probabilistic seasonal weather forecasts
    to support chickpea real-time irrigation scheduling. Differently, Linker et al.
    (2018), using the AquaCrop model for irrigation scheduling and yield predictions
    coupled with 4 to 6-day weather forecasts, reported an overall inadequacy of the
    forecasts for several locations (Denmark, Greece, Italy and Portugal) and crops
    (potato, cotton, tomato and maize); in addition, these authors also outlined that
    there was no considerable advantage of using those forecasts relative to historical
    average data. Overall, the use of short-term weather forecasts keeps being a bottleneck
    due to their uncertainty/inaccuracy. Combining SWB model predictions with plant
    indicators (Ferreira, 2017) and/or soil sensors, is also an option that has been
    investigated, e.g. Cancela et al. (2015) used SIMDualKc with an automatic control
    irrigation system supported by a low cost wireless soil moisture sensors network.
    Thus, these tools rely less on weather data, and more on soil and plant sensors,
    which calls for new approaches in using the FAO56 method. An example of such new
    approaches is the model reported by Schwartz et al. (2020) aimed at actual Kc
    for maize when deficit irrigation is used and non-uniform soils also affect the
    crop and the available soil water. The use of soil water sensors is recognized
    as having a great importance for the accuracy of modern SWB modeling approaches
    (El-Naggar et al., 2020). The use of canopy temperature sensors is also recognized
    as contributing to improved accuracy (Han et al., 2018). Remote sensing data provide
    the opportunity to model at large scale and they typically fall in the domain
    of Big Data. This includes both data originating from unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV, Ortega-Farias et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2019) and satellites. Two main
    approaches may be considered: energy balance models and vegetation indices. Models
    such as SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm of Land), TSEB (Two-Source Energy
    Balance) and METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration)
    are quite accurate in assessing crop evapotranspiration from the energy balance
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998; Allen et al., 2011a; French et al., 2015; Dhungel
    et al., 2016). ET from remote sensing may also be used to derive Kc or Kcb values.
    Vegetation indices, mainly the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
    the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), are often used to estimate Kc and Kcb
    values (Johnson and Trout, 2012; Pôças et al., 2015; Campos et al., 2017). Satellite
    Kc data are then assimilated into SWB models. Another issue is the assessment
    of crop stress indicators from remote sensing (Pôças et al., 2017), namely using
    UAV. The use of optical/thermal satellite imagery at farm level would also allow
    drawing water requirement maps and implementing precise irrigation (Hendrickx
    et al., 2016). Melton et al. (2012, 2020) described the SIMS framework that combines
    NASA’s Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS), Landsat and MODIS
    satellite imagery, and a surface sensors network to map indicators of crop irrigation
    demand and to develop information products to support irrigation management and
    other water use decisions. Li et al. (2018) described and tested a new method
    for sequential data assimilation that allows integrating soil water content measurements
    into the Community Land Model (CLM) aiming to improve irrigation scheduling. Evaluation
    of the method was performed on several citrus orchards allowing to save on average
    24 % of water relative to the farmers’ irrigation schedules while the use of the
    irrigation schedules based upon the FAO56 SWB provided for similar average water
    savings of 22 %. The development of mobile and on-line applications (apps) has
    also been investigated, with support of cloud computing and IoT. This kind of
    tools allows to provide to farmers easy-to-use information (Car et al., 2012),
    particularly when the information is conveyed using text messaging service (SMS).
    Todorovic et al. (2016) described and evaluated an automatized decision support
    system (Hydro-Tech) available as an app; Hydro-Tech integrates FAO56 methods,
    including the SWB, with continuous soil sensor-based monitoring, short-term weather
    forecasts, remote monitoring of the water supply network, diverse tools for data-cloud
    processing, and an economic and eco-efficiency assessment tool for optimizing
    irrigation scheduling. Evaluations performed in farmers’ fields with diverse crops
    (vegetables and fruit orchards) in the Apulia region, Italy, showed potential
    water savings ranging from 5 % to 20 % relative to the schedules used by farmers.
    Goap et al. (2018) presented an IoT-based smart irrigation management system,
    available as an app, using machine learning technology to predict crop irrigation
    requirements when combining sensing soil moisture along with the forecasts of
    precipitation, air temperature and humidity. Good accuracy of soil moisture predictions
    was reported thus allowing improving irrigation scheduling. An irrigation scheduling
    app (Bluleaf®) was evaluated by Abi-Saab et al. (2019) using field observations
    and showing its accuracy for estimations of soil moisture content and leaf water
    potential along the wheat season. In addition, the tool was able to enhance water
    savings by almost 26 % relative to the farmer’s traditional schedule. The progression
    of the satellite-based SEBAL model into an operational tool for irrigation scheduling
    is of particular interest. The private venture eLEAF (https://eleaf.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020) developed a number of applications of interest to irrigation scheduling,
    namely PiMapping®7 (Pixel Intelligence Mapping), CropLook for field crops, as
    well as GrapeLook and FruitLook for grapes and fruit trees in the Western Cape,
    South Africa. The applications are based on satellite information to produce evapotranspiration
    maps and data that farmers and practitioners can access through a web portal (https://www.fruitlook.co.za/,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). A similar service providing information that can be
    accessed with different devices is IrriSat (https://www.irrisat.com/en/home-2,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). The Portuguese Association of Horticulture also makes
    available to farmers an app for real-time irrigation advice, Manna Irrigation
    Intelligence (https://aphorticultura.pt/2020/01/13/manna-irrigation-intelligence-tecnologia-de-deteccao-remota/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), which bases upon a SWB model, remote sensing data and
    weather forecasts. Advances in ICT provide great opportunities to make use of
    large volumes of data and sources (sensors, models, remote sensing, images, tweets,
    farmers’ knowledge and experience, etc.). For using the Kc-ETo approach, ETo may
    be estimated with reduced datasets using the PMT and HS-eq approaches which require,
    among other, ground observed data, gridded and reanalysis data, and/or Meteosat
    Second Generation products, as well as forecasted weather data (Allen et al.,
    2020; Paredes et al., 2020a, b). Kc data sets refer to the updated tabulated standard
    Kc and Kcb values (Pereira et al., 2020a,b) and to the use of the A&P approach
    to compute Kcb and Kc from fc and height (Allen and Pereira, 2009; Pereira et
    al., 2020c,d). The challenge is to streamline these diversely structured data
    into usable and reliable information. Although major advances have been documented
    in the literature, the level of uptake is still not widespread mainly due to the
    need to own devices, applications, costs of services, etc. Maintenance of these
    systems can also be expensive in terms of hardware (e.g. sensors exposed in the
    field), securing a steady power supply, network and software stability, data storage
    infrastructure, security and access control. Nevertheless, given the volume of
    usable information that can potentially be produced to optimize farming production,
    it can be expected that IoT will become a more and more prominent feature in smart
    farming. 6. Conclusions and recommendations The current review has shown that
    SWB models have an enormous potential for irrigation scheduling including the
    assessment of alternative crop management practices, as well as biophysical and
    economic indicators of crop water productivity. The FAO56 methodology adopted
    in SWB is very accurate with moderate data requirements; simpler SWB models have
    been adopted for supporting irrigation scheduling but likely at a greater risk
    of water balance inaccuracies, namely when deep percolation and capillary rise
    are not properly taken into consideration and when Kc estimation is less appropriate.
    Research users may also prefer to adopt mechanistic, high-input intensive models
    having capabilities to simulate crop growth and yield as depending not only on
    water, but also on nutrients and other practices. Trends for future also refer
    to the adoption of crop growth and yield models for irrigation scheduling, at
    least for research purposes; the adoption of the FAO56 method in the DSSAT models
    already performed (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) consists of an excellent foundation
    for this purpose. Easy to parameterize and calibrate, field and crop-focused SWB
    models will likely continue to be used by farmers and farm advisers as well as
    using the cloud data facilities at the large scale. However, trends for IoT and
    cloud computing seem to lean towards simple crop ET computations, likely using
    the Kc-ETo approach. Then, ETo is likely estimated from temperature using the
    FAO56 recommended approaches (PMT and HS-eq), or is derived from reanalysis products,
    gridded data or Meteosat Second Generation products, as well as using forecasted
    weather data. Future trends are also envisaged with farmers using models with
    ready to use information through mobile phones and smartphone apps. This approach
    is easier to apply with IoT or cloud data. In fact, simpler models provide acceptable
    to good indicative information to support basic irrigation decisions while more
    complex models are difficult to be deployed for the variety of users in terms
    of crops and cropping practices and management. It is therefore recommended that
    IoT models use the FAO56 method, including the updated FAO56 temperature based
    ETo, and the updated data sets of Kc and Kcb, or with application of the A&P approach
    to estimate Kcb and Kc from the fraction of ground cover and crop height, that
    are well proved and tested at various locations. Innovation in cloud data and
    IoT models needs to enlarge the present focus on solving data acquisition and
    sensors management to the quality of crop and ET computations, since this approach
    may support attaining better water productivity and water saving, which are definitely
    relevant in terms of facing climate change. A main opportunity for future is the
    use of remote sensing and the integration of remotely-sensed data into the SWB
    and crop growth models. Two main approaches may be considered (energy balance
    models and vegetation indices) as well as diverse sources of information (satellite
    imagery, imagery obtained from drones and infrared thermometry measurements on
    the ground). The dual Kc approach is already used in remote sensing applications
    for estimating ETc of various crops, which compared well with the Kcb estimated
    using the SIMDualKc model for many crops. Thus, results show that for real-time
    irrigation management the Kcb derived from remotely sensed vegetation indices
    may be used to adjust SIMDualKc and similar models’ simulations in near real-time,
    particularly when using sensors from satellites with high revisiting frequency.
    An effective exchange between research and practice represents a great challenge
    in SWB models use and development. Research uses models to better and more accurately
    understand the processes relative to soil water fluxes and transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum. Irrigators need that a SWB model responds to their need for knowing
    when and how much water to apply to a crop in a given environment and in a defined
    development stage. The users require timely and simple responses, very easy to
    interpret. SWB models for research and practice already are, and will keep being
    distinct. The question is therefore how and which information created from research
    shall pass into practice and which type of SWB will facilitate both new knowledge
    and its transfer to practice. Likely this requires that research considers transferability
    as a main option, but that freedom of research is not affected by the need for
    transferability of results. Is the development of more and more sophisticated
    models a need? Is scrutiny of field data quality a priority? Is the consideration
    of the energy balance, namely through crop coefficients, an essential approach
    in research? Is empirical research, with a minimal use of models to be continued?
    Would it be advantageous to bring into research the models used in practice? These
    are questions that future research should debate and substantiate. Declaration

    Get rights and content Abstract Green roofs can notably modify the thermal properties
    of the building envelope and adjacent air to bring environmental benefits. This
    study investigates the heat flux dynamics of the tropical green roof ecosystem
    to provide a scientific basis for design and management. Green roof experimental
    plots were established to monitor the total solar radiation, net radiation, and
    micrometeorological parameters. The data permit calculation of sensible and latent
    heat fluxes using the Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) method. The results demonstrated
    the life cycle characteristics of heat flux components. The dynamic changes of
    sensible (H), latent (λE) and soil (G) heat fluxes were denoted by single-peak
    quadratic curves. Net radiation (Rn) was largely determined by quantity and variation
    trends of λE, reaching at 1300 h a maximum λE of 655 W m−2 and maximum H of 369
    W m−2. Temporal heat-flux fluctuations were strongly correlated with meteorological
    variables. Extreme values of H and λE correlated well with precipitation and temperature
    (R2 = 0.78). Dynamics of heat-flux magnitude and partitioning demonstrated notable
    differences by daily and season periods. They displayed considerable variations
    in flux partitioning, with Bowen ratios strongly correlated with weather conditions
    and vegetation types. The energy budget of the green roof ecosystem is unbalanced
    with a heat loss of about 15.5% caused by soil and canopy heat reserve. The passive
    indoor cooling effect under the green roof is attributed to the unbalanced energy
    closure. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Bowen ratioEnergy

    1. Introduction Green roofs contribute to environmental improvement and sustainable
    living, especially in compact cities (Gomez et al., 1998, Miyawaki, 1998, Niachou
    et al., 2001, Lazzarin et al., 2005, Santamouris et al., 2006, Alvarado and Martínez,
    2008, Miranville et al., 2008, Collins et al., 2009). Their environmental benefits
    are derived from functioning as living ecosystems. The cooling, shading and insulation
    afforded by green roofs can significantly limit heat flow into buildings (Del
    Barrio, 1998, Wong et al., 2003, Sailor et al., 2008, Teemusk and Mander, 2009,
    Teemusk and Mander, 2010). Green roofs reduce the heat transfer through the roof
    to reduce indoor heat gain and cooling energy consumption. The heat transfer processes
    of a flat roof, such as convection, conduction and radiation, are modified by
    the green roof through the thermal characteristics and surface properties of the
    constituent materials, evapotranspiration (ET) and metabolic processes of plants
    (Theodosiou, 2003, Koehler, 2004, Martens et al., 2008). Energy exchange and transmission
    of a green roof ecosystem are influenced by weather conditions, plant physiological
    functions, and building structures. Factors that regulate heat transfer include
    the external air temperature and humidity, direct solar radiation (clear sky or
    overcast), building materials, ratio of hard to vegetated surfaces, roofing material
    and color, soil depth, exposed soil color, soil water content, and vegetation
    type and coverage. For a green roof, the heat flux aspect of its energy balance
    is composed of three parts: sensible, latent and soil heat fluxes. Evaporation
    is an integral and pertinent part of the hydrothermal balance package (Ouyang
    and Haghighat, 1991, Grigoletti et al., 2008). The partitioning between latent
    and sensible heat fluxes is critical in determining the hydrological cycle, boundary
    layer development, and microclimatic conditions. Two key issues of flux partitioning
    are the variabilities of partitioning across different climates and ecosystems,
    and the mechanisms that induce such variabilities (Lindberg et al., 2004, Fang,
    2008). Energy partitioning at the surface is a complex function of interactions
    between plant physiology and development of the atmospheric boundary layer (Cellier
    and Olioso, 1993, Emilsson, 2008). Despite conceptual and practical complexities,
    it is important to understand the underlying factors and processes of energy flows
    and associated energy savings brought by green roofs (Fritschen and Simpson, 1989,
    Nichols, 1994, Cóstola et al., 2009). The methods for studying the energy balance
    of ecosystems are classified into three general types: heat balance method, hydrologic
    water evaporation method, and micrometeorology method. The heat balance method
    employs the principle of energy conservation to calculate heat transfers, and
    the convective heat flows are determined by heat transfer equation for surface
    and air temperatures (Lacroix, 1993, Malek and Bingham, 1997, Martens et al.,
    2008). The hydrologic water evaporation method is favored for monitoring the effect
    of long-term energetics due to vegetation changes. The micrometeorological method
    is often adopted in field control experiments (Geros et al., 1999). It employs
    the Penman–Monteith equation, Priestley–Taylor equation, Bowen ratio, and vapor
    gradient concept (Cellier and Olioso, 1993, Nichols, 1994). The Bowen ratio energy
    balance (BREB) method is widely used in micrometeorology study to estimate actual
    or potential ET. Compared with eddy covariance or water balance, BREB is fairly
    robust when Bowen ratios are mostly positive (Malek and Bingham, 1997). The BREB
    method estimates latent heat flux from a surface using measurements of air temperature
    and humidity gradients, net radiation, and soil heat flux (Fritschen and Simpson,
    1989). Despite its limitations in application experiments, the advantages of BREB
    are straight-forward and simple measurements in calculating heat fluxes. Moreover,
    it can estimate continuous heat fluxes at fine time scales (intervals of <1 h)
    and requires little information about surface aerodynamic characteristics. Previous
    studies provide valuable background on heat flux and energy balance of green roofs
    (Cellier and Olioso, 1993, Nichols, 1994, Del Barrio, 1998, Kumar and Kaushik,
    2005, Fang, 2008, Grigoletti et al., 2008, Martens et al., 2008). Most studies
    emphasized the engineering or horticultural aspects, and seldom treated green
    roof as an ecological system. The objective of this study is to investigate from
    the microclimatalogical perspective the dynamics of heat flux and energy balance
    of the green roof ecosystem. We designed field experiments to monitor the total
    solar radiation, net radiation, and micrometeorological parameters. The data were
    used to calculate the sensible and latent heat fluxes of the green roof with the
    help of the BREB method. We explored the effects of different vegetation covers
    on water absorption and thermal transmission under different field microclimatic
    regimes. The findings could provide a scientific basis to optimize the design
    and management of the green roof as an integrated ecosystem and as a natural passive
    cooling entity. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental design and data acquisition
    The experiment was conducted on the roof of the Runme Shaw Building at the University
    of Hong Kong to establish a thermal reduction map of different scenarios. Fig.
    1, Fig. 2 illustrate the details of the experimental setup. It consisted of four
    8 m × 8 m plots, namely, a control and three vegetation types of different growth
    forms, plant height, leaf area and biomass structure. They included a shrub (Duranta
    repens, Golden Dewdrop), a perennial herbaceous groundcover (Arachis pintoi, Perennial
    Peanut), and a lawn grass (Zoysia tenuifolia, Korean Velvet Grass) (Table 1).
    The plots were retrofitted on the four-storied building, with a flat roof concrete
    slab protected by a waterproofing membrane, thermal insulation panels, screed
    and cement tiles. A proprietary multiple-layer green roof system (Nophadrain,
    Kirkrade, the Netherlands) was laid directly on the tile surface with a 2% gradient
    to shed drainage water. From bottom to top, it contains five layers: root barrier,
    plastic (high impact polystyrene) drainage, geotextile filter, rockwool water
    retention, and mineral soil mixed with 20% v/v mature compost (Fig. 1). The soil
    with sandy loam texture (Soil Survey Staff, 1999), facilitates free drainage.
    The soil thickness varies between plots, with grass at 35 mm, groundcover at 50
    mm and shrub at 80 mm. An automatic sprinkler irrigation system, which sprays
    daily at 1000 h for 1 h, provides supplementary water supply. Download : Download

    and soil conditions were automatically recorded at a 15 min interval by data loggers
    (8160, Lufft, Fellbach, Germany). Four solar radiation components were recorded:
    incoming and outgoing shortwave, and incoming and outgoing longwave. A four-in-one
    combination type of radiometer (CNR1, Kipp & Zonen, the Netherlands) was mounted
    horizontally at 150 cm above the soil surface. Soil heat flux was monitored by
    a dedicated thermal transmission sensor (HFP01SC of Hukseflux, the Netherlands).
    Soil moisture and temperature sensors (respectively S-SMC and S-TMB, Onset Hobo,
    USA) were buried in different layers of the substrate (soil, rockwool, and the
    original tile surface at the bottom of the green roof setup). Surface temperature
    (bare tile for the control plot, vegetation canopy for the treatment plots) was
    assessed by an infrared radiometer made for outdoor use (SI-111, Apogee, Logan,
    UT, USA). The thermister air temperature probes (8160.TFF, Lufft, Fellbach, Germany)
    with radiation shields were installed at 20, 60, and 200 cm above the ground surface.
    Meteorological factors were observed using a weather station setup (Onset Hobo),
    including air relative humidity (RH), air temperature, dew point temperature,
    wind speed, wind direction, and rainfall. Table 2 lists an extract of the raw
    data set acquired by the sensors. Table 2. An extract of the raw data acquired

    of energy between sensible and latent heat fluxes was computed by the BREB method
    (Malek and Bingham, 1997, Nichols, 1994, Martens et al., 2008). Using our microclimatic
    data, values of net radiation, air temperature gradient, vapor pressure gradient,
    and soil heat flux were used to solve the energy budget, given by heat flux model:
    (1) where Rn is the net radiation flux; H is sensible heat flux which is characterized
    by the surface and atmospheric turbulence between the different forms of heat
    exchange; λE is latent heat flux, referring to the water vapor exchange between
    lower atmosphere and ground, including evaporation from the soil, transpiration
    from vegetation, and latent heat flux denoted by evapotranspiration; G is soil
    heat flux which involves internal heat exchange in the soil; SWi is incoming shortwave
    and SWo outgoing shortwave radiation; LWi is incoming longwave and LWo outgoing
    longwave radiation; SWn is net shortwave (SWi − SWo) and LWn, net longwave (LWi
    − LWo). We adopted W m−2 as the energy unit. The Bowen ratio (β) registers the
    relationship between sensible heat flux to latent heat flux (H/λE), which is determined
    as: (2) where ΔT and Δe are respectively temperature and vapor pressure differences
    between lower and upper levels respectively (kPa), γ is the psychrometric constant;
    ρ is the air pressure (101.23 kPa); Cp is the specific heat of air at constant
    pressure (4190 J kg−1 K−1); ɛ is the ratio between molecular weights of water
    vapor and air (0.622); λ is latent heat of vaporization of water (kJ kg−1), TL
    is air temperature at a certain height (L), Ea is the actual water vapor pressure;
    and E0 is saturation water vapor pressure at a certain temperature (TL). 3. Results
    and discussion 3.1. Dynamics of heat flux Diurnal and seasonal variations of heat
    flux on green roofs present characteristic hyperbola curves (Fig. 3, Fig. 4),
    showing respectively the net absorption and release of heat energy for diurnal
    and seasonal cycles. For the diurnal cycle, representative data for three typical
    weather days (sunny, cloudy and rainy), in four seasons (winter-January, spring-April,
    summer-July and autumn-October) yield 12 focus days for detailed analysis of the
    four experimental treatments (Fig. 3). They depict the commonality of energy fluxes
    in the temporal-seasonal and major weather patterns. Download : Download full-size

    heat flux (Rn, λE, H and G) variations of four green roof experimental treatments
    in 2008. The Rn, H and λE increase from zero at 0600–0800 h in the morning to
    peak values at 1200–1300 h. They then decrease to zero at around 1800–2000 h,
    and continue to slide into negative values from 2000 h to early morning at 0600–0800
    h. The energy deficit after sunset and at night is more notable for Rn and less
    so for H and λE. G demonstrates a time lag of about 2 h, peaking around 1400–1500
    h with a minimum at about 0600 h. The heat-flux fluctuation is positive when incoming
    radiation exceeds outgoing radiation in sunny daytime. At night, Rn is usually
    negative with domination by outgoing longwave radiation. Rn is zero when the incoming
    and outgoing components are in balance. The magnitude of Rn on green roofs is
    twice that of H, which is comparable to λE. The maximum Rn reaches about 800 W
    m−2 at 1300 h on a summer sunny day in July. For comparison, the maximum H is
    about 400 W m−2 at 1300 h on the same summer sunny day. The variations of H occur
    mainly in daytime, with notable nocturnal suppression when the air temperature
    is relatively low. λE has a similar maximum value of about 400 W m−2 and follows
    a similar temporal pattern. The maximum Rn is nearly twice the maximum H or λE.
    The processes of heat fluxes controlling surface exchanges are typically more
    active in daytime than at night. The energy balance closure statistics and micrometeorological
    analysis indicate that the eddy covariance is less significant during nocturnal
    periods. H is typically negative and λE is typically near-zero at night. In daytime,
    G is usually rather low at less than 10% of Rn. The seasonal heat fluxes on green
    roofs vary with the fluctuations of the underlying meteorological driving forces.
    H and λE follow clearly the seasonal solar radiation regime, with deviations brought
    by the monsoonal rainfall rhythm. G remains markedly low throughout the year in
    comparison with other heat fluxes, with meager quantities in winter and only a
    slight rise in the warm months peaking in summer. The seasonal trends of H and
    λE are affected by rainfall and temperature (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Seasonal H drops
    to a minimum value in winter, especially in January and February, and reaches
    a maximum in summer peaking in July and August. In terms of daily weather condition,
    the maximum occurs on summer sunny day, and the minimum on winter rainy day. λE
    follows a similar seasonal pattern, attaining a maximum value in summer with moderate
    rainfall in July and August, and a minimum in winter with no rainfall in January
    and February (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). By daily weather condition, the maximum occurs
    on the summer sunny day and the minimum on the winter rainy day. The highest flux
    occurs when high temperature coincides with an adequate supply of water to enhance
    evaporation. The diurnal range of λE reaches the widest in summer and narrowest
    in winter, with medium values for both spring and autumn. For all seasons, the
    sunny day registers the widest diurnal range, with suppression on cloudy day,
    and diminishing to almost zero on rainy day. In winter, the subdued λE is mainly
    associated with soil evaporation which is feeble due to low temperature and meager
    rainfall. In summer, the strong λE is augmented by the dual process of evapotranspiration
    under a high temperature regime and sustained by liberal rainfall. Negative λE
    occurs only on the summer rainy day from 1900 to 0400 h. Negative λE exists in
    nighttime in most cases due to net radiation balance effects. In general, negative
    λE indicates a net release of latent energy back to the environment due to condensation
    or freezing. The extreme values of H and λE correlate well with rainfall and temperature
    (Table 3). Rainfall demonstrates differential effects on H and λE (Fig. 4). In
    summer, moderate rainfalls in July and August suppress both H and λE, but not
    Rn. It indicates that the summer rainfall events are mainly of short duration
    and high intensity with little effects on direct solar radiation. However, excessive
    rainfalls in June of prolonged duration curtail sunshine to lower notably Rn and
    λE, with H showing no depression response. In contrast, the limited rainfall associated
    with the prolonged cloudy-humid weather in spring in April, when temperature is
    not high, depresses Rn, H and λE. Table 3. Pearson correlation coefficients between
    net radiation (Rn) of green roof ecosystem and three meteorological factors for

    λE and G) differ notably by experimental treatment (control and vegetation types)
    and temporal groups (diurnal and seasonal changes) (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5). Rn
    fluctuations for both groups are greater than H and λE. The difference in heat
    flux components between grass and shrub ranges from 83 to 207 W m−2. The Bowen
    ratio (β) extends over a wide range from 0.5 to 1.24 (Table 4). The control has
    the lowest value (0.50–0.57), followed by grass (0.70–0.75), groundcover (0.79–0.83)
    and shrub (0.83–1.24). β increases sequentially with the complexity of biomass
    structure and leaf-area surface: control < grass < groundcover < shrub. The β
    of the control has been raised mainly due to the exceptionally low λE. The low
    vegetation height of grass and groundcover generated similar β values with a comparable
    narrow range. Their small and simple biomass structure enhances evapotranspiration
    due to irrigation effect, leading to increases in both H and λE, but relatively
    more for H in comparison with the control. The taller shrub vegetation with higher
    leaf area and more complex biomass structure notably raises β value and widens
    its range (0.50–1.24) (Fig. 3 and Table 4). The changes in β display a trend similar
    to mean daytime evaporation of the four treatments. The variability of β between
    vegetation treatments could be related to fluctuations of soil moisture due to
    differential ability of roots to access soil water. Average β values vary according
    to vegetation types and weather conditions. Download : Download full-size image

    impacts of meteorological conditions on heat flux dynamics can throw light on
    their interactions. The meteorological conditions affect the Bowen ratio in complex
    ways. From the BREB modeling, we notice that it relies on accurate estimates of
    the Bowen ratio, which in turn relies on accurate measurement of temperature and
    vapor-pressure gradients. The heat flux dynamics calculated by BREB data show
    that the sensible heat component is significant and the evaporative potential
    of the net radiation is greater than actual conversion to latent heat. Physiological
    characteristics between different treatments may cause discrepancies in the meteorological
    influence. The most obvious canopy difference is due to height which leads to
    variations in surface roughness and atmospheric coupling. Thus, grass is poorly
    coupled to the atmosphere whereas shrub is more coupled, so that the control on
    their evapotranspiration is quite different. The results show variations in the
    heat flux of different treatments which is dependent on meteorological conditions.
    On days with low radiation and cloud cover, and particularly associated with rainfall,
    the canopy remains wet for at least some of the evaporative period, and the latent
    heat flux is different from dry and bright days. The difference could be attributed
    to the fact that the evaporation rate of intercepted raindrops is faster than
    the transpiration rate from the plant which is regulated by stomatal resistance.
    The parameters that affect stomatal resistance are not constant, and in particular
    they are known to vary diurnally and with weather conditions to account for some
    deviations in the results. 3.2. Coupling heat flux dynamics with weather conditions
    The temporal heat-flux fluctuations are strongly correlated with meteorological
    variables (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Weather data analysis shows that temperature is one
    of the key determinants of heat flux. Fluctuations of λE are inversely related
    to atmospheric pressure. High values of λE (200–300 W m−2) correspond to low atmosphere
    pressure (100.4 Pa) in summer. Low values of λE (30–50 W m−2) match the high air
    pressure in winter (102.0 Pa). A similar relationship exists between λE and air
    temperature (average 26 °C in summer and 15 °C in winter). For the whole year,
    the minimum λE occurs in the coldest month of January, and maximum latent flux
    in the hottest month of July. λE correlates positively with saturated water vapor
    pressure deficit (R2 = 0.78, p < 0.05), although it shows a fluctuation pattern
    similar to atmospheric pressure and air temperature. The lower λE happens in dry
    winter months and higher λE in wet summer months. λE and H respond differently
    to precipitation. Diurnal variations in the components of surface energy balance
    can be plotted by BREB at hourly intervals (Fig. 3). To analyze the diurnal variations
    in energy balance, three representative weather conditions are selected (sunny,
    cloudy, and rainy) in four seasons. Latent heat flux increases after rainfall
    in both daytime and nighttime, ranging from 4.7 W m−2 (nighttime of January 26)
    to 42.3 W m−2 (daytime of July 15). The augmented amplitude of λE and H is wider
    in daytime (5.7 W m−2) than nighttime (3.6 W m−2). H is reduced by rainfall, dropping
    considerably by 20–75% after rainfall in daytime. Rainfall events of longer duration
    and greater magnitude lead to sharp decrease in H. For example, H drops by 75%
    on April 19 with 153 mm of rainfall, compared to H on April 16. However, it increases
    if rainfall occurs in nighttime or early morning, such as the spike in the morning
    of July 12 (Fig. 3). This may be related to the insulation effect of clouds on
    the thermal radiation regime of the ground. With the onset of the summer rainy
    season, λE responds in a way opposite to H. Rainfall can trigger a rise in λE,
    and the increase can be sustained if the rain continues for a certain period.
    If the rainfall persists for a long time, λE can instead be suppressed. Thus λE
    is more affected by weather conditions in summer than in other seasons. For example,
    a short rainfall event in July adds λE of 94 W m−2. However, low λE values are
    associated with protracted rainfalls in April and October. In summer, the temperature
    rise coupled with increase in rainfall gradually lift λE over time. In winter,
    rainfall mainly establishes relatively low and brief peaks in λE, because individual
    rainfall events have limited augmenting effect on ET. Moreover, winter rainfall
    events are seldom protracted, which seldom suppress λE. These phenomena can be
    explained by the combined effects of high RH and high temperature in wet summer,
    and the combined effects of low RH and strong wind in dry winter. Meanwhile, daytime
    H is notably reduced during high monthly rainfall in July. Overall, the arrival
    of the summer rainy season can suppress H but elevate λE. Evaporation is the major
    cause of λE, which is notably shaped by soil moisture. The diurnal fluctuations
    of soil moisture of grass and groundcover treatments demonstrate a similarly acute
    pattern (high frequency of fluctuations) across a wide amplitude, whereas shrub
    has relatively subdued changes. Grass has the highest soil moisture content, and
    shrub the lowest. Grass has wider fluctuations in soil moisture content which
    is more sensitive to moisture in the near-surface air than groundcover and shrub.
    Soil moisture responds with a time lag to external water supplies and internal
    water losses due to evaporation, root withdrawal and drainage. In a daily cycle,
    soil moisture of the three treatments peaks significantly at 1000 and 2200 h.
    Grass is the wettest, followed by groundcover and shrub. The average soil moisture
    contents of grass, groundcover and shrub are respectively 20.7%, 19.8% and 19.4%
    in winter, and 25.3%, 20.8% and 19.4% in summer. Soil moisture is sensitive to
    precipitation but mediated by vegetation biomass structure. For instance, on April
    19 with 47.4 mm of rainfall from 1400 to 1600 h during which soil moisture reaches
    the peak. At the initial raining stage, soil moisture registers a slight increase
    in grass, but with little effect on groundcover and shrub due to canopy interception.
    With continuation of rain, all treatments indicate obvious increase in soil moisture.
    Plots with thick soil (Section 2.1) induce higher soil moisture content with less
    fluctuation. When rainfall reaches the maximum intensity after 30 min, soil moisture
    gradually rises in all treatments to attain the maximum after 1 h. When rainfall
    begins to wane, soil moisture declines notably faster in grass, followed by groundcover.
    Thereafter, soil moisture remains rather stable for a long period. The rapid decline
    of soil moisture in grass can be explained by fast evaporation loss. Rainfall
    leads to increase in soil moisture, which in turn triggers a corresponding increase
    in evaporation, whereupon λE is augmented. The Bowen ratio can fluctuate quite
    a bit with variations in precipitation and soil moisture. The singularity of the
    Bowen ratio exists preferably in the following conditions: weak turbulence, stable
    stratified stability, dry soil, and humid air. The existence of a singularity
    state renders its dependence on these five variables very complicated. When soil
    moisture availability is greater than the soil capacity, the Bowen ratio is likely
    to be inversely proportional to soil moisture availability. When atmospheric relative
    humidity increases, its absolute value also increases. When the absolute surface
    net radiation increases, its absolute value rises. The impact of net radiation
    on the Bowen ratio is stronger at nighttime than daytime. Soil moisture exerts
    an even stronger impact on it during the daytime unstable condition. However,
    it demonstrates weak responses to changes in soil moisture availability at night.
    It is more sensitive to changes in turbulent intensity. Its response to variations
    in atmospheric relative humidity over a vegetated area is also weak. 3.3. Impact
    of heat flux transmission on cooling effect 3.3.1. Heat flux transmission Rn determines
    λE amount and variation trends. The above analysis shows that the dynamic changes
    of H, λE and G present single-peak quadratic curves. For a diurnal cycle, the
    maximum values of H and λE occur at 1200–1300 h, and G with a time lag at 1500
    h. Seasonal variations are obvious for all three energy flux components of the
    green roof ecosystem. From January to March, H exceeds λE, with average H reaching
    the maximum in March. H exceeds λE by about 24 W m−2 at noon in March. From early
    April, H declines with increase in λE, and thereafter the two values converge.
    In July, the average λE and Rn values reach the maximum in the year. λE exceeds
    H by about 47 W m−2 at noon in July. From August to November, the heat-flux dynamics
    between λE and H is opposite to the earlier trend (January to April), with λE
    declining vis-à-vis H increase. Rn presents smooth hyperbola curves under cloudless
    sunny weather. The maximum Rn occurs at 1200–1300 h in July at around 844 W m−2,
    which is commensurate with the levels of λE and H. G is relatively small compared
    with other variables in the energy balance equation. It is a break-even variable
    in terms of the seasonal cycle. The dynamic diurnal and seasonal changes of G
    is moderate, and it is similar to the variation trend of Rn but with a time lag.
    The maximum G attains only 13.2 W m−2 at 1300–1500 h in July. G is positively
    correlated with soil moisture. It shows that G responds quickly to notable soil
    moisture changes, but has no obvious response to smaller soil moisture variations.
    3.3.2. Cooling effects of green roof from unbalanced energy closure There is a
    considerable range in flux partitioning characteristics (Rn, λE, H and β) (Table
    4). Variability in β across different groups can be analyzed by quantifying general
    weather conditions and group characteristics that control flux partitioning. The
    changes in β due to meteorological control are proportional to vapor pressure
    deficit and net radiation. Flux partitioning by vegetation and substrate is controlled
    by water vapor transport, a large amount of which tends to increase β. The control
    and grass have the lowest β (0.25–0.60), followed by groundcover (0.71–0.83),
    and shrub has the highest (0.79–1.24). Notable variabilities exist between seasons,
    and the most prominent difference between groups is seasonal (from December to
    February). It has the highest Rn (140 W m−2 on average) and lowest β (0.5–0.81)
    in summer, and lowest Rn (37 W m−2) and highest β in winter (1.24). Cooling effects
    under the green roof ecosystem is attributed to the imbalance in energy closure.
    Energy of the green roof ecosystem is unbalanced with the loss of about 15.5%
    due to the lack of soil and canopy heat reserves. The energy balance is different
    between rainy and cloudy days, with less energy loss on rainy than cloudy days,
    and especially with energy surplus on summer rainy days. The results show that
    the sum of H and λE is less than the difference between Rn and G (λE + H < Rn
    − G) of the green roof ecosystem through the analysis of key variables in the
    energy balance system (Rn, λE, H and G). Thus the energy budget is not closed
    in the green roof ecosystem. Energy consumption (λE + H) is less than energy availability
    (Rn − G), with an average ratio of 0.87, indicating that about 13% of the energy
    loss is absorbed by the building structure. Energy loss varies in time, reaching
    the maximum in November and December for a whole-year cycle. Energy loss is less
    for a rainy day compared with sunny day. For example, average energy loss was
    10% on a sunny day in June, but only 2% on a rainy day in June. The detailed mechanisms
    for the lack of energy closure are not fully understood, but a portion of this
    imbalance is likely to be an underestimation of the heat storage (in the soil,
    air and biomass) components (G). Underestimating these components would not affect
    the results in this study. There is no overall indication of differences in closure
    with β, which may suggest that H and λE are both systematically underestimated
    by a similar relative proportion. Therefore, we believe that the relative partitioning
    between H and λE is generally accurate, but that the total magnitude of turbulent
    fluxes may be biased towards the low side. 4. Conclusions The study assessed the
    ecological dynamics of heat flux transmission and energy balance of the green
    roof ecosystem so as to develop a scientific basis for its design and management.
    The results show that the heat flux components of the green roof ecosystem express
    peculiar life cycle characteristics. The dynamic changes of fluxes in sensible
    heat, latent heat and soil heat demonstrate single-peak quadratic curves. The
    net radiation determines the quantity and variation trends of latent heat flux.
    Diurnal and seasonal variations of heat fluxes form hyperbola curves. Seasonal
    heat fluxes vary with the fluctuation of meteorological driving forces. Extreme
    values of sensible heat and latent heat fluxes correlate well with rainfall and
    temperature. The dynamics of heat flux magnitude and partitioning demonstrate
    notable differences amongst daily time periods and seasons which are dependent
    on group characteristics. Temporal heat-flux fluctuations are strongly correlated
    with meteorological variables. Latent heat and sensible heat fluxes show major
    differences in response to precipitation. Temperature is one of the key contributors
    to heat flux. Latent heat flux is inversely related to atmospheric pressure. Evaporation
    is the principal determinant of latent heat flux and soil moisture. There is a
    considerable range in flux partitioning characteristics (Rn, λE, H, and β). Fluctuation
    trends of Bowen ratio are strongly influenced by weather condition and vegetation
    type. The cooling effect of the green roof ecosystem is due to the imbalance of
    energy closure. The characteristics of plant canopy and soil properties contribute
    to heat loss of green roof ecosystem which leads to an unbalanced energy closure.
    Meteorological conditions, such as the amount, duration and density of clouds
    and precipitation, incur variations in heat flux components in relation to the
    energy closure analysis. Acknowledgements We acknowledge with gratitude the grants

    The variability of fresh water availability in arid and semi-arid countries poses
    a serious challenge to farmers to cope with when depending on irrigation for crop
    growing. This has shifted the focus onto improving irrigation management and water
    productivity (WP) through controlled deficit irrigation (DI). DI can be conceived
    as a strategy to deal with these challenges but more knowledge on risks and chances
    of this strategy is urgently needed. The availability of simulation models that
    can reliably predict crop yield under the influence of soil, atmosphere, irrigation,
    and agricultural management practices is a prerequisite for deriving reliable
    and effective deficit irrigation strategies. In this context, this article discusses
    the performance of the crop models CropWat, PILOTE, Daisy, and APSIM when being
    part of a stochastic simulation-based approach to improve WP by focusing primarily
    on the impact of climate variability. The stochastic framework consists of: (i)
    a weather generator for simulating regional impacts of climate variability; (ii)
    a tailor-made evolutionary optimization algorithm for optimal irrigation scheduling
    with limited water supply; and (iii) the above mentioned models for simulating
    water transport and crop growth in a sound manner. The results present stochastic
    crop water production functions (SCWPFs) that can be used as basic tools for assessing
    the impact on the risk for the potential yield due to water stress and climate
    variability. Example simulations from India, Malawi, France and Oman are presented
    and the suitability of these crop models to be employed in a framework for optimizing
    WP is evaluated. Similar content being viewed by others Modelling impacts of precision

    that lack sufficient rainfall to sustain agriculture rely heavily on irrigation
    and thus other freshwater resources to water their lands. Water used for crop
    growing in arid and semi-arid environments can account for more than 90% (FAO
    2010) of the total freshwater supply making water a limited resource there. The
    variability of the water availability in these climates adds to the problem. Additional
    socio-economic pressure is being exerted through the current development in the
    world’s population. Hence strategies are needed that improve crop growth, make
    irrigation more efficient and sustainable as well as preserve farmland through
    better cultivation practices. This has led to a renewed interest in techniques
    to improve irrigation management as well as water use efficiency (WUE) or water
    productivity (WP) of irrigation systems. Molden et al. (2010) see great potential
    for improvements for irrigation through techniques such as water harvesting, supplemental
    irrigation, deficit irrigation (DI), precision irrigation techniques and soil-water
    conservation practices. Considerable improvements in WP are feasible in areas
    that suffer from imminent water scarcity, low productivity and high poverty, which
    is often accompanied by severe degradations of the ecosystem such as falling groundwater
    tables from excessive pumping. The preferred irrigation management practice in
    irrigated or rainfed systems that are only limited in land targets most likely
    at maximizing crop yields. With water being the limiting factor the benefits of
    a higher WP are that water and land resources are used more effectively. Fraiture
    and Wichelns (2010) consequently request to lower risks in rainfed agriculture
    by a better prediction of precipitation and, more importantly, by supplemental
    irrigation applications. Several definitions exist for WUE and WP depending on
    the area of operation. In general, WUE represents a gain (i.e. assimilated carbon,
    yield, biomass or others) over its expenses (i.e. irrigation water, transpiration
    sum, evapotranspiration). WUE could also be defined as how effectively provided
    irrigation water is used by crops (Molden et al. 2010). The term WP in the following
    is defined as crop yield per unit of depleted water but other expressions including
    monetary value are possible as summarized in Vazifedoust et al. (2008). Dealing
    with improvement of WP is closely related to the irrigation practice of regulated
    deficit irrigation where an intentional reduction in applied irrigation water
    would result in a yield drop. The ratio, however, would benefit from the cuts
    in water and yield with its productivity increasing to a certain point. More profound
    knowledge of DI is also needed to cope with severely limited water availability,
    e.g. during a drought. In such cases impacts by water stress on the yield cannot
    be avoided and DI could therefore be conceived as part of a strategy to minimize
    this impact on yield. Efforts to investigate WP are numerous and can mainly be
    divided into two groups; (a) field experiments which focus on crop growth and
    the evaluation of its effects on plants sustaining drought stress and (b) simulation-based
    studies where parameterized crop growth models that were calibrated and validated
    by appropriate field experiments in advance calculate the impacts of drought stress
    for a diverse range of environmental boundary conditions. A fairly comprehensive
    overview of conducted field experiments provide Geerts and Raes (2009) where investigations
    of different crops (among them maize, wheat and cotton) and their respective shapes
    of crop water production functions (CWPFs) are summarized. Additionally, advisable
    DI practices are presented. These vary within the crops without favoring an irrigation
    strategy in particular and reflect the diversity of genotypes of the investigated
    crops, the location they were grown at, and the crop development stages they sustained
    water stress. WP is governed by these factors and it becomes clear that mere crop
    growth experiments are not sufficient to explain the findings and therefore present
    no explicit solution on how to improve WP. Field experiments are in addition laborious
    and expensive and furthermore cannot account for all possible combinations of
    water stress or yield-affecting environmental boundary conditions. Pursuing a
    simulation-based approach to investigate and improve WP is another reasonable
    strategy. Khaledian et al. (2009) carried out a study where the applicability
    of the crop model PILOTE for corn and durum wheat under different direct seeding
    methods was investigated. The model was calibrated and validated against data
    of a 7-year trial in Mediterranean climate and the method “direct seeding into
    mulch” compared to conventional tillage. According to the authors PILOTE simulated
    leaf area index (LAI), soil water reserve, grain yield and dry matter for both
    methods satisfactorily. Potato under water saving regimes was investigated by
    Plauborg et al. (2010) where experimental data on transpiration and crop yield
    were compared to simulated results obtained by the model Daisy. The 2D soil water
    flow module was used and the model found to be capable of simulating the water
    saving effects of partial root zone drying compared to full irrigation treatments.
    The investigation concludes with the need for more experimental studies since
    simulated effects on crop yield and water use were negligible. Moore et al. (2011)
    applied a conceptual framework based on different water use efficiencies to evaluate
    the productivity and sustainability of fields in Australia that were comprised
    of wheat and different proportions of lucerne pastures by employing APSIM. Wang
    et al. (2009) simulated the productivity of wheat and the requirement of nitrogen
    under spatial climate effects with APSIM as well. In a study that focuses rather
    on hydraulics, Ismail et al. (2005) investigated the water productivity and yield
    production of Cotton grown in Egypt with CropWat. The model was used to determine
    whether optimal continuous flow or optimal surge flow is the more effective tool
    for irrigating short fields, which is the predominant field type in Egypt. The
    investigation was carried out by utilizing observed data of the amount of water
    stored in the ground along a furrow (and there distinguishing between beginning,
    middle and end section of the furrow) for the both flow types and their respective
    application efficiency into CropWat. The authors conclude that optimal surge flow
    resulted in higher crop yield. The applications of the simulation-based approach
    are limited since the variability of relevant climate factors (such as precipitation
    and temperature) and soil properties are not considered in many of the investigations.
    Studies carried out by (Semenov 2007), Brumbelow and Georgakakos (2007), Soltani
    and Hoogenboom (2007), Gonzalez-Camacho et al. (2008), Garcia y Garcia et al.
    (2008), Tao et al. (2008) among others employ crop growth models to examine WP
    under the influence of climate variability and climate change but look only at
    rainfed or non irrigated sites or deal with full irrigation. Studies by Schütze
    and Schmitz (2010) and Brumbelow and Georgakakos (2007) investigate deficit irrigation
    systems and the influence of climate variability on crop water production functions.
    Brumbelow and Georgakakos (2007) employed data of climate change scenarios of
    the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to derive probability distribution
    functions of CWPF (CWPF-PDs). Schütze and Schmitz (2010) developed the concept
    further and proposed a stochastic framework in form of a planning tool for Optimal
    Climate Change Adaption Strategies for Irrigation (OCCASION) for generating site
    specific stochastic CWPF (SCWPF). In this context, this article discusses the
    performance of in total four crop models that are being subjected to a stochastic
    simulation-based approach to improve WP. The yields and corresponding water demands
    for different crops were calculated and their respective CWPFs generated by utilizing
    the stochastic framework OCCASION. Afterwards, the CWPFs were statistically analyzed
    and evaluated. The findings were used to test the crop models for their applicability
    within this framework. OCCASION was tested by Schütze and Schmitz (2010) and was
    found to be a valuable tool when investigating WP of irrigation systems and improving
    suchlike since stochastic water productivity function, profit function and water
    demand function can easily be derived from the generated SCWPF (Schütze et al.
    2011a). Furthermore, different crop models and consequently their locations of
    application were chosen to show that OCCASION can successfully be applied to a
    wide spectrum of crop growth models and for many environments suggesting a sound
    and robust approach to improve WP. 2 Materials and Methods The stochastic framework
    in which the crop models are implemented is discussed in Schütze and Schmitz (2010).
    Details about the working principle of OCCASION are therefore hereinafter summarized
    briefly. Based on Fig. 1, the stochastic framework consists of (i) a weather generator
    that provides a statistically sound number of site specific climate time series,
    (ii) a problem specific algorithm for optimal irrigation scheduling under limiting
    water supply, and (iii) a crop model for simulating plant growth and water consumption.
    The application of OCCASION results in a number of site-specific CWPFs for a certain
    crop because of the number of climate time series used. These CWPFs are evaluated
    by means of descriptive statistical analysis and form the basis for the SCWPF.
    Fig. 1 The framework OCCASION for generating stochastic crop water production
    functions (Schütze and Schmitz 2010) Full size image The weather generator applied
    in OCCASION is LARS-WG (Semenov et al. 1998). Daily synthetic and statistically
    equal weather data of arbitrary length of global radiation, minimum and maximum
    temperatures, and precipitation from historical climate time series were created.
    Additionally, IPCC climate change scenarios for the year 2080 are implemented
    in the software and were considered. The optimization algorithm used in the framework
    (loop 1) is a problem specific evolutionary optimization algorithm named GET-OPTIS
    (Global Evolutionary Technique for Optimal Irrigation Scheduling) (Schütze et
    al. 2011b). Its structure differs in some aspects from conventional evolutionary
    algorithms by employing the steps selection, crossover, mutation, and recombination
    in that order. In conjunction with a crop model GET-OPTIS results in an irrigation
    schedule where the maximum yield per growing season by any given but limited amount
    of total irrigation water including application rates for each irrigation event
    is determined. SCWPF are then derived within three loops (see Fig. 1). The objective
    of loop 1 is to maximize the yield for one crop one climate time series and for
    a fixed amount of total irrigation water during that one growing cycle. With loop
    2, a complete CWPF is calculated by iterating through a range of available total
    irrigation water amounts. This CWPF represents the maximum yield that can be achieved
    with those amounts of total irrigation water available and can be viewed as the
    potential CWPF for a specific crop and for a specific climate time series. In
    loop 3, numerous CWPF are generated by iterating through all available synthetic
    climate time series. These are provided by the weather generator which can be
    interpreted as a Monte Carlo sampler. The resulting CWPFs are analyzed and the
    SCWPF obtained through parameters of descriptive statistics such as mean, median,
    quantiles and other moments. SCWPFs are empirical probability functions where
    for every value of applied irrigation water the marginal distribution function
    of the yield attached to it can be derived. Its quantiles can be understood as
    a reliability a certain yield can be achieved. The crop models investigated are
    CropWat, PILOTE, Daisy, and the Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM).
    Except for APSIM, all models were calibrated by field experiments in advance to
    the optimization runs which were then carried out by only taking site specific
    data on meteorology and soil into account. Wind and relative humidity had to be
    excluded since the weather generator cannot determine those quantities. Soil salinity
    or other factors affecting crop growth were also not considered as well as possible
    different agricultural management practices. Instead, this investigation was kept
    as simple as possible in order to focus only on weather and climate variability
    and its effects on water consumption and crop yield. All water demands calculated
    are net amounts with irrigation efficiency assumed to be 100% (by reason of general
    applicability) and where applicable observed values were corrected prior to their
    use for calibration. In general, the irrigation efficiency is difficult to determine
    and has to be estimated. Three sources are feasible; from empirical studies such
    as provided by the FAO, from field experiments (Mailhol et al. 2011) or from simulation
    studies (Schmitz et al. 2002, 2007). 2.1 CropWat CropWat (Smith 1992) is an empirical
    decision support system developed by the Land and Water Division of the FAO and
    is well known to farmers for its easy estimation of crop water demands under different
    irrigation practices. The model considers climate, soil and crop data. The model
    is based on the FAO Irrigation and Drainage papers No. 56 “Crop evapotranspiration”
    and No. 33 “Yield response to water”, and for the latter its fundamental equation
    described by Jensen (1968) where the relative loss in yield is proportional to
    the relative reduction in evapotranspiration. The Penman-Monteith equation and
    respective crop coefficients are used to calculate evapotranspiration rates. Crop
    growth is simulated by the so-called linear model where gross dry matter production
    of a standard crop is empirical calculated and crop-dependent correction factors
    for climate, growth and yield are applied (Doorenbos et al. 1979). In this investigation
    a reimplementation of CropWat was used that calculated the soil water balance
    on a daily basis and was designed to run in batch mode. The model was applied
    in a study where the development of maize and wheat on a field in Kharagpur, India
    was investigated. The 17-year (1991 to 2007) climate time series consisted of
    weather records on rainfall, evaporation, relative humidity, maximum and minimum
    temperatures, wind speed and solar radiation. The climate in Kharagpur can be
    described as sub-humid and tropical with the growing season from September to
    March. 2.2 PILOTE PILOTE (Mailhol et al. 1997) is an empirical crop growth model
    for simulating plant development and calculating crop yield. The effects of water
    stress are taken into account by using a water stress index. The model follows
    a cascading layer approach for determining the water balance and is based on three
    soil water reservoirs. From these reservoirs, amongst others, water transport,
    evapotranspiration and plant available water content are managed. For yield calculations
    it is assumed that water is the only limiting factor and that all other variables
    meet plant requirements. The impacts of water deficit are considered by its effects
    on the LAI which in turn is governed by the water stress index. This water stress
    index accounts for reductions in evapotranspiration rates. The actual grain yield
    is calculated by the ratio of average LAI (affected by water availability) to
    optimal LAI (no water stress occurred). The final yield under non-water-limited
    conditions, which is also part of the equation, is determined by the harvest index
    and LAI-dependent intercepted solar radiation. The model operates on daily time
    steps. Further descriptions and examples for application can be found in Mailhol
    et al. (1997) and Khaledian et al. (2009), respectively. The development of maize
    grown on a sandy loam in the tropical continental climate of Bwanje, Malawi was
    investigated in conjunction with PILOTE. The model was parameterized with LAI
    and crop yield data to fit the observations of an irrigation scheme that was introduced
    to farmers to fight famine. The irrigation water was applied by furrow irrigation.
    Observed weather data of 35 years (1972 to 2006) were used to generate 400 climate
    time series in order to obtain the SWPF. In addition, the future climate change
    scenarios A2 and B1 for the year 2080 were included in this investigation. At
    the end, the effectiveness of the current irrigation practice was compared with
    the results of the optimized irrigation schedule. 2.3 Daisy Daisy (Abrahamsen
    and Hansen 2000) is a well-tested dynamic 1D soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer
    (SVAT) model comprising of the main modules bioclimate, vegetation and soil. These
    modules account for water balance, heat balance, solute balance and crop growth.
    The water balance module includes a surface and a soil water balance model where
    interception, evaporation, infiltration and surface run-off are considered for
    the former, and water transport in macropores as well as in the soil matrix for
    the latter. Root water uptake by plants is also regarded and modeled by a single
    root concept. Daisy calculates plant development through simulation of crop growth,
    photosynthesis, respiration and root water uptake. The development of the leaf
    area index is also considered. Driving variables are weather data of daily or
    hourly values of at least global radiation, temperature and precipitation. Adding
    values of relative humidity and wind speed is also possible. Crop growth is simulated
    by dividing plant development into the three stages emergence, flowering and maturation
    where the length of each stage is governed by the thermal time (Hansen 2002).
    The data used to calibrate Daisy was derived from the experimental site Lavalette
    in Montpellier, France where maize (variety Pioneer PR36K67) had been cultivated
    on a loamy soil in the year 2007. The model was verified by an experimental run
    in 2009 that confirmed crop parameters as reliable with measured vs. simulated
    yields of 16 t ha−1 to 17.5 t ha−1 for full irrigation (478 mm of total applied
    water of which 96 mm came from precipitation) and 11.8 t ha−1 to 12.1 t ha−1 for
    a deficit irrigation treatment (339 mm of total applied water of which 96 mm came
    from precipitation). Daily weather data records for 17 years (1991 to 2007) were
    used to generate 500 realizations of synthetic weather data for this Mediterranean
    climate. A subset that covered the growing period from May to October was selected
    and applied for optimization runs within OCCASION. Three cases were examined.
    In the first case, the SCWPF under no-rain condition was investigated; in the
    second case rainfall was included. For both cases, the IPCC baseline climate scenario
    was chosen. The third case comprised rainfall and the IPCC A2 climate scenario.
    Initial water stress was set to zero in all cases. Even though improbable, the
    first case was conceived to identify governing variables for crop yield in comparison
    to the second case by focusing solely on meteorological parameters. In the third
    case yield development under climate variability was investigated and compared
    to resulting yields of the second case. The overall model performance was subject
    to investigation in all three cases. 2.4 APSIM The Agricultural Production System
    Simulator (APSIM) (Keating et al. 2003) is a mechanistic crop growth model. It
    was developed by the Agricultural Production Systems Research Unit in Australia
    to simulate biophysical processes in farming systems by a modular approach to
    crop modeling. There are sets of modules for simulating biological and physical
    processes as well as management modules that specify management practices for
    the intended scenario and those control the simulation. Physical processes include
    soil water movement and solutes transport, soil nitrogen, soil phosphorous, soil
    pH and erosion. The soil water balance is implemented by two commonly used approaches;
    cascading layer and Richards equation. The matter transport is managed by the
    combined numerical solution of Richards equation and convection–dispersion equation.
    APSIM can be utilized for a wide range of grain and fiber crops mostly grown in
    temperate and tropical climates. Where biophysical modules are available, the
    model simulates growth, development, and yield. Crops currently included are barley,
    cotton, maize, peanut, sorghum, sunflower, wheat and others (Wang et al. 2002).
    The model operates on daily time steps (Keating et al. 2003). Maize (variety Katumani)
    and sorghum grown and irrigated at a hypothetical site in the coastal plain of
    Al-Batinah, Oman were investigated. Observed weather data for 16 years (1991 to
    2006) from Seeb weather station were used and baseline scenarios as well as IPCC
    scenarios B1 and A2 for the year 2080 applied. 500 realizations for each climate
    scenario were calculated whereas as subset of 100 realizations was selected for
    simulation/optimization runs in APSIM. An exemplary loamy soil from the APSIM
    soil database was selected which had similar properties to soils in the region;
    selected crop management practices such as sowing density resembled practices
    in the region. Sowing date was set to 15 January with no initial water deficit
    present. Fertilizer was only applied when nutrient stress was imminent. An overview
    of the crop models in this study is given in Table 1 with major model criteria
    and site information summarized. Table 1 Major characteristics of investigated
    crop models and study area Full size table 3 Results for the Individual Crop Models
    and Discussion 3.1 CropWat The resulting SCWPFs for maize and wheat are shown
    in Fig. 2. where the relative yield is plotted against the net irrigation amount
    with the quantiles of 10%, 50% and 90% (from top to bottom). For both crops, full
    irrigation is reached at around 600 mm of irrigation water. For no or low irrigation,
    the span in relative yield is notably high with around 0.6 and decreases with
    additional supply of irrigation water. For full irrigation, another extreme can
    be observed; the differences in quantiles are equal zero. The reason lies within
    the model structure of CropWat and its yield response proportional factor. The
    factor is unable to take variability in temperature and global radiation into
    account and cannot substitute photosynthesis processes. CropWat therefore does
    not seem predestined for calculation runs to improve water productivity by simulation-based
    optimization and climate change investigations in general. Fig. 2 SCWPFs and their
    empirical quantiles 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9 from top to bottom respectively for maize
    and wheat at Kharagpur, India Full size image 3.2 PILOTE The statistical analysis
    of generated CWPFs resulted in the SCWPF for baseline, B1 and A2 climate scenarios
    which are shown in Fig. 3. with triangles representing a traditional irrigation
    scheme and squares representing a season independent optimized irrigation schedule.
    For the season independent schedule the average yield of the 400 weather scenarios
    was optimized. Thus, the optimized schedule is robust to weather and climate variations.
    Fig. 3 SCWPFs and their empirical quantiles 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9 respectively for
    maize for IPCC scenarios A2, B1 and baseline with respective quantiles for the
    traditional irrigation scheme (triangles) and season independent optimized irrigation
    schedules for different total irrigation amounts (squares) Full size image As
    the SCWPFs show, there is a certain degree of variability within the quantiles
    in all climate scenarios once full irrigation is reached. There is also a decline
    in yields for the climate change scenarios A2 and B1. Looking at the baseline
    scenario, optimizing the irrigation shows that the maximum potential yield may
    already be achieved by applying a net irrigation amount of 350 mm. The traditional
    irrigation scheme on the contrary requires a net irrigation amount of 522 mm.
    This is equal to water saving of 33%. Additionally, by investigating the traditional
    irrigation scheme in the future IPCC climate scenarios the schedule resulted in
    even less total achieved yield and in higher yield variability. An alternative
    irrigation schedule with better yield reliability was found for a total of 400
    mm, 450 mm and 500 mm of net irrigation water. Up to this point, PILOTE produced
    satisfactory results. In a next step, the maize crop parameters applied for Bwanje
    were taken and used to set up the model for the site in Montpellier, France. The
    outline of these experiments was already presented in the Daisy section in part
    2. The model was parameterized and a plot of maize irrigated according to the
    model predictions of an irrigation schedule generated with PILOTE. Predicted outcome
    was 14 t ha−1 whereas actual yield harvested was 12 t ha−1. Furthermore, the development
    of the LAI did also not match the predictions. A closer investigation revealed
    unstable crop parameters and concluded in their non-transferability to other locations.
    Beyond that, crop parameters taken from the same location varied for different
    growing seasons as well. These circumstances make it difficult to apply PILOTE
    in performance studies for optimizing water productivity. Reliable results may
    be obtained, however, once stable crop parameters are found. 3.3 Daisy The results
    for the no-rain case are shown in Fig. 4. with generated CWPF on the left side
    and their corresponding SCWPF on the right. In there, applied water amounts ranging
    from 0 mm (no irrigation) to 500 mm (full irrigation) and crop yields between
    10 t ha−1 to 13 t ha−1 at full irrigation are plotted. The variability in crop
    yields (in absolute and relative terms) is greatest at full irrigation and decreases
    rapidly with less water applied. Since precipitation can be ruled out, it is believed
    that temperature and global radiation are the only major governing variables for
    crop growth and are therefore the reason for the variability in yields near full
    irrigation. This assumption is supported by the nearly normal distributed marginal
    distribution of the yield at full irrigation (not shown in the Figure). In contrast
    to this observation Daisy calculates crop yields for no or little irrigation but
    results are implausible for such low water applications. In theory it is possible
    to deprive the crop of water for almost the entire growing season and apply water
    only at the end and still get a fair amount of crop yield. This is caused by Daisy’s
    inability to simulate irreversible damage to the crop during drought stress. Though
    photosynthesis is reduced, once fully irrigated again, full transpiration rates
    are restored. Another reason is the initial soil moisture content which is used
    to calculate small but still unreliable amounts of yield. In any case, this range
    of water application is only of little scientific interest and may therefore be
    neglected. Fig. 4 Samples of generated CWPFs (left) and SCWPF (right) under no
    rain conditions for maize grown at Lavalette site, Montpellier, France (Schütze
    and Schmitz 2010) Full size image In a next step, the variability of rainfall
    was added to the simulation by taking precipitation into account (second case).
    Figure 5 shows the 500 generated CWPFs and the derived SCWPF. In comparison to
    case one (no-rain) yields range from 0.5 t ha−1 to 7 t ha−1 where no irrigation
    water was applied. Besides temperature and global radiation, the yield variability
    is now dominated by irrigation events; a left skewed marginal distribution at
    0 mm irrigation water (not shown) seems to confirm that explanation. With increasing
    amounts of irrigation water, however, global radiation and temperature become
    the main factors until a point where they almost entirely govern the variability
    in yields. Differences in the quantiles at full irrigation between this case and
    the no-rain case are however present indicating that a slight influence of precipitation
    remains. The marginal distribution at 500 mm follows a rather symmetrically distributed
    curve (not shown) which supports that conclusion. Fig. 5 Samples of generated
    CWPFs (left) and SCWPF (right) under rain conditions for maize grown at Lavalette
    site, Montpellier, France (Schütze and Schmitz 2010) Full size image In Fig. 6
    the results for case three (IPCC A2 climate scenario) are shown. The resulting
    SCWPF, which is comprised of 500 CWPFs, shows potential yields of 8 t ha−1 to
    11 t ha−1 at full irrigation. Compared to case two (IPCC baseline climate scenario),
    increased temperatures have caused a notable drop in crop yield of almost 2 t ha−1
    at full irrigation. Additionally, the higher skewness coefficient of the yield
    marginal distribution at 0 mm irrigation water is an indicator for an increased
    probability of dry conditions. The highest variance in potential yields can be
    observed between 60 mm and 210 mm due to the superposition of rainfall and radiation/temperature
    variability. The highest crop water productivity seems to be around 310 mm. Fig.
    6 Samples of generated CWPFs (left) and SCWPF (right) under rain conditions for
    IPCC A2 scenario (Schütze and Schmitz 2010) Full size image Daisy performed well.
    Projected crop yields, their respective water demands and the overall SCWPF curve
    progression seems plausible for the applied scenarios of no-rain and rain condition
    as well as the climate change scenario A2. By comparison of these scenarios, major
    meteorological variables influencing the variability of potential yields, i.e.
    global radiation, temperature and precipitation, could be identified. A set back
    in the Daisy model application is its inability to simulate permanent damage to
    the crop if heavy drought stress is sustained since the crop’s ability to photosynthesize
    at a full rate is restored afterwards. This together with the initial soil water
    reserve explains the implausible simulated crop yields in the CWPFs when total
    irrigation sums are very low (below 50 mm) which are however of little scientific
    interest and therefore negligible. 3.4 APSIM The results for maize and sorghum
    are shown in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. In both figures the impact on potential
    yield for one growing cycle for baseline (top row), B1 (middle row) and A2 (bottom
    row) scenarios are presented. Furthermore, the figures are separated into SCWPF
    shown in the left column, and the yield histogram at an irrigation amount of 150
    mm in the middle column as well as near full irrigation in the right column (400
    mm for maize and 450 mm for sorghum). Comparing the three climate scenarios with
    each other, the yield for maize is reduced from 7.1 t ha−1 (baseline) over 6.1
    t ha−1 (B1) to 5.7 t ha−1 (A2). The temperature and radiation driven changes not
    only affect crop development in early stages and thus leading to faster plant
    development and shorter vegetative phases but also increase water requirements
    in a way that e.g. 400 mm are not sufficient anymore to reach near full yield
    potential. At the same time, standard deviations decrease with available amount
    of water (within the scenarios) as well as with temperature (between the scenarios)
    meaning the reliability to reach a certain crop yield increases. Fig. 7 SCWPFs
    for maize for baseline, IPCC B1 and A2 scenarios for 150 mm and 400 mm irrigation
    amount at Al-Batinah site, Oman (Schütze et al. 2011a) Full size image Fig. 8
    SCWPFs for sorghum for baseline, IPCC B1 and A2 scenarios for 150 mm and 450 mm
    irrigation amount at Al-Batinah site, Oman (Schütze et al. 2011a) Full size image
    Looking at the baseline and A2 climate scenarios the drop in sorghum yields is
    not as high as for maize. This indicates a lighter impact of water stress and
    climate variability on the development of sorghum with yields decreasing from
    10.3 t ha−1 (for baseline) to 9.6 t ha−1 (for A2). There is also a change in the
    histogram distribution between 150 mm and 450 mm within each climate scenario
    from skewed to normal indicating a dominating impact of temperature and radiation.
    The changes in the B1 climate scenario are not as strong. These results seem to
    indicate that the cultivation of sorghum as a crop with high water stress resistance
    could be a viable option when considering future cropping patterns. The results
    suggest that APSIM can cope with climate variability and calculates plausible
    potential crop yields for the different climate scenarios. Values for maize and
    sorghum suggest good model performance when investigating systems to improve water
    productivity. The true potential of APSIM, however, may only be fully discovered
    once field experiments have been carried out and findings used for calibration.
    Until then APSIM remains a promising candidate for the framework presented. 4
    Summary and Conclusion This study, and its application of OCCASION, is limited
    to the investigation of water productivity under the influence of climate variability
    where only global radiation, temperature and precipitation were considered. There
    are, however, more variables affecting water productivity such as soil salinity,
    agricultural management practices and soil variability. In theory, all these variables
    could be implemented into OCCASION with no increase in complexity of the optimization
    problem since the random variables are independent. Hence, it must be mentioned
    that presented results are only valid within the boundaries specified. CropWat
    showed unsatisfying performance for the investigated scenarios. Quantiles of yield
    of the SCWPF did not differ once full irrigation was reached. Reason is the yield
    response proportional factor that accounts for the relative loss in yield. The
    factor is no adequate substitute to describe plant physiology and reaction to
    climate variability and climate change. The successor of CropWat is AquaCrop where
    fundamental changes were made by replacing the yield response proportional factor.
    Main changes include the separation of evapotranspiration into crop transpiration
    and soil evaporation. Beyond, crop yield now depends on crop biomass and harvest
    index. Another improvement is the change in time steps to days which now enables
    the plant response to drought stress adequately (Steduto et al. 2009). This makes
    AquaCrop a possibly more suitable candidate for water productivity improvements
    within a stochastic framework. This conclusion is supported through results presented
    by Geerts et al. (2009) and Heng et al. (2009). Unfortunately, batch processing
    remains an unsolved problem in AquaCrop. PILOTE did perform well and plausible
    results were obtained for the investigated site for the baseline, A2 and B1 climate
    scenarios. Unlike CropWat, there was certain variability in quantiles once full
    irrigation was reached. Transferring the model to another location, however, showed
    less satisfactory results. A more detailed investigation revealed that applied
    crop parameters were not transferable to other locations. Therefore, once a conservative
    set of cop parameters is found PILOTE might be well suited for optimizing water
    productivity. Daisy has convinced in most of the cases. The model is capable of
    plausibly simulating potential yields and the respective supply of irrigation
    water for no-rain and rain conditions. Daisy can also take scenarios with different
    climate settings, historic as well as future, into account and produces results
    that are well in the range of expectation. All this, however, applies only for
    light drought stress where no permanent damage occurs to the crop. Cases that
    yet result in irreversible damage to the plant are neither of scientific nor practical
    or economic relevance and are limited to values in the range of the lower third
    of the generated SCWPF. This set back is outweighed by the fact that model and
    crop parameters were successfully applied in another study for a location in Germany
    where an irrigation experiment was carried out with different treatments for water
    stress (Walser et al. 2011). Irrigation schemes and projected yields were simulated
    by OCCASION prior to the experimental run. Results indicate that model and crop
    parameters in particular are robust and transferable. Values taken from the upper
    third of the generated SCWPF can therefore be used reliably. Limitations in the
    range of the middle section of the SCWPF have not yet been determined. It can
    be concluded that Daisy seems to be a suitable candidate to be used in a simulation
    based approach to improve water productivity within a stochastic framework. APSIM,
    the only SVAT model that was not calibrated by field experiments in advance but
    where observed weather and soil input data were used, showed plausible results
    for potential yields and water demands for baseline, A2 and B1 climate scenarios
    for maize and sorghum. The results also imply that substituting plants by crops
    better suited to drier conditions, such as sorghum compared to maize, could be
    part of an approach to cope with climate change when considering future cropping
    patterns (besides other factors affecting this choice). Even though carried out
    as a hypothetical study, APSIM remains to be a promising candidate for optimization
    within the applied framework. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to conduct a
    limited number of experiments in order to obtain cultivar-specific crop parameters
    for model calibration. The results presented show that not all crop growth models
    are eligible for simulation-based optimization that targets at the improvement
    of water productivity within a stochastic framework. Certain criteria have to
    be met for obtaining plausible values of potential yields and their respective
    water demands. These criteria are most importantly (i) the good representation
    of plant physiology within the crop growth model with modules for assimilation,
    respiration, partitioning of carbon, senescence and others along with (ii) the
    realistic and plausible response of crop to water stress. Beyond that, minor considerations
    are (iii) the model’s ability to account for spatial distribution of water in
    soil when dealing with modern irrigation systems such as micro irrigation and
    (iv) favoring a time resolution of days instead of weeks for better consideration
    of plant response to water stress. Finally, all models are in need of (v) robust
    crop parameters that allow for their transferability and application in a wide
    range of locations. Beyond that, it became apparent during the investigation that
    crop growth models also have to fulfill certain basic requirements for being efficiently
    utilized as part of this stochastic framework at all. The model has to (i) be
    able to consider climate variability to take full benefit from the weather generator’s
    built-in IPCC climate change scenarios. (ii) Model parameters have to be transferable
    in space and time for a robust model application. And there is the practical aspect
    that (iii) the model should have the ability for batch processing since several
    hundred simulations have to be evaluated in order to obtain the SCWPF. All crop
    growth models complied with the last point except for CropWat. Computational effort
    and therefore runtime for a simulation might be an issue but can be mitigated
    by high-performance computing (HPC). References Abrahamsen P, Hansen S (2000)

    \ or water use efﬁciency (WUE)) for a large number of\ncrops is a problem that\
    \ remains unresolved. For each crop, it will be necessary to create a stronger\n\
    connection between crop-water status and crop yield.\nKeywords: crop water status;\
    \ water use efﬁciency (WUE); platforms; sensors; evapotranspiration\n(ET); Crop\
    \ water stress index (CWSI); time-temperature threshold (TTT); vegetation indices\
    \ (VIs)\n1. Introduction\nFood is the basic and compulsory human requirement.\
    \ It is expected that limited land and\ninadequate water resources will negatively\
    \ impact the expected increase in demand for food crops\nduring the next ﬁfty\
    \ years [1–3]. Subject to scenarios used, and assumptions and models employed,\n\
    different forecasts have been made for food and agricultural production and related\
    \ irrigation water\nneeds. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projections\
    \ indicated a growth rate of world\nconsumption of agricultural products of 1.1%\
    \ per year for the period from 2005 to 2050. In order to\nmeet this projected\
    \ global demand, agricultural production would have to increase by 60% from 2005\n\
    to 2050 [4,5].\nProduction of food requires water. Since water resources are a\
    \ limiting factor for human actions,\nWater Use Efﬁciency (WUE) will be a crucial\
    \ factor [6]. For these reasons, the European Parliament,\nin agreement with the\
    \ Horizon 2020 program, has coined the phrase “produce more with less” [7].\n\
    Agriculture is the main user of water worldwide, accounting for about 70% of total\
    \ water withdrawals,\nincluding the water used in livestock and aquaculture production\
    \ [8]. Furthermore, it is expected that\nthis sector will witness increased water\
    \ consumption of about 20% by the year 2025 [9]. Thus, it is\nwidely expected\
    \ that the competition for water resources in many regions will increase. To meet\
    \ the\nincreasing population’s demands for food and for water, it is critical\
    \ to improve agricultural water\nproductivity, or economic yield per volume of\
    \ water used [1,10].\nForty percent of total agricultural production comes from\
    \ the 20% of the land that is irrigated [11].\nFarmers in developing countries\
    \ have to improve agronomic and water management practices in\norder to increase\
    \ WUE in all agroecosystems (from fully-rainfed to fully-irrigated farming systems).\n\
    Pereira et al., [12] reported that the above goal is chieﬂy important where water\
    \ is a scarce commodity\n(arid and semiarid regions). In these regions, it will\
    \ be crucial to increase water productivity rather\nthan maximizing crop yield.\
    \ Molden et al. [13] suggested, “The adoptions of techniques to improve water\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40; doi:10.3390/horticulturae3020040\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/horticulturae\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n2 of 36\nproductivity will require an enabling policy\
    \ and an institutional environment that aligns the incentives of\nproducers, resource\
    \ managers and society, and provides a mechanism for dealing with trade-offs”.\
    \ Irrigation\nwater management is sustainable if it realizes the objectives of\
    \ preserving the natural environment\nand sustaining irrigated agriculture for\
    \ food security. Appropriate irrigation practices are aimed at\nimproving WUE\
    \ in order to save water and maintain satisfactory yields [14].\nPainter and Carren\
    \ [15] emphasized the importance of reducing water losses below the root zone,\n\
    improving yield and crop quality, conserving the resource base, and lowering the\
    \ risk of salinization\nof groundwater to enhance sustainability. The authors\
    \ also pointed out that “these gains can only be\nachieved when all elements of\
    \ precision operate synergistically within a given environment”.\nFor improving\
    \ WUE at the regional level, Batchelor [16] suggested four methods of agronomic\n\
    improvements: (1) rely on improved crop husbandry; (2) introduce varieties with\
    \ higher productivity;\n(3) maximize cropped area during periods of low potential\
    \ evapotranspiration and (4) when rainfall is\nhighest, promote water recycling.\n\
    Wallace and Batchelor [17] reported four categories (agronomic, technical, managerial,\
    \ and\ninstitutional) for improving the efﬁciency of irrigation. Technical solutions\
    \ may improve irrigation\nuniformity, reduce leaching, and lead to adoption of\
    \ irrigation practices that increase rainfall\neffectiveness. Among managerial\
    \ improvements, the authors highlighted the implementation of\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ systems based on crop demand. The institutional improvements “rely on the user\n\
    involvement in scheme operation and maintenance; introduction of water pricing\
    \ and legal frameworks to provide\nincentives for efﬁcient water use and disincentives\
    \ for inefﬁcient use; introduction of integrated catchment\nmanagement; improved\
    \ training and extension”. In 2005, Johansson [6] emphasized the importance at\
    \ the\nfarm level of the extension services for improving information or of cheap\
    \ credit for adjusting to the\nchanging environments associated with water policy\
    \ reforms (water-pricing reforms, particularly).\nBecause more efﬁcient irrigation\
    \ practices can optimize WUE [18], and drip irrigation reduced\ncrop evapotranspiration\
    \ losses and runoff [19–21], the technology was appropriate for applying water\n\
    to orchards and vegetables [22]. Proper irrigation (timing and amount) increased\
    \ the crop WUE and\ncrop yield [23]. In contrast, improper irrigation can lead\
    \ to the onset of crop water deﬁcits causing\nwater and nutrient deﬁciencies that\
    \ reduce yield [23,24]. Nevertheless, regardless of the strategy\nengaged, the\
    \ beneﬁts of irrigation scheduling can be reached only by applying the exact amount\
    \ of\nwater required [25]. Raine et al. [26] deﬁne precision irrigation as “the\
    \ accurate and precise application\nof water to meet the speciﬁc requirements\
    \ of individual plants or management units and minimize\nadverse environmental\
    \ impact”. Monitoring water use and crop water status in the ﬁeld is important\n\
    for developing effective precautions, and for this purpose, some indicators are\
    \ required [27]. A very\nlarge body of research, spanning almost four decades,\
    \ has demonstrated that much of the required\nagricultural information can be\
    \ derived from remotely sensed data [28] starting from crop water status\ndetection.\
    \ IN order to develop effective irrigation strategies, it is necessary to identify\
    \ the appropriate\nindicators for monitoring crop water status at the farm level\
    \ [27]. For these purposes, the required\nagricultural information may be derived\
    \ from remotely sensed data [28].\n2. Scope of the Review\nThe applications of\
    \ remote sensing to irrigation monitoring and management are reviewed\nherein.\
    \ The assessment of the ideal crop water requirement is indispensable for several\
    \ objectives\nlinked to agronomic, economic, and environmental issues: (i) maximize\
    \ crop yield (the ’yield gap’);\n(ii) stabilize production by adopting a safeguard\
    \ against the vagaries of weather; (iii) ameliorate crop\nquality; (iv) save water;\
    \ (v) limit onset of diseases; and (vi) limit groundwater pollution caused by\n\
    N leaching losses. A seventh (vii) crucial point is the ’yield gap’ of the environment\
    \ under study.\nThis means deﬁning the potential and constraints of the ﬁeld environment\
    \ (sub optimal management,\ninappropriate technology, and/or lack of training\
    \ of farmers). This is possible when water constraints\non crop production are\
    \ removed by using appropriate irrigation scheduling for getting more crop\nyield\
    \ per drop of water [9,29], contributing to social growth of the irrigated area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n3 of 36\nIn 2008, Fereres [8] called for a more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable irrigation than in the past, at a\ntime when the rate of irrigation\
    \ was expected to slow down, and when the investments in irrigation\nand drainage\
    \ were on the decline. Fereres also emphasized challenges in irrigated agriculture\
    \ due to\nmodernization of irrigation networks and management, the improvement\
    \ of water institutions, and\nthe responses to periodic droughts. The last point\
    \ has imposed the introduction of new water saving\ntechnologies in horticulture.\n\
    A holistic approach is necessary for moving from a traditional approach to precision\
    \ irrigation,\ndeﬁned as site-speciﬁc irrigation management that relies on the\
    \ variable application of water according\nto soil and crop variability. It is\
    \ a potential solution for increasing productivity and reducing the\nenvironmental\
    \ impact of irrigated agriculture. A holist approach needs a deep and precise\
    \ knowledge\nof the crop water requirements and the cultivated environment. The\
    \ innovative deﬁcit irrigation and\npartial root drying management strategies\
    \ [29] have encouraged the development of new methods for\nmonitoring water stress\
    \ (abiotic). Fernández [30] focused on plant-based methods that integrate the\n\
    soil and atmospheric water status and the plant response to the surrounding conditions.\n\
    The present review describes the role of remote sensing with respect to crop water\
    \ status, its\nsurface energy balance, the relationship between surface temperature\
    \ and remotely sensed vegetation\nindices, and WUE and evapotranspiration. This\
    \ review is limited to ﬁeld-key studies, and presents\napplications of remote\
    \ sensing for managing irrigation and water resources for meeting the current\
    \ and\nfuture challenges of agricultural water resources management. A list of\
    \ references is presented\nas a good resource for any who are interested in remote\
    \ sensing applied to irrigation studies.\nThe review is organized into the following\
    \ main sections: (1) Sensors and platforms applied to\nirrigation studies; (2)\
    \ Remote sensing approaches for precision irrigation for estimating crop water\n\
    status, evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, and soil and crop characteristics.\n\
    3. Sensors and Platforms\nJensen et al. [31] reported that the ﬁrst aerial images\
    \ were taken by a camera mounted on a balloon\naround 1859. From the very beginning\
    \ of satellite-based remote sensing in the 1970s, the use of remote\nsensing for\
    \ terrestrial applications has increased tremendously [32]. Remote sensing is\
    \ the acquisition\nof information about an object, or event through the analysis\
    \ of data acquired obtained by a device\nwithout contact with the target under\
    \ investigation [33]. The term remote sensing includes all the\ntraditional primary\
    \ mapping data acquisition technologies [34].\nRemote-sensing instruments are\
    \ designed to identify various wavelengths of the electromagnetic\nspectrum referred\
    \ to as a “band” or “channel”. Each instrument is characterized by a speciﬁc number\n\
    and widths of wavelengths detected; some instruments detect discrete bands, while\
    \ others detect\nfairly narrow wavelengths or broader bands (multispectral, visible\
    \ and near-infrared wavelengths,\nmicrowave, thermal sensing systems) [35–37].\n\
    Remote sensing is able to identify spectral signatures of all surfaces and objects.\
    \ Sensors can sense\ntargets with a speciﬁc spatial resolution of image data deﬁned\
    \ by the smallest spatial area sampled or\nviewed. Digital images are made up\
    \ of pixels, each pixel characterized by speciﬁc spectral and spatial\nattributes\
    \ [38], as the intensity of reﬂectance or emittance measured by a sensor [39].\
    \ Spatial resolution\ncorresponds to the spatial area each displayed or printed\
    \ pixel represents.\nWhen the time image was shot (day or year) is a crucial point\
    \ in interpreting remotely sensed data\nanalysis [40]. If the same area is imaged\
    \ in the morning and late afternoon, a greater number of features\nwith different\
    \ orientations may be discerned than if the area is only imaged in the morning\
    \ [41]; this\nis especially true when interpreting vegetation classes. Multi-temporal\
    \ images are taken at different\ntimes to monitor changes in the environment and\
    \ to analyze numerous processes [42,43]. The temporal\ndynamics may range from\
    \ hours to a number of years. Sexton et al. [44] and Guerschman et al. [45]\n\
    reported that “to assess changes over a time sequence accurately, effects in the\
    \ data not caused by true\nenvironmental changes (such as differing atmospheric\
    \ conditions and sun or view angle positions)\nmust ﬁrst be accounted for”.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n4 of 36\nOther sensors are deﬁned as bidirectional,\
    \ due to the illumination angle at which the energy\nsource strikes the target,\
    \ and the position (angle) at which the instrument receives the emitted or\nthe\
    \ reﬂected energy (called the view angle) as described by Schowengerdt [46] and\
    \ Campbell and\nWynn [47].\n3.1. Remote Sensing Sensors\nDifferent remote sensing\
    \ sensors have been developed for monitoring crop growth and yield, as\nwell as\
    \ the spatial variability within ﬁelds. Many factors may affect crop growth and\
    \ yield variability,\nsuch as soil characteristics, soil fertility, soil moisture,\
    \ canopy volume, biomass and architecture, water\ncontent, and biotic and abiotic\
    \ stress. Different types of sensors can monitor and measure these factors;\n\
    Lee et al. [48] discussed electronic sensors, spectroradiometers, machine vision,\
    \ multispectral and\nhyperspectral sensors, thermal sensors, and machine olfaction\
    \ systems. A detailed review on sensors\nrelated to agricultural crop was reported\
    \ by Ruiz-Altisent et al. [49]. The authors provided an overview\nof sensing technologies\
    \ and application as: (i) electromagnetic sensors, spectroscopic sensors, and\n\
    computer vision; (ii) mechanical contact and acoustic sensors; (iii) biosensors;\
    \ and (iv) wireless-sensor\nnetworks. Wang et al. [50] studied recent development\
    \ and future perspective of wireless sensors in\nagriculture and the food industry.\n\
    Sensors can be divided into several broad categories of basic sensor system types\
    \ such as active and\npassive. Passive sensors (photographic, electro-optic radiometers,\
    \ passive microwave systems visible,\ninfrared, and thermal imaging systems, etc.)\
    \ are the most common for vegetation correlated remote\nsensing. These sensors\
    \ provide helpful information for crop monitoring, but their major limitation\n\
    is the strong relationship among data acquisition and lighting (time of day and\
    \ year; latitude) and\nweather conditions (cloud cover). Data from passive sensors\
    \ requires accurate measurements of solar\nradiation and correction for “atmospheric\
    \ effects” [34,40].\nActive sensors use an artiﬁcial source of energy; in active\
    \ remote sensing, humans can control the\nnature (wavelength, power, duration)\
    \ of the source energy. Active sensors (Radar systems, LiDAR)\ndo not need sun\
    \ light and perfect weather conditions (less dependence on environmental factors);\n\
    therefore, they can be more dedicated and targeted toward the remote sensing objectives\
    \ even at night\nor under adverse conditions (haze, clouds, rain, etc.) [34,40].\n\
    3.2. Remote Sensing Platforms\nThe platform on which a particular sensor is lodged\
    \ states the distance of the sensor from the\ntarget, timing, periodicity, location,\
    \ and extent of coverage of the acquired image. The detailed\ninformation obtained\
    \ is strictly related to the distance between the object of interest and the type\
    \ of\nplatform. Remote sensing platforms can be divided into three groups: satellite,\
    \ airborne and Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAVs), and ground based solutions. According\
    \ to Matese et al. [51], each of these\nplatforms and sensors shows strengths\
    \ and weaknesses related to technological, operational and\neconomic factors.\n\
    3.2.1. Satellite\nSatellites can be classiﬁed by (i) altitude; (ii) orbital geometry\
    \ (geostationary, equatorial and sun\nsynchronous) and (iii) timing. Regarding\
    \ the ﬁrst point, there are space shuttles orbiting around\n250–300 km above the\
    \ earth; space stations orbiting from 300 to 400 km above; low level satellites\
    \ from\n700 to 1500 km above, and high-level satellites, about 36000 km above\
    \ the earth's surface. The ﬁrst\nremote sensing satellite appeared in 1960 for\
    \ meteorological purposes. Geostationary satellites have a\n24 h-period of rotation,\
    \ so they always stay over the same earth location. Usually, communications\n\
    and weather satellites have often-geostationary orbits, generally located over\
    \ the equator. To ensure\nrepeatable sun illumination conditions during speciﬁc\
    \ seasons, sun synchronous satellites have orbits\nnearly passing over the poles.\
    \ Sensor and orbital characteristics determine the frequency of data\nacquisition\
    \ (Table 1). The satellite frequency ranges from twice a day to every 16 days.\n\

    Toth and Jó´zków [34] reported on new satellite technologies related to microsatellites\
    \ and\nnanosatellites, which increment the number of observations by sharing the\
    \ same orbit. One of the\nﬁrst examples comes from Planet Labs, which launched\
    \ four prototype satellites in order to test the\nperformance of the system [34].\n\
    Satellite\nconstellations\n(Landsat,\nSPOT,\nGlobal\nNavigation\nSatellite\nSystem\n\
    and\nGeoEye/WorldView families;\nRapid Eye) have identical satellites positioned\
    \ on the same\norbit to diminish the revisit time [52,53].\nSatellites that operate\
    \ in dual mode are deﬁned as a constellation, such as GOCE and the dual\nGRACE\
    \ satellites launched in 2009 to measure the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth [54].\n\
    In the recent past, satellites were characterized by a low spatial resolution\
    \ and were used for\nseveral purposes over large geographic areas, but were unable\
    \ to assess crop yield variability within\na ﬁeld [48]. Single satellite based\
    \ systems continue to improve in imaging performance, including\nbetter spatial\
    \ and spectral resolution as well as sensor agility, so in-track and cross-track\
    \ stereo capture\nis available [55]. Currently, new opportunities for mapping\
    \ and monitoring crop yield variability\nare provided by high-resolution satellite\
    \ sensors (e.g., SPOT 6 and 7, Ikonos, Quick-Bird) that have\nnarrowed the gap\
    \ between image by satellite and by airborne vehicles [56,57].\nLandsat series\
    \ from 1 to 7, for example, had a spatial resolution ranging from 30 to 79 m and\
    \ a\nradiometric resolution of 6–8 bits, usable to some extent for mapping water\
    \ quality parameters [58–61].\nLandsat 8 (12-bit radiometric resolution) is suitable\
    \ for remote sensing of water in lakes (even dark\nwith CDOM-rich); although the\
    \ revisit time of 16 days limits its use in routine monitoring of water\nbody\
    \ quality.\nSince\nsatellite\nmeasurements\nare\nnot\nsatisfactory\nfor\nmonitoring\n\
    diurnal\nvariation,\nRoussel et al. [62] noted advantages from the use of electromagnetic\
    \ waves constantly released by the\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)\
    \ satellite constellations for retrieving different geophysical\nparameters of\
    \ the Earth's surface. For irrigation purposes, GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) system\
    \ is\nuseful for soil moisture monitoring, because it is able to monitor diurnal\
    \ variation [62].\nSatellite missions, labelled Sentinel 1 up to 5, were set up\
    \ for environmental monitoring [63].\nThe launch of Sentinel-2 in 2015 opened\
    \ a new era in remote sensing. This system has a medium spatial\nresolution, super-spectral\
    \ instrument with a ﬁeld of view of 290 km, a revisit capability of 5 days\n(two\
    \ satellites), a resolution of 10 m, 20 m and 60 m, and a moderately large band\
    \ set (13 spectral bands)\naiming to provide global land coverage. The mission\
    \ ensures continuity of the previous missions\n(Landsat and SPOT) and provides\
    \ geochemical and physical variables, land cover maps and land\nchange detection\
    \ maps. Its image spatial resolution (from 60 m to 10 m) allows the monitoring\
    \ of several\nsmall water bodies as reported by Toming et al. [64], who have shown\
    \ that Sentinel-2 was able to map\nwater quality. It may monitor Chlorophyll a\
    \ (Chl a) as an indicator of phytoplankton, Chromophoric\n(or colored) Dissolved\
    \ Organic Materials, and Dissolved Organic Material concentrations.\nImmitzer\
    \ et al. [65] have assessed the suitability of Sentinel 2 data in agriculture\
    \ for land cover\nclassiﬁcations. Results appeared encouraging, although the classiﬁcation\
    \ results for the pixel- and\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n7 of 36\nthe object-based\
    \ approach were not extremely high. The authors relied on the support of two twin\
    \ S2\nsatellites for consistently improving spectral and temporal information\
    \ with high spatial resolution.\nSaadi et al. [66] have conducted an experiment\
    \ on regional evapotranspiration and crop\nwater consumption estimated over an\
    \ irrigated area in Tunisia with the SAMIR model that used\nSPOT high-resolution\
    \ time series. The SAMIR model was calibrated with local evapotranspiration\n\
    measurements taken from ﬂux towers. It was validated at plot and perimeter scales\
    \ using known\nirrigation volumes. The objective of the work was to assess the\
    \ operational feasibility and accuracy\nof SAMIR outputs at plot and perimeter\
    \ scales, in a context of high land cover complexity (i.e., trees,\nwinter cereals,\
    \ summer vegetables) and limited data available for parameterization. The authors\n\
    concluded that acquisition frequency (ﬁve days) of the satellite Sentinel-2 would\
    \ not answer the\nproblem of cloudiness, even in semi-arid conditions, as in the\
    \ case of Tunisia. The authors suggested\nthe combination with Landsat8 or SPOT,\
    \ which have VIS-NIR high-resolution sensors. Using these\ntime series, including\
    \ clear images approximately every 20 days, would make it possible to estimate\n\
    irrigation volumes at perimeters scale. The seasonal volumes estimated by this\
    \ method appeared\nacceptable, even though results at ﬁner timescales (monthly\
    \ and below) need to be improved.\nA variety of variables (e.g., leaf chlorophyll\
    \ content, leaf water content, leaf area index) are\nproposed for Sentinel-2 as\
    \ inputs to earth system models. Van der Werff and van der Meer [63]\nsummarized\
    \ spectral position (λ) and bandwidth (∆λ), spatial resolution, heritage and purpose\
    \ of\nSentinel-2 bands, according to the Copernicus derived user requirements.\n\
    Escorihuela and Quintana-Seguí [67] reported recently on soil moisture measurements\
    \ by remote\nsensing at local and regional scales. Recent technical developments\
    \ have allowed the outgrowth\nof space borne L-band microwave radiometry. Two\
    \ satellite missions, the Soil Moisture and Ocean\nSalinity (SMOS, 2009) and the\
    \ Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP, 2015) provide global mapping of\nsurface\
    \ soil moisture based on radiometric measurements at L-band (21 cm, 1.4 GHz).\
    \ The authors\nfound SMOS to be the only satellite able to detect irrigation and\
    \ the only one that does not show clear\nvegetation or roughness effects and is\
    \ able to map irrigated areas. Entekhabi et al. [68] produced\ncomposited maps\
    \ of the difference between weekly mean soil moisture over one week, one month,\n\
    and three months.\nThe NASA report “Microwave Technologies Review and Strategy”\
    \ [69] contained an overview\nof technologies for Earth science measurements involving\
    \ passive microwave radiometry for soil\nmonitoring. The Soil Moisture Active\
    \ Passive mission goal was to produce global maps of surface\nsoil moisture at\
    \ low (36 km) and high resolution (9 km).\nThe mission was based on L-band\nradiometer\
    \ and radar/radiometer measurements for low and high-resolution maps, respectively.\n\
    The preliminary results of the Multi-Temporal Dual Channel Algorithm (MT-DCA)\
    \ for retrieving\n(i) soil moisture; (ii) Vegetation Optical Depth; and (iii)\
    \ scattering albedo estimates, from passive\nmicrowave measurements alone and\
    \ without reliance of a priori information were reported. At L-band,\nthe Vegetation\
    \ Optical Depth was related to total vegetation water content and albedo to structural\n\
    changes. The analysis of these two parameters, at different temporal and spatial\
    \ scales, disclosed the\npotential of L-band microwave sensors for ecological\
    \ studies on a global scale [70]. Kojima et al. [71]\nreport an estimate of Soil\
    \ Moisture Distributions across Small Farm Fields with ALOS/PALSAR.\nThe ALOS\
    \ (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) has an active microwave sensor; PALSAR (Phased\n\
    Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) has a ﬁne resolution of 6.5 m. Because\
    \ of the ﬁne resolution,\nPALSAR provides the possibility of estimating soil moisture\
    \ distributions in small farmlands. Making\nsuch small-scale estimates has not\
    \ been possible with traditional satellite remote sensing techniques.\n3.2.2.\
    \ Airborne Platforms\nAirborne platforms (from 50 m to 50 km) carry out downward\
    \ or sideward sensors to obtain\nearth’s surface images. Airborne platforms give\
    \ images with a spatial resolution of 20 cm or less, much\nhigher than satellite\
    \ maps, but they have low coverage area and high cost per unit area. For these\n\
    reasons, it is not proﬁtable to monitor and map large areas. Airborne missions\
    \ are one-time operations,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n8 of 36\nwhereas satellites\
    \ provide continuous target monitoring [72]. The quality of images acquired may\
    \ be\ndegraded by factors that introduce blurring, improper focusing, atmospheric\
    \ scattering and target\nmotion [34,40]. The ﬁelds of application of airborne\
    \ remote sensing are numerous, such as biodiversity,\nbiogeochemical cycles, climate\
    \ change, eco-hydrology, infectious disease, land use, invasive species.\nFor\
    \ natural and agricultural environments, it is worth mentioning airborne remote\
    \ sensing studies\non vegetation: (i) cover amount; (ii) dominant type; (iii)\

    \ chemistry (nitrogen index); (vi) crop greenness; and (vii) crop health in\n\
    relation to topography (elevation, slope and aspect) [73–77].\nMost data seen\
    \ in Google Earth, and the imagery of towns and cities, are supplied by Bluesky\
    \ and\nDigitalGlobe, and are not taken from a satellite. On a plane or helicopter\
    \ it is simple to remove/replace\nthe old sensor with a new one that is more precise\
    \ and accurate. Furthermore, it is possible to take\nseveral ﬂights until the\
    \ proper and correct image is acquired. Moreover, a plane or helicopter, different\n\
    from satellites, can ﬂy with unfavorable weather conditions (high-level clouds).\
    \ Even imperfect images\ncan undergo a post-processing stage for correcting atmospheric\
    \ problems. Helicopters are usually used\nfor low altitude applications where\
    \ the ability to hover is required. Airborne hyperspectral imagery\nhas been evaluated\
    \ for estimating crop yields [78,79], green biomass [80], and crop disease [81].\n\
    In one of the ﬁrst examples of application of airborne imaging to crop farming,\
    \ Alvino and\nZerbi [82] set up an experimental ﬁeld capable of creating a continuous\
    \ gradient of water table level\nduring the rainy season. Four inclined water\
    \ tables were obtained (Figure 1). Figure 1b was taken\nin summer 1986 by an aircraft\
    \ with conventional imaging equipment. Figure 1c is the conversion of\nthe color\

    \ weight. The small systems were deﬁned\nas an UAV of a maximum weight of 25 kg.\
    \ Watts et al. [87], Matese et al. [51], DeBell et al. [88],\nCandiago et al.\
    \ [89], and Toth and Jó´zków [34] describe current UAS systems (ﬁxed and rotating\
    \ wing),\nsolutions and applications. The following description provides only\
    \ the basics for the UAV remote\nsensing ﬁeld; an extended recent review (monograph)\
    \ on the topic can be found in Pajeres [90], as well\nas in Toth and Jó´zków [34].\n\
    Large volumes of UAVs are expected to ﬂy in upcoming years, so safe operation\
    \ is essential for\nthe user and the public. There are extremely large numbers\
    \ of UAV applications to remote sensing [34].\nColomina and Molina [91] reported\
    \ the evolution of the use of UAVs in the ﬁeld of photogrammetry\nand remote sensing.\n\
    Another state-of-the-art example is available in Sankaran et al. [92], who studied\
    \ the use of UAV\ntechnology for various crop applications (crop emergence, vigor,\
    \ characterization of yield potential).\nThe review also reported the potential\
    \ and future perspectives of using UAV imaging to evaluate the\neffect of biotic\
    \ and abiotic stresses for crop breeding and precision crop yield management.\n\
    DeBell et al. [88] suggested that UAVs are set to become a crucial factor of a\
    \ water-resource\nmanagement toolkit. They can ensure high-resolution data (not\
    \ available from other platforms such as\nsatellites or aircrafts), in a cost-effective\
    \ way and in a more sustainable way for water-resource\ntargets.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest the use of UAVs for data analysis of water resource information\n(e.g.,\
    \ regular surveys of reservoir resources, soil moisture assessments by thermal\
    \ imaging, more\neffective consumption).\nAn interesting point of view was reported\
    \ by Anderson [53], who put an emphasis on remote and\nproximal sensing changes\
    \ due to a variety of sensors ﬁtted to drones and kites to improve ﬁne-grained\n\
    understanding of environmental processes. Anderson et al. [93] also proposed a\
    \ grassroots remote\nsensing and democratic mapping for delivering rapid spatial\
    \ data (GeoTIFF images) from lightweight\ndrones and kites with open-source geospatial\
    \ toolkits and android smartphone apps.\nUAVs offer many advantages with respect\
    \ to other platforms, the main one relying on readiness\nand repeatability of\
    \ the measurements. The UAV operator can monitor the procedure and decide\nto\
    \ repeat the ﬂight if something went wrong. Conversely, each satellite has a speciﬁc\
    \ revisit time\n(see Table 1), and it is almost impossible to replicate a survey.\
    \ The airborne ﬂights try to reduce costs\nby bringing together several targets\
    \ and actions (e.g., one strip on different subjects or many strips on\nthe same\
    \ one). This prevents modiﬁcation of the ﬂight plan. The operation costs are the\
    \ lowest for\nthe UAVs, which are ﬂexible and may change sensors/missions/objectives\
    \ easily. However, satellite\nsensors cannot be replaced when they are obsolete\
    \ or out of service.\n3.2.4. Ground-Based Platforms\nThe more common ground-based\
    \ platforms (up to 50 m) are tripods, towers, poles, and cranes,\nas well as instruments\
    \ mounted on vehicles. They are characterized by different land coverage:\nshort\
    \ (50–100 m), medium (150–250 m), and long (up to 1 km).\nPlatforms may be temporary\n\
    or permanent and are usually used to support research projects, even for micro-meteorological\n\
    measurements like, for example, for Bowen-ratio and Eddy-covariance [94].\nImportant\
    \ data can be also collected in the ﬁeld using vehicle-mounted instruments.\n\
    O’Shaughnessy et al. [95] have studied how to enhance crop-water-use efﬁciency\
    \ by reducing\nirrigation losses and enhancing soil water availability. The authors\
    \ underline that abiotic and biotic\nfactors can increase the yield gap through\
    \ a reduction of water use and of crop yield potential.\nEmerging technologies,\
    \ such as wireless communication, may be integrated with soil and plant sensors\n\
    (variable-rate irrigation equipment, and decision support systems).\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n10 of 36\nAqeel-ur-Rehman et al. [96] discussed different examples\
    \ of the use of sensors and their networks\nfor agriculture and irrigation purposes.\
    \ Damas et al. [97] developed an automatic irrigation system\nwith signiﬁcant\
    \ water conservation (i.e., up to 30–60%). Evans and Bergman [98] worked on precision\n\
    irrigation control of self-propelled, linear-movement and center-pivot irrigation\
    \ systems, controlled by\nwireless technology. To improve water use efﬁciency,\
    \ Morais et al. [99] implemented a smart irrigated\nsystem piloted by a wireless\
    \ data acquisition network to acquire environmental (climate) and soil\nmoisture\
    \ data. Basu et al. [100] set a drip-irrigation-control system characterized by\
    \ remote sensing\ndata acquisition. Kim et al. [101] devised a site-speciﬁc sprinkler\
    \ irrigation system equipped with a\nreal time sensor (using Bluetooth and GPS\
    \ technologies) and control software based on soil moisture,\ntemperature and\
    \ weather information data. Kim and Evans [102] and Evans et al. [103] improved\n\
    the above noted irrigation system with “in-ﬁeld data feedback to support the decision-making\
    \ and real-time\nmonitoring of irrigation operations via Bluetooth wireless radio\
    \ communication”. Thompson et al. [104]\nstudied soil moisture sensors to support\
    \ the decision-making irrigation management scheduling.\nThe study was aimed at\
    \ determining threshold values of soil water characteristics (matric potential\n\
    and available soil water content), using appropriate values of leaf water potential\
    \ for pepper, melon,\nspring tomato and winter tomato crops.\n4. Approaches to\
    \ Precision Irrigation\nRemote sensing has many potential applications in many\
    \ ﬁelds and at different scales. Table 2\nlists ﬁeld applications of remote sensing\
    \ in agriculture. Moran et al. [28] summarized the important\nrole of remote sensing\
    \ in site-speciﬁc farming.\nRemote Sensing can provide non-destructive, automatic,\
    \ and continuous measurements, easily\nimplemented with data transmission systems\
    \ for the user to have nearly real time access to the\ncollected data from a remote\
    \ computer, smart phone or similar [30].\nMost of these methods\nand related systems\
    \ are highly sensitive and capable of working under ﬁeld conditions for long\n\
    periods. These characteristics confer great potential for both monitoring water\
    \ stress and scheduling\nirrigation [105].\nTable 2. Applications of remote sensing\

    \ resources\nRemote sensing can provide precise information of irrigated crop\
    \ areas [106] by monitoring the\nphenological development of crops through multi-temporal\
    \ image [107].\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n11 of 36\nCrop water status is the\
    \ crucial biophysical property, used in particular to manage irrigation\nby remote\
    \ sensing. It is, in most cases, directly associated to the available soil water\
    \ content, and in\nother conditions to soil salt content when salinity is a limiting\
    \ factor of water uptake. Similarly, plant\ndiseases, which may be obstacles to\
    \ plant-water ﬂow, may negatively inﬂuence crop water status,\nwhich becomes an\
    \ indicator of disease presence and severity [108,109]. Crop water status can\
    \ be\nquantiﬁed at the canopy and leaf levels, by monitoring leaf or stem water\
    \ potential, or leaf water\ncontent [110]. Unfortunately, this simplistic view\
    \ is complicated by several plant factors (root signaling,\naerodynamic characteristics\
    \ of vegetation, genetic control of crop performance, etc.), which interact\n\
    in a complicated way with environmental factors, such as solar radiation (intensity\
    \ and insulation),\nwind speed and direction, air humidity, and air temperature.\
    \ Plant species may or may not be highly\ncoupled to the environment [111]. The\
    \ Ω coefﬁcient (or decoupling coefﬁcient) is a measure of the\ncoupling between\
    \ conditions at the canopy surface and in the free airstream (well above the crop),\
    \ and\ncan vary between 0 (for perfect coupling) to 1 (for complete isolation).\
    \ Jones [111] reports Ω values of\n0.85, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3 for strawberry, tomato,\
    \ raspberry, and citrus orchards, respectively. In other words, a\ncitrus orchard\
    \ is more coupled to the environment than more dense horticultural crops. The\
    \ concept is\nsummarized by Hsiao [112], who stated that relatively open, tall\
    \ and aerodynamically rough canopies\nmade of small leaves facilitate turbulence\
    \ and air movement within the canopy, and therefore, are\nclosely coupled to the\
    \ air overhead. Conifer forests show a low decoupling factor Ω. In contrast, dense,\n\
    smooth and short canopies, with all the leaves packed into the limited vertical\
    \ space, would obstruct air\nmovement and therefore are nearly uncoupled from\
    \ the air overhead. For many ﬁeld and horticultural\ncrops with short and dense\
    \ canopies, control of transpiration may be expected to be minimal until\nstomata\
    \ close, and canopy conductance decreases markedly. Another crucial point is the\
    \ ability of\nsome crops to limit their leaf water potential, preventing it from\
    \ falling below a critical level (isohydric\nbehavior). Marino et al. [113] have\
    \ reported that daytime leaf water status (or water potential) was\nmaintained\
    \ relatively constant as long as the potential transpiration exceeded the hydraulic\
    \ threshold.\nThis means that water potential of the leaves remained relatively\
    \ constant during the day and during\nperiods of minor-to-moderate water stress\
    \ events, regardless of soil water status, because of active\nstomatal control.\
    \ The assessment of the isohydric crop response is important for crop-water-use\n\
    predictions and requirements, and photosynthetic productivity under uneven irrigation\
    \ conditions.\nIn contrast, many species show unisohydric behavior with leaf water\
    \ potential relatively coupled\nto the environment. The different behavior of\
    \ isohydric and unisohydric plants may affect Remote\nSensing measurements based\
    \ on thermography. Two crops, one isohydric and the other unisohydric,\nboth held\
    \ in non-limiting soil water conditions, would be expected to return different\
    \ values of Crop\nWater Stress Index (CWSI). Since both crops are well-watered,\
    \ the differing behaviors of isohydric and\nunisohydric crops may affect irrigation\
    \ scheduling if appropriate corrections are not applied to each\nspecies (e.g.,\
    \ by using different thermal index threshold values).\nAccording to Casa et al\
    \ [114], several methodologies are available for estimating crop water use\nand\
    \ water use efﬁciency. Evett [115] developed a theoretical approach to precision\
    \ irrigation based on\nremote sensing, considered a powerful, practical and cost-effective\
    \ tool for obtaining comparable yield,\ncrop quality, and water and nutrient use\
    \ efﬁciencies proﬁtably and sustainably. In the ﬁeld of irrigation,\nﬁve major\
    \ approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing were reported (Table\
    \ 3).\nThe ﬁve approaches can be grouped into three major categories related to\
    \ ET estimation (point 1\nand 4); infrared thermography (point 2 and 3) and crop\
    \ characteristics (point 5). Many papers report\n“new methods” to calculate precision\
    \ irrigation based on remote sensing, combining, simplifying or\nintegrating the\
    \ methods described above.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n12 of 36\nTable 3. Five\
    \ major approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing. From Evett [115].\n\
    1\nScheduling irrigation to replace ET estimated from a reference ET (ETo), calculated\
    \ from local weather data,\nwhich is multiplied by a crop coefﬁcient estimated\
    \ with a crop coefﬁcient function, Kc (NDVI), where NDVI is\nthe normalized difference\
    \ vegetative index (NDVI) or a similar index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\n\
    The NDVI is based on canopy irradiance in the red and near-infrared bands, which\
    \ can be remotely sensed.\n2\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount of water\
    \ whenever a trigger to irrigate is generated by the crop water\nstress index\
    \ (CWSI), which is estimated using remotely sensed surface temperature (Ts) and\
    \ local weather data.\n3\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount when triggered\
    \ by the time-temperature threshold index (TTTI) reaching\na crop and region-speciﬁc\
    \ value. The TTTI is calculated using Ts.\n4\nScheduling irrigation to replace\
    \ ET estimated with the ﬁeld surface energy balance (FSEB), which uses remotely\n\
    sensed surface temperature, Ts, determined from thermal infrared data, and data\
    \ on canopy cover and surface\nemissivity deduced from the near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ and visible bands.\n5\nSensing of crop and soil characteristics in order to\
    \ guide timing, placement, and amount of fertilizer and water\nthrough irrigation\
    \ (or fertigation) systems of various orders of precision. The characteristics,\
    \ including crop cover\nfraction, nitrogen status of leaves, disease, and pest\
    \ damage, all of which vary spatially and temporally, are\ninferred from various\
    \ remotely sensed vegetative indices.\nEvett proposed an electronic hardware and\
    \ software system that acquires data from sensors and controls the\noperation\
    \ of other hardware to pilot irrigation. This Supervisory control and data acquisition\
    \ system (SCADA)\nacquires in situ, remotely sensed, or near-surface remotely\
    \ sensed crop, soil, and micrometeorological properties as\ninputs for a decision-making\
    \ algorithm. The system applies deﬁned amounts of water at deﬁned times automatically\n\
    through control of an integrated irrigation application system.\n4.1. ET Estimation\n\
    Satellite Remote Sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration has become a popular\
    \ tool and a focus of\nstudy in the past two to three decades. High-resolution\
    \ daily evapotranspiration (ET) maps would\ngreatly improve irrigation crop management\
    \ [116]. Remote Sensing based ET estimation roughly\nstarted in the 1980s and\
    \ has evolved into a variety of approaches and models as reported in an\nexhaustive\
    \ paper by Zhang et al. [117]. In addition, Liou and Kar [118] reported the estimation\
    \ of ET\nwith RS and various surface-energy-balance algorithms (SEBAL). The authors\
    \ reviewed these different\nsatellites based approaches and the main physical\
    \ bases and assumptions of these algorithms.\nIt is difﬁcult to categorize these\
    \ methods, since they try to compensate for the empirical modules\nand physically\
    \ based modules used. Table 4 lists a classiﬁcation by Courault et al. [119]\n\
    Table 4. Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation model categories. From Courault et\
    \ al. [119]\n1\nEmpirically direct methods (remote sensing data are introduced\
    \ directly in semi-empirical models to estimate ET)\n2\nResidual methods of the\
    \ energy budget (combining some empirical relationships and physical modules in\n\
    models such as SEBAL)\n3\nDeterministic methods (more complex models such as Soil–Vegetation–Atmosphere\

    \ Priestley Taylor-alpha parameters).\nRemote sensing techniques for estimating\
    \ ET from satellites [120] have been developed from\nenergy balances, thus generating\
    \ estimates of actual evapotranspiration [121,122]. The University\nof Idaho (USA)\
    \ has developed a model to estimate ET called Mapping Evapo Transpiration\nwith\
    \ high Resolution and Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [122], based on the Surface\
    \ Energy\nBalance Algorithms from the Land (SEBAL) model of Bastiaanssen et al.\
    \ [121]. In METRIC, the\nevapotranspiration is calculated from Landsat imagery\
    \ calculating the available energy using the\nearth surface temperature (Ts) derived\
    \ from satellite imagery thermal bands, to constrain the heat\nﬂux for one or\
    \ more layers (canopy and soil), and then computing the latent heat as a residual\
    \ to the\nsurface energy balance [123]. In other words, the energy utilized by\
    \ the ET process is considered as a\nresidual of the SEBAL equation. The ratio\
    \ between actual evapotranspiration (Etcrop) and reference\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (Eto) can be calculated only when ET is measured; this ratio is the Kcact, namely\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n13 of 36\nthe actual crop coefﬁcient [124]. Allen et\
    \ al. [122] reported this method (Crop ET estimations based on\nKcact) is a useful\
    \ tool for ﬁeld and regional water management.\nThe energy-balance approach has\
    \ the beneﬁt that it can be utilized to quantify the dimensions\nof irrigated\
    \ ﬁelds and their water-use dynamics, without reference to source of water as\
    \ opposed to\na water balance model. This latter model necessitates the information\
    \ of both the magnitude and\ntemporal distribution of rainfall and irrigation\
    \ applied to ﬁelds [125]. Temperature-based methods, as\nSEBAL, can be automated\
    \ and likely outperform vegetation-based methods in irrigated areas, especially\n\
    under conditions of low vegetation cover and high soil evaporation. According\
    \ to Biggs et al. [126],\nan automated SEBAL can estimate the evaporative fraction\
    \ from irrigated crops with a mean error of\n14% of Rn (range 218% to 124%). Allen\
    \ et al. [127] conﬁrmed the maturing technology of SEBAL and\nMETRIC for deriving\
    \ a satellite-driven surface energy balance for estimating ET from the ground’s\n\
    surface. The authors foresee a great future for these models in the scientiﬁc\
    \ groups dealing with\nwater resources.\nSantos et al. [120] have combined METRIC-derived\
    \ estimates of ET with a water balance model\nnamed LORMOD [128] to evaluate,\
    \ at a plot level, the use of near-real time ET estimates to update\nand correct\
    \ irrigation scheduling predictions and to assess its impact on WUE. ET estimates\
    \ derived\nfrom satellites were used in a daily soil-water-balance model to improve\
    \ accuracy of ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld ET\ndemands and, as a consequence, ﬁeld-scale irrigation\
    \ schedules. This approach combined high spatial\nresolution (satellite RS) data\
    \ with high temporal resolution data (daily soil-water-balance), providing\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ advances in irrigation schedules, as reported for cotton (a 24% reduction) increasing\
    \ ﬁeld\nirrigation efﬁciency to 0.72; the ﬁeld irrigation efﬁciency reached 0.90\
    \ for sugar beet [120].\nTrezza et al. [129] reported an estimation of actual\
    \ ET for central New Mexico. They matched ET\nimages derived from MODIS with those\
    \ taken by Landsat. The adoption of a METRIC model based on\nMODIS imageries produced\
    \ monthly and annual ET estimates, comparable to those obtained with\nLandsat\
    \ imagery.\nElhaddad and Garcia [130] reported a ReSET model based on wind from\
    \ multiple weather stations\nand the use of a weather station for the model calibration.\
    \ This ﬂexible approach generated raster\ninterpolated weather parameters, accounting\
    \ for spatial variation of weather parameters between\nweather stations, which\
    \ can be signiﬁcant. They found that ET calculated using this approach could\n\
    vary by 17% compared with ET calculated with point values.\nSubsequently, Elhaddad\
    \ and Garcia [131] assessed the use of actual ET calculated by ReSET to\nestimate\
    \ seasonal crop water use at regional scale instead of the traditional ET estimation\
    \ method\nbased on reference ET and crop coefﬁcients.\nOrtega-Farías et al. [132]\
    \ estimated the energy balance components over a drip-irrigated olive\norchard,\
    \ using thermal and multispectral cameras placed on a helicopter-based unmanned\
    \ aerial\nvehicle, acquiring high-resolution images to assess intra-ﬁeld spatial\
    \ variability.\nIn the ﬁeld of irrigation scheduling/WUE, there are very few concrete\
    \ outcomes. In particular,\nD’Urso et al. [133] analyzed, from the PLEIADeS framework,\
    \ ﬁve agricultural systems, in a broad\nrange of arid and semi-arid conditions\
    \ characteristic for the European, Southern Mediterranean, and\nAmerican regions.\
    \ The aim of the project was to improve the efﬁciency of the irrigation schemes,\
    \ made\npossible through wide space–time coverage of Earth Observation data and\
    \ interactive networking\ncapabilities of Information and Communication Technologies.\
    \ They included the following: canopy\nparameters, fractional vegetation cover,\
    \ LAI, albedo, crop coefﬁcients, potential ET, irrigation water\nrequirements.\
    \ They conﬁrmed the possibility of estimating crop coefﬁcient from NDVI, relying\
    \ upon\nadvances in spatial and radiometric accuracy of new sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2),\
    \ for a full exploitation of\ntheir applications.\nPeña-Arancibia et al. [107]\
    \ quantiﬁed irrigation water use and water provenance (surface water\nor groundwater),\
    \ combining t remote sensing data on irrigation dynamics and actual ET linked\
    \ with\na river-reach hydrological model. They concluded that the results were\
    \ as accurate as those of more\ntraditional irrigation area modelling using remotely\
    \ sensed irrigated areas. Actual ET data can be used\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n\
    14 of 36\nto understand irrigation dynamics, the constraints in irrigation models,\
    \ and speciﬁc areas that require\nbetter monitoring.\nVanino et al. [134] estimated\
    \ the ET and crop coefﬁcients of table grape vineyards trained on\noverhead “tendone”\
    \ systems in the Apulia region (Italy). The FAO direct methodology for estimating\n\
    potential evapotranspiration (ETp) was used to estimate maximum vineyard transpiration.\
    \ The model,\nbased on existing validated methodologies, used appropriate values\
    \ of canopy variables (albedo and\nthe LAI) derived by means of multispectral\
    \ satellite data. ETp values (mean seasonal daily ET) ranged\nbetween 4.2 and\
    \ 4.1 mm·d−1, and from 0.88 to 0.93 in 2013 and 1.02 to 1.04 in 2014 for the midseason\n\
    values, respectively. The results indicated that the values of Kc are site- and\
    \ year-speciﬁc and depend\non local ET0 rates, rainfall frequency, cumulative\
    \ thermal requirements, and effective canopy cover.\nThe resulting crop water\
    \ requirements were lower than the actual average irrigation volumes applied\n\
    by farmers, thus suggesting the possibility of improving the water use efﬁciency\
    \ of these crops by\nadopting the proposed methodology. We agree with the authors\
    \ that, in the Mediterranean, few studies\nhave investigated the satellite Kc\
    \ estimation for vineyards.\nLópez-López et al. [135] estimated ET starting from\
    \ ﬁeld weather data and Kc estimated with a\nfunction related to vegetation indices\
    \ such as NDVI or index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\nKamble et al. [136]\
    \ studied how to estimate Kc directly from reﬂectance and VIs derived from\na\
    \ satellite. The authors found that NDVI-Kc quantiﬁed from remote sensing could\
    \ be useful for\nestimating WUE, irrigation scheduling and performance, and agricultural\
    \ water budgets. The NDVI-Kc\nmay be also utilized for agriculture water conservation,\
    \ starting from local to continental scales.\nRecently, Battista et al. [137]\
    \ published a paper with the aim of demonstrating how spatialized\nmeteorological\
    \ data and remote sensing techniques may allow one to estimate actual ET and the\
    \ soil\nwater content of a small plot (about 0.1 ha) of an olive orchard. As a\
    \ rule, for Mediterranean areas,\ntrees were covered by several herbaceous species.\
    \ The authors found that the NDVI-Cws (coefﬁcient of\nwater stress) method is\
    \ a suitable tool for estimating daily olive tree actual transpiration and soil\
    \ water\ncontent in complex and multi-layer Mediterranean agricultural ecosystems.\
    \ The novelty of the adopted\nmethod was to consider the spatially fragmented,\
    \ two-layer structure of an olive orchard. For instance,\nthe ETa of trees and\
    \ grasses were combined with weather data (precipitation) to assess the site-speciﬁc\n\
    water balance, which was assessed through comparison with daily measurements of\
    \ soil water content.\nMoreover, this highlighted the importance of separating\
    \ trees and grasses for estimation of the NDVI,\nadopting statistical operations\
    \ to satellite imagery with different spatio-temporal properties.\nMarshall et\
    \ al. [138], with the aim of partitioning ET into soil evaporation and crop transpiration,\n\
    studied the ratio-based vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI) retrieved from optical\
    \ remote sensing,\nhighlighting their limitations and how VIs can induce large\
    \ model error. NDVI explained half of the\nvariability in transpiration, the largest\
    \ component of ET. However, to estimate total ET one should\nconsider the Photochemical\
    \ Reﬂectance Index (PRI). To estimate soil evaporation, the authors suggest\n\
    two new ratio-based indices derived from NIR bands 743 and 953 nm and visible\
    \ blue 428 nm and\nfrom SWIR1 bands 1518 nm.\nGonzález-Dugo and Mateos [139] used\
    \ an approach based on the conjecture that variations in\nthe size of the crop\
    \ have much stronger effects on its ET than variations in stomatal conductance.\n\
    This assumption seems to be valid for irrigated crops, according to several studies\
    \ [140–142]. The results\nshowed the potential of this method for ﬁeld application.\
    \ Since there is little agreement on the nature\nof the relationships between\
    \ VIs and Kc, the latter can be estimated from spectral measurements.\nThe rationale\
    \ is that both the component of the crop coefﬁcient that represents transpiration\
    \ (Kcb)\nand VIs are sensitive to crop biomass (LAI and ground cover fraction—fc).\
    \ The relationships between\nKcb and VIs could be linear or non-linear. The linearity\
    \ of these relationships depends on the crop\narchitecture [143]. Er-Raki et al.\
    \ [142] used the same approach to derive Kcb values of wheat crops,\nanalyzing\
    \ the relationships between VIs, and both LAI and fc.\nThe use of remotely-sensed-vegetation\
    \ indices has been tested to predict crop coefﬁcients at\ndifferent scales. In\
    \ fact, González-Dugo and Mateos [139] found that the NDVI and SAVI were strictly\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n15 of 36\nrelated to LAI, vegetation ground cover and\
    \ biomass. These relationships were obtained by radiometric\nmeasurements obtained\
    \ from satellite and ground-based platforms. The relationship is simple and\n\
    robust and may be used for studying WUE and water productivity at a regional level.\n\
    The statistical analyses of ﬁeld data and remote sensing data, derived from multispectral\
    \ imagery\nusing an UAV, conﬁrms the feasibility of applying the proposed methods\
    \ to assess physiological and\nstructural properties of Citrus under water and\
    \ saline stress. The novelty of this study was to show\nthat diurnal changes in\
    \ physiological and structural traits of citrus irrigated with RW combined with\n\
    RDI could be determined by multispectral images from UAVs. NIR was a useful indicator\
    \ of s, A and\ngs on both crops. The NDVI was strictly related to gas exchange\
    \ in both species and on mandarin [144].\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] hypothesized\
    \ that the index PRI (normalized by canopy chlorophyll\ncontent), might be a strong\
    \ indicator of the diurnal dynamics of water stress.\nThey acquired\nnarrow-band\
    \ multispectral and thermal imageries over a vineyard cultivated under three different\n\
    irrigation treatments, and evaluated the relationships between the normalized\
    \ PRI, ﬁeld-physiological\nparameters (stomatal conductance) and plant water potential.\
    \ Relationships with CWSI, which were\nused as a remote sensing benchmark for\
    \ water stress detection, were also discussed by the authors,\nwho reasoned that\
    \ CWSI can be used as a remote sensing benchmark for water stress detection. Some\n\
    critical points were suggested for integrating VIs derived by UAVs and everyday\
    \ water resource\nmanagement, such as the integration of differential global positioning\
    \ and the development of\nintelligent control of UAV platforms to improve positional\
    \ accuracy and spatial data capture.\nA review by Kang et al. [146] set up the\
    \ ﬁrst worldwide dataset to analyze the global LAI-VI\nrelationships at different\
    \ spatial and temporal scales. Analysis was derived from low-resolution (30 m)\n\
    satellite Landsat images, with the goal of producing large-scale ﬁne resolution\
    \ LAI maps, essential\nfor agricultural applications, especially in mosaic agriculture.\
    \ The authors reported that the LAI-VI\nrelationships were crop-speciﬁc and may\
    \ explain why the largest amount of variance in ﬁeld-measured\nLAI was obtained\
    \ using only remotely sensed observations.\n4.2. Infrared Thermography\n4.2.1.\
    \ CWSI\nScientists tried to ﬁnd indexes that describe the relationship between\
    \ and thermal characteristics\nof plants and water stress [147]. Jackson et al.\
    \ [148] set up the CWSI, Jackson [149] the Surface\nTemperature (ST), Moran et\
    \ al. [150] the Water Deﬁcit Index (WDI), Vidal et al. [151] the Stress Index\n\
    (SI), and Guilioni et al. [152] the Stomatal conductance index. Plants showing\
    \ symptoms of wilting emit\nmore longwave infrared radiation, revealing canopy\
    \ temperature. Unfortunately, canopy temperature\nis affected by meteorological\
    \ conditions at the time of measurement, so it cannot be an absolute\nindicator\
    \ of water stress.\nWe recommend several papers related to theoretical approaches\
    \ dealing with infrared\nthermography: Jones and Vaughan [40] provided a rigorous\
    \ and detailed explanation of the theory\nand practical applications of remote\
    \ sensing; Maes and Steppe [153] wrote an exhaustive review\non thermal remote\
    \ sensing technique and ﬁeld variation of plants and environmental parameters\n\
    involved. Other key papers include those from Mulla [94], Gago et al. [154], Thenkabail\
    \ et al. [155],\nand Jones [156].\nAmong the indexes cited above, the most studied\
    \ is the CWSI, which was developed at the U.S.\nWater Conservation Laboratory\
    \ in the 1970s and 1980s [148,157,158] and has been commercialized and\nwidely\
    \ used in irrigation management. Jackson et al. [148] found that CWSI was deﬁned\
    \ by the ratio of\nactual to potential ET calculated from the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation, and highlighted the usefulness\nand limitation of the index. Although\
    \ it appeared to be a promising tool for quantifying crop water\nstress, it was\
    \ unable to quantify crop water needs, or the time threshold for watering a crop.\n\
    A long list of indices is available at the website IDB (http://www.indexdatabase.de/db/i.\n\
    php?offset=1), which reports the basic information for each index including the\
    \ following: name,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n16 of 36\nabbreviation, formula,\
    \ variables, explanations of variables, wavelengths, source, description; sensors,\n\
    visualization of required spectral range; visualization of Sensor-Bands, applications,\
    \ references.\nGiven deﬁned environmental conditions (air humidity, air temperature),\
    \ the CWSI index is based\non the quantiﬁcation of the behaviour of a crop both\
    \ when it is fully transpiring and when it is not.\nLópez-López et al. [135] expressed\
    \ CWSI in terms of evapotranspiration:\nCWSI = 1 − ETc/ET0\nwhere, ETc is the\
    \ actual crop evapotranspiration and ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration.\n\
    According to López-López [135], the relation between ETc and ET0 approaches the\
    \ theoretical values\nproposed by Jackson [148], because it is decoupled from\
    \ the wind velocity as in the classical form,\naccording to Idso et al. [158].\n\
    Idso [159] suggested replacing the estimations of VPD from minimum temperature\
    \ with air\ntemperature measurements in direct radiation on irrigated plots, with\
    \ the goal of increasing and partly\ncorrecting the inﬂuence of the superﬁcial\
    \ soil temperature on LAI. The accurate assessment of the ET\nby means of the\
    \ CWSI is assumed by the relation between ETc and the leaf’s water potential (ET0)\
    \ at\ndawn, according to Itier et al. [160].\nEvett [115] deﬁned the CWSI as:\n\
    CWSI = ((Tc − Ta)m − (Tc − Ta)l)/((Tc − Ta)u − (Tc − Ta)l)\nIt uses the crop canopy\
    \ temperature (measured by an IR thermometer or thermal images) and\nenvironmental\
    \ parameters (air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation). The\
    \ canopy-air\ntemperature difference (Tc − Ta) is normalized to the lower and\
    \ upper limits of canopy-air temperature\ndifferences, which represent non-water-stressed\
    \ and completely water-stressed crops, respectively.\nThe subscript “m” denotes\
    \ measured data, while “l” denotes a lower baseline (non-water-stressed\ncrop),\
    \ “u” denotes an upper limit (completely water stressed crop), which is an estimated\
    \ parameter.\nThe (Tc − Ta)l and (Tc − Ta)u limits may be estimated either on\
    \ an empirical or theoretical basis as\ndescribed by Idso et al. [158] and Jackson\
    \ et al. [148]. Both approaches require readings of air humidity\nand air temperature\
    \ but it works better with wind speed and solar radiation data, and estimates\
    \ of\nbulk canopy resistances.\nIrrigation scheduling based on (Tc − Ta) has often\
    \ been determined by the stress degree day\nmethod (SDD), originally suggested\
    \ by Idso et al. [157] and Jackson [161]:\nSDD =\nn\n∑\ni=l\n(Tc − Ta)i\nwith\
    \ Tc and Ta measured 1–1.5 h after solar noon at day i, during a n-day period.\
    \ Irrigation was\ninitiated as soon as SDD exceeded 0. The formula was used successfully\
    \ for different crops [162], and\naccording to Maes and Steppe [153] SDD worked\
    \ well for wheat, and in semi-arid climates where\nweather conditions were expected\
    \ to differ little between consecutive days.\nAccording to King and Shellie [163],\
    \ the CWSI is also deﬁned as:\nCWSI = (Tcanopy − Tnws)/(Tdry − Tnws)\nwhere Tcanopy\
    \ is the temperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C), Tnws is the temperature\
    \ of\nfully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop is non-water-stressed (well-watered)\
    \ and Tdry is the\ntemperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop\
    \ is severely water stressed due to low soil\nwater availability. Temperatures\
    \ Tnws and Tdry are the lower and upper baselines used to normalize\nCWSI for\
    \ the effects of environmental conditions (air temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ radiation, wind\nspeed, etc.) on Tcanopy. Maes and Steppe [153] emphasized the\
    \ limited application of the CWSI by the\ndifﬁculty of estimating without actually\
    \ measuring Tnws and Tdry.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n17 of 36\nJones [164] proposed\
    \ a stress index (SICWSI) analogous to the Idso-Jackson CWSI, using wet\nsurface\
    \ conductance rather than the ﬁnite value for a well-watered crop.\nSIcwsi = (Tleaf\
    \ − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet)\nRojo et al. [165] suggested a modiﬁed CWSI (MCWSI) in\
    \ grape and almond using the\ncontinuous leaf monitor data, where the well-watered\
    \ and dry conditions were measured using\na well-watered tree and a simulated\
    \ dry leaf. The CWSI and MCWSI indices were calculated and\nwere capable of representing\
    \ the stress level of the grape and almond crops, so variable rate irrigation\n\
    was implemented.\nThe CWSI is considered a sensitive tool for monitoring and assessing\
    \ plant water stress for a\nwide range of crops. CWSI was inversely correlated\
    \ to cotton yields [166], and positively correlated\nwith soil water depletion\
    \ for a fully developed canopy when no soil reﬂectance was present [167].\nThe\
    \ CWSI was also able to foresee a yield of several crops under stress and to develop\
    \ schemes for\nmanaging irrigation [168,169]. Furthermore, the Water Deﬁcit Index,\
    \ which is a two-dimensional CWSI\nnormalized for vegetation cover, was related\
    \ to crop water stress [150,170].\nOrta et al. [171] studied the upper and lower\
    \ baselines, and CWSI values on watermelon were\nslightly different. They tested\
    \ CWSI for scheduling irrigation for watermelon grown with ﬁve irrigation\ntreatments\
    \ (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) in terms of the replenishment of the water depletion\
    \ (0.90 m\nsoil proﬁle depth). The CWSI was calculated from IR canopy temperatures,\
    \ air temperatures, and\nvapor pressure deﬁcit values. In two years, the fully\
    \ irrigated treatment gave the highest yield and\nwater use. The CWSI values tended\
    \ to be consistent with the soil water content. The authors proposed\na linear\
    \ equation of CWSI versus yield prediction, and suggested testing in long-term\
    \ experiments a\ncritical value of CWSI at which a farmer should irrigate.\nRecently,\
    \ Bellvert et al. [172] measured the CWSI in three peach cultivars (Prunus persica\
    \ L.)\nthroughout different growing seasons. They measured the canopy temperature\
    \ of well-watered trees\nusing high-resolution thermal imagery obtained from an\
    \ airborne platform and related it to leaf water\npotential (ψL) as a water stress\
    \ indicator. Results demonstrated that (i) the CWSI had similar seasonal\nresponses\
    \ and (ii) a common “non-water-stressed baseline” can be used during the course\
    \ of the entire\ncrop season. The CWSI is a practical method for evaluating the\
    \ spatial variability of peach tree water\nstatus in heterogeneous orchards, and\
    \ for deriving ψL maps throughout a complete growing season.\nSantesteban et al.\
    \ [173] evaluated the ability of high-resolution UAV-based thermal imaging\nto\
    \ estimate instantaneous and seasonal variability of plant water status within\
    \ a vineyard.\nCWSI correlated well with ψs and gs at the moment of image acquisition,\
    \ showing great potential\nfor monitoring instantaneous variations in water status,\
    \ but it did not provide a good estimation of\nvariations of plant water status\
    \ on a single day. The results added evidence regarding the suitability of\nthis\
    \ approach, and reinforced the potential role UAV thermal imaging may have as\
    \ an instantaneous\nwater-stress mapping tool. Similarly, Baluja et al. [174]\
    \ conducted an airborne study over a vineyard,\nwith the goal of computing image-derived\
    \ spectral and thermal indices, and indicators of water status\nin vines including\
    \ (i) the crop water stress index (CWSI), stomatal conductance index (Ig) [164]\
    \ and\n(ii) a formulation of the stomatal conductance index (I3) [164]. They concluded\
    \ that the relationship\nbetween thermal imagery and derived indices can be considered\
    \ as a short-term response, a kind\nof instantaneous “picture” of the plant water\
    \ status situation, while spectral vegetation indices are\nprobably the result\
    \ of cumulative water deﬁcits.\nBerni et al. [84] validated a methodology for\
    \ producing high-resolution maps of canopy\nconductance and CWSI, potentially\
    \ useful for calculating actual ET and as an input for scheduling\nirrigation.\
    \ The canopy of conductance and CWSI maps of olive orchards were acquired by airborne\n\
    and UAV platforms for two years with different irrigation treatments.\nTesti et\
    \ al. [175] showed that the CWSI measured in the ﬁrst afternoon hours were a good\
    \ tool\nfor identifying seasonal changes in the water status of a pistachio orchard\
    \ submitted to variable\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n18 of 36\nwater stress by\
    \ regulated deﬁcit irrigation practices. The temperature of pistachio trees showed\
    \ great\nresponsiveness to variations in plant water status.\nLópez-López et al.\
    \ [135] analyzed ET and CWSI in tomato conﬁrming that the use of infrared\nthermometry\
    \ to calculate the CWSI is a reliable technique for scheduling irrigation using\
    \ the\ndetermined upper and lower CWSI baselines in a husk tomato crop. The CWSI\
    \ value increased\nuntil it reached 0.7 in the treatment with severe irrigation\
    \ restrictions (40% ETo).\nGonzález-Dugo et al. [176] used UAV systems to derive\
    \ CWSI from high-resolution thermal\nimagery. They assessed the spatial variability\
    \ of crop water status in a pistachio orchard for precision\nirrigation purposes.\
    \ The authors estimated a possible reduction of irrigation costs moving from\n\
    common irrigation system to a variable rate irrigation system [177].\nGonzález-Dugo\
    \ et al. [178] also used IR imagery taken by UAVs to evaluate the variability\
    \ in the\nwater status of ﬁve fruit tree species. They compared the daily differential\
    \ between Tc − Ta (canopy\nand air temperature) with the tree water status. Since\
    \ the slope of the differential with time was\nhighly correlated with water status,\
    \ the authors proposed the slope as an indicator of the stomatal\nbehavior. An\
    \ empirical approach was used to deﬁne the upper and lower limits of Tc − Ta;\
    \ CWSI\nwas calculated using the temperature data from a 13-h ﬂight. Another important\
    \ contribution of the\npaper was the assessment of variability in the water status\
    \ based on the differences in relative canopy\ntemperatures. The authors concluded\
    \ that their approach (i) was worthwhile for managing precision\nirrigation; (ii)\
    \ could identify water stressed areas; and (iii) could deﬁne threshold CWSI values,\
    \ a great\nhelp for farmers and for irrigation strategies at different phenological\
    \ stages.\nSezen et al. [179] analyzed the CWSI of red pepper irrigated with two\
    \ systems (drip and furrow)\nand with different irrigation regimes. The authors\
    \ concluded that CWSI could measure crop water\nstatus and improve irrigation\
    \ scheduling. For high-quality yields, the authors suggested CSWI values\nof 0.26\
    \ for drip irrigation and 0.38 for furrow irrigation. For both irrigation methods,\
    \ linear relations\nwere found between CWSI and red pepper yield.\nAgam et al.\
    \ [180] tested CWSI for analyzing the changes in water status of olive trees when\n\
    entering into and recovering from stress on a diurnal scale. CWSI was tested in\
    \ an empirical form\nand in two analytical conﬁgurations. The results showed that\
    \ the empirical CWSI was capable even\ngiven its limitations, while the analytical\
    \ forms of CWSI needed enhancement for monitoring the water\nstatus of olive.\
    \ The authors proposed calculating the wet temperature analytically and ﬁxing\
    \ the dry\ntemperature at a level of 5 ◦C higher than the air temperature. Thermal\
    \ imaging and water status\nmeasurements were recorded between 12:00 and 14:00.\n\
    Wang et al. [181] conducted a two-year experiment on early-ripening peach exposed\
    \ to postharvest\ndeﬁcit irrigation schemes, concluding that IR measurements might\
    \ estimate plant water stress,\nparticularly in high-radiative arid and semi-arid\
    \ climates. They found that the temperature differences\n(infrared-canopy temperature\
    \ and air temperature) where correlated to stem water potential and\nproved to\
    \ be a useful tool for water stress assessment for managing regulated deﬁcit irrigation.\n\
    Temperature differences (midday canopy to air temperature) ranged from 5 to 7\
    \ ◦C in the water-stressed\npostharvest deﬁcit irrigation treatments, while they\
    \ ranged from 1.4 to 2 ◦C in the non-water-stressed\ncontrol treatments.\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] calculated CWSI for four 1-hour periods, ranging from 10:00 to\
    \ 14:00,\neach day for 29 days.\nThe estimated CWSI was smallest from 10:00 to\
    \ 11:00 and largest from\n12:00 to 13:00. These values may be used for precise\
    \ (amounts and timing) irrigation scheduling.\nWhen measurements were taken during\
    \ earlier hours, the authors suggested adopting a conservative\nthreshold value\
    \ of CWSI; in contrast, they suggested higher levels when measurements were recorded\n\
    one hour after solar noon.\nGarcía-Tejero et al. [183] conducted a study using\
    \ thermal data to monitor crop-water status in\nirrigated Mediterranean viticulture.\
    \ They found that CWSI and IG might provide more meaningful\ninformation about\
    \ the crop-water status than Tcanopy-air.\nThe authors also found that TC was\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n19 of 36\nsigniﬁcantly correlated with gs and net assimilation,\
    \ suggesting that it can be used as a simpler\nparameter to support thermal remote\
    \ sensing of water stress in grapevines.\nKullber et al. [184] compared and evaluated\
    \ the accuracy of several water-stress coefﬁcient\nmethods for estimating crop\
    \ ETc under different levels of deﬁcit irrigation. Four canopy temperature\nbased\
    \ methods were used to calculate Ks: CWSI, Canopy Temperature Ratio (Tc ratio),\
    \ Degrees Above\nNon-Stressed Temperature (DANS), Degrees Above Canopy Threshold\
    \ (DACT). Methods using only\ncanopy temperature measurements (DANS, DACT, and\
    \ Tc ratio) performed with comparable error to\nmore data intensive methods such\
    \ as CWSI and demonstrated their potential for irrigation scheduling.\nOsroosh\
    \ et al. [185] carried out an experiment on apple trees, to compare two empirical\
    \ indexes, a\nCWSId (averaged over daylight hours) and a CWSIm (midday CWSI).\
    \ Since CWSI was very sensitive\nto mild variations in the soil water content,\
    \ the authors suggested using CWSId and CWSIm for\nestimating soil water availability.\
    \ These indices were also stable under transitional weather conditions.\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] considered the time changes of IR for monitoring corn water stress\
    \ at high\nspatial and temporal resolution for managing irrigation water within\
    \ large agricultural production\nsystems. In the 80-day study, they observed a\
    \ statistical decrease in soil moisture “only when the\nCWSI value increased past\
    \ 0.6 with 82% of soil moisture variation explained by the CWSI”. The CWSI\nwas\
    \ negatively correlated to soil moisture, demonstrating the potentiality of CWSI\
    \ (i) as an alternate\nirrigation scheduling method; and (ii) for quantifying\
    \ spatial soil moisture by IR canopy temperatures.\n4.2.2. Time-Temperature Threshold\
    \ (TTT)\nThe TTT is a method based on a canopy temperature threshold and a time\
    \ threshold [187,188].\nBecause it is a response method of automatic control,\
    \ the TTT method does not need supplementary\ninputs for activating irrigation;\
    \ and it has been credited for regulating water-use efﬁciency.\nEvett et al. [188]\
    \ found no statistical differences in yield and WUE, when comparing TTT and with\n\
    manually irrigated plots, in soybean and corn.\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [189] studied\
    \ the relationship between cotton irrigation scheduling, using\nsoil water measurements\
    \ and two thermal indices. An automatic irrigation scheduling determined by\n\
    a TTT algorithm reduced applied water volumes that did not negatively affect yield.\
    \ In well-watered\nconditions (full irrigation), the TTT method increased WUE\
    \ with respect to the water balance method;\ndifferences were not signiﬁcant at\
    \ reduced water depths (rates of 33 and 67% of full irrigation).\nThe authors\
    \ also found similar trends between two thermal indices, although the daily theoretical\n\
    CWSI resulted in over-irrigation when it was over 0.5.\nLamm et al. [190] compared\
    \ the TTT and ET-based irrigation scheduling for corn production.\nThe TTT method\
    \ accumulated time when the crop was above a speciﬁed temperature. An irrigation\n\
    event signal was triggered when the accumulated time exceeded the speciﬁed TTT\
    \ threshold.\nThe authors compared (i) three irrigation treatments with TTT values\
    \ of 2.5 h, 4.0 h or 5.5 h above a\ncanopy temperature of 28 ◦C; and (ii) two\
    \ ETc treatments (100% and 65%), plus a treatment receiving\nno further irrigation\
    \ after mid-July in Kansas. The results indicated that a TTT with a threshold\
    \ of 2.5 h\ncorresponded to a fully irrigated treatment.\nO’Shaughnessy et al.\
    \ [191] developed a method of integrating the CWSI over a day for presenting\n\
    clear CWSI signals occurring in some environmental conditions, near solar noon.\
    \ CWSI-TT was the\naccumulated time when CWSI was greater than a threshold value\
    \ of 0.45; this cumulated time value\nwas compared with a CWSI-TT value obtained\
    \ for a well-watered crop. The use of CWIS-TT, however,\ncan lead to an over-irrigation\
    \ due to false positive triggers that may be generated early in the season.\n\
    CWSI-TT provided yield results similar to scientiﬁc irrigation scheduling using\
    \ a neutron probe.\nOsroosh et al. [192] tested an automatic control system along\
    \ with a wireless network of soil,\nthermal and weather sensors, developed for\
    \ an apple orchard. Seven irrigation-scheduling algorithms\nwere tested: TTT,\
    \ CWSI, soil-based using granular matrix sensors (SOIL), an ET model, a soil water\n\
    balance (WB), a combination of SOIL and WB, a conventional irrigation practice\
    \ used in the region,\nand soil-based using a neutron probe (NP) as benchmark.\
    \ The treatments TTT, CWSI, NP and WB\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n20 of 36\nsubstantially\
    \ reduced water (70%) while maintaining ψstem within the non-stressed range. WB\
    \ seemed\nto demonstrate the characteristics of being economical, easy to implement\
    \ and accurate.\nDeJonge et al. [193] conducted an experiment on corn to evaluate\
    \ several water stress indices based\non canopy temperature. All thermal indices\
    \ responded quickly to irrigation-treatment differences at\nmajor growth stages,\
    \ in particular Degrees Above Non-Stressed index and Degrees Above Canopy\nThreshold\
    \ index were highly correlated with CWSI above the corn threshold of 28 ◦C used\
    \ in the\nTTT method. Furthermore, all indices showed a linear relationship with\
    \ soil water deﬁcit at high\ntemperatures. Degrees Above Canopy Threshold was\
    \ the best index due to (i) the strong relationships\nwith other indices and crop\
    \ water measurements; and (ii) because it was derived from a single canopy\ntemperature\
    \ measurement.\n4.2.3. Thermography Issue and Critical Aspects\nThe infrared thermometry\
    \ measurements suffer from several critical points, which may affect\nnegatively\
    \ the accuracy of the results. Jones et al. [156] found many important deﬁciencies\
    \ in the\ngeneral applications of CWSI. In particular deﬁciencies included (i)\
    \ the absolute temperature ranges\nmay be small in humid environments; (ii) the\
    \ canopy temperature was negatively affected when crop\nsurface target accidentally\
    \ includes areas such as soil, sky, and trunks; (iii) there existed a different\n\
    distribution of temperatures of sunlit and shaded parts of the canopy; and (iv)\
    \ the sunlit part of the\ncanopy showed a wider range of temperatures when viewed\
    \ normal to the rows or down the rows.\nEvett et al. [115] reported some other\
    \ critical points including that (i) the signal was not stable\nduring cloudy\
    \ periods; (ii) the lower base line and upper limit were difﬁculty to determine\
    \ and (iii)\nno uniqueness of these limits. Others problems were related to the\
    \ ﬁrst growth stages, when soil\nbackground was visible and it was more difﬁcult\
    \ to measure the canopy temperature.\nBaselines\nThe theoretical deﬁnition of\
    \ the two baselines, the lower baseline (well-watered crop, or more\nprecisely\
    \ non-water-stressed crop), and the upper baseline (completely water stressed\
    \ crop).\nThe lower baseline (non-water-stressed crop) depends on the plant species,\
    \ and even among\nvarieties of the same species, which have different canopy and\
    \ leaf structures. The energy balance of\ncrops may differ consistently, since\
    \ each canopy structure has its own radiometric properties, which\ncan facilitate\
    \ in some cases eradiation capture, and, in other cases, that which can escape\
    \ excessive\nradiation loads.\nLeaf Temperature Variability\nOptical parameters\
    \ of leaves of 30 plant species were presented by Gausman and Allen [194],\ndemonstrating\
    \ that each species demonstrated its own coefﬁcient of leaf emissivity. Leaves\
    \ showed\nwide ranges of temperature within a crop, often several degrees within\
    \ and between plants because of\nseveral factors. Each plant had (i) speciﬁc leaf\
    \ angles, that may vary during the day for several reasons\n(e.g., leaf turgidity;\
    \ radiation load, etc.); (ii) speciﬁc dimensions of (young and old) leaves, (iii)\
    \ unique\ncanopy architecture, (iv) different LAI, (v) different radiation loads\
    \ that impacted the crop, and (vi)\naerodynamic properties related to the wind\
    \ speed and direction. Therefore, Jones et al. [195] stated that\n“is desirable\
    \ to measure the canopy surface temperature (Tc) as an aggregate of all leaf temperatures”.\
    \ Maes and\nSteppe [153] noted that measurements of Tc differed from those of\
    \ a single leaf for two main reasons.\nCanopy emissivity was larger than leaf\
    \ emissivity, which has the function of capturing radiation\nfor photosynthesis.\
    \ The estimation of canopy emissivity is quite difﬁcult because it requires night\n\
    measurements. A second difference with canopy temperature measurements include\
    \ branches and, in\nparticular, soil which have temperatures usually higher than\
    \ the canopy. This is particularly evident in\norchards and croplands when the\
    \ canopy cover (crop fraction) is low. Furthermore, they reported that\nin stressed\
    \ conditions, at very low leaf stomatal conductance, the total range in surface\
    \ temperature\nbetween leaves is larger than in unstressed conditions, so that\
    \ canopy temperature variability often\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n21 of 36\n\
    reported as an index of drought stress. The sunlit side of a crop tends to have\
    \ a greater variance of\ntemperature among leaves than the shade side.\nSunlit\
    \ and Shade Leaves\nBoth baselines account for fully sunlit canopy leaves, but\
    \ it is evident that the average canopy\ntemperature is a summary of attributes\
    \ of different leaves, an extensive variety of leaf temperatures,\nwith sunlit\
    \ leaves showing much higher temperatures than shaded leaves [156,196]. Both shade\n\
    and sunlit leaves constantly move to adjust light interception to maximize their\
    \ water use efﬁciency\nand protect leaves from excessive heat and radiation load.\
    \ In both well-watered transpiring and\nwater-stressed canopies, there will be\
    \ a wide range of sunlit and shaded leaves, since it is known that\nthat dry matter\
    \ accumulation in crops is directly related to the interception of solar radiation,\
    \ up to the\ncritical LAI.\nAlvino et al. [196] reported that the fraction of\
    \ light absorbed by leaves, which controls crop\ngrowth rate, plant development,\
    \ crop biomass accumulation, is directly related to the interception of\nsolar\
    \ radiation, up to the critical LAI [197]. The light distribution within the canopy\
    \ affects, inter alia,\nthe photosynthetic efﬁciency. Under comparable environmental\
    \ conditions, the most important are the\nlight levels, since leaf photosynthetic\
    \ rates decline with age after leaf full expansion. The complexity is\nmade worse\
    \ by the difﬁculty of estimating the true age of each leaf in a plant community.\
    \ Furthermore,\nthe head-on viewing of a crop may increase the number of leaves\
    \ that appear shaded, even though\nthey are sunlit. As reported by Jones [156],\
    \ “there are always a few sunlit leaves on the shaded side and some\nshaded leaves\
    \ visible on the sunlit side”.\nTesti et al. [175] reported that measurements\
    \ of tall trees are particularly challenging, because\n(i) open sky is within\
    \ the sensor ﬁeld of view; (ii) a tree canopy has a vertical rather than horizontal\n\
    structure; and (iii) there is a canopy temperature difference between the shaded\
    \ and the sunlit sides.\nCrops with genetic modiﬁcations (reduced leaf and modiﬁed\
    \ stipule morphology) may result in\nenhanced yield when water is a limiting factor,\
    \ avoiding drought stress [198].\nIt is still critical to deﬁne a well-watered\
    \ crop, which according to deﬁnition should transpire\nat a rate regulated by\
    \ physical conditions (e.g., VPD), and not present any physical resistance\nto\
    \ transpiration ﬂuxes.\nHowever, even well-watered plants show a midday depression\
    \ of\nstomatal conductance in case of high VPD [199].\nDifferent indices and procedures\
    \ have been\nproposed [108,111,115,153,164,200].\nAs correctly stated by King\
    \ and Shellie [163], the CWSI has not been widely used for irrigated\ncrops since\
    \ it is necessary to acquire the temperature difference of both transpiring and\
    \ non-transpiring\nleaves under the same environmental conditions. Stated below\
    \ King and Shellie [163] obtained\nCWSI values ranging from 0 to 1, when adopting\
    \ the Tair + 5 ◦C for estimating the temperature\nof non-transpiring leaves (Tdry),\
    \ as proposed by Irmak et al. [201] and Möller et al. [108] for corn\nand grape,\
    \ respectively. The authors found that the maximum temperature difference between\
    \ the\ncanopy of deﬁcit-irrigated vines and Tair was inﬂuenced by irrigation frequency.\
    \ Greater maximum\ntemperature differences were found for vines irrigated once\
    \ a week compared to those irrigated three\ntimes per week. The cultivar response\
    \ to deﬁcit irrigation was different with ‘Syrah’ vines, which were\n2–4 ◦C cooler\
    \ than ‘Malbec’ vines [202], and differences were also detected in leaf surface\
    \ temperature\namong grapevine cultivars undergoing water stress. Bellvert et\
    \ al. [202] reported Tnws − Tair values\nmore than 7.5 ◦C for ‘Pinot-noir’ vines\
    \ subject to water stress, when air temperature was 32.3 ◦C and\nair humidity\
    \ 2.37 kPa. In more stressful conditions (37 ◦C and very low air humidity), the\
    \ authors\nmeasured a difference of 13 ◦C in ‘Syrah’ and 17 ◦C in ‘Malbec’ (Tnws\
    \ − Tair). King and Shellie [163]\nreport that a difference between canopy and\
    \ air temperature of vines of about 17 ◦C, which is much\nhigher than with Tdry\
    \ values assumed in other studies and slightly less than the energy balance models\n\
    developed by Jones [111]. Tdry for calculation of the CWSI was estimated as Tair\
    \ + 15 ◦C for both grape\ncultivars, resulting in a CWSI value between 0 and 1\
    \ for irrigation scheduling purposes. The CWSI\nvalue obtained was a good representation\
    \ of a measure of plant water stress.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n22 of 36\nMöller\
    \ et al. [108] studied the effect of different irrigation treatments on grapevines\
    \ for achieving\na higher fruit quality when the vineyard was subjected to mild-to-moderate\
    \ levels of water stress.\nThe authors found a higher accuracy for determining\
    \ CWSI combining thermal and visible images,\nand adopting the following assumptions:\
    \ (i) CWSI calculated with air temperature +5 ◦C and\n(ii) Twet assumed to be\
    \ the average temperature of the wet artiﬁcial reference surface. Other surface\n\
    temperatures were obtained by wetting the canopy surface before thermal image\
    \ acquisition and from\nthe energy balance according to Jones [164]. There was\
    \ a stable linear relationship when Twet was\nderived from the energy balance\
    \ and from image analysis of a wetted part of the canopy. The authors\nsuggested\
    \ in-depth study was needed to develop this calculation as a tool for irrigation\
    \ management\non a ﬁeld scale.\nLópez-López et al. [135] reported that in case\
    \ of no transpiration, the difference between the\nTair and the Tcrop averaged\
    \ 2.8 ◦C (n = 25). Irmak et al. [201] determined an average value of 4.6 ◦C\n\
    for corn.\nOrta et al. [171] determined in a study of trickle-irrigated watermelon\
    \ upper baseline limits of\n3.3 and 3.4 ◦C. Santesteban et al. [173] preferred\
    \ the approach suggested by Jones et al. [156], whereby\nleaves of two sampled\
    \ grapevines were coated on both sides with petroleum jelly to prevent leaf\n\
    transpiration and interrupt the transpiration-cooling phenomenon, simulating the\
    \ leaf physiological\nresponse to water stress conditions. The authors report\
    \ a variation in vineyard temperature range of\nthe (Tdry and Twet) h of about\
    \ 1.3 ◦C and 2.4 ◦C, respectively.\nKing and Shellie [163] adopted a neural model\
    \ to estimate daily mean CWSI starting from\nwell-watered leaf temperatures and\
    \ air temperature plus 15 ◦C for a non-transpiring leaf temperature\n(between\
    \ 13:00 and 15:00 MDT). They were able to discriminate between deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ amounts,\nirrigation events, and rainfall. In contrast, Park et al. [203] estimated\
    \ the lower boundary temperature,\nrepresenting the temperature of fully transpiring\
    \ leaves, while the temperature of a non-transpiring\nleaf (Tdry) was determined\
    \ by air temperature at + 6 ◦C.\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] found Tc − Tair of\
    \ well-irrigated grapes was effectively determined as\nTc − Tair = 0695 − 1.575\
    \ × VPD.\nMangus et al. [186] derived an instantaneous CWSI using air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and\nsolar radiance. Twet reference were empirically found\
    \ using well-watered plants, while a standardized\nTdry reference of 5 ◦C above\
    \ air temperature was utilized to represent the upper leaf temperature.\nThe same\
    \ results were obtained by DeJonge et al. [192] with an upper baseline of 5◦ C\
    \ and a linear\nrelation with VPD.\nGrant et al. [204] studied the effect of the\
    \ canopy architecture on the crop temperatures of two\ngrapevine cultivars grown\
    \ under two irrigation regimes (fully and not irrigated). They concluded that\n\
    it was desirable to calculate an average over several leaves per canopy in order\
    \ to reduce the effect of\nvariation in leaf angles. The simple CWSI, without\
    \ further data acquisition, was sufﬁcient for detecting\nthe relative stress required\
    \ for scheduling irrigation.\nTime of Measurements\nTesti et al. [175] found that\
    \ the CWSI measured in the early afternoon hours was a good\ndescriptor of water\
    \ status of a pistachio orchard. Ghaemi et al. [205] developed baseline equation\
    \ to\ncalculate eggplant CWSI reﬂecting water deﬁcit and salinity stresses, and\
    \ also studied the effect of\ngrowth environment (ﬁeld and greenhouse) on eggplant\
    \ CWSI values and its relationship with crop\nevapotranspiration and yield. CWSI\
    \ values were signiﬁcantly affected by water deﬁcit and salinity,\nand rising\
    \ levels of water salinity decreased the slope of the lower baseline in both crop\
    \ conditions,\nalong with a rise in the upper baseline.\nGarcía-Tejero et al.\
    \ [183] found that the best time to obtain robust and more physiologically\nmeaningful\
    \ thermal data to assess grapevine water status was between 11:00 h and 14:00\
    \ h, independent\nof the variety.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n23 of 36\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] found differences in estimating CWSI at different times of day.\
    \ The smallest\ndifference was from 10:00 to 11:00 h and the highest from 12:00\
    \ to 13:00 h periods. In their study,\nthey combined IR thermometry with some\
    \ weather parameters to develop non-water-stressed and\nnon-transpiring baselines\
    \ for irrigated maize in of Colorado (USA).\nKing and Shelliey [163] reported\
    \ that clouds (thin cirrus), often present during the best\ntwo-hour-time for\
    \ CWSI monitoring, rapidly caused changes in levels of solar radiation and, as\n\
    a consequence, an effect on Tnws. They also provided a detailed description of\
    \ physiological variations\nwithin a canopy; particular attention was given to\
    \ rapid changes of leaf temperature in response to\nenvironmental ﬂuctuations\
    \ (e.g., air turbulence, changing radiation). For this reason, they proposed\n\
    the adoption of a 2-h-averaged CWSI value based on 15-min average measured values\
    \ (canopy\ntemperature, air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and\
    \ wind speed), which provided\na sound daily CWSI value under variable climatic\
    \ conditions. The results appeared to be consistent\neven when comparing two grape\
    \ cultivars, characterized by different canopy temperature in response\nto climatic\
    \ conditions and irrigation conditions.\nBellvert et al. [172] found a good estimate\
    \ for the calculated daily mean CWSI of well-watered\nleaves between 10:00 and\
    \ 16:00 h. Berni et al. [84], using airborne thermal data of an olive orchard,\n\
    found the best results from 07:30 to 09:30; however, at 12:30 h there was an overestimate\
    \ of canopy\nconductance values. Bellvert et al. [202] found that the correlation\
    \ between CWSI and ΨL had different\nR2 values at different hours of measurements\
    \ (0.46 at 09:30 and 0.71 at 12:30), suggesting that the latter\nwas the more\
    \ favorable time for obtaining thermal images that were linked with ΨL values.\n\
    In Zarco-Tejada et al. [145], CWSI was measured from 13:00 to 15:30 coinciding\
    \ with the times at\nwhich the non-stressed baseline was obtained.\n4.3. Remote\
    \ Sensing and Soil\nSoil moisture measurements are critical components for climate\
    \ studies, hydrology, weather\npredictions, analysis of ﬂooded areas or the recharge\
    \ of aquifers. Real time analysis of the soil water\ncontent is crucial for optimizing\
    \ water management of agricultural ﬁelds.\nNichols et al. [206] presented an overview\
    \ of soil-moisture retrieval methods using different\nremote sensing data (active\
    \ or passive). They reported the advantages and limitations of each method,\n\
    and the evaluation of the most robust methods for retrieving soil-moisture information\
    \ from bare and\nvegetated soils. The best results come from a combination of\
    \ active and passive sensing methods.\nA backscatter empirical model (active method)\
    \ gave a 95–97% correlation between the estimated and\nthe ﬁeld soil measurements.\
    \ The “neural networks method” (passive method) gave a 100% correlation\nbetween\
    \ the estimated and ﬁeld soil measurements.\nRoussel et al. [62] reported the\
    \ adoption of GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) based on a low-cost\ndevice and an airborne\
    \ solution. For irrigation purposes, the GNSS-R system was useful for soil\nmoisture\
    \ monitoring. Classical probes were not considered representative of the ﬁeld-soil\
    \ moisture\nsince they return punctual measurements. The authors considered the\
    \ soil moisture monitored on a\nlarge scale to be appropriate, even at the expense\
    \ of temporal and/or spatial resolution. Even satellite\nmeasurements were not\
    \ sufﬁcient to monitor diurnal variations.\nYueh et al. [207] provided a review\
    \ of the calibration, validation and assessment of Soil Moisture\nActive Passive\
    \ (SMAP) instruments. The project conducted two activities aimed at enhancing\
    \ the\nproducts’ resolution: (i) the Backus Gilbert interpolation and de-convolution\
    \ techniques based on the\noversampling characteristics of the SMAP radiometer;\
    \ (ii) the disaggregation of the SMAP radiometer\ndata using the Sentinel-1 C-band\
    \ synthetic aperture radar data to obtain a resolution from 1 km to\n3 km.\nMulder\
    \ et al. [208] studied microwave remote sensing of soil moisture content. The\
    \ system was\nfounded on the different dielectric properties of water with respect\
    \ to dry soil. The Soil Water Index\n(SWI) was combined with the METOP ASCAT and\
    \ ENVISAT ASAR GM to obtain one layer with\nhigh resolution (1 km). The authors\
    \ reported another way of assessing soil moisture, the Soil Energy\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n24 of 36\nBALance (SEBAl). All of these models were applied on\
    \ a local scale to produce the actual ET linked to\nsoil water. The authors indicated\
    \ that the most broadly used methods were the SEBAL, the Two-Source\nEnergy Balance\
    \ (TSEB) modeling approach, and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS).\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] performed a full-season experiment in a greenhouse with several\
    \ objectives.\nSince CWSI (values between 0.6 and 1.0) was negatively correlated\
    \ to soil moisture, the index may be\nconsidered “as an alternate irrigation scheduling\
    \ method to quantify spatial soil moisture”.\nOther information is reported in\
    \ the previous Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.4.\n4.3.1. Vegetation Indices\nDifferent\
    \ indexes have been set up to estimate different crop parameters (e.g., crop density,\n\
    biomass, chlorophyll, nitrogen, water content, etc.); the Enhanced Vegetation\
    \ Index (EVI), the Soil\nAdjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Simple Ratio (SR),\
    \ and the Normalized Difference Vegetation\nIndex (NDVI), are measures of canopy\
    \ greenness, which may be related to physiological processes\nsuch as transpiration\
    \ and photosynthesis [209–211].\nZhao et al. [212] studied the relationship between\
    \ stem water potential (SWP) and VIs extracted\nfrom high spatial resolution images.\n\
    A circle mission was conducted to evaluate the effects\nof bidirectional reﬂectance\
    \ distribution fraction (BRDF) and canopy NDVI mean.\nThe authors\ndemonstrated\
    \ the importance of BRDF to infer SWP from NDVI mean. Circle missions indicated\
    \ that\nview angle inﬂuenced the canopy NDVI. This could lead to a prediction\
    \ error of SWP of up to 12 bars.\nFurther analysis of images identiﬁed a non-normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NNDVI) based\non ground-derived measurements over\
    \ three weeks that showed a more signiﬁcant relationship with\nSWP than the canopy\
    \ NDVI mean.\nZúñiga et al. [213], in a study on a remote sensing-based WUE evaluation\
    \ of sub-surface irrigated\ngrape vines, compared several irrigation methods.\
    \ Differences in NDVI values occurred among\ndifferent irrigation strategies (surface\
    \ and subsurface irrigation methods) and when irrigation rates\nwere compared.\
    \ Multispectral satellite imagery, particularly with a red edge waveband, demonstrated\n\
    the potential for quantifying soil-moisture-tension variability, and hence could\
    \ be used for variable rate\nirrigation management. Red Edge Normalized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index (RENDVI) was especially\nsensitive to soil moisture tension\
    \ and demonstrated that a single image could be representative of\nvariability\
    \ up to two weeks after acquisition. However, it will be necessary to conﬁrm the\
    \ repeatability\nof these results at more maize growth stages and with other crops.\
    \ Finally, an economic study to\nevaluate the monetary and environmental implications\
    \ of such management at a ﬁeld scale would\nhelp transition these ﬁndings into\
    \ adoption by growers [214].\nToureiro et al. [215] presented work on the use\
    \ of remote sensing for measuring soil water\navailability for optimizing crop\
    \ growth. Data were determined by satellite and integrated with\natmosphere and\
    \ crop parameters to calculate biophysical indicators and indices of water stress\n\
    by NDVI, Kc, and Kcb. The results showed that remote sensing based on multispectral\
    \ images\nmay be used, with a high degree of accuracy and spatial representation,\
    \ to calculate crop water\nand irrigation requirements. However, frequent mapping\
    \ of soil water status and crop irrigation\nrequirements would be required; this\
    \ is the weakest point of the satellite imagery methodology used.\nTemporal representation,\
    \ once each 16 days with the Landsat 5 satellite, would not be enough for\nirrigation\
    \ management. The Sentinel 2 satellite is available and could be combined with\
    \ data from\nother satellites to provide more frequent images of the land surface.\n\
    4.3.2. WUE\nMarino et al. [216] evaluated the use of soil and vegetation spectroradiometry\
    \ to investigate crop\nwater use efﬁciency of drip-irrigated tomato. A new instrument\
    \ to measure in-depth soil moisture was\ntested combined with the Hargreaves method\
    \ and VIs with the goal of reducing irrigation volume, to\nassess crop spatial\
    \ variability, and to identify the best VIs related to WUE, at a ﬁeld scale. The\
    \ tomato\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n25 of 36\ncrop was drip irrigated by an automated\
    \ precision system, which maintained the soil water content\nwithin a speciﬁc\
    \ range related to growth stage and environmental conditions.\nThe instrument\
    \ recorded the soil moisture at different soil depths, providing information on\n\
    the amount of water to apply, taking into account—at each watering—the volume\
    \ of the root zone\nexplored by the crop. The results conﬁrmed that the system\
    \ saved water, applying lower soil water\ndepths than those calculated with the\
    \ Hargreaves formula. The ﬁeld was divided into three clusters,\ncharacterized\
    \ by increasing WUE. The highest (H) cluster showed a WUE value of 35.1 kg·m−3;\n\
    the lowest (L) showed WUE a value of 23.1 kg·m−3. Among VIs tested, the Perpendicular\
    \ vegetation\nindex (PVI), Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index (SAVI), optimized\
    \ Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index\n(OSAVI), and Weighted Difference Vegetation\
    \ (WDVI) were signiﬁcantly related to tomato crop yield.\nThe authors concluded\
    \ that “PVI proved to be a useful tool for (i) a better understanding of the different\
    \ ﬁeld\nproductive areas and for (ii) the adoption of variable water rate application\
    \ according to the different PVI values.\nThe irrigation system adopted proved\
    \ to be effective from agronomic and environmental point of view”.\nSimilar probes\
    \ were used by Nolz et al. [217] to monitor soil water in a vineyard for irrigation\n\
    management. Wang et al. [218] studied the application of quick techniques based\
    \ on thermal imaging\nand visual-NIR spectroscopy for measuring WUE in millet.\
    \ The authors suggested that the exact\nspectral parameters used for measuring\
    \ physiological factors (e.g., E, gs, leaf and WUE) may be used\nfor estimating\
    \ response of crops to changes in the environmental conditions.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    The advances in electronic and information technologies have developed various\
    \ non-invasive\nsensing systems, which return accurate georeferred information\
    \ on spatial variability within ﬁelds.\nThe sensing systems utilize sensors and\
    \ instruments that produce a huge amount of data at\ndifferent scales (temporal\
    \ and spatial) and distances from the target. Remote (satellite, airborne\nand\
    \ UAV imageries) and proximal sensors (mounted on tractors, poles or towers, and\
    \ portable\nspecto-radiometers) are able to detect soil and crop information,\
    \ such as soil status and traits, crop yield,\ncanopy volume and biomass, crop\
    \ water status, and pests (disease, weeds, and insects). These sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ cane be used for precision agriculture and irrigation management.\nSoaring investments\
    \ in R&D have spurred all branches of knowledge linked to RS, boosting the\nproduction\
    \ of reliable and accurate sensors. Temporal frequency of RS imagery has also\
    \ improved\nconsistently, although it has been impaired by considerable lengthening\
    \ of the average times for data\nprocessing. Data processing of images necessitates\
    \ adequate hardware, speciﬁc expertise, skills and\nfunds, which are likely to\
    \ be provided only by specialized reprocessing companies.\nOverall, there are\
    \ numerous studies with spatially distributed information on ET and plant\nwater\
    \ status. These approaches use reﬂectance, including thermal radiance, measurements\
    \ of the\nsurface, vegetation index-based crop coefﬁcients, surface energy balance\
    \ models, and soil water balance\n(although limited to the upper soil layer).\n\
    On a small scale, the focus on time and space has signiﬁcantly improved the monitoring\
    \ of the\ncrop water status of many crops, especially orchards and vineyards.\
    \ The estimation of ET and kc,\nof appearance of biotic and abiotic stresses,\
    \ of crop spatial variability, and of canopy volume have\nbeen improved signiﬁcantly.\
    \ On a ﬁeld scale, the attention paid to soil-water status seems inadequate,\n\
    although soil moisture monitoring is a prerequisite for professionally controlled\
    \ irrigation that satisﬁes\ncrop water requirements (precision irrigation) and\
    \ reduces inefﬁcient spatial allocation of irrigation\nwater, in particular over\
    \ irrigation that causes N leaching. There are current limits of RS, which can\n\
    answer the question of “when to apply water”, because the irrigation volume needs\
    \ to be estimated\nbased on other methods, as wisely pointed out by Taghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] These other methods,\ninclude—amongst many—the use of electronic\
    \ probes measuring crop water consumption [113], with\nthe aim of deﬁning the\
    \ right water depth to apply to a ﬁeld, and hopefully to each homogeneous area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n26 of 36\nSince positive correlations between crop-water\
    \ status and yield vary among crops, RS studies on\nirrigation should pay more\
    \ attention to ﬁeld production, either in absolute terms (maximizing ﬁeld\nproductivity)\
    \ or in relative terms (higher WUE).\nIn the near future, it is likely that all\
    \ available tools (multi-temporal images combined with\nmodels and improved sensors)\
    \ will contribute to monitoring crop status for triggering irrigation.\nAs mentioned\
    \ above, doubts persist on their ability to estimate the water delivery to the\
    \ ﬁeld for each\ncrop, or to different zones in the case of high crop spatial\
    \ variability.\nA holistic approach is necessary for moving toward precision irrigation.\
    \ It will be necessary\nto set up networks that contemplate the participation\
    \ of public/private partnerships, universities,\nand research institutes, for\
    \ producing multi-temporal images, models, sensors and data sets [94] for\nmanaging\
    \ precision irrigation. Among several EU hubs of excellence, the Quantalab IAS—CSIC\
    \ in\nSpain focuses on quantitative methods for remote sensing in agriculture\
    \ and forestry, for a wide\napplication of precision agriculture and precision\
    \ irrigation, for the assessment of environmental\nimpacts and stress detection.\n\
    Other\nscientists\nare\npursuing\ngrassroots\nremote\nsensing\nand\ndemocratic\n\
    mapping.\nAnderson et al. [93] have generated a toolkit using drones, live coding,\
    \ smartphones and kites.\nFor all institutions developing RS, a key factor will\
    \ be the operational readiness of information\nprovided to farmers and technicians\
    \ for managing irrigation. For irrigation purposes, it will be\nnecessary to develop\
    \ techniques and interpretative frameworks to provide low-cost and affordable\n\
    tools and real-time information to stakeholders involved in the management and\
    \ security of\nagricultural and related sectors.\nAuthor Contributions: Arturo\

    for achieving yield and quality assurance to guarantee profitable crop production
    in dry years. • We modelled and mapped the financial benefits of supplemental
    irrigation in England and Wales. • A sensitivity analysis shows the impact of
    agroclimate, market and water supply conditions on irrigation benefits. • A better
    knowledge of the financial benefits of irrigation would support decision making
    in water resources planning to reduce the impacts of low flows on agriculture
    during drought periods. Abstract Irrigation is an essential component of crop
    production to meet retailer demands for premium quality when rainfall is insufficient.
    Under drought conditions, irrigation can be constrained by water resources availability,
    with consequent impacts on yield, quality and revenue. Whilst most agriculture
    in Europe is rainfed, greater dependence on supplemental irrigation could become
    more important in humid environments due to a changing climate with greater rainfall
    uncertainty and higher frequency of droughts. By combining industry and farm level
    economic data, with geospatial information on agricultural land use, agroclimate,
    soils and irrigation practices within a GIS, this paper estimates the total financial
    benefit of outdoor irrigated production in England and Wales assuming no constraints
    in resource availability and optimal irrigation practices. The analysis suggests
    that the total net benefits of irrigation in a ‘design’ dry year are around £665
    million, with an average irrigation water productivity in excess of £3.3 per m3
    (close to £1.1 per m3 excluding soft fruit). Map outputs highlight significant
    regional differences in water productivity reflecting the composition of land
    use and the importance of crop mix in determining economic value. A sensitivity
    analysis to changes in agroclimate, market conditions (crop prices) and water
    supply (costs) illustrates how the benefits might change under contrasting scenario.
    The study highlights the importance of supplemental irrigation, even in a humid
    climate, and the risks that future droughts and/or constraints in water resource
    availability might have on agricultural systems, livelihoods and the rural economy.
    The implications for water resources and drought management are discussed. Previous

    resource, not only in arid and drought-prone areas but also in more humid and
    temperate regions where traditionally rainfall has been abundant (Santos Pereira
    et al., 2002, Daccache et al., 2012). A drought is normally defined as a natural
    hazard caused by a period of abnormally low precipitation. Three main types of
    droughts can be distinguished: a meteorological drought, an agricultural drought,
    a hydrological drought. A fourth type, socio-economic drought, can also be defined,
    dealing with drought in terms of supply and demand, taking into account the impact
    of water shortages on socio-economic systems (Wilhite and Glantz, 1985). A meteorological
    drought is characterised by a prolonged period of low rainfall; an agricultural
    drought occurs when a lack of precipitation results in low soil moisture that
    affects crop growth and development; and a hydrological droughts typically occurs
    when precipitation deficits lead to below normal water levels in reservoirs and
    rivers for an extended period (AMS Council, 2013). Over the last three decades,
    the incidence of droughts in Europe has increased in both intensity and number,
    mainly in the Mediterranean region (European Commission, 2007). The risk of drought
    and water scarcity is expected to increase in future in currently dry regions
    due to a range of factors including climate change and population growth (IPCC,
    2014). The agricultural sector is particularly sensitive to drought and water
    scarcity because of its dependence on water, along with other weather-related
    factors (Knox et al., 2010a). Agriculture is the dominant user of freshwater in
    many countries, accounting for 70% of global water withdrawals (FAO, 2004, Calzadilla
    et al., 2010). Most irrigation occurs in arid and semi-arid areas where there
    is insufficient rainfall to support crop growth. In these areas, the inter-annual
    variability in irrigation application is relatively small as irrigation provides
    the majority of crop water requirements to sustain crop growth. Whilst such areas
    have tended to be the focus for most research on irrigation demand assessment,
    water efficiency and economic valuation (Hillel, 1987, Oweis, 1997, Deng et al.,
    2006, Prasad et al., 2006), supplemental irrigation can also be critical in humid
    regions where it buffers the effects of rainfall variability so that the adverse
    effects of low soil moisture content on crop development and particularly quality
    are reduced (Oweis, 2005). Given an increasing emphasis on quality assurance,
    rather than solely yield, supplemental irrigation is essential to ensure the viability
    and profitability of particular crops in some regions. For example, there has
    been a marked increase in irrigation of high-value crops such as potatoes and
    field vegetables in the UK (Morris et al., 2014). However agricultural irrigation
    is often given the lowest priority for water allocation under drought conditions.
    This partly reflects a perception that the marginal value of water is relatively
    low in agriculture compared to its use in other sectors including public water
    supply, and that there is scope in drought conditions for increasing the ‘efficiency
    in use’ of agricultural irrigation. However, in humid regions, the small application
    depths applied to high-value crops primarily for quality assurance purposes can
    result in very high financial benefits, and hence the potential economic impacts
    of any water shortages (abstraction restrictions) can be substantial (Knox et
    al., 2000). In order to guarantee public water supply and maintain minimum environmental
    flows during droughts, the water regulatory agency in England and Wales (Environment
    Agency, EA) can impose partial or total bans on irrigation abstraction (EA, 2012,
    Defra, 2014), so water may not be available to farmers when needed (Knox et al.,
    2010b). This has occurred during recent drought episodes in 1995, 2003, 2006 and
    2011–2012 (ADAS, 1999, Marsh, 2004, EA, 2006, EA, 2011a). For instance, formal
    restrictions were imposed on 600 spray irrigation licences during the 2006 drought,
    and 300 irrigators were affected by abstraction restrictions in the 2012 drought
    (EA, 2011b, Vivid Economics, 2013). Hess et al. (2011) estimated that more than
    half of the total area of irrigated production in England and Wales is currently
    located in catchments designated as being either ‘over-abstracted’ and/or ‘over-licensed’;
    these areas are therefore the focus of increasing attention to support more sustainable
    levels of abstraction through regulatory reform and the revocation of so-called
    ‘time-limited’ licences (perpetuity). In order to protect their interests some
    farmers have formed water abstractor groups (WAGs) to collectively share their
    risks and knowledge (Leathes et al., 2008), whilst others have taken individual
    actions including investment in storage reservoirs and precision irrigation. Drought
    combined with restrictions on irrigation abstraction can therefore have important
    agronomic and economic impacts on crop production. Whilst the impacts of drought
    on the value of output from UK agriculture as a whole have been assessed (e.g.
    ADAS (1999) for the 1995 drought; and Anglian Water and University of Cambridge
    (2013) for the 2010–2012 drought), there is much less understanding of the economic
    impacts of restrictions on supplemental irrigation in field-scale agriculture
    and horticulture. With a changing climate expected to increase irrigation demand
    (Weatherhead and Knox, 2015; Rodriguez Diaz et al., 2007; Else and Atkinson, 2010)
    and the frequency and severity of droughts also expected to impact on irrigated
    agriculture (Fowler and Kilsby, 2004), this study builds on previous research
    (Morris et al., 1997, Knox et al., 2000) to provide the first comprehensive national
    spatial assessment of the financial benefits of supplementary irrigation, both
    in terms of yield and quality assurance in a dry year. This will support policies
    to better understand the impacts of abstraction restrictions in the sector, and
    to improve drought management strategies which balance impacts across different
    economic and environmental sectors. As a result, the farming community will be
    better equipped to estimate potential losses arising from drought, as will governments
    and agencies in deciding where and when to impose restrictions on agriculture
    with minimum economic impact. The analysis is applied to outdoor irrigated cropping
    in England and Wales, but the approach is applicable in other countries where
    appropriate datasets are available. The methodology and outputs also have significant
    implications for the implementation of abstraction controls within the Water Framework
    Directive (WFD). 2. Material and methods In summary, a four staged approach was
    developed: 1. Deriving and mapping agroclimate variability using potential soil
    moisture deficit (PSMD) as an aridity indicator; 2. Modelling and mapping theoretical
    volumetric irrigation water demand for the major irrigated crop categories during
    a design dry year; 3. Mapping the financial value of supplemental irrigation,
    by crop category and per unit of water applied (water productivity), and; 4. Conducting
    a sensitivity analysis to assess how the irrigation benefits might change under
    contrasting agroclimate, market (price) and water supply (water price) conditions.
    A brief description of each stage is given below. 2.1. Mapping agroclimate variability
    A dry year in England and Wales in irrigation terms is typically characterised
    by periods of low rainfall and high evapotranspiration (ET) from June to August
    (Weatherhead et al., 1997). The combined effects of rainfall and ET on irrigation
    demand can be reflected via an aridity index using potential soil moisture deficit
    (PSMD). The advantage of using PSMD over other agroclimatic indicators (e.g. Standardised
    Precipitation Index, SPI) is that the distribution of rainfall and ET throughout
    the year is taken into account. It can also be used to identify the dryness or
    wetness of a specific location for a given year. The index has been widely used
    internationally to quantify irrigation needs at different scales and assess climate
    impacts on water demand (Knox et al., 1997, Knox et al., 2010a, Knox et al., 2010b,
    De Silva et al., 2007, Rodríguez Díaz et al., 2007). It is also used by the regulatory
    authority in England and Wales for setting licences (permits) for irrigation abstraction
    (Rees et al., 2003). In this study, the PSMD index for 2010 was calculated using
    a 5 km × 5 km gridded monthly climatic dataset from the UK Meteorological Office
    derived from observed historical weather data collected from a range of meteorological
    stations spatially distributed across the UK (Perry and Hollis, 2004). The rationale
    for using 2010 data was twofold: Knox et al. (2014) reported that 2010 closely
    approximated to a ‘design’ dry year in irrigation terms (statistically defined
    as the unconstrained water demand with an 80% probability of non-exceedance);
    secondly, national irrigated area data were available from the most recent 2010
    Defra Irrigation Survey (Defra, 2011). Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was
    calculated using the gridded monthly temperature, solar radiation, wind speed
    and relative humidity data and the FAO Penman-Monteith combination equation (Allen
    et al., 1998). Using monthly rainfall ( ) and reference evapotranspiration ( )
    data, the PSMD (mm) for each month ( ) is calculated as following: (1) In months
    where , any initial soil moisture deficit is filled and hence . In the UK, soil
    moisture deficits typically start to build up in early spring as ET > P, peak
    in mid-summer (July–August) and then decline to zero through autumn and winter
    as P > ET. Therefore in the UK, the estimation of PSMD can start with January
    as month t = 1. The maximum PSMD of the 12 months of each year is the PSMDmax
    value assigned to that year at that location. A map showing the spatial variation
    in PSMDmax for England and Wales at 5 km grid resolution for 2010 was produced
    and then used to estimate volumetric irrigation demand. 2.2. Mapping theoretical
    volumetric irrigation demand (m3) The spatial volumetric irrigation needs of the
    main outdoor crop categories in England and Wales were derived by applying the
    methodology developed by Knox et al. (1997) to spatial datasets of climate, soil
    type, crop areas and irrigation survey results. In summary, Knox et al. (1997)
    used a daily time-step water balance model (Hess, 1996) to calculate the theoretical
    unconstrained annual irrigation need (mm) for each of the major irrigated crop
    categories (potatoes, field vegetables, sugar beet, soft fruit, orchard fruit,
    grass, and cereals) grown on a contrasting range of soil types at agroclimatically
    contrasting locations. These results were then correlated using linear regression
    analyses against the PSMDmax. Knox et al. (1997) developed formulae for each crop
    relating the theoretical irrigation need for any specific year or location to
    soil type and agroclimate (PSMDmax). The spatial volumetric water demand in a
    grid square was calculated by applying the regression relationships derived by
    Knox et al. (1997) for each crop type to the gridded agroclimate dataset (PSMDmax)
    for 2010, taking account the spatial distribution of soil types from the National
    Soil Map1 and estimated irrigated area (ha) in each grid pixel. The irrigated
    area within each catchment was calculated using a GIS by applying the 2005 and
    2010 Defra Irrigation Survey results to the 2 km × 2 km gridded land use dataset
    derived from the Defra, 2011 June Agricultural Census data. Three different soil
    types were considered for calculating theoretical water demand, depending on available
    water capacity (AWC): low AWC (<100 mm/m), medium AWC (100–175 mm/m), and high
    AWC (>175 mm/m). 2.3. Mapping the financial value of supplemental irrigation (£/m3)
    The positive effect that irrigation has on crops, both in terms of yield and quality
    (and therefore revenue) (Weatherhead et al., 1997) is crop specific since each
    crop responds differently to the same volume of water applied. Several studies
    have estimated the yield response to irrigation (e.g. Morris et al., 1997; based
    on experimental data and farm records) allowing us to estimate the average net
    yield increase for each unit (mm) of water applied (Table 1). This is then up-scaled
    to estimate the net yield increase in each grid pixel according to the theoretical
    irrigation need (based on the local soil type and PSMDmax). However, irrigation
    also has a very important effect on quality which is critical for some crops;
    for example, on potatoes it is used to limit the incidence of common scab (Streptomyces
    scabies spp.) which causes skin imperfections or for lettuces where water shortages
    can negatively impact on size, shape and leaf defects. Irrigation is also essential
    for soft fruit (strawberries) since the majority of the crop is grown under temporary
    polytunnels to prevent rain damage and thus attain Grade 1 class fruit, which
    has a much higher price than the strawberries sold for processing. In this study,
    we estimated the benefits of irrigation on crop quality, expressed as a percentage
    increase in crop price (£/t) based on published literature corroborated by farmer
    interviews. These data have been used to derive estimates of the quality benefits
    of irrigation for each crop and soil type (Table 2). All costs and prices used
    in this assessment, including the additional costs due to increased production
    shown as in Table 1 were checked and confirmed with horticultural and soft fruit
    growers via a series of face-to-face interviews in 2015. Table 1. Main economic
    data and crop yield response to irrigation. Crop category Crop pricea (£/t) Additional
    costs due to increased production (% gross benefit)b Average crop yield response
    per hectarec (t/mm) Early potatoes 155 15% 0.08 Main crop potatoes 104 15% 0.08
    Cereals (wheat) 110 3% 0.02 Sugar beet 31 10% 0.13 Vegetables (carrots) 95 15%
    0.13 Soft fruit (strawberries) 600 25% 0.03 Grass- graze 95 0% 0.03 Grass- silage
    95 22% 0.03 Orchard fruit (dessert apple) 479 25% 0.02 a These represent the average
    national crop price (£/tonne, adjusted for inflation using the Agricultural Price
    Index for the UK, which measures the monthly price changes in agricultural outputs
    and inputs for all major crops). Information was collected for all crop categories
    over the past three drought episodes in the UK (2003, 2004–2006, 2010–2012), from
    the relevant years of the Farm Business Survey (e.g. Defra 2005), the Agriculture
    in the English regions (e.g. Defra 2006) and the Farm Management Pocketbook (e.g.
    Nix, 2010). b Extra costs associated with the additional production due to irrigation.
    These include: additional harvesting, handling, drying and if relevant, direct
    packaging and marketing costs (Morris et al., 1997), but not the variable costs
    of irrigation. c Average yield response to irrigation, normalised by irrigation
    depth, obtained from previous experimental data and field experience in the UK
    from Morris et al. (1997). A simplifying assumption of a linear relationship between
    irrigation depth and yield is used to estimate irrigation benefits, given the
    impracticability of calibrating biophysical crop models to characterise the non-linear
    response for all combinations of agroclimate, soils and crop type across the UK.

    water capacity (AWC) soils, expressed as% increase in the rain-fed crop price.

    429% 429% Grass 0% 0% 5% Orchard fruit (dessert apple) 14% 20% 25% a The very
    large price benefit due to irrigation for strawberries reflects the difference
    in price between Class 1 strawberries (that can only be achieved with irrigation,
    and have an average price of £3150 per tonne) and the lower quality strawberries
    that result if growers are unable to meet crop water requirements in a dry year
    (and sold for processing at an average price of £600 per tonne. Conventionally,
    it is assumed that crop prices rise during a drought as agricultural production
    is affected by weather conditions (FAO et al., 2011). However, the final impact
    on price is influenced by many other factors, such as the timing and onset of
    the drought, world market prices and the extent to which imported products affect
    the local domestic food market. Thus, in estimating the benefits of irrigation
    in financial terms, the average crop price (£/tonne, adjusted for inflation using
    the government Agricultural Price Index for the UK) over the past three drought
    episodes in the UK (2003, 2004–2006, 2010–2012) were used (Table 1). Regionally
    disaggregated price information is available for some crop types, but not all;
    we therefore assumed national average crop prices for our analysis, having checked
    that differences were not significant across the country for the available price
    data (for instance, the price of cereals has a coefficient of variation (CV) across
    regions <0.05 cereals and <0.16 for potatoes). Price data for these periods were
    drawn from various sources including Defra, 2005, Defra, 2006, Nix, 2010.2 For
    each crop, the additional costs associated with the increased production (e.g.
    during harvest, handling, drying) (Table 1) were deducted from the gross benefit.
    The variable irrigation costs (repairs, fuel, labour and machinery, water charges)
    were also deducted. The costs of irrigation vary considerably depending on local
    circumstances, the type of irrigation system, the water source and crop water
    requirements (Morris et al., 2014). For calculation purposes, we assumed average
    variable costs of irrigation in the UK (1.50 £/ha mm, based on Nix (2010)). By
    combining the yield and quality benefits, the total financial benefit of supplemental
    irrigation can be estimated. Here, we consider only the extra net benefits derived
    from irrigation in comparison with the benefits that the farmer would get from
    the same crops grown under non-irrigated conditions (the counter-factual); i.e.
    the added value associated with irrigation relative to rainfed production.3 Fig.
    1 shows that the yield and quality benefits are multiplicative, not additive,
    as the quality premia are relevant to the whole crop not just the yield increase.
    From the gross benefits illustrated in Fig. 1, the irrigation costs and additional
    costs associated with higher levels of production must be deducted to obtain the
    net extra margin (£/ha mm) derived from supplemental irrigation. Download : Download

    derived and used to estimate the net irrigation benefit (total and per ha) and

    (£) (2) - Benefit per irrigated hectare (£/ha) (3) - Water productivity (£/m3)
    (4) where, B is the financial irrigation benefit (£). Y refers to the yield benefit
    derived from irrigation (£/ha) and Q the quality benefit (£/ha). P represents
    the extra crop costs (£/ha) and I the irrigation costs (£/ha). R represents the
    total benefit associated with non-irrigated production (£/ha). Subscript c represents
    each of the eight major irrigated crops (namely, early potatoes, maincrop potatoes,
    cereals, sugar beet, vegetables, soft fruit, grass, and orchard fruit); subscript
    s denotes the soil available water capacity (AWC) (high AWC, medium AWC and low
    AWC). A is the irrigated area of each crop (ha); W is the water average productivity
    (£/m3) and V is the theoretical irrigation water demand (m3). 2.4. Sensitivity
    analysis For each crop category, agroclimate (PSMD), crop price and water cost
    were assumed to have the greatest impact on irrigation benefit. Higher PSMD values
    imply higher irrigation needs (mm), and thus higher benefits derived from fulfilling
    crop water requirements, as the differences between rainfed and irrigated yield
    would be higher (Morris et al., 2014). Higher crop prices increase the benefit
    that irrigators derive from each incremental depth of water applied (mm) to their
    crops. Costs of water will have a direct impact on water productivity (£/m3).
    Using different agroclimate and price scenario, a sensitivity analysis was also
    undertaken to assess how the irrigation benefits might be impacted by changes
    in each of these variables. 3. Results 3.1. Irrigated production and water resource
    availability Fig. 2a shows the spatial variability in agroclimate across England
    and Wales for 2010, assumed here to represent a ‘design’ dry year, defined as
    a year with an 80% probability of non-exceedance. The areas of highest aridity
    (high PSMDmax) are concentrated in eastern and southern England, notably in Norfolk,
    Suffolk, Essex and Kent. These correspond to parts of the country where irrigated
    cropping is most concentrated (Fig. 2b) reflecting suitable soils and agroclimatic
    conditions for potato and field-vegetable production in East Anglia, and soft
    and orchard fruit production in Kent. The location of irrigated production is
    also closely correlated with (though not necessarily the cause of) water resources
    availability with 59% located in either over-licensed and/or over-abstracted catchments
    (Fig. 2c). In contrast, regions with the lowest aridity extend across much of
    Wales, the south west and north-west of England, reflecting higher rainfall and
    less suited land for intensive irrigated vegetable production. In these regions,
    rainfed production including extensive grassland for livestock is the dominant
    form of agricultural land use. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Maximum

    Irrigation water demand, value and productivity The calculated spatial distribution
    of volumetric irrigation demand in England and Wales is shown in Fig. 3a. Nationally,
    the majority (80%) of irrigation demand is concentrated in central and eastern
    England, notably in EA Anglian (130 × 106 m3) and EA Midlands (30 × 106 m3) regions.
    The total volumetric demand in 2010 (‘design dry year’) was estimated to be 200
    × 106 m3. Maincrop potatoes and vegetables have the highest irrigation demand,
    representing 56% and 23% of total theoretical water demand, respectively. Download

    irrigation benefit (£) and water productivity (£/m3) for England and Wales, by
    EA region. The financial benefit of irrigated production in 2010 was estimated
    to be £665 million. As shown in Fig. 3b, the highest benefits accrue in Anglian,
    Midlands and Southern EA regions, where high-value crops (soft fruit, potatoes
    and vegetables) are concentrated. Soft and orchard fruit has the highest average
    benefit per hectare (Table 3) with most production concentrated in EA Anglian
    and Southern regions. Maincrop potatoes are also an important irrigated crop in
    EA Anglian region, representing a significant proportion of total benefits in
    that area (close to 34%). Areas with lower irrigation benefits reflect areas where
    grassland and cereals dominate the land use mix. Based on the coefficients of
    variation (cv), it can be deduced that the spatial variability in irrigation benefits
    is very high for cereals and very low for maincrop potatoes and orchard and soft
    fruit (as these crops benefit from irrigation for quality assurance in almost
    all areas). Table 3. Irrigated area and estimated combined yield and quality benefits

    Orchard fruit 1,057 4.48 8,834 1,294.41 0.15 As discussed earlier, the total irrigation
    benefit is a combination of both yield and quality benefits which differ between
    individual crop types. Table 4 shows the relative contribution of each component
    to the total irrigation benefit for each crop. The irrigation benefits associated
    with quality assurance are higher than the yield benefits for soft fruit, maincrop
    and early potatoes. For example, more than 60% of the total benefit derived from
    irrigating vegetables in a dry year is derived from an improvement in quality.
    For other crops, such as grass, sugar beet and cereals, which have a much higher
    tolerance to drought and are not part of the fresh produce supply chain, most
    of the irrigation benefits are related to a yield increment with irrigation having
    a relatively low impact on quality. The proportion of irrigation benefits derived
    from quality improvements are also higher on low moisture retentive (AWC) soils
    (Table 2). Table 4. Estimated average contribution of yield and quality benefits

    3c shows the spatial distribution of benefits per unit of water applied (£/m3)
    or water productivity for the composition of land use in 2010. The most productive
    areas are mainly in the south-east and around the Bristol Channel (south and west)
    and in the midlands. The data for individual crop types shows soft fruit and early
    potatoes have the highest average water productivity (£52 and £1.94 per m3, respectively),
    with cereals (£0.08 per m3) and grass (£0.11 per m3) having the lowest values.
    Irrigation benefits tend to be highest for high-value (£/ha) crops, where irrigation
    can make most difference to yield and farm-gate price; and for crops that are
    associated with relatively high capital and labour production costs, helping to
    secure their viability. That is the case for strawberry production in the UK.
    The areas showing the highest water productivity (>£50 per m3) correspond to land
    where soft fruit is the only crop being irrigated. Expressing net benefits per
    unit of irrigation in this way, however, attributes all net benefits of crop production
    to the irrigation activity, rather than sharing it amongst the various components
    of investment, on the understanding that irrigation is an essential, non-substitutable
    component of production. These high returns to water are indicative of the essential
    nature of irrigation in England and Wales, where water adds most value in relatively
    intensive high-value, high-risk production systems. 3.3. Sensitivity analysis
    Sensitivity analysis can provide an insight into the impact that changes in agroclimate,
    crop price or irrigation costs can have on irrigation benefits. As mentioned,
    PSMD was used in this study as an agroclimate index. Fig. 4 shows the financial
    value of irrigated agriculture in England and Wales, for different agroclimate
    and crop price scenario. In a very dry year,4 with very high crop prices5 the
    total economic value of supplemental irrigation could reach almost £1130 million,
    assuming that crop irrigation needs are fully met. Cereals, grass and sugar beet
    are most sensitive (in terms of a percentage change in, albeit low, irrigation
    benefits) to a change in PSMD, with strawberries and early potatoes being least
    sensitive (Fig. 5). However, it should be highlighted that Fig. 5, Fig. 6 show
    the ‘relative’ changes, so for instance for cereals an increase of 148% in average
    benefit represents only £17/ha. Fig. 6 summarises the effects of changes in farm
    gate commodity prices on irrigation benefits. The analysis shows, for example,
    that if the price of cereals were to increase by 10% then the irrigation benefits
    would increase by nearly 40%. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Estimated

    If water resources become more scarce in future, then the water charges (£/m3)
    for agricultural abstraction are likely to increase, with the aim of reducing
    water use and improving irrigation efficiency. A change in water price will affect
    the benefits from supplemental irrigation and hence water productivity. Fig. 7
    shows the estimated change in water productivity (%) caused by a change in the
    cost of irrigation water for farmers in different regions. Changes in water costs
    have an important impact on water productivity, although they may not be significant
    depending on the crop mix. For example, a 50% increase in water costs would reduce
    water productivity (£/m3) by <2%. In those regions with a large proportion of
    high-value crops such as soft fruit and vegetables, the impact of an increase
    in water price will be lower, as our results demonstrate. Although current water
    charges represent a small percentage of the average total crop cost per hectare,
    if water prices were to increase, then the viability of irrigating some of the
    least-profitable crops (grass and cereals) would be further reduced. Download

    management This study represents the first international attempt to develop a
    national assessment of the financial benefits of supplemental irrigation for a
    defined dry year, compared to rainfed cropping, taking account of the spatial
    distribution of irrigated crops, and the factors that influence irrigation demand.
    For the eight crops examined, the highest irrigation benefit is for soft fruit
    (strawberries) and orchard fruit (dessert apples); and the lowest is for cereals
    due to the high differential in price between the crops, although differences
    across regions are also considerable. Our estimate of irrigation demand in EA
    Anglian Region is marginally higher (130 × 106 m3) compared to that (104 × 106
    m3) estimated by Knox et al. (2000). However, our results for the average benefit
    (£/ha) of irrigated maincrop potatoes are consistent with those reported by Morris
    et al. (2014). Since the work carried out by Morris et al., 1997, Knox et al.,
    2000, irrigated agriculture and demand for water has changed markedly (Weatherhead
    et al., 2015). This is partly due to the changes in cropped area and crop mix
    over the last decade together with changes in abstraction licensing and water
    allocation. Irrigation has become increasingly concentrated on fewer high-value
    crops; coupled with improvements in application technology scheduling and in-field
    management. The rising real cost of abstracted water and energy for pumping has
    also led to a reduction in irrigation on some crops where the benefits of irrigation
    were previously marginal, notably grass and sugar beet. At a national scale, Defra
    (2011) reported that the total irrigated area in England and Wales has decreased
    by 43.5% from 2001 to 2010, yet the benefit has increased In future it is likely
    that the frequency and severity of droughts in the UK will increase, potentially
    leading to an increase in crop water requirements. It is likely that irrigation
    will become more important but also more challenging, as there will be a greater
    probability of low water availability periods that will affect irrigators, since
    most agricultural production is concentrated in catchments that are already water
    stressed. Irrigated agriculture could lose its comparative advantage if constrained,
    unless the sector adapted to changing water availability. The economic rationale
    for irrigation is to secure water to add value, particularly through quality assurance,
    in areas that have comparative advantage for crop production. Many of these areas
    are in water deficit: thus there is an emerging ‘critical irrigation geography’
    with competing demands between water for irrigation and other uses. During drought
    conditions, irrigated agriculture is potentially exposed because of its greater
    dependency on water, with unintended outcomes and consequences. Irrigation may
    not help in severe drought conditions, unless drought responses for agriculture
    are explicitly ‘designed’ into farm irrigation plans and regional drought management
    strategies. According to the analyses presented here, the inability to irrigate
    in future dry years could lead to severe economic impacts for the farming community.
    Thus, to de-risk their businesses, a combination of irrigation with other drought
    management strategies will be essential. In recent decades farmers in the UK have
    invested in irrigation management to cope with a more uncertain water supplies,
    including for example, building on-farm water storage reservoirs, investing in
    more efficient technologies or creating water abstractor groups (Holman and Trawick,
    2011, NFU, 2015). In areas where increased irrigation from direct summer abstraction
    is not a viable option for coping with drought, other measures will need to be
    implemented, such as the selection of more drought-resistant varieties (Pidgeon
    et al., 2006) or changes in planting programmes to avoid late summer maturation
    (Wreford and Adger, 2010). These adaptation strategies would thus help reduce
    the potential losses in years when irrigation water was constrained. In England,
    irrigation constitutes only 4% of the total cropped area, yet it represents 20%
    of crop value (EA, 2008). In a dry year, the contribution of irrigated agriculture
    to the total crop value could be much higher. The benefits derived from irrigation
    vary spatially in England and Wales. Thus, the magnitude of drought impacts on
    these benefits will differ depending on which areas of the country are most affected.
    In a very dry year, as our sensitivity analysis suggests, some crops will be more
    affected (in terms of financial benefits) than others by an increase in aridity
    (PSMD). The results from this analysis could help guide water management decisions
    by regulatory authorities to minimize the overall economic impact of restrictions
    on water abstractions, changes in the abstraction licensing system and WFD implementation.
    This includes consideration of the economic impact on incomes, employment and
    livelihoods in the farm sector, the food and allied industries and other parts
    of the rural economy where irrigation is important. This wider perspective would
    also consider regional and national food supply and security issues placed under
    pressure during drought conditions, as well as the impacts of agricultural water
    abstraction on the environment. Apart from the potential impacts of abstraction
    restrictions on the financial benefits of irrigation highlighted in this paper,
    the water regulatory agency should also take into account the positive and negative
    externalities (i.e., more water for the environment vs. irrigated agriculture
    profitability, rural employment and food security), that imposing abstraction
    restrictions could have on the different water users and the environment. 4.2.
    Methodological limitations Finally, this work has some inherent limitations that
    should be recognised. The study by Morris et al. (1997) was applied to a specific
    area (Anglian region) where most irrigation is concentrated. Although some of
    the data used in this study have been updated, our analysis is informed by their
    results, which might cause errors in the estimation of the financial benefits
    of irrigation for other regions in England and Wales. Our assumption regarding
    the relationship between irrigation and crop quality could be improved by developing
    an irrigation- related quality indicator that could better explain variations
    in market price. The assumption of a linear relationship between irrigation depth
    and yield is considered the most feasible option to estimate irrigation benefits
    for most of the crops in this study, given the difficulty in calibrating biophysical
    crop models to simulate farm yields for all combinations of agroclimate, soils
    and crop type. However, it is also probably the greatest source of uncertainty
    given the assumption of linearity over the ‘relevant range’ of irrigation water
    use. Another potential source of error relates to the assumptions on irrigation
    cost. Although in England and Wales different irrigation systems and water sources
    (with different associated costs) exist, we assumed the costs associated with
    direct abstraction from a surface water (river, stream) and overhead application
    using a hose reel fitted with a gun (93% of the total irrigated area used hose
    reels in 2010 according to Defra (2011)). However, we recognise that other water
    sources are used, including groundwater and storage reservoirs which would change
    the structure of irrigation costs. Finally, we used ‘representative’ irrigated
    crops for some crop categories (i.e. carrots for vegetables, wheat for cereals,
    strawberries for soft fruit, apples for orchard fruit) which could introduce some
    uncertainty into our estimates. We also assumed that the counterfactual for irrigated
    crops would be the rainfed equivalent, which is reasonable as we are considering
    the costs of unexpected droughts or restrictions. However, the counterfactual
    in areas of highest irrigation needs is likely to be wheat or barley, rather than
    a rainfed equivalent of the irrigated crop. Finally, the financial assessment
    has not considered the economic impacts of crop switching due to, for example,
    changes in future land suitability and/or agroclimate conditions. Further primary
    data collection could help address the limitations outlined since most are related
    to constraints in farm level data availability. 5. Conclusions Drought episodes
    can severely impact on agricultural production in the UK, and are projected to
    become more frequent and extreme. This work presents a methodology to assess the
    geospatial financial benefits of supplemental irrigation in England and Wales.
    Despite the fact that many crops grown in the UK are rainfed, our analyses highlight
    the importance of supplemental irrigation to achieve yield and quality assurance
    to guarantee profitable crop production in dry years. In a future drier climate
    with greater aridity, irrigation would only become more crucial to buffer the
    impacts of the capricious nature of rainfall. Information arising from this work
    could support water resource planning and decision making to reduce the impacts
    of low flows on agriculture during drought periods. The procedure developed here
    could readily be applied to other crop types and/or mixes in other agroclimatic
    regions worldwide. Acknowledgements This research forms part of the Natural Environment

    c ) was measured over a clean-cultivated, mature navel orange orchard with microsprinkler
    irrigation located near Lindsay, California. Hourly mean latent heat flux density
    was determined as the residual of the energy balance equation with measured net
    radiation, soil heat flux density and sensible heat flux density estimated using
    the surface renewal method. The ET c was compared with ET o calculated using hourly
    weather data and the ASCE-EWRI Penman-Monteith equation. Following pruning and
    topping of the trees in the spring of 2001, the K co values slowly increased as
    the canopy developed in the following season. An average K co = 0.82 was observed.
    In the following year, the mean summertime value increased to about K co = 0.95
    , and in 2003 and 2004, the summertime value averaged near K co = 1.00 , which
    is somewhat higher than observed for drip irrigated trees in southwestern Arizona
    and considerably higher than reported in the widely used Food and Agricultural
    Organization of the United Nations publications that were based on infrequent
    surface irrigation. Introduction Need for Updates Crop coefficient ( K c = ET
    c ∕ ET ref ) factors are determined using the maximum (i.e., no stress) crop evapotranspiration
    ( ET c ) , which is assumed to be equal to the actual measured crop evapotranspiration
    ( ET a ) , and reference evapotranspiration ( ET ref ) , which is estimated from
    weather data and provides a measure of evaporative demand. It is assumed that,
    with similar crop, environmental and management factors, the product of derived
    K c values and ET ref , calculated from weather data, will give good estimates
    of ET c in future seasons. In general, this is true, but there clearly is a need
    to update and improve K c values for use in irrigation scheduling and water resource
    planning. For example, a wide range of crop coefficient ( K c ) values have been
    reported for mature citrus orchards (Doorenbos and Pruitt 1977; Hoffman et al.
    1980; Rogers et al. 1983; Castel et al. 1987; Allen et al. 1998). The K c variations
    can be attributed to several factors including differences in (1) variety and/or
    rootstock, (2) tree spacing, (3) canopy height, (4) ground cover, (5) tillage,
    (6) leaf area index (LAI), (7) method for estimating reference evapotranspiration,
    (8) microclimate, (9) irrigation method and frequency, and (10) method of measuring
    crop evapotranspiration ( ET c ) . Recently, the ASCE-EWRI (2005) provided a standardized
    method to estimate reference evapotranspiration ( ET ref ) using a modified Penman-Monteith
    equation and monthly, daily, and hourly climate or weather data. Equations were
    published for a short ( h = 0.12 m ) reference canopy using the symbol ET o and
    for a tall ( h = 0.50 m ) reference canopy using the symbol ET r . In this paper,
    the ET o reference was used for the discussion, and the crop coefficient values
    were given the symbol K co . However, the crop coefficients relative to ET r (i.e.,
    K cr values) were also provided. In the earlier literature, different equations
    were used for ET ref , so making comparisons with current K co calculations is
    somewhat difficult; however, an attempt was made to use ET ref methods that are
    comparable. To differentiate ET ref methods in this paper, the symbol K c was
    used for crop coefficients from earlier literature where ET ref was not calculated
    using the ASCE-EWRI (2005) Penman-Monteith (PM) method, and K co is used for crop
    coefficients developed with the PM method for short canopies. From the literature,
    it was assumed that ET ref ≈ ET o . Citrus K c values for mature orchards (Hoffman
    et al. 1980; Rogers et al. 1983; Castel et al. 1987) and the corresponding ET
    ref values are presented in Table 1. Estimated K c values from the Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations Paper 24 (FAO-24) (Doorenbos and Pruitt 1977),
    which have been widely used, are also presented as K cf values for the three experiments
    listed in Table 1. The K cf values under Castel et al. (1987) are the same as
    for the no-till citrus in FAO-24. Under Hoffman et al. (1980), the K cf values
    are the same as clean-cultivated K c values from FAO-24. Based on recommendations
    in FAO-24, the K cf values for no-till orchards from Rogers et al. (1983) were
    increased slightly over the FAO-24 values to account for the more humid Florida
    climate. Although not directly cited in FAO-24, the source for the citrus K c
    data was identified by Hoffman et al. (1980) as MacGillivray (1975). Table 1.

    determined from Table 25 in Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977). In Hoffman et al. (1980),
    the K cf values were estimated from the category “large mature trees providing
    70% tree ground cover and clean cultivated.” The K cf values for Rogers et al.
    (1983) and Castel et al. (1987) came from the category “large mature trees providing
    70% tree ground cover and no-tillage.” The K cf values are slightly for Rogers
    et al. (1983) because Florida has a more humid climate than Spain. The cited research
    was conducted in a range of climatic conditions from Florida, Valencia, Spain,
    and Arizona, and ET c was estimated using water balance calculations in all cases.
    In Florida and Spain, there was considerable rainfall, relatively low ET ref rates
    and nontilled orchards. In Florida, the orchards were irrigated with pop-up sprinklers
    and in Spain with border irrigation. In the southwestern Arizona desert, buried-drip-irrigated,
    clean-cultivated orchards were evaluated. The K c values in all three experiments
    were based on ET ref estimated from pan evaporation ( E p ) data using the conversion
    method presented in Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977). The measured K c values presented
    in Table 1 were quite different from those reported in FAO-24 and in FAO-56 (Allen
    et al. 1998), illustrating the need for more research on this topic. In both Florida
    and Spain, there was considerable rainfall. Irrigation was supplemental to rainfall
    in Florida, and it was applied during relatively dry periods from November through
    April. The rainfall was about 70 mm mon − 1 (November–December) and about 50 mm
    mon − 1 (February–April). In Spain, the trees were border irrigated about every
    15 days during the dry (summer) season. The Arizona orchard was irrigated several
    times per day with a high frequency, buried-drip irrigation system. The FAO-24
    K c values for no-till orchards were generally lower than measured values in Florida
    and were higher than measured K c values in Spain. It is believed that part of
    the difference is due to pruning and grower management in the two locations. In
    FAO-56, it was noted that K c values may require adjustment for tree size and
    coverage. While the percentage ground cover was similar, European orchards tend
    to have their lower branches pruned up higher than in California, where the branches
    grow to near the ground, so the leaf area index (LAI) is higher in the United
    States. Rogers et al. (1983) noted that the ground cover was relatively dormant
    in Florida during February through April, which might explain the lower K c values
    observed in those months (Table 1). However, the higher K c values during May
    through October also occurred during the period with the most rainfall. The K
    c values reported by Hoffman et al. (1980) tended to be higher than the FAO-24
    estimates. Hoffman et al. (1980) attributed the lower K c values reported in FAO-24
    to earlier research in Arizona and California (Erie et al. 1965; MacGillivray
    1975). Hoffman et al. (1980) felt that the K c values in the earlier research
    were low due to inadequate soil moisture sampling. In addition, the use of high-frequency
    drip irrigation rather than infrequent furrow irrigation, which was common prior
    to 1980, might have enhanced plant water status and led to larger, more vigorous
    plants. Recently, growers have increasingly changed from surface and drip irrigation
    to microsprinkler irrigation (Snyder et al. 1996a), and, to our knowledge, crop
    coefficients for microsprinkler irrigated orchards have not been reported. In
    California, only water balance measurements have been used to estimate ET c for
    determining K co values of citrus. In addition, the K c data presented in Doorenbos
    and Pruitt (1977), Rogers et al. (1983), Castel et al. (1987), and Hoffman et
    al. (1980) were not developed with the ASCE-EWRI (2005) equations, and this might
    also explain some of the variation in observed K c values. As a result, there
    is a need to develop K co values for microsprinkler irrigated citrus orchards
    using the standardized Penman-Monteith (PM) method. Measuring Evapotranspiration
    with Surface Renewal In earlier research (Erie et al. 1965; MacGillivray 1975;
    Hoffman et al. 1980; Rogers et al. 1983; Castel et al. 1987), crop evapotranspiration
    was measured using a water balance approach. However, it is also possible to measure
    ET c using an energy balance approach. There are several energy balance methods,
    but the surface renewal (SR) method was selected for these experiments because
    of its low cost and portability. In the SR method, sensible heat flux density
    ( H ) is estimated using high-frequency temperature data. In combination with
    net radiation ( R n ) and soil heat flux density ( G ) measurements, latent heat
    flux density is calculated as the residual of the energy balance equation (explained
    later). The SR method (Paw U and Brunet 1991) is based on the concept of coherent
    structures, which are characterized by air sweeps and ejections to and from the
    surface (Gao et al. 1989). When in or near the canopy, air parcels are heated
    or cooled as sensible heat exchanges with canopy elements. The rate of air temperature
    change over time is related to sensible heat flux density (Paw U et al. 1995).
    Under unstable conditions, cool air sweeps into a canopy from above and the air
    parcels are gradually heated by the canopy elements. Hence, temperature traces
    initially drop sharply with time and are then followed by a slow rise as the air
    is heated. Then, the warmed air is ejected from the canopy, and it is again replaced
    by a sweep of colder air from above. Under stable atmospheric conditions, the
    pattern is reversed with a sharp temperature increase followed by slow cooling.
    The air temperature falls slowly as heat is transferred from the air to cooler
    plant elements. When plotted, temperature traces show ramplike characteristics,
    and the mean amplitude ( a ) and duration of ramp event ( d + s ) , where d is
    the duration of the ramp period and s is the duration of the quiescent period
    between ramps, can be quantified using structure function analysis (van Atta 1977).
    Based on many studies, the SR method seems to work well as long as the length
    of the mean ramp period is greater than five times the time lag used in the structure
    function analysis. Thus, for windy conditions or for measurements close to the
    soil (i.e., with a small volume of air), a higher sampling frequency might be
    required to meet the time lag versus frequency requirement. However, the citrus
    orchard had a large air volume under the temperature sensors, and there were mostly
    calm wind conditions during the experiments, so wind effects on the surface renewal
    measurements are unlikely. Using conservation of energy, Paw U et al. (1995) showed
    that an expression for H can be derived from the conservation of energy H = α
    H ′ = α ( ρ C p a d + s h ) (1) where h =measurement height (m); ρ =air density
    ( kg m − 3 ) ; and C p =specific heat of the air ( J kg − 1 K − 1 ) . The factor
    H ′ =SR sensible heat flux density assuming uniform heating from the ground up
    to the measurement height ( h ) , and α accounts for unequal heating of the air
    volume under the temperature sensor (Paw U et al. 1995). The α factor is determined
    by calculating the slope of the linear regression (through the origin) of H from
    an accurate independent method such as eddy covariance using a sonic anemometer
    versus H ′ (Snyder et al. 1996b; Spano et al. 1997, 2000). Note that Eq. (1) is
    a conservation of energy equation relating the change in temperature with time
    a ∕ ( d + s ) to the volume of air under the sensor, which is represented by the
    height h over a unit surface area. The α factor adjusts for the fact that the
    parcel of air entering or leaving the canopy is not uniformly heated or cooled
    by the canopy elements as it resides under the temperature sensor. Unequal heating
    or cooling mainly results from air penetration into the canopy and differences
    in foliage temperature with height rather than on the air temperature gradient
    in or above the canopy. Consequently, α depends more on canopy characteristics
    than on air temperature gradients. Thus, wind has little direct effect on the
    α value. In these experiments, α was determined by calibrating against a CA27,
    one-dimensional (1D) sonic anemometer (Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, Utah).
    Before using the sonic anemometer, it was calibrated against two other 1D sonic
    anemometers and the root mean square error between the three sensors was about
    30 W m − 2 . When calibrating the SR method, the sonic anemometer was mounted
    about 0.5 m above the canopy top. The sonic anemometer data were collected at
    5 Hz with a Campbell Scientific, Inc. 21X data logger. As recommended by Campbell
    Scientific, Inc., the mean of the cross products of perturbations of air temperature
    and vertical wind speed were computed every 10 min , and the results were averaged
    and archived at the end of each half hour. Mean sensible heat flux density was
    computed as the product of the air density, specific heat of air at constant pressure,
    and the mean of the cross products. For a more detailed explanation of eddy covariance,
    see Shaw and Snyder (2003). After calculating H ′ , the sensible heat flux density
    α H ′ was computed using Eq. (1) and the α factor calibrated for that vegetation
    or crop type. For practical purposes, α changes little with stability, wind speed,
    or other weather factors. L E was determined using measured or estimated R n and
    G and α H ′ in the energy balance equation L E = R n − G − α H ′ (2) The L E calculations
    were done on a half-hourly basis, and the daily energy fluxes due to R n , G ,
    and L E were computed. Then the mean ET c for an hour expressed in J m − 2 s −
    1 was divided by the latent heat of vaporization ( L = 2.45 J g − 1 ) and multiplied
    by 3.6 to obtain the depth of water vaporized (mm). Methods and Materials Experimental
    Site The experimental site was an 8 ha ( 20 acre ) navel orange orchard in the
    Lindsay area of Tulare County in California on a Hanford sandy loam soil. The
    trials were conducted from 2001–2004 on 33–37 year old Frost Nucellar navel oranges
    with Troyer Citrange rootstock. The trees were planted at a distance of 5.8 m
    in the row and 6.1 m between rows for a total of 282.6 trees per hectare. The
    trees were vigorous and, even with pruning, grew from 4.0 m tall after topping
    in the winter of 2001 to 4.5 m tall in the late fall of 2004. The canopies mostly
    filled in between trees within rows (i.e., like a hedge row) with the foliage
    row width increasing from about 4.0 to 4.3 m giving approximately 66 to 70% ground
    shading. The tree rows were planted in an east–west orientation. The orchard floor
    was maintained vegetation-free using pre- and post-emergence herbicides. A low
    volume microsprinkler irrigation system was used. The irrigation lateral was positioned
    on the south side of each tree row about 0.5 m north of the edge of the tree row
    foliage with the emitter half way between two trees. A microsprinkler had a 360
    ° pattern and delivered 46 L h − 1 at an operating pressure of 172 kPa ( 15 psi
    ) . The irrigation system was operated on an alternate row basis, with every second
    row receiving a 24 or 48 h irrigation during an irrigation event. Therefore, only
    half of the orchard was irrigated at each event. The wetted area extended from
    the edge of the foliage on the north side of the tree row with the lateral to
    the edge of the foliage on the north side of the tree row immediately to the south.
    The throw radius was about 2.4 m (i.e., a surface area of about 18.1 m 2 ). Since
    the area per tree was about 35.38 m 2 and irrigations were applied to every second
    row, the wetted surface area for each irrigation event was approximately 26% of
    the orchard surface area. Decisions on irrigation timing and duration were made
    by the ranch management. Irrigation dates and amounts are indicated in Figs. 1–4.
    The irrigation frequency was about 4–6 days during summer, and it increased to
    about every eight days in October. There was no irrigation during the low ET,
    rainy season from November through mid-March. The orchard canopy was large, and,
    during an irrigation event, there was only a slight increase in L E and a related
    decrease in H . There was no observable direct effect of irrigation on either
    R n or G . Fig. 1. Daily plots of (a) reference and crop evapotranspiration; (b)

    amounts during 2004. The irrigation depths correspond to the volume of water supplied
    to the entire orchard area, but the actual application was double the depth to
    half of the orchard. At 46 L h − 1 , 24 and 48 h sets applied 1,104 and 2,208
    L , respectively, per 18.1 square meters of wetted area for each irrigated tree
    occupying 35.38 m 2 of surface area. This gave mean depths of 31.2 and 62.4 mm
    per tree surface area. Thus, typical summertime 48 h sets supplied sufficient
    water for slightly more than 10 days of ET c , assuming ET c ≈ 6 mm d − 1 . Weather
    Data for Crop Evapotranspiration Calculation Weather data used to calculate ET
    o using the Penman-Monteith equation (ASCE-EWRI 2005) came from the California
    Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) station (Snyder and Pruitt 1992)
    at the University of California Lindcove Field Station located 19 km from the
    study site. Rainfall data were collected by the grower, using his own rain gauge,
    about 2 km from the orchard. Although a standard rain gauge was not used, the
    rainfall data were highly correlated with a standard gauge located in the City
    of Lindsay, which is about 5 km distance from the orchard. The grower also supplied
    the irrigation dates and runtimes. The irrigation system was evaluated to determine
    the mean application rate, which was used with the runtime to determine water
    applications. The precipitation and irrigation applications are shown in Figs.
    1–4. Hourly ET o values were summed over 24-h periods to obtain daily ET o data.
    Surface Renewal Station A surface renewal station was set up inside the orchard
    with more than 100 m of fetch in all directions and several kilometers of similar
    orchards surrounding the orchard. Fine-wire ( μ 76.2 μ m diameter) thermocouples
    (FW3, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, Utah) were used with a data logger (CR10,
    Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, Utah) to measure high frequency temperature.
    In addition, net radiometers (model Q7.2, REBS, Inc., Seattle, Wash.) and soil
    heat flux plates (model HT3, REBS, Inc., Seattle, Wash.) were used to measure
    energy balance components. Soil heat storage above the heat flux plates was measured
    with soil averaging thermocouple sensors (model TCAV, Campbell Scientific, Inc.,
    Logan, Utah). The TCAV soil temperature sensor consisted of four thermocouple
    probes that were wired in parallel, so the recorded temperature was the mean of
    four probe readings. Each of the four thermocouple probes was imbedded inside
    of a high-heat-conducting metallic cylinder having 1 mm diameter and 75 mm in
    length. Each thermocouple probe provided an integrated measure of the soil temperature
    in contact with the 75 mm metal cylinder. During the first two years, four pairs
    of probes were inserted horizontally in the soil at four transect locations at
    0.01 and 0.03 m depth. During the last two years, individual probes were inserted
    in an angle from 0.04 to 0.01 m depth in transect between tree rows. A 1D sonic
    anemometer (model CA-27, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, Utah) and a data logger
    (model 21X, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, Utah) were used to calibrate the
    surface renewal estimates of H . During 2003 and 2004, a second net radiometer
    (model NR Lite, Kipp and Zonen, AM Delft, The Netherlands) was added to confirm
    the accuracy of the Q7.2 net radiometer. The observed linear regression of the
    (REBS) Q7 R n versus the (NR) Lite R n was Y = 0.95 X ( R 2 = 0.99 ; n = 1,471
    ) and Y = 0.94 X ( R 2 = 1.00 ; n = 2,641 ) in 2003 and 2004, respectively. The
    plotted points fell nearly on the 1:1 line up to about 500 W m − 2 , and the Q7
    values tailed off to about 50 W m − 2 lower than the NR Lite at 800 W m − 2 .
    Since the crop coefficients were already higher than any recorded, and use of
    the NR Lite data would have further increased the K c factors, the Q7 data were
    used for all energy balance calculations. The net radiometers were installed at
    5 m above the ground (about 0.5 m above the maximum height of the canopy top).
    Horizontally, the net radiometer was located midway between two trees within the
    measurement row, and it was oriented to the south with the bulb located midway
    between the tree trunk line and the south edge of the row tree foliage. The upper
    sensor dome was fully exposed to sunlight at all times. It is unlikely that the
    sensor placement height had an effect on R n readings because, although some of
    the soil was within the sensor view, there was no observable influence of irrigation
    (i.e., wetting the soil under the sensor) on R n observations. The net radiation
    data were collected every 60 s , and means were computed and converted to W m
    − 2 each half hour. During 2001 and 2002, two TCAV temperature sensors, with eight
    probes, were used, and pairs of the thermocouple probes were inserted horizontally
    at 0.01 and 0.03 m depth to measure soil temperature at four locations. Two probes
    were placed 1, 2, 3, and 4 m north of the tree trunk line of the tree row where
    the SR tower was located. The probe transect was perpendicular to the tree rows
    (i.e., south to north direction), and it was located about 1 m north of the tree
    trunk west of the transect line. Heat flux plates were placed at 0.04 m depth
    at 1.5 and 3.5 m north of the tree trunk line. Therefore, one of the heat flux
    plates was under the tree skirts, and the other was in the middle between rows.
    Data were collected every 60 s , and means of the heat flux plate readings were
    computed and converted to W m − 2 each half hour. The mean soil temperatures were
    also recorded every 60 s , but only temperature at the end points of each half
    hour were used to calculate the change in stored soil heat in the upper soil layer
    during the half hour period [see Eq. (3)]. Although the soil heat flux calculations
    were reasonable in 2001 and 2002, some spikes in the data were observed when sunflecks
    caused sharp temperature increases in the near-surface soil layer. As a result,
    the distribution of soil heat flux plates and soil temperature sensors was changed
    at the beginning of the 2003 season to obtain a better weighted mean value for
    soil heat flux density. A third heat flux plate was added to the measurements,
    and the three heat flux plates were inserted at 0.05 m depth. The heat flux plates
    and TCAV temperature sensors were again placed in transect between two rows. The
    transect row was perpendicular to the tree row containing the surface renewal
    tower. The first heat flux plate was located about 1 m east of the tree trunk
    immediately west of the surface renewal tower. A second plate was placed about
    2 m directly to the north of the first plate, and a third plate was placed at
    about 4 m directly north of the first plate. The soil temperature probes were
    relocated with one probe in line with the tree trunk row, and single probes were
    placed at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5 m spacing to the north of the tree trunk
    row. The temperature probes were placed at an angle coming up from about 0.04
    to 0.01 m depth to obtain an integrated temperature in the soil layer above the
    plates. This method of placement increased the number of placement locations and
    provided a more uniform measure of the change in heat storage of the upper soil
    layer. The new placement of the soil sensors gave a more uniform estimate of soil
    heat flux density than in the first two years by eliminating fluctuations in soil
    temperature as the surface above the sensors passed from shade to sun and visa
    versa. The soil heat flux data were collected every 60 s , and means of the heat
    flux plate readings were calculated and converted to W m − 2 each half hour. Mean
    soil temperatures were also recorded every 60 s , but only the temperatures at
    the end points of each half hour were used to calculate the change in stored soil
    heat in the upper soil layer during the half hour period [see Eq. (3)]. The net
    radiometer, soil heat flux plates, and soil temperature data were measured every
    minute, and data were averaged over half hour periods. The average millivolt reading
    from the net radiometer and heat flux plates were computed, and the mean values
    were stored at the end of each half hour. Changes in soil heat storage ( Δ S )
    above the heat flux plates were computed using Δ S = C V ( T f − T i 1,800 ) z
    (3) where C V =apparent volumetric heat capacity of the soil; T f and T i =final
    and initial temperatures for a half-hour period; and z = 0.04 m or z = 0.05 m
    (in 2003–2004)=depth of the heat flux plate. The value 1,800 =number of seconds
    per half hour period. The C V is calculated as the product of the apparent soil
    density and the specific heat. The surface layer soil water content was measured
    through several irrigation cycles during 2003, and the water content varied between
    about 19% after irrigation to about 13% prior to irrigation with a weighted mean
    near 18%. The effect of varying the C V with water content on calculated G was
    minimal, so a fixed C V = 2.0 × 10 6 J m − 3 K − 1 , which corresponds to 18%
    moisture content, was used for determining the change in heat storage of the soil
    layer above the heat flux plates during the entire experiment. The soil heat flux
    density ( G o ) was calculated as the mean of the two heat flux plate measurements.
    Δ S was calculated using T f and T i from the averaging soil temperature probe
    and Eq. (3). Then, the soil heat flux density at the surface ( G ) was calculated
    following de Vries (1963) as G = Δ S + G o (4) The calculated surface G values
    were slightly less than 10% of R n on most clear sky days. In all years, the surface
    renewal temperature data were collected with two μ 76.2 μ m thermocouples mounted
    on a tower at 4.5 m above the ground. The sensors were on the ends of metal arms
    (about 0.3 m length) that were oriented to the west of the tower. There was approximately
    0.05 m distance between the two thermocouple junctions, so they were measuring
    the same air parcels. The wind speed is typically less than 2 m s − 1 and the
    direction is almost always from the north or south. With this orientation, it
    is unlikely that the tower had any effect on the temperature measurements. The
    peak canopy height increased from about 4 m in April 2001 to about 4.5 m in the
    spring of 2003. Because the thermocouples were mounted within a row between two
    trees, the canopy top dipped down somewhat below the thermocouples, and they were
    not within 1.5 to 2.0 m of any foliage. High frequency temperature data were collected
    at a frequency of f = 4 Hz , and the time lags of r = 0.5 and r = 1.0 s were used
    in a structure function (van Atta 1977) to determine the temperature ramp characteristics
    as described in Snyder et al. (1996b). The uncalibrated sensible heat flux density
    was calculated as H ′ = ρ C p ( a d + s ) z (5) In SR analysis, calibration (
    α ) factors are needed to account for uneven heating of the air below the temperature
    measurement height. Uncalibrated H ′ was converted to the actual sensible heat
    flux density ( H ) using the equation H = α H ′ (6) The α values depend on the
    thermocouple size, sampling frequency, height above the ground, and the underlying
    vegetation. In this research, calibration factors were determined as the slope
    of the linear regression of H , measured with a Campbell Scientific, Inc. (Logan,
    Utah) Model CA27, one-dimensional sonic anemometer, versus the uncalibrated H
    ′ from surface renewal measurements. Data were collected each half hour for 24
    h per day during May 6–13, 2001 and during July 27–30, 2001. The slope of the
    regression of H versus H ′ for May 6–13 was b = 0.227 with R 2 = 0.996 ( n = 328
    ) . The slope for July 27–30 was b = 0.226 with R 2 = 0.851 ( n = 154 ) . The
    calibration factor α = 0.227 was used for both 2001 and 2002 data. During 2003,
    the thermocouples were wired in parallel to a differential channel of the data
    logger, which changed the calibration factor from separately measured thermocouples.
    The height and orientation of the sensors were the same as in 2001 and 2002. Calibration
    data were collected each half hour for 24 h per day during the sampling periods,
    and regressions of H versus H ′ were computed. Data collected during the period
    June 9 through June 24 gave a regression slope b = 0.467 with R 2 = 0.855 ( n
    = 727 ) . Measurements during the period August 13–20, 2003 gave a slope of 0.461
    with R 2 = 0.767 ( n = 359 ) over a similar range of H . The calibration factor
    α = 0.467 was used during 2003 and 2004. The thermocouple wiring was changed in
    2003 to allow more channels for measuring soil temperature and heat flux to improve
    the soil heat flux estimates. Differences in the R 2 values between calibration
    periods were mainly due to differences in the range of sensible heat flux density
    during the measurement period. Data sets with larger range of sensible heat flux
    had larger R 2 values. Results and Discussion Fig. 1(a) shows the ET o and ET
    c data for 2001. Crop coefficients for the same experiment are plotted with the
    irrigation and rainfall data in Fig. 1(b). The corresponding plots are provided
    for 2002 (Fig. 2), 2003 (Fig. 3), and 2004 (Fig. 4). In all years, the energy
    balance calculations were similar. On a daily basis, the soil heat flux density
    was close to zero. During summer, the daily mean sensible heat flux density tended
    to be upwelling at around H = 5 MJ m − 2 d − 1 , the latent heat flux density
    was about L E = 15 MJ m − 2 d − 1 , and the net radiation was typically about
    20 MJ m − 2 d − 1 . In general, the ET o was between 6 and 7 mm d − 1 during midsummer
    in each year (Figs. 1–4). The ET c was somewhat lower than normal during April
    and May of 2003 when there was an atypical cool-rainy period. Crop coefficient
    ( K co ) values were higher (Figs. 1–4) than previously reported for clean-cultivated
    citrus orchards (Doorenbos and Pruitt 1977; Hoffman et al. 1980; Allen et al.
    1998). In 2001, the K co values increased from about 0.70 to 0.85 during the summer.
    It is believed that the increase was due to canopy growth following topping and
    pruning prior to the 2001 experiment. During the summer of 2002, the K co values
    increased above 0.95. The K co factors were close to 1.00 during the summer of
    2003 and 2004. The ET o was slightly lower in 2003, and the orchard received more
    irrigation water during that year. In 2004, the ET o rate was higher in the spring,
    and the irrigation might have been slightly insufficient and possibly resulted
    in some water stress, with ET a < ET c during midsummer. The grower noted that
    the orchard appeared more stressed than usual during the 2004 season. The experimental
    orchard was vigorous with above average production and densely canopied trees
    (high-yielding grove with a dense canopy). The row orientation was east–west rather
    than north–south, because the orientation improves cold air drainage during frost
    conditions. Although row orientation was not reported in the other literature,
    this might partially explain the higher K co values observed in these experiments.
    Another possible reason for the higher summer K co values observed in this experiment
    is the use of microsprinkler irrigation rather than surface irrigation and higher
    application frequency in this orchard. The drip irrigated orchard in the Arizona
    experiments (Hoffman et al. 1980) had K c values near 0.85 during the summer,
    so the higher K c values for the microsprinkler irrigated orchard seems reasonable.
    In the California experiments, the orchard had 70% ground cover (i.e., 70% of
    the ground was shaded by tree foliage) and, during the summer, it was irrigated
    by the microsprinkler approximately every 5–6 days. Irrigation was applied to
    every second row (half of the orchard) at each application. In the widely used
    papers by Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977) and Allen et al. (1998), the crop coefficient
    for clean-cultivated, mature with greater than 70% ground cover citrus is given
    as K c = 0.65 for June through August. However, it is likely that the values came
    from research on flood or furrow irrigated citrus orchards prior to 1977. Hoffman
    et al. (1980) noted that there was inadequate sampling of soil water content changes
    in earlier research. Therefore, the FAO numbers may be too low for dense canopy,
    vigorous, sprinkler-irrigated orchards in the arid western United States. From
    October through April, many of the K co values were unrealistically high and variable
    (Figs. 1–4). For example, extremely high values of K co were observed prior to
    May 2003 (Fig. 3) because of the late spring rain during that year. The high and
    variable K co values were attributed to a combination of factors related to the
    rainy-foggy conditions that are typical of the region during late fall, winter,
    and spring: 1. There was a greater chance of ET c measurement error(s) due to
    wet sensors. In surface renewal, like all aerodynamic methods, energy balance
    calculations are more questionable when the sensors are wet. There was no way
    to know if the thermocouples were wet or not in the research reported here, so
    there was no attempt to filter out those data. Wet net radiation sensors were
    most likely the reason for the unrealistically high K c values observed during
    low- ET o , rainy months, so those data were filtered out of the analysis presented
    in Figs. 1–4; 2. Canopy resistance near zero was expected for the wet crop, whereas
    the canopy resistance used for calculating ET o was fixed at 50 s m − 2 when R
    n > 0 (ASCE-EWRI (1998)). This factor and the higher net radiation over the orchard
    partly explain why the K c values were higher for the citrus orchard; 3. The K
    co for wet soil in the rainy season is higher than for drier soil during high
    ET o conditions in summer; 4. Weather conditions are more spatially variable during
    the cool-rainy season, so differences in weather between the Lindcove CIMIS station
    site and the orchard were more likely; and 5. The fraction of canopy light interception
    was greater in the fall, winter, and spring than in the summer when sunlight can
    penetrate to the bare ground between rows. The late-fall, winter, and early-spring
    K co values were clearly too high because of the aforementioned factors. In fact,
    it is unlikely that the K co values for citrus orchards would be higher than the
    ratio of ET r ∕ ET o , where ET r is the reference evapotranspiration for tall
    canopies (ASCE-EWRI 2005). Using weather data from the nearby Lindcove CIMIS station,
    the ratio ET r ∕ ET o ≈ 1.15 was observed. Since there were also unrealistically
    low K co values during the low- ET o , rainy-foggy season, but the extremely high
    K co values were more common, a fixed value of K co = 1.15 is recommended during
    the low- ET o , rainy-foggy season. Because the canopy was growing and K co values
    were increasing during the 2001 and 2002 seasons, the orchard was not fully intercepting
    light, and the K co values increased during the summer (Table 2). Note that ET
    r rates and K cr factors are provided in Table 3. There was no evident increase
    in K co during the 2003 and 2004 seasons. Therefore, the mean monthly K co values
    for the 2003 and 2004 seasons were computed to represent a mature orchard (Table
    4). Presenting K co values to the nearest 0.01 implies too much accuracy, and
    the unrealistically high K co factors during the low- ET o , rainy-foggy period
    are misleading, so the K co values were rounded to the nearest 0.05 with an upper
    limit of 1.15 to provide recommended crop coefficient factors ( K co ′ ) for ET
    o (Table 4). Then ET c was calculated using the mean daily ET o rates by month
    from 2003 and 2004 and the observed ( K co ) and recommended ( K co ′ ) values.
    The difference in ET c rates ( Δ D ) and monthly totals ( Δ M ) calculated from
    observed and recommended K co values were compared (Table 4). Except for the low
    ET o , rainy-foggy period, the error from using the recommended K co values was
    less than one day per month of ET c . The recommended K co values can therefore
    be used for estimating the ET c of clean-cultivated, microsprinkler irrigated,
    mature orchards in the San Joaquin Valley of California or in regions with similar
    climatic conditions. In areas with a different climatic pattern of rain and fog,
    the coefficients may need adjustment. During the drier, high ET o summer, the
    value K co = 1.00 should provide good estimates of ET c for similar orchards and
    climates. Table 2. Reference Evapotranspiration for Short Canopies ( ET o ) and

    18 1.00 Annual             − 10   a These recommendations are only for microsprinkler
    irrigated citrus grown in a similar climate as the San Joaquin Valley of California,
    which is characterized by warm, arid summers and cool, foggy-rainy winters. The
    results of these experiments depend on accuracy of the SR method, which in turn
    depends on accuracy of the sonic anemometer used to calibrate the SR estimates
    of H . There has been some concern expressed about the lack of closure in eddy
    covariance measurements. In particular, Twine et al. (2000) noted that there are
    three possible methods to estimate L E from (EC) measurements. The direct L E
    measurement from the EC system can be used, or L E can be calculated as the residual
    of the energy balance equation as was done in this experiment. Another possibility
    is to calculate the Bowen ratio and increase the values of H and L E until closure
    is attained while maintaining the measured Bowen ratio. In fact, none of these
    methods has been proven to be superior to the others. If it is assumed that the
    Bowen ratio with 80% closure is correct and one increases the values for H and
    L E , while maintaining the Bowen ratio, until the closure reaches 100% for a
    clear-sky R n − G = 700 W m − 2 , the increase in H value is about 15 W m − 2
    . For periods with smaller R n − G , the increase in H would be less. A multiplication
    factor that increased peak midday H values 15 W m − 2 was determined and applied
    to increase all of the H data by that factor. Then, using the higher H values,
    a new α factor for surface renewal H was computed and applied to the 2004 data.
    The new K c values were between 0.01 and 0.02 lower than the results presented
    in this paper. Some concern has been expressed about using the surface renewal
    method during foggy-rainy periods because of the observed high K c values. No
    aerodynamic method will provide accurate ET results, when the sensors are wet,
    so surface renewal is no different than any other method. In the case of California,
    the wet period is mainly during the winter months when ET o rates are low, so
    estimating the ET c as slightly higher than ET o (i.e., as ET r ) is a reasonable
    method to estimate ET c . In locations with rainy summers, using aerodynamic methods
    is more problematic. To ensure K c accuracy, data from aerodynamic methods in
    rainy summer climates should probably be filtered to use only days when the sensors
    are dry. An additional problem arises under foggy-rainy conditions, because the
    ET o equation uses fixed values for canopy resistance, whereas a citrus orchard
    canopy resistance can change dramatically depending on whether the trees are wet
    or not. The canopy resistance approaches zero when wet, so the K c values will
    increase when the canopy is wet. Conclusions For healthy, microsprinkler irrigated,
    mature (about 70% ground cover) navel orange orchards with rows oriented in an
    east–west direction, a crop coefficient K co = 1.00 , with lower values in years
    following extensive pruning and topping, can be used during summer in an arid
    climate. Most likely, the difference in K co following pruning was due to reduced
    light interception by the orchard canopy. The observed summer K co values were
    considerably higher than reported for orchards with a crop cover in Spain that
    were infrequently irrigated using surface irrigation. Generally, the observed
    K co values during June through September were not as high as for orchards with
    a cover crop in Florida (Table 1). However, because the orchards in Florida had
    cover crops and they were frequently wetted by rainfall, this was not unexpected.
    The observed K co factors were higher than K co values observed for buried-drip-irrigated
    orchards in the southern Arizona desert. Since there was more wetted soil surface
    and a lower ET o rate observed in these experiments, the results seem realistic.

    \ interactions in the Republic River basin (RRB)\nin the midwestern United States,\
    \ where agriculture heavily\ndepends on irrigation. The decreasing ﬂow trend recorded\
    \ at\nthe RRB gauging station since the 1950s reﬂects the syn-\nthetical effect\
    \ of dynamic interactions between surface wa-\nter and groundwater systems, which\
    \ has been enhanced by\ngroundwater pumping and irrigation return ﬂow. This study\n\
    uses a systematic modeling approach to analyze the conjunc-\ntive effects of pumping\
    \ and return ﬂow on streamﬂow. A wa-\ntershed management model, the Soil and Water\
    \ Assessment\nTool (SWAT), is modiﬁed and established for the French-\nman Creek\
    \ basin (FCB), a subbasin of RRB, to examine the\ncauses of streamﬂow changes.\
    \ The baseﬂow component in\nSWAT is linked to aquifer storage so that the model\
    \ can sim-\nulate the combined effects of groundwater pumping and ir-\nrigation\
    \ return ﬂow on natural streamﬂow. Results show that\nirrigation has not only\
    \ depleted streamﬂow but also changed\nthe ﬂow pattern and seasonal variability.\
    \ The changes can be\ndecomposed into decrease in the slow component (baseﬂow)\n\
    and increase in the fast components (surface and subsurface\nﬂow). Since the fast\
    \ components are subject to higher vari-\nability than the slow component, the\
    \ annual streamﬂow vari-\nability is ampliﬁed. Agricultural water use in this\
    \ region also\nhas changed the groundwater storage seasonal regime from\nthe pattern\
    \ of “summer recharge and winter discharge” in the\npast to “summer discharge\
    \ and winter recharge” at present.\nThis challenges the existing groundwater modeling,\
    \ which\nusually assumes ﬁxed recharge pattern and rates.\n1\nIntroduction\nIrrigation\
    \ has contributed to the agricultural production in-\ncrease during the past decades,\
    \ becoming the largest wa-\nter consumption sector throughout the world, accounting\
    \ for\nabout 70 % of the global freshwater withdrawals and 90 % of\nconsumptive\
    \ water uses (Siebert et al., 2010). In the United\nStates, irrigation is located\
    \ in the states where average an-\nnual precipitation is typically less than 20\
    \ inches and thereby\nis insufﬁcient for crop consumption. As the surface water\n\
    resources is prone to be affected by climate variability and\npollution, and needs\
    \ infrastructure investment for storage\n(i.e., reservoir) and delivery (i.e.,\
    \ channels), groundwater has\nreplaced surface water as the major water source\
    \ in many\nplaces. In 2005, 13 western states consumed nearly 90 % of\nthe groundwater\
    \ used for irrigation, among which ground-\nwater was the primary source for irrigation\
    \ in Nebraska,\nArkansas, Texas, Kansas, Mississippi, and Missouri (Kenny\net\
    \ al., 2009).\nGroundwater-fed irrigation alters hydrological processes\nacross\
    \ a range of scales. The estimated global groundwater\ndepletion since the year\
    \ of 1900 is equivalent to a 12.6 mm\nrise in sea level, which accounts for more\
    \ than 6 % of to-\ntal sea-level rise (Konikow, 2011). Nonrenewable groundwa-\n\
    ter abstraction contributes approximately 20 % to the global\ngross irrigation\
    \ water demand in the year of 2000 (Wada et\nal., 2012). At the regional scale,\
    \ the rapid development of\ngroundwater pumping after the 1950s has changed the\
    \ in-\nteractions of surface water and groundwater and caused wa-\nter right conﬂicts\
    \ between surface water users and ground-\nwater users in the western states of\
    \ the US (Sophocleous,\n2010; Gleeson et al., 2012). At a local scale, the changes\n\

    \ ﬂux affect the terrestrial envi-\nronment and ﬂuvial biota (Alley et al., 2002).\
    \ The interac-\ntions between groundwater and lakes, wetlands, estuaries,\nand\
    \ oceans play an important role for the distribution of biota\nand biogeochemical\
    \ processes, such as ﬁsh spawning areas\n(Malcolm et al., 2008).\nMoreover, the\
    \ aggregation of the disruption of the local\nhydrological cycle by intensive\
    \ irrigation has been found to\naffect the regional climate, which would further\
    \ affect the\nirrigation requirement, leading to a feedback loop. Irrigation\n\
    impacts land surface processes by altering the partition of en-\nergy and water\
    \ through the interactions between soil proﬁle,\nland surface ﬂux and groundwater\
    \ depth. Studies have shown\nthat irrigation increases surface latent heat ﬂux\
    \ and dew point\ntemperature, while decreases sensible heat ﬂux and near-\nground\
    \ temperature (Adegoke et al., 2003; Tang et al., 2007).\nDeAngelis et al. (2010)\
    \ found the intensive groundwater\npumping for agricultural use over the Great\
    \ Plains leads\nto increased vapor, which aggregates to enhance downwind\nprecipitation.\
    \ According to Ferguson and Maxwell (2012),\nthe effect of water management (e.g.,\
    \ pumping and irriga-\ntion) on terrestrial water and energy budgets is even com-\n\
    parable in magnitude to the impact of climate change (e.g.,\nchanges in temperature\
    \ and precipitation). Thus, understand-\ning the details of how irrigation affects\
    \ hydrological pro-\ncesses will help in understanding hydrological alterations\n\
    over watershed scales, as well as providing support for con-\njunctive management\
    \ of surface water and groundwater re-\nsources in terms of satisfying both human\
    \ and environmental\nwater needs.\nWhile the complex feedbacks between irrigation\
    \ and land\nsurface processes have been less studied because of difﬁcul-\nties\
    \ in observation data, the impact of large-scale pumping\non aquifer storage and\
    \ streamﬂow is more likely to be ob-\nserved (McGuire, 2009) and hence has been\
    \ studied inten-\nsively since Theis (1940). Jenkins (1968) analyzed the stream\n\
    depletion volume and residual timing of pumping by intro-\nducing the SDF (stream\
    \ depletion factor), which measures\nhow fast groundwater withdrawal transfers\
    \ from aquifer stor-\nage to stream depletion, to account for the transient effect\n\
    of pumping. Kendy and Bredehoeft (2006) assessed the re-\nsponse of streamﬂow\
    \ to pumping wells with different dis-\ntances to the river. They found that stream\
    \ depletion caused\nby near-stream pumping wells quickly reaches equilibrium\n\
    and responses temporally in phase with pumping; however,\nfar-away wells cause\
    \ smaller stream depletion and seasonal\nﬂuctuation, and a greater portion of\
    \ the depletion occurs dur-\ning post-irrigation season. They also examined the\
    \ impact of\nirrigation efﬁciency on the streamﬂow seasonality and found\nthat\
    \ when the irrigation system delivers water inefﬁciently,\nirrigation return ﬂow\
    \ recharges the aquifer during irrigation\nseason and discharges to stream during\
    \ post-irrigation sea-\nson, boosting fall and winter low ﬂows. The return ﬂow\
    \ to\nstream is a loss of irrigation water but a gain of streamﬂow in\nmany cases.\
    \ For example, Gosain et al. (2005) studied return\nﬂow from irrigation introduced\
    \ by canal in the Palleru River\nbasin. They found that return ﬂow accounts for\
    \ over 50 %\nof irrigation application, much higher than the usual rule-of-\n\
    thumb value of 10–20 %. However, in many studies, return\nﬂow is simply accounted\
    \ as a ﬁxed portion of irrigation wa-\nter application and is added back to streamﬂow.\
    \ This will\nprobably ignore the actual quantity and temporal variation of\nthe\
    \ return ﬂow contribution to streamﬂow, which might be\ninﬂuential during growing\
    \ seasons.\nThe combined effects of the two processes, pumping and\nreturn ﬂow,\
    \ on streamﬂow have not been well represented\nby the models used for the analysis.\
    \ Few current groundwa-\nter models explicitly simulate the impact of irrigation\
    \ return\nﬂow on aquifer–stream interaction; while surface hydrologi-\ncal models\
    \ usually do not simulate the impact of groundwater\npumping on baseﬂow appropriately.\
    \ Both modeling groups\ncapture one aspect of the picture, but not the whole.\
    \ For ex-\nample, the aquifer recharge, evapotranspiration and channel\nloss in\
    \ groundwater models are usually decided through cal-\nibration and treated as\
    \ ﬁxed values during the simulation pe-\nriod. Attempts to simulate crop processes,\
    \ such as with the\nFarm Process package of MODFLOW, improve the estimate\nof\
    \ crop water requirement (Schmid et al., 2006). However,\nthose models usually\
    \ do not simulate the soil proﬁle, which\nplays an important role in determining\
    \ crop growth, recharge\nand evapotranspiration (Rodriguez-Iturbe et al., 1999).\
    \ Some\nsurface hydrological models have detailed representations\nof crop irrigation\
    \ requirement and soil moisture, but usu-\nally assume that groundwater-fed irrigation\
    \ has no impact on\nthe source (i.e., aquifer storage) (Sophocleous and Perkins,\n\
    2000). It is important to note irrigation affects spatially dis-\ntributed hydrological\
    \ processes and land-energy ﬂuxes de-\npending on the location of irrigated crops\
    \ (Ferguson and\nMaxwell, 2011). The streamﬂow recorded at gauging stations\n\
    is the result of dynamic interactions between surface water\nand groundwater systems\
    \ over different temporal and spa-\ntial scales, where return ﬂow plays a critical\
    \ role in partially\ncompensating the stream depletion caused by groundwater\n\
    pumping and changing the process of streamﬂow response to\nclimatic variability\
    \ through the conjunctive management of\nsurface water and groundwater systems.\n\
    Although hydrological research communities agree that\nsurface water and groundwater\
    \ systems compose a holistic\nentity that requires an integrated modeling approach,\
    \ models\nfor the integrated systems are currently not well developed\n(Sophocleous\
    \ and Perkins, 2000; Sophocleous, 2010). In this\nstudy, the Soil and Water Assessment\
    \ Tool (SWAT) (Arnold\net al., 1998), a widely used watershed management model\
    \ is\nmodiﬁed by linking the baseﬂow component to aquifer stor-\nage in order\
    \ to simulate the complex effect of groundwater\npumping and irrigation return\
    \ ﬂow on streamﬂow, and to un-\nderstand the impact of irrigated agricultural\
    \ development on\nstreamﬂow change. The model is applied to the Frenchman\nCreek\
    \ basin (FCB), a subbasin of the Republican River basin\n(RRB), where groundwater-fed\
    \ irrigation has been developed\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 18, 493–502, 2014\n\

    \ de-\npletion has been reported (Burt et al., 2002). This case study\nwill then\

    \ under the effects of pumping and\nreturn ﬂow.\n2\nStudy area and model description\n\
    2.1\nFrenchman Creek basin\nThe RRB, lying above the northern Ogallala Aquifer,\
    \ is\nshared by Colorado, Nebraska, and Kansas. The FCB, a sub-\nbasin of RRB,\
    \ lays above the Ogallala Formation, which is\ncomposed mainly of silt, sand,\
    \ gravel, and clay-rock debris\nthat have been washed off the face of the Rocky\
    \ Mountains\nand other more local sources over the past several million\nyears\
    \ (Gutentag, 1984). Recharge to the High Plains aquifer\nis primarily fed by precipitation\
    \ through inﬁltration. Natu-\nral discharge from the High Plains aquifer goes\
    \ to springs,\nseeps, and streams, as well as by evapotranspiration ﬂux.\nHowever,\
    \ the pumping for irrigated crops now becomes a sig-\nniﬁcant discharge from the\
    \ aquifer. The Ogallala Formation\nhas the greatest saturated thickness, and the\
    \ portion in FCB\nranges from 200 to 300 ft. above the Permian bedrock (Miller\n\
    et al., 1997). The aquifer underlying the FCB is conceptu-\nalized as a one-layer\
    \ unconﬁned aquifer above a non-leaky\nbedrock in the groundwater model established\
    \ by the Repub-\nlican River Compact Administration (RRCA). Groundwater-\nfed\
    \ irrigation since the 1950s (shown in Fig. 1 as the pump-\ning well numbers)\
    \ in this region has reduced aquifer storage\nand caused stream depletion problems\
    \ in the RRB as shown\nin Fig. 2. Groundwater storage in the High Plains aquifer\n\
    in 2009 was about 2.9 billion acre-ft., showing a decline of\nabout 274 million\
    \ acre-ft. (or about 9 %) from predevelop-\nment storage (McGuire, 2011). Szilagyi\
    \ (2001) found the\nFig. 2. Monthly ﬂow regime (monthly average ﬂow by each decade)\n\
    at RRB outlet (source: USGS Station 06853500).\nRepublican River annual streamﬂow\
    \ has declined by 61 %\nwithout a signiﬁcant change in climate. Disputes about\
    \ sur-\nface water and groundwater rights lead to a legal issue among\nthe states\
    \ sharing the aquifer.\nThe Frenchman Creek, about 166 mi. long, ﬂows from\nColorado\
    \ to Nebraska. The average annual precipitation in\nthis region from 1941 to 1994\
    \ was about 443 mm according\nto the Automated Weather Data Network with the High\
    \ Plain\nRegional Climate Center (HPRCC, 2010), which increases\nfrom east to\
    \ west as the effect of elevation gradient; annual\npotential evapotranspiration\
    \ in this region is about 1100 mm.\nThe crop in the basin is heavily dependent\
    \ on central pivot ir-\nrigation from pumping wells. Although lacking of well\
    \ doc-\numented groundwater consumptive use data, studies have\nshown a strong\
    \ statistical relationship between the number of\npumping wells and stream depletion\
    \ in this watershed (Burt\net al., 2002). In this study, the pumping is estimated\
    \ from\nannual irrigated crop acreage from the National Agricultural\nStatistics\
    \ Service (USDA, 1999). The FCB has experienced\nstream depletion over the past\
    \ decades. The majority of the\nﬂow in the watershed was sustained by the Ogallala\

    \ decreases from 18.07 to 17.92 ◦C. Standard devia-\ntion of the both remain unchanged\
    \ at around 0.7 ◦C. More-\nover, the seasonality of climatic variables was examined\
    \ by\naveraging the monthly data for each decade; it is found that\nthe pattern\
    \ remains unchanged, i.e., the rainfall season is still\nin phase with the warm\
    \ season. Actually, a slight decrease is\nfound in the diurnal temperature range\
    \ (difference between\ndaily maximum and minimum temperature), which can be\n\
    the result of irrigation. Irrigation leads to increased evapo-\ntranspiration\
    \ and humidity above farmland, converting more\nradiative energy into latent heat,\
    \ which results in redistribu-\ntion of surface energy between latent heat, sensible\
    \ heat and\nground heat ﬂux. Adegoke et al. (2003) compared the surface\nenergy\
    \ budget between irrigated and non-irrigated farmland\nin Nebraska. They found\
    \ that due to the “cooling effect”, ir-\nrigation contributes to a 15 % decrease\
    \ in sensible heat and\n1.2 ◦C decrease in near-ground temperature. Thus, based\
    \ on\nthe observed data and some relevant analyses, changes in\nclimate forcing\
    \ cannot explain the signiﬁcant decrease in\nstreamﬂow, which is then mostly likely\
    \ due to other factors\nsuch as land use and water use in the region.\n2.2\nWatershed\
    \ management model\nSWAT, a semi-distributed, physically based watershed\nmodel,\
    \ includes components such as weather, hydrology,\nsediment transport, crop growth,\
    \ water quality, and agricul-\ntural management, and has been widely applied to\
    \ assessing\nwater quantity and quality, land use and climate change im-\npacts,\
    \ and agriculture management in heterogeneous water-\nsheds (Gassman et al., 2007).\
    \ Irrigation is simulated by an\nauto-irrigation subroutine, i.e., irrigation\
    \ is applied when the\nsoil moisture of a crop ﬁeld is below the prescribed irrigation\n\
    triggering threshold during the crop growing season.\nFig. 4. Annual precipitation\
    \ (left) and maximum/mininimum tem-\nperature (right) in FCB. The climate exhibits\
    \ no signiﬁcant change\nduring the last several decades. The slight decrease in\
    \ diurnal tem-\nperature range implies the impact of irrigation on land surface\
    \ en-\nergy redistribution.\nIn watersheds with intensive irrigation, irrigation\
    \ return\nﬂow is an important human-induced hydrologic process, but\nit is usually\
    \ ignored or oversimpliﬁed in some existing agri-\ncultural watershed models.\
    \ Irrigation return ﬂow includes\nboth a vertical and a horizontal component.\
    \ The vertical\ncomponent inﬁltrates through the soil proﬁle and recharge\naquifer,\
    \ which will then affect aquifer storage and further\nbaseﬂow. The horizontal\
    \ component moves in the soil pro-\nﬁle and contributes to rivers as subsurface\
    \ ﬂow. The differ-\nent return ﬂow paths result in different processes and travel\n\
    times. Moreover, irrigation changes soil moisture, and in turn\nthe soil moisture\
    \ dynamics affects the timing and quantity\nof irrigation return ﬂow. SWAT simulates\
    \ runoff from sur-\nface ﬂow, subsurface ﬂow and baseﬂow, separately. Thus the\n\
    SWAT model is chosen to simulate the effect of irrigation re-\nturn ﬂow on all\
    \ components of runoff, i.e., the baseﬂow and\nthe fast ﬂow components.\nHydrol.\

    R. Zeng and X. Cai: Analyzing streamﬂow changes\n497\nIn the SWAT model the baseﬂow\
    \ is calculated by the fol-\nlowing equation:\nQgw,i = Qgw,i−1Exp(−α1t) + Wrchrg,i[1\
    \ − Exp(−α1t)], (1)\nwhere i is the simulation day, 1t is the time step (i.e.,\
    \ one\nday), Qgw,i is the baseﬂow, Wrchrg is the shallow aquifer\nrecharge from\
    \ soil proﬁle, and α is the baseﬂow recession\ncoefﬁcient. In Eq. (1), baseﬂow\
    \ depends on the baseﬂow\nfrom the previous day (representing recession process)\
    \ and\nrecharge (representing the effect of rain-induced recharge\non baseﬂow).\
    \ However, the process reﬂecting the impact of\ngroundwater pumping on streamﬂow\
    \ is missing in Eq. (1).\nGroundwater pumping ﬁrst captures aquifer storage, if\
    \ the\nstorage is not fully recovered, then the induced water table\ngradient\
    \ would change the discharge (i.e., baseﬂow), causing\nstream depletion. To represent\
    \ this process, alternatively, the\nbaseﬂow component in SWAT has been modiﬁed\
    \ based on\nthe shallow (unconﬁned) aquifer water storage (Ssh):\nQgw,i = α Ssh,i,\n\
    (2)\nand storage is updated through shallow aquifer water bal-\nance:\nSsh,i =\
    \ Ssh,i−1 + Wrchrg,i − Qgw,i − Wrevap,i − Wpump,i,\n(3)\nwhere Wrevap is the water\
    \ evapotranspirated from the shallow\naquifer by deep root vegetation; Wpump is\
    \ the water pumped\nfrom aquifer for irrigation use, which is based on the soil\n\
    moisture content. Note that Eq. (2) represents a linear stor-\nage model (Chow\
    \ et al., 1988). If there is no recharge, i.e.,\nevapotranspiration and pumping,\
    \ baseﬂow is an ordinary dif-\nferential equation and Eq. (1), originally used\
    \ in SWAT, can\nbe derived from Eqs. (2) and (3). Thus the baseﬂow recession\n\
    parameter is consistently used in the original and modiﬁed\nmodel. However, the\
    \ modiﬁed equation requires one more\nparameter, the initial storage, which needs\
    \ to be calibrated\nfrom model outputs. Note that Eq. (3) assumes groundwater\n\
    lateral ﬂux is negligible in the water balance equation. This\nassumption is validated\
    \ by checking the water table contour\nin the study area. The water table contour\
    \ in 1979 and 1995\nare obtained from the Conservation and Survey Division\nin\
    \ the University of Nebraska (Swinehart and Richmond,\n1994). Those contours show\
    \ that the groundwater in FCB\nﬂows from west to east following the topographic\
    \ gradient.\nSince the water table contour is generally perpendicular to\nthe\
    \ boundary of the FCB within Nebraska, the groundwater\nlateral ﬂow exchange with\
    \ the adjacent aquifer is negligible.\nThe irrigated cropland acreage over years\
    \ is an important\nmodel input, which determines the timing and location of\n\
    groundwater pumping for irrigation. Since irrigation is the\nmajor water use in\
    \ this watershed, the spatial and temporal\nexpansion of irrigated crop water\
    \ use affects the spatial het-\nerogeneity and temporal variability of groundwater\
    \ storage\nchange through pumping, which further affects the interac-\ntion between\
    \ surface and ground water, especially the con-\ntribution of baseﬂow to river\
    \ streams. Running the SWAT\nmodel over years will capture the temporal variability\
    \ of\ngroundwater storage and then streamﬂow; the spatial vari-\nability of groundwater\
    \ storage, baseﬂow and the total stream-\nﬂow is related to the spatial distribution\
    \ of irrigation pumping\nover the spatial units of the SWAT model (i.e., hydrologic\
    \ re-\nsponse units represented by watersheds of a certain stream\norder).\nTo\
    \ calibrate the model for the FCB, the outlet of the water-\nshed is chosen at\
    \ the upstream of Enders Reservoir (USGS\nsiteID 06831500) to exclude the impacts\
    \ of surface water\nregulation on streamﬂow. The model is calibrated and val-\n\
    idated for the periods 1981–1985 and 1986–1990, respec-\ntively, with a multiple-objective\
    \ genetic algorithm. The root-\nmean-square error (RMSE) and logarithm of the\
    \ RMSE of\nstreamﬂow are chosen as calibration criteria to consider both\nhigh\
    \ ﬂow and low ﬂow. The SWAT model is calibrated by the\ntotal streamﬂow (i.e.,\
    \ including both baseﬂow from aquifer\ndischarge and surface runoff). The RMSE\
    \ of crop yield is\nalso set as criteria, mainly to calibrate the auto-irrigation\n\
    trigger parameter, thus the water management activity (i.e.,\npumping amount and\
    \ timing) is retrieved through ﬂow and\ncrop data. It is worth noting that the\
    \ best calibration result of\nthe original SWAT model does not even capture the\
    \ stream\ndecline trend. For details on model data, parameters, and cal-\nibration\
    \ procedures, the reader is referred to Zeng (2012).\n3\nResults\n3.1\nStreamﬂow\
    \ change due to land use and pumping\nThe SWAT model is applied to three land\
    \ use and water\nmanagement scenarios, all under historical climate forcing\n\
    data: (1) no agricultural development in this region; (2) land\nuse change is\
    \ represented by historical crop area but no ir-\nrigation (i.e., rain-fed crop);\
    \ (3) historical crop area with\ngroundwater pumping simulated by auto-irrigation\
    \ in SWAT.\nThe auto-irrigation module of SWAT calibrated to the case\nstudy watershed\
    \ is used to determine the irrigation schedul-\ning, including the water application\
    \ timing and amount. By\ncomparing the results from these scenarios, the impacts\
    \ of\nland use and groundwater irrigation can be identiﬁed.\nIn the “no agricultural\
    \ development” scenario, the land use\nis ﬁxed as the level in the 1940s, when\
    \ most of the land\ncover in the region was either grassland or ranch land and\n\
    only a small fraction of the land was used for irrigated agri-\nculture, which\
    \ is negligible compared to the large irrigation\nwater consumption after quick\
    \ development in the 1960s and\n1970s. Under this “natural” scenario, the mean\
    \ streamﬂow is\n3.24 and 3.08 m3 s−1 during pre-1970s and post-1970s peri-\nods,\
    \ respectively, showing a very small change. This small\ndecline may also be caused\
    \ by agricultural activity because\nsome parts of the basin were used for crop\
    \ production before\nthe 1940s.\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/18/493/2014/\n\

    ﬂow (GW) for the non-irrigation (left) and irrigation (right) cases.\nGroundwater-fed\
    \ irrigation decreases the slow ﬂow component\n(GW) and increases fast ﬂow components\
    \ (SUR and SUB), leading\nto a streamﬂow more subjected to climate variability.\
    \ The conver-\nsion from natural grassland to irrigated cropland leads to a decrease\n\
    of slow components, due to depletion of aquifer discharge by pump-\ning. The increased\
    \ soil moisture during growing season increases\nsubsurface lateral ﬂow and surface\
    \ runoff during storm events.\nThe streamﬂow under agricultural development is\
    \ shown\nin Fig. 5 with only land use change (non-irrigation sce-\nnario) and\
    \ with both land use change and irrigation (irri-\ngation scenario). For the non-irrigation\
    \ scenario, the mean\nstreamﬂow is 3.22 and 2.77 m3 s−1 during pre-1970s and\n\
    post-1970s periods, respectively. For the irrigation scenario,\nFig. 6. Baseﬂow\
    \ index for non-irrigation and irrigation cases.\nthe mean streamﬂow is 3.05 and\
    \ 1.93 m3 s−1 during pre-\n1970s and post-1970s periods, respectively. Note that\
    \ the\nstreamﬂow from the pre-1970s periods is not signiﬁcantly\ndifferent among\
    \ these scenarios, since large-scale agricul-\ntural development and groundwater\
    \ pumping had just started\nat that time. Comparing the ﬂow pre-1970s under the\
    \ three\nscenarios shows that groundwater pumping amounts to a\n0.84 m3 s−1 decrease\
    \ in streamﬂow, more than twice as that\ncaused by land use at 0.31 m3 s−1.\n\
    3.2\nFlow component change\nThe SWAT model simulates three ﬂow components (i.e.,\n\
    baseﬂow, subsurface ﬂow and overland runoff), which en-\nable us to decompose\
    \ the effect of groundwater-fed irriga-\ntion on streamﬂow. In Fig. 5, the surface\
    \ ﬂow, subsurface\nﬂow from the soil proﬁle, and baseﬂow from the aquifer dis-\n\
    charge are denoted as SUR, SUB and GW, respectively. As\nmentioned earlier, streamﬂow\
    \ is decomposed to a slow com-\nponent (corresponding to a sustained baseﬂow from\
    \ aquifer)\nand a fast ﬂow component (corresponding to runoff from\nsurface and\
    \ unsaturated zone), which has a shorter travel\ntime and is more prone to climate\
    \ variability. Although the\nstreamﬂow decreases under both scenarios (land use\
    \ only,\nland use and irrigation), the changes on the different ﬂow\ncomponents\
    \ are signiﬁcantly different. In the non-irrigation\nscenario, all ﬂow components\
    \ decrease, especially for the\nsubsurface ﬂow, which is nearly zero after the\
    \ 1970s. For the\ngroundwater-fed irrigation scenario, the decrease is mainly\n\
    from aquifer discharge (i.e., from 2.56 to 1.41 m3 s−1), while\nsurface ﬂow decreases\
    \ slightly from 0.177 to 0.154 m3 s−1\nand subsurface ﬂow increases from 0.311\
    \ to 0.362 m3 s−1.\nAs a result, return ﬂow from irrigation partially compensates\n\
    the stream depletion by groundwater pumping. This also im-\nplies that ignoring\
    \ irrigation return ﬂow would overestimate\nstream depletion by aquifer pumping.\n\

    \ for non-irrigation and irrigation\ncases.\nAquifer discharge provides streams\
    \ with a stable ﬂow (i.e.,\nslow ﬂow component) and is relatively insensitive\
    \ to cli-\nmate variation; while surface and subsurface ﬂow is prone\nto climate\
    \ variability (i.e., temperature, and vapor pressure)\nthrough soil moisture dynamics,\
    \ vegetation water use or hu-\nman water management (Harman et al., 2011). Thus,\
    \ sur-\nface and subsurface ﬂow convert the climatic variability into\nstreamﬂow\
    \ variability and exhibit as fast ﬂow components.\nThe baseﬂow index (BFI, ratio\
    \ of baseﬂow in total stream-\nﬂow) is shown in Fig. 6 for irrigation and non-irrigation\
    \ sce-\nnarios. The BFI decreases from 95 to 75 % due to groundwa-\nter pumping\
    \ and irrigation return ﬂow. As shown in Fig. 6,\nthe baseﬂow accounts for 70–80\
    \ % of the total ﬂow. The\nbaseﬂow indices calculated from a recursive digital\
    \ ﬁlter\n(Santhi et al., 2008) and the US Geological Survey 1 km\nbaseﬂow index\
    \ data set (Wolock, 2003) show similar values\nto our results (i.e., between 69\
    \ and 76 %).\nThe effects of stream depletion and irrigation return ﬂow\nchange\
    \ the ratio of the fast and slow ﬂow components in\nstream, leading to changes\
    \ in streamﬂow variability. The co-\nefﬁcient of variation (CoV) of streamﬂow\
    \ under the irriga-\ntion case is 0.077 and 0.151 for pre- and post-1970s periods,\n\
    respectively. In watersheds with intensive agricultural activ-\nities streamﬂow\
    \ components are affected by crop water con-\nsumption and water management. Thus\
    \ besides climatic vari-\nability, human interference (irrigation, return ﬂow)\
    \ is also an\nimportant factor to affect the stream variability by changing\n\
    the dynamics of surface water and groundwater interaction.\n3.3\nAquifer recharge–discharge\
    \ pattern change\nAssociated with the streamﬂow changes, the pumping for ir-\n\
    rigation and return ﬂow also change the temporal pattern of\naquifer storage.\

    \ ﬂow. Meanwhile the increased\nsoil moisture also helps recharge the aquifer\

    \ which\nis considerably higher under the irrigation scenario than the\nnon-irrigation\
    \ one. Especially after 1973, the soil proﬁle per-\ncolation is nearly zero in\
    \ the non-irrigation case, since soil\nmoisture in a large portion of the watershed\
    \ is lost to the at-\nmosphere through crop evapotranspiration. While for the\
    \ ir-\nrigated case, irrigation maintains soil moisture and then soil\nproﬁle\
    \ percolation over the years.\nAquifer storage change results from the combined\
    \ effect\nof aquifer recharge, pumping, aquifer discharge to river and\nother\
    \ ﬂuxes (i.e., deep root vegetation evapotranspiration).\nThe monthly aquifer\
    \ storage change regime is averaged by\ndecades, as shown in Fig. 8. During periods\
    \ when irriga-\ntion intensity is low, the aquifer is recharged during sum-\n\
    mer from May to July due to precipitation-dominant recharge\nand discharged in\
    \ winter to sustain the baseﬂow in streams\nsince the precipitation is relatively\
    \ low in winter. Recharge\nto the aquifer in summer from 1920 to 1950 is also\
    \ shown\nby the RRCA groundwater model. With agricultural devel-\nopment, aquifer\
    \ storage experiences signiﬁcant decreases in\nthe crop growth season (June–September,\
    \ which covers the\nwhole summer in the region) due to pumping and high evapo-\n\
    transpiration. However, aquifer storage recovers during win-\nter and spring by\
    \ the return ﬂow, which is delayed from irri-\ngation application in summer. The\
    \ maximum monthly stor-\nage decline occurs in August, when pumping is most in-\n\
    tensive. Figure 9 shows the declining trend of aquifer stor-\nage during the period\
    \ of 1951–1994. Since the SWAT model\ndoes not simulate the water table, the aquifer\
    \ storage is ex-\npressed in equivalent water depth (i.e., millimeter) by averag-\n\
    ing the groundwater storage of all subbasins annually. Since\nlate 1960s, the\
    \ accumulative groundwater storage has de-\nclined about 5500 mm in equivalent\

    \ in the area is 0.175 (the value used in the RRCA\nmodel). Thus the average water\
    \ table decrease in the FCB is\nabout 31.5 m, which is validated by the area-weighted\
    \ aver-\nage from observation wells (McGuire, 2009). Aquifer stor-\nage depletion\
    \ started in the 1960s, reached the maximum\nduring the 1970s, and remained stable\
    \ since then. During\nthe 1980s, the aquifer storage depletion recovers slightly,\n\
    which corresponds to the irrigation regulation within the re-\ngion started in\
    \ the late 1980s. According to the records of the\nUS Geological Survey (USGS),\
    \ the water table in the aquifer\nremains in a declining trend but at a slower\
    \ rate in recent\nyears (McGuire, 2012). The decline of the aquifer storage\n\
    during the period 2009–2011 is estimated as 2.8 million acre-\nft., equivalent\
    \ to 0.1 ft. decline in the water table. Thus, the\nintensive pumping reverses\
    \ the natural seasonal groundwa-\nter recharge pattern, from “summer recharge\
    \ and winter dis-\ncharge” under natural conditions to “summer discharge and\n\
    winter recharge” under the human interferences.\n4\nConclusions\nStreamﬂow change\
    \ is a result of climate forcings, catch-\nment properties and human activities\
    \ in watersheds around\nthe world. At the study site discussed in this paper,\
    \ stream-\nﬂow records at the gauging stations reﬂect the synthetical\neffect\
    \ of dynamic interactions between surface water and\ngroundwater systems, which\
    \ are enhanced by groundwater\npumping and return ﬂow with heavy groundwater-fed\
    \ irri-\ngation. In this study, a modeling analysis based on a mod-\niﬁed SWAT\
    \ model is applied to analyze the conjunctive ef-\nfects of pumping and irrigation\
    \ return ﬂow on streamﬂow. By\nrelating baseﬂow to shallow aquifer storage through\
    \ a lin-\near reservoir model, the streamﬂow response to groundwa-\nter pumping\
    \ is explicitly simulated, and the synthetic effects\nof two types of human interferences\
    \ (i.e., pumping and re-\nturn ﬂow) are assessed. While irrigation return ﬂow\
    \ partially\ncompensates the decrease in streamﬂow, the stream deple-\ntion trend\
    \ due to groundwater pumping has been revealed by\nthe model as comparable to\
    \ the observed. However, the fast\nﬂow component (surface and subsurface ﬂow)\
    \ increases due\nto return ﬂow and the slow ﬂow component (baseﬂow) de-\ncreases\
    \ due to groundwater pumping. As a result, the stream-\nﬂow is altered from a\
    \ baseﬂow dominant regime to one that is\nmore inﬂuenced by surface and subsurface\
    \ ﬂow. The change\namong baseﬂow, subsurface and surface ﬂow components\ndue to\
    \ human interferences is modeled for the ﬁrst time, ac-\ncording to our knowledge,\
    \ which allows a close examination\nof the streamﬂow variability, rooted with\
    \ climatic variability\nbut aggravated by human interferences (groundwater pump-\n\
    ing and return ﬂow). Agricultural water use in this region has\nshifted the groundwater\
    \ seasonal regime from the pattern of\n“summer recharge and winter discharge”\
    \ in the past to “sum-\nmer discharge and winter recharge” at present. This could\n\
    affect the ecosystems that depend on the streamﬂow regime.\nMoreover the shift\
    \ challenges existing groundwater model-\ning, which usually assumes ﬁxed recharge\
    \ patterns and rates.\nAlthough the modiﬁed model can simulate streamﬂow re-\n\
    sponse to groundwater pumping, it only represents one way\nof the stream–aquifer\
    \ interaction, that is, ﬂow from aquifer to\nstream. This limits the model to\
    \ simulate the situation where\ngroundwater pumping inverses stream–aquifer interaction.\n\
    This model is valid in a headwater zone such as FCB, where\nbaseﬂow is sustained\
    \ by the aquifer, but may not be appli-\ncable to areas where streamﬂow recharges\
    \ the aquifer. Also,\nthe SWAT model is semi-distributed, that is, each hydrolog-\n\
    ical representative unit is only connected with each other by\nriver network and\
    \ no interaction exists due to the water table\ngradient. Thus, the assessment\
    \ of aquifer storage is averaged\nfrom all subbasins. Improvement of the subbasin\
    \ aquifer stor-\nage connection would provide the spatial impact of ground-\n\
    water movement. If spatial information (e.g., impact of the\nlocation of pumping\
    \ wells relative to streams, the location of\ndrawdown cones, etc.) is included,\
    \ the groundwater move-\nment under human interferences can be better understood.\n\
    We admit that the model presented (even with our modiﬁ-\ncation) is not ideal\
    \ for simulating the sophisticated relation-\nship between irrigation pumping\
    \ and streamﬂow, which in-\nvolves the dynamic interactions of surface water and\
    \ ground-\nwater. As discussed in the introduction, both surface hy-\ndrology\
    \ and groundwater communities assess the stream–\naquifer interaction from different\
    \ aspects. Simulation mod-\nels from both communities have a different focus with\
    \ re-\nspect to their interests. However, surface water and ground-\nwater are\
    \ a holistic entity that requires an integrated mod-\neling approach, which is\
    \ currently not well developed. We\nbelieve the modiﬁcation of a widely used watershed\
    \ manage-\nment model (SWAT) can serve the purpose of analysis, espe-\ncially\
    \ for the understanding of agricultural development and\nstreamﬂow change. Our\
    \ study presents an effort to improve\nthe watershed model to better assess basin-wide\
    \ surface wa-\nter and groundwater interaction with intensive agricultural\nHydrol.\

    \ and yield responses of cabbage to deficit irrigation. Hort. Sci. \n(Prague),\
    \ 41: 138–146.\nField experiments were conducted in two seasons to investigate\
    \ growth, physiology and yield responses of cabbage (Bras-\nsica oleracea L. cvs\
    \ Pennant and Rio Grande) to deficit irrigation. In 2012 season, 50% of crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETc) \nirrigation temporarily decreased plant size, reduced leaf area, fresh\
    \ weight, relative water content, specific leaf area and \ngas exchange during\
    \ late development, and decreased head fresh weight, size, marketable and total\
    \ yield. Deficit irrigation \nat 75% ETc had little influence on plant growth\
    \ and physiology, but it still reduced both marketable and total yield. In \n\
    2013 season, 75% ETc irrigation had little influence on plant growth, leaf characteristics,\
    \ photosynthetic rate, head fresh \nweight and size, but it temporarily increased\
    \ chlorophyll and carotenoid content, and decreased stomata conductance, \ntranspiration,\
    \ and marketable yield. Pennant, the green-head cultivar, had higher photosynthetic\
    \ rate, head fresh weight, \nmarketable and total yield than the red-head cultivar\
    \ Rio Grande. In both seasons, deficit irrigations did not influence \ncabbage\
    \ head dry weight, indicating that most yield reduction under deficit irrigations\
    \ is related to water content. \nKeywords: pigment; photosynthesis; relative water\
    \ content; specific leaf area\nThe Winter Garden region of south Texas is a \n\
    semiarid agricultural region with limited water \nresources. Cabbage is one of\
    \ the most important \ncole crops in this region, but it was also classified \n\
    as intermediately susceptible to water stress (Janes \n1950; Singh, Alderfer 1966;\
    \ Nortje, Henrico \n1988). Cabbage production during fall and winter \nmainly\
    \ depends on supplemental irrigation. There-\nfore, development of efficient and\
    \ economically vi-\nable irrigation management for effective use of lim-\nited\
    \ water resources is needed. \nCompared with furrow and basin irrigation, drip\
    \ \nirrigation is the most effective method to irrigate \nvegetable crops due\
    \ to water savings and yield \nincreases (Tiwari et al. 1998a,b; Xie et al. 1999;\
    \ \nTiwari et al. 2003). In addition, deficit irrigation \nstrategy, a practice\
    \ that deliberately allows crops to \nsustain some degree of water deficit with\
    \ marginal \nyield loss, has the potential to increase water use \nefficiency\
    \ and save water (Costa et al. 2007). It is \nexpected that deficit irrigation\
    \ would be adopted \nfor a wide variety of crops and in more regions, es-\npecially\
    \ in arid and semiarid climates of the world. \nHowever, leafy vegetables appear\
    \ less adapted to \ndeficit irrigation than fruit tree crops (Jones 2004; \nCosta\
    \ et al. 2007). A previous study indicated \nSupported by the National Institute\
    \ of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture under Agreement  \n\
    No. 2010-34461-20677. \nVol. 41, 2014, No. 3: 138–146 \nHort. Sci. (Prague)\n\
    \ \n139\nthat yield of cabbage was similar when irrigated at \n80 kPa and 160\
    \ kPa soil water tension, but reduced \nat 360 kPa (Thomas et al. 1970). Smittle\
    \ et al. \n(1994) found that cabbage yield was highest when \nirrigation was applied\
    \ at 25 kPa soil water tension, \nas compared to 50 or 75 kPa. Drew (1966) report-\n\
    ed higher cabbage yield with irrigation at 12.5% \nthan at 25, 50, or 75% available\
    \ soil moisture con-\ntent. Using sprinkler irrigation system, Sanchez et \nal.\
    \ (1994) found that cabbage production was op-\ntimized when crops were irrigated\
    \ for evapotran-\nspiration (ET) replacement while both deficit and \nexcess irrigation\
    \ reduced yield. However, Sammis \nand Wu (1989) reported that cabbage marketable\
    \ \nyield increased linearly with increased water appli-\ncation up to 49.3 t/ha.\
    \ Tiwari et al. (2003) found \nno significant yield difference in cabbage irrigated\
    \ \nat 100, 80 and 60% of crop ET (ETc) during three \nyears. Imtiyaz et al. (2000)\
    \ examined the effect \nof irrigation scheduling using 18 mm of water in \neach\
    \ irrigation when cumulative pan evaporation \nreached 11, 22, 33, 44 and 55 mm\
    \ and found that \nirrigation at 11 mm of cumulative pan evaporation \nhad the\
    \ highest cabbage yield. \nThe reports on deficit irrigation for cabbage \nproduction\
    \ have some discrepancies, which may \nbe related to differences in cultivar,\
    \ climate, soil \nconditions and irrigation method. Moreover, most \nresearch\
    \ on cabbage irrigation focused mainly on \nyield without accounting for the effects\
    \ on growth \nand physiology. The aim of this two-year study was \nto determine\
    \ the influence of deficit irrigation on \ncabbage growth, leaf characteristics,\
    \ pigment con-\ntent, gas exchange, head weight, size and yield.\nMATERIAL AND\
    \ METHODS\nExperiments were carried out in two seasons, \n2011–12 and 2012–13\
    \ (herein 2012 and 2013 sea-\nson, respectively) at the Texas AgriLife Research\
    \ \nCenter, Uvalde, Texas, USA (longigude 29°1'N, lati-\ntude 99°5'W, elevation\
    \ 283 m a.s.l.). The soil was silty \nclay (fine-silty, mixed, hyperthermic Aridic\
    \ Calcius-\ntolls) with an available soil moisture holding capaci-\nty of 17%.\
    \ Cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) was seeded \nwith a vacuum planter (MaterMacc,\
    \ San Vito al Tag-\nliamento, Italy) on 1.02 m wide bed with double lines \nspaced\
    \ at 0.23 m on November 24, 2011 (2012 sea-\nson), and November 30, 2012 (2013\
    \ season). The \ncultivar Pennant (green head) was used for the 2012 \nseason,\
    \ and Pennant and Rio Grande (red head) for \nthe 2013 season. Winter (November\
    \ to February) \ntemperatures for 2012 and 2013 seasons were gener-\nally similar\
    \ with average daily temperatures in the \nranges of 5 to 22°C. The main difference\
    \ between the \ntwo seasons was rainfall, which was 243 and 158 mm \nfor 2012\
    \ and 2013 season, respectively. In each sea-\nson seedlings were thinned at 0.3 m\
    \ between plants. \nSubsurface drip irrigation was installed in the cen-\ntre\
    \ of each bed at 10 cm depth. The irrigation rates \nwere 100, 75, and 50% ETc\
    \ for the 2012 season, and \n100 and 75% ETc for the 2013 season. The adjustment\
    \ \nof the deficit irrigation rate in 2013 was based on re-\nsults obtained in\
    \ 2012 season. The ETc values were \nestimated using weather data from a local\
    \ weather \nstation and the Penman-Monteith method, and the \napplication of stage-specific\
    \ crop coefficients (Al-\nlen et al. 1998). Total irrigation was 259, 218 and\
    \ \n182 mm for 100, 75 and 50% ETc irrigation in 2012 \nseason, and 515 and 416\
    \ mm for 100 and 75% ETc ir-\nrigation in 2013 season, respectively. Total fertilizers\
    \ \napplied as fertigation were 140 N-57 P-23 K kg/ha \nin 2012 season and 135\
    \ N-43 P-50 K kg/ha in 2013 \nseason.\nGrowth and physiological measurements.\
    \ \nPlant height, width and leaf chlorophyll index were \nperiodically measured\
    \ on five plants from each \nreplication throughout development at various \n\
    days after seeding (DAS). Leaf chlorophyll index \nwas measured in the first fully-developed\
    \ leaf with \na SPAD-502 meter (Konica Minolta Sensing Inc., \nTokyo, Japan).\
    \ During early, middle and late de-\nvelopment, leaf gas exchange (photosynthetic\
    \ rate, \nPn; stomatal conductance, gs; and transpiration, Tr) \nwas measured.\
    \ In addition, three plants from each \nreplication were sampled to determine\
    \ leaf area, \nfresh and dry weight (FW and DW), relative water \ncontent (RWC),\
    \ specific leaf area (SLA), and con-\ntent of chlorophyll a, b and carotenoids.\
    \ \nLeaf area was measured with a leaf area me-\nter (Li-3000, Licor, Inc., Lincoln,\
    \ USA). For leaf \nchlorophyll and carotenoid content, six leaf discs \nwere taken\
    \ with a cork borer from three plants \nand soaked in 20 ml of 95% ethanol in\
    \ the dark for \n48 hours. The extraction was repeated twice with \n10 ml of 95%\
    \ ethanol each time. Absorbance of the \nextraction at 664, 649 and 470 nm was\
    \ measured \nwith a spectrophotometer (Genesys 10S, Thermo \nFisher Scientific,\
    \ Inc., Waltham, USA). Chlorophyll \na, b and carotenoid content was calculated\
    \ using \nthe formula described by Arnon (1949). Another \nsix leaf discs were\
    \ taken to determine leaf RWC \nand SLA. \nHort. Sci. (Prague) \nVol. 41, 2014,\
    \ No. 3: 138–146\n140 \nLeaf RWC was calculated using the formula: \n100[(FW −\
    \ DW)/(TW − DW)] \nwhere:\nFW  – fresh weigh (g)\nTW  – turgid weight following\
    \ soaking in water for 4 h \nat 4°C\nDW  – weight following oven-drying leaf samples\
    \ for \n72 h at 80°C\nGas exchange measurements were made on the \nlargest leaf\
    \ from three plants in each plot with a \nportable infrared gas analyser (Li-6400,\
    \ Licor, Inc.). \nThe analyser was set at 500 μmol/s flow rate (leaf \ntemperature\
    \ of 25 ± 0.4oC, 60 ± 5% relative humid-\nity) and a light emitting diode external\
    \ light source \nproviding a photosynthetic photon flux density of \n1,500 μmol/m2/s.\
    \ \nYield and yield components. Cabbage heads \nwere harvested at peak maturity\
    \ on May 17 in \n2012 season and May 13 in 2013 season. Heads \nwith defects or\
    \ initial flower stalk, or too small  \n(≤ 454 g) were defined as unmarketable.\
    \ Market-\nable and total yield (t/ha), average head size (width \nand height),\
    \ weight (g/head), and the ratio of head \nfresh and dry weight were determined.\
    \ \nStatistical analysis. The experiment for 2012 \nseason was conducted using\
    \ a completely rand-\nomized design with four replications. The experi-\nment\
    \ for 2013 season was conducted using a split \nplot design with four replications.\
    \ Irrigation treat-\nments were the main plots and cultivars the sub-\nplots.\
    \ Each replication consisted of four rows with \n7.6 m length. All growth and\
    \ physiological vari-\nables, yield and yield characteristics data were sub-\n\
    jected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SAS \n(SAS Institute Inc., 1993).\
    \ Mean differences among \nirrigation and cultivar were determined according \n\
    to the Tukey’s Studentized range test. \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n2012 season\n\
    Plant size was temporarily reduced by 50% ETc \nirrigation as compared to 100%\

    \ \n143\nno significant yield difference in cabbage among 100, \n80 and 60% ETc\

    \ not decrease \nwhen irrigated at 80 kPa and 160 kPa soil water ten-\nsion, but\
    \ it reduced at 360 kPa (Thomas et al. 1970). \nThe inconsistency in yield response\
    \ might be due to \ndifferences in climate, soil conditions and irrigation \n\
    method. In this study, both marketable and total \nyield at 75 and 50% ETc deficit\
    \ irrigation were sig-\nnificantly reduced as compared to 100% ETc irriga-\ntion.\
    \ However, there were no significant differences \ndetected in dry weight of marketable\
    \ heads among \nthe irrigation treatments since deficit irrigations in-\ncreased\
    \ the dry weight percentage, which suggests \nthat most decreases in yield under\
    \ deficit irrigation \nare related to water content.\n2013 season\nOnly 75% ETc\
    \ irrigation was tested but on two cul-\ntivars (Pennant, green head colour and\
    \ Rio Grande, \nred head colour), since it had little effects on plant \ngrowth\
    \ and physiology during 2012 season. The in-\nteraction between irrigation and\
    \ cultivar was not \nsignificant so the data were pooled by cultivar. 75% \nETc\
    \ irrigation significantly reduced plant height at \n146 DAS but had no significant\
    \ effect on plant width \n(Table 5). Deficit irrigation increased chlorophyll\
    \ in-\ndex from 52.5 to 53.1 (P = 0.073) and 66.0 to 66.7 at \n83 and 111 DAS,\
    \ respectively (Table 6). Also leaf pig-\nment content based on dry weight was\
    \ enhanced by \ndeficit irrigation at 106 DAS (Table 7). Chlorophyll a, \nb, a\
    \ + b and caroteniod contents were 2.60, 0.94, 3.55 \nand 0.59 µg/mg DW at 100%\
    \ ETc irrigation as com-\npared to 2.97, 1.06, 4.02 and 0.64 µg/mg DW at 75% \n\
    ETc irrigation. At 129 DAS chlorophyll b content was \nslightly (P = 0.078) reduced\
    \ from 1.03 to 0.96 µg/mg \nDW by 75% ETc irrigation, which might result from\
    \ \nleaf senescence under drought stress. Mäkelä et al. \n(2000) also reported\
    \ that moderate drought stress \nincreased tomato leaf chlorophyll content. The\
    \ re-\nduced effect of deficit irrigation on pigment content \nduring 2012 season\
    \ might be due to the low irriga-\ntion differences between 100 and 75% ETc irrigation\
    \  \n(41 and 99 mm for 2012 and 2013 season, respec-\ntively).\nDeficit irrigation\
    \ affected leaf gas exchange before \nmaturity (115 DAS), but not during development\
    \ (90 \nDAS) and maturity (135 DAS). At 115 DAS deficit ir-\nrigation reduced\
    \ gs and Tr at 115 DAS, but had no \nsignificant effect on Pn (Table 8). Similarly,\
    \ 75% ETc \nirrigation did not affect Pn during 2012 season. \nLeaf characteristics\

    \ and size, ex-\ncept for a moderate reduction in marketable yield. \nHowever,\
    \ dry weight of marketable heads was not \nsignificantly different between 100\
    \ and 75% ETc ir-\nrigation. Since dry weight percentage increased un-\nder deficit\
    \ irrigation, it suggests that most yield re-\nduction under deficit irrigation\
    \ is related to water \ncontent. Implementing deficit irrigation (75% ETc) \n\
    could save water (16%) although a moderate de-\ncrease in yield (12%) and head\
    \ size is expected.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors would like to thank Juan Esquivel,\

    Nano-silicon application is an efﬁcient novel approach to mitigate the deleterious
    impacts

    of drought stress on ﬁeld crops, which is expected to increase owing to climate

    change, especially in arid regions. Two-season ﬁeld studies investigated the inﬂuence

    of foliar-applied nano-silicon (0.5, 1, and 1.5 mM) on physiological and biochemical

    attributes and their impacts on crop water productivity (CWP) and the agronomic
    traits

    of faba beans (Vicia faba). The plants were evaluated under two irrigation regimes:

    well-watered (100% ETc giving 406 mm ha−1) and drought stress (65% ETc giving

    264 mm ha−1). It was found that drought stress signiﬁcantly decreased gas exchange

    (leaf net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and rate of transpiration),
    water

    relations (relative water content and membrane stability index), nutrient uptake
    (N, P,

    K+, and Ca+2), ﬂavonoids, and phenolic content. In contrast, drought stress signiﬁcantly

    increased oxidative stress (H2O2 and O·−

    2 ) and enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant

    activities compared with the well-watered treatment. These inﬂuences of drought

    stress were negatively reﬂected in seed yield-related traits and CWP. However,
    foliar

    treatment with nano-silicon, particularly with 1.5 mM, limited the devastating
    impact of

    drought stress and markedly enhanced all the aforementioned parameters. Therefore,

    exogenously applied nano-silicon could be used to improve the CWP and seed and

    biological yields of faba bean plants under conditions with low water availability
    in

    arid environments.

    INTRODUCTION

    Faba beans (Vicia faba L.) are an important legume crop grown worldwide (Gasim
    et al., 2015).

    These plants have high crude protein content and essential amino acids (Vogelsang-O’dwyer

    et al., 2020) and improve soil nitrogen content through the symbiotic ﬁxation
    of atmospheric

    nitrogen, which reduces the requirement for nitrogen fertilizer in agricultural
    production systems

    Desoky et al.

    Nano-Silicon and Drought Stress

    (Liu et al., 2019). Faba beans are cultivated in the Mediterranean

    region as a rotational crop and ﬁx more than 80% of the nitrogen

    requirements of the plant (Denton et al., 2017). However, it is

    highly sensitive to water deﬁcits compared with other ﬁeld crops

    (Parvin et al., 2019).

    The Mediterranean region is one of the most vulnerable areas

    to the deleterious impacts of climate change, with ﬂuctuations

    in precipitation and water shortage being projected to increase,

    particularly in arid and semi-arid environments (García-Ruiz

    et al., 2011; Cook et al., 2016; Mansour et al., 2018; Spinoni et al.,

    2018; Chiwetalu et al., 2020). As a result, water scarcity causes

    destructive alterations in the biochemical and physiological

    processes of plants and, consequently, reduces their growth and

    productivity (Siddiqui et al., 2015; Attia et al., 2021; Desoky

    et al., 2021; Mansour et al., 2021). Therefore, it is crucial

    to mitigate the deleterious impacts of water deﬁciency using

    practical approaches to boost drought tolerance in ﬁeld crops

    (Semida et al., 2020; Abd El-Mageed et al., 2021; El-Sanatawy

    et al., 2021).

    Silicon (Si) considerably increases mechanical strength and

    membrane stability of cell. It also maintains membrane integrity,

    mineral nutrition, photosynthesis eﬃciency, and the tolerance

    defense system (Spinoni et al., 2018; Desoky et al., 2020). As a

    result, Si can be used to alleviate the negative impacts of water

    deﬁcits and improve plant growth and productivity owing to its

    beneﬁcial physicomechanical functions (Rady et al., 2019).

    Recently, nanomaterials have become a desirable solution to

    many technological and environmental challenges in numerous

    ﬁelds (Ansari and Husain, 2012). Nano-silicon has displayed

    superior physicochemical properties owing to its microscopic

    size compared with bulk Si (Prasad et al., 2012; Rastogi et al.,

    2019). Furthermore, nano-silicon has a larger surface area,

    greater surface reactivity and solubility, and numerous well-

    characterized surface properties compared with bulk Si (Qados

    and Moftah, 2015). In particular, particle size is considered

    to be one of the most crucial factors impacting particle

    adhesion, uptake, and transportation into plant cells (Smith

    et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009). In addition, nanoparticles

    interact with plant cells and assist in the transportation of

    diﬀerent substances that can regulate plant metabolism and

    several physiological processes (Galbraith, 2007; Torney et al.,

    2007; Giraldo et al., 2014).

    Investigations into the inﬂuence of nano metals and their

    mechanisms are still at the rudimentary stage. Studies related to

    nano-silicon application and its contribution to the attenuation

    of the adverse impacts of drought stress and the increasing

    of faba bean productivity under water-deﬁcit conditions,

    particularly under ﬁeld conditions, are lacking. Based on the

    results of previous investigations, we hypothesized that the

    application of nano-silicon would notably improve faba bean

    plant performance (growth and productivity) by improving

    the eﬃciency of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, in

    turn reducing the overproduction of reactive oxygen species

    (ROS). Accordingly, we investigated the role of exogenously

    applied nano-silicon dioxide (SiO2) at diﬀerent concentrations

    in ameliorating the drought tolerance of faba bean plants at the

    morphological, physiological, biochemical, and agronomic levels.

    This knowledge will assist in enhancing the drought tolerance of

    faba bean plants for their cultivation in arid environments.

    MATERIALS AND METHODS

    Description of the Experimental Site

    A ﬁeld experiment was undertaken during the 2018–2019 and

    2019–2020 winter growing seasons at the experimental farm of

    the Faculty of Agriculture, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt

    (30◦36′57′′N, 31◦46′58′′E). The site was characterized by low

    precipitation and an arid climate, with an average annual

    rainfall of ∼60 mm. The results of the soil analysis, including

    bulk soil density, ﬁeld capacity, wilting point, pH, texture, and

    soil composition, are presented in Supplementary Table 1. The

    monthly minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall for

    the two winters and the 35-year averages (from 1986 to 2020)

    were obtained from a station close to the experimental site

    (Supplementary Table 2).

    Agronomic Practices

    Phosphorus fertilizer was added at a rate of 31 kg P ha−1

    as calcium superphosphate [Ca(H2PO4)2, 15.5% P2O5] before

    sowing. Nitrogen (N) fertilizer was added at a rate of 45 kg N

    ha−1 as ammonium-sulfate [(NH4)2SO4, 21% N] as fertigation

    one time at sowing. Potassium (K) fertilizer was applied at

    a rate of 95 kg K ha−1 as potassium sulfate (K2SO4, 48%

    K2O) in two equal doses every two weeks after sowing. The

    sowing dates of both seasons were performed according to the

    optimal period for growing faba beans in the region during the

    ﬁrst week of November. The genotype used in this experiment

    was a recommended commercial cultivar in the region (Giza-

    843). Standard agronomic practices, comprising drip irrigation,

    sowing date, chemical fertilization, weed, disease, and pest

    control, were applied as recommended for the commercial

    production of faba beans.

    Experimental Design and Irrigation

    Regimes

    The experimental design was a split-plot, with randomized

    irrigation regimes in the main plots and foliar treatments in sub-

    plots in three replicates. Each plot consisted of six rows that

    were 5 m long with 0.65 m between rows. The plant spacing

    was 0.15 m, resulting in ∼205,130 plants per ha−1. A drip

    irrigation system was used to meet the study objectives, with drip

    laterals and emitters were spaced at 0.65 and 0.3 m, respectively.

    The operating pressure and emitter ﬂow rate were kept at 1

    bar and 4 L h−1, respectively, and maintained using a valve

    and pressure gauge for each irrigation sector. Irrigation water

    quantity was measured independently for each irrigation regime

    using a ﬂow meter. Irrigation scheduling was based on potential

    crop evapotranspiration (ETc) replacement according to the

    crop coeﬃcient approach (Allen et al., 1998). The ETc was

    determined by multiplying the daily reference evapotranspiration

    (ETo) by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) crop

    coeﬃcients (Kc) of faba beans (Allen et al., 1998). The ETo was

    determined from weather data using the FAO-56-standardized

    Penman–Monteith equation as stated by Allen et al. (1998).

    Desoky et al.

    Nano-Silicon and Drought Stress

    Daily meteorological data, including minimum, maximum, and

    dew point temperatures and wind speed, were taken from the

    closest weather station to calculate the ETo. The Kc ﬁgures for

    faba beans, as suggested by the FAO-56, were altered based

    on the obtained climatic values, including the wind speed and

    relative humidity of the experimental site. During the ﬁrst and

    second growing seasons, the total amount of the full irrigation

    regime (100% ETc) was 400 and 412 mm ha−1, respectively. The

    drought stress regime was 35% less (260 and 268 mm ha−1) than

    the well-watered treatment from the seedling establishment to

    physiological maturity in both seasons. Irrigation was applied

    weekly from full emergence to ﬂowering and then two times a

    week from ﬂowering to maturity. Irrigation was discontinued 2

    weeks before harvest (mid-April).

    Foliar Application of Nano-SiO2

    Nano-silicon dioxide (99.5% pure; 20–30 nm) (Sigma-Aldrich

    Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany), with a corresponding

    surface area of 180–600 m2 g−1, was used in the study

    (Supplementary Figure 1). Foliar sprays of 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mM

    nano-SiO2 were applied using a pressurized spray bottle with

    0.1% Tween 20 as a surface spreader. Spraying with distilled water

    was used as a control for foliar treatments.

    Agronomic Traits Measurements

    At the end of the growing season, the plant height, which was

    from the soil surface to the uppermost leaf tip, was measured

    for 10 replicate plants in each plot. Three middle rows from each

    plot were harvested from a total area of 9.8 m2 to determine the

    yield components (number of pods per plant and seeds per pod

    and 100-seed weight), seed yield, and aboveground biomass. The

    100-seed weight was assessed from the weight of the three sets of

    100 seeds.

    Crop Water Productivity

    The crop water productivity (kg m−3) for seed yield (CWPs)

    and aboveground biomass (CWPab) was estimated as the ratio

    of seed yield or aboveground biomass (kg ha−1) to crop

    evapotranspiration (ET, m3) following the formula of Pereira

    et al. (2012) and Fernández et al. (2020):

    CWP (kg m−3) = Yield

    ET

    Crop evapotranspiration (ET, mm) was calculated according to

    the water balance equation (James, 1988): ET = IW + P +

    Cr + Dp ± Rf ± 1S, where IW is the irrigation water amount

    (mm), P is the seasonal precipitation (mm), Cr is the capillary

    rise to the root zone (mm), Dp is the deep percolation (mm), Rf

    is the surface runoﬀ (mm), and 1S is the soil moisture change

    in the crop root zone (mm). The Cr in this study was zero as the

    groundwater table was 15 m below the ground surface. The Dp

    and Rf were neglected owing to the use of a drip irrigation system.

    Furthermore, the soil water content was determined using an

    oven drying method for all the experimental plots. Soil samples

    were collected at planting and harvest from soil depths of 0–

    30, 30–60, and 60–90 cm to estimate the initial and ﬁnal soil

    moisture content during the two growing seasons. The ﬁgures

    were converted to a volumetric basis and multiplied by soil depth

    and bulk density.

    Determination of PSII Quantum Yield and

    CO2 Fixation Rate

    All gas exchange measurements were performed using a Li-

    6400XT portable photosynthesis system equipped with a 6400-40

    leaf chamber ﬂuorescence head and a 6400-02 B LED light source

    (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) between 09:00 and 11:00 a.m. To

    avoid errors, CO2 leakage was corrected according to Flexas et al.

    (2007). All types of measurement (light response curves and CO2

    response curves) were applied on the third leaves of three plants

    at each light intensity. Before starting the CO2 response curve

    measurements, the leaf was adapted for 5–20 min to ensure that

    photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and ﬂuorescence signal

    were stable and rubisco was fully activated. The ﬁrst point was

    measured under a reference CO2 concentration (Ca) of 400 ppm.

    The A–Ci measurements were conducted at the reference CO2

    concentration of 400 ppm, followed by 300, 200, 100, 50, 150,

    250, 350, 600, 900, 1,200, and 1,500 ppm under the saturating

    light conditions of 1,300 µmol m2 s−1 (Loriaux et al., 2013). The

    ﬂuorometer measuring light was turned on and set to measure

    light frequency = 10 kHz, intensity = 3, ﬁlter = 5, and gain = 10.

    The ﬂash was set to multiphase pulse, with a target intensity = 9,

    ramp depth = 30%, measuring frequency = 20 kHz, and ﬁlter =

    50 kHz. The three phases were 320, 350, and 200 ms long (Chen

    et al., 2014).

    Determination of Relative Water Content,

    the Membrane Stability Index, Leaf Soluble

    Sugars, and Proline Content

    Relative water content (RWC) was assessed following the method

    of Osman and Rady (2014) and determined using the following

    equation: RWC (%) = FM−DM

    TM−DM × 100, where FM is fresh mass,

    DM is dry mass, and TM is turgid mass. The membrane stability

    index (MSI) was determined by adding 200 mg of fresh leaves into

    test tubes containing 10 cm3 of double-distilled water. One set

    was heated at 40◦C for 30 min in a water bath, and the electrical

    conductivity of the solution was recorded on a conductivity

    bridge (C1). A replicated set was boiled at 100◦C in a water

    bath for 10 min, with conductivity also being measured (C2).

    The MSI was calculated as described by Rady (2011) using the

    following equation: MSI (%) = 1 − EC1

    EC2 × 100, where EC1

    is the electrical conductivity at 40◦C and EC2 is the electrical

    conductivity at 100◦C.

    The total soluble sugars of 0.2 g of leaf washed with 5 ml

    of 70% ethanol and homogenized with 5 ml of 96% ethanol

    were determined following the method of Irigoyen et al. (1992).

    Brieﬂy, the extract was centrifuged at 1,372 × g for 10 min, and

    the supernatant was collected and stored at 4◦C. Freshly prepared

    anthrone (3 ml) was added to a 0.1 ml supernatant and incubated

    in a hot water bath for 10 min. Absorbance was measured at

    520 nm (Jenway Spectrophotometer 6705, Staﬀordshire, UK),

    and the sugar content was determined from the standard curve

    (Supplementary Figure 2). One gram of glucose was dissolved in

    distilled water, with the volume amounting to 1 L. The diﬀerent

    volumes of the glucose solution were taken and made to amount

    to 100 ml with distilled water in volumetric ﬂasks. Finally, the

    relationship between the readings at 520 nm and the known

    concentration of glucose was plotted (Supplementary Figure 2).

    A rapid colorimetric assay was performed to measure the proline

    content in 0.5 g dried leaf samples according to Bates et al.

    (1973). The absorbance was recorded at 520 nm, with the proline

    content being determined from the standard curve. The proline

    standard curve was developed using 1 g of pure proline, which

    was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Supplementary Figure 3).

    Assessing Antioxidant Enzyme Activity

    Enzyme extraction was performed according to the method of

    Vitória et al. (2001). Brieﬂy, fresh leaf samples were collected in

    an icebox and taken to the laboratory. Distilled water was used to

    wash the leaves, following which, the surfaces of the leaves were

    wiped out of moisture. The leaf sample (0.5 g) was homogenized

    in 0.1 M of an ice-cold phosphate buﬀer (pH 7.5) containing

    0.5 mM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) using a pre-

    chilled mortar and pestle. The homogenate was then transferred

    to centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 4◦C in a Beckman Coulter

    refrigerated centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc., California, USA)

    at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to

    30-ml tubes and referred to the enzyme extract.

    Catalase

    (CAT)

    was

    estimated

    spectrophotometrically

    according to Britton and Mehley (1955). Brieﬂy, the enzyme

    extract (100 µl) was added to 100 µl of 100 mM of H2O2, and

    the total volume has amounted to 1 ml with 250 mM of the

    phosphate buﬀer at pH 6.8. The reduction in optical density

    at 240 nm against the blank was measured every minute. The

    activity of peroxidase (POD) was estimated as described by

    Thomas et al. (1982) using guaiacol as the substrate. The

    reaction mixture contained 3 ml of the phosphate buﬀer (0.1 M,

    pH 7), 50 ml of enzyme extract, 30 ml of H2O2 (20 mM),

    and 50 ml of guaiacol (20 mM). The reaction mixture was

    incubated in a cuvette for 10 min at room temperature. The

    optical density was recorded at 436 nm, and the enzyme activity

    was expressed as the number of absorbance units g−1 fresh

    weight of leaves. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was

    determined by recording the reduction in the absorbance of the

    superoxide-nitro blue tetrazolium complex by the enzyme SOD

    (Sairam et al., 2002). Approximately 3 ml of a reaction mixture

    comprising 0.2 ml of 200 mM methionine, 0.1 ml of 3 mM EDTA,

    0.1 ml of 1.5 M sodium carbonate, 1.5 ml of 100 mM potassium

    phosphate buﬀer pH 7, 0.1 ml of 2.25 mM nitro blue tetrazolium,

    1 ml of distilled water, and 0.05 ml of the enzyme, which were

    all collected in duplicates from each of the enzyme samples into

    test tubes. Two tubes without the enzyme extract were used as

    controls. The reaction was started by adding 0.1 ml riboﬂavin

    (60 µM) and placing the tubes below a light source (two 15-W

    ﬂuorescent lamps) for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by

    turning oﬀ the light and covering the tubes with a black cloth.

    The tubes without the enzyme developed the maximum color. A

    non-irradiated complete reaction mixture that did not develop

    color served as a blank. The absorbance was recorded at 560 nm,

    and one unit of enzyme activity was taken as the quantity of

    enzymes that reduced the absorbance readings of samples to 50%

    compared with the tubes lacking enzymes.

    Determination of Antioxidant Compounds

    and Oxidative Stress (H2O2 and O·−

    2 )

    Content

    The content of ascorbate (AsA; µmol g−1 FW) was determined

    as described by Kampfenkel et al. (1995). Reduced glutathione

    (GsH; µmol g−1 FW) was estimated according to the method of

    Griﬃth (1980). The α-tocopherol was estimated in accordance

    with the methods of Konings et al. (1996) and Ching and

    Mohamed (2001). Finally, the level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2

    µmol g−1 leaf FW) was determined as reported by Velikova et al.

    (2000) and superoxide (O·−

    2 ) level was determined as described

    by Kubi´s (2008).

    Determination of N, P, K+, and Ca+2

    Content

    Dried powder samples (0.1 g) were digested for 12 h in a mixture

    of 2 ml of perchloric acid (80%) with 10 ml of concentrated

    H2SO4. Each sample was diluted with distilled water to a volume

    of 100 ml. Total N was estimated using a micro-Kjeldahl method

    as described by Chapman and Pratt (1982). Total P was estimated

    colorimetrically using the ascorbic acid method as described by

    Watanabe and Olsen (1965). Flame photometry was used to

    analyze the K+ and Ca+2 content according to the method of

    Williams and Twine (1960).

    Preparation of Seed Extracts for

    Biochemical Analyses

    The seeds were homogenized using a lab grinder and stored

    in airtight jars maintained at 4◦C. Dried materials (10 g)

    were defatted by hexane 60–80 and then separately extracted

    successively with ethanol 70% (1:10 ratio) by soaking at room

    temperature for 12 h. The extract was centrifuged at 784 × g for

    15 min (Jouan, MR 1822, Pays de la Loire, France). Extraction

    and ﬁltration were repeated until the residue was colorless. The

    solvent was removed under vacuum at 40◦C using a rotary

    evaporator (Laborota 4000-eﬃcient, Heidolph, Germany), and

    extracts were freeze-dried using a lyophilizer. The obtained

    powder extracts were preserved in light-protected containers

    at −18◦C.

    Determination of Biochemical Parameters

    The antioxidant activity was determined using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-

    picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). The free radical scavenging activity was

    estimated as a percentage of DPPH discoloration as described

    by Blois (1958). The ﬂavonoids content in the extracts was

    estimated following the colorimetric method based on the

    formation of ﬂavonoid-aluminum compounds (Zhishen et al.,

    1999). Total polyphenols were estimated following the Folin–

    Ciocalteu method of Singleton and Rossi (1965).

    comparisons to standard molecular weight markers (Marker, 28–

    250 kDa; Sigma-Aldrich). The protein bands were visualized by

    staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Sigma-Aldrich).

    Statistical Analysis

    The R statistical software version 3.6.1 was used to analyze the

    data. A combined analysis of variance was performed for the

    split-plot design with irrigation regimes, foliar applications,

    and their interactions as ﬁxed eﬀects, while growing seasons,

    replications, and their interactions were considered random

    eﬀects.

    The

    diﬀerences

    among

    irrigation

    regimes,

    foliar

    applications, and their interactions were separated by the

    least signiﬁcant diﬀerence at p ≤ 0.05. A biplot of a principal

    component analysis (PCA) estimated the association between

    evaluated traits.

    RESULTS

    Agronomic Traits and CWP

    The water-deﬁcit treatment signiﬁcantly decreased plant height,

    100-seed weight, number of pods per plant, number of seeds

    per pod, seed yield, and aboveground biomass compared with

    the well-watered treatment (Table 1). Nano-SiO2 substantially

    enhanced all agronomic traits compared with the corresponding

    untreated plants under both watering regimes. The greatest yield

    was achieved with 1.5 mM, followed by 1 mM nano-SiO2 in

    the well-watered treatment. Treatment with 1.5 mM nano-SiO2

    also increased the seed yield by 14.2% in well-watered plants

    and 27.7% in drought-stressed plants compared with those in

    untreated plants (Figure 1).

    The CWP for seed yield (CWPs) ranged from 1.22 to 1.65 kg

    m−3, while the aboveground biomass (CWPab) ranged from 2.81

    to 3.72 kg m−3 (Table 1). Under drought stress conditions, faba

    bean plants possessed higher CWPs (on average 1.5 kg m−3) and

    CWPab (3.8 kg m−3) than those that underwent the well-watered

    treatment (1.31 and 3.12 kg m−3, respectively). Drought-stressed

    plants also had a higher CWP than well-watered plants due to

    their more eﬃcient water consumption and water loss reduction

    due to osmotic regulation. The application of nano-SiO2 also

    signiﬁcantly improved CWPs and CWPab compared with the

    untreated stressed controls. The highest CWPs (1.65 kg m−3) and

    CWPab (3.72 kg m−3) were achieved with the application of 1.5

    mM nano-SiO2.

    Physiological Parameters

    Drought stress signiﬁcantly reduced the net photosynthetic rate

    (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (gs), RWC,

    MSI, and nutrient content (N, P, K+, and Ca+2) of faba bean

    Nano-Silicon and Drought Stress

    FIGURE 1 | Percentage change (increase or decrease) in morphological, agronomic,
    physiological, and biochemical attributes upon the application of 1.5 mM

    nano-silicon dioxide (nano-SiO2) compared with untreated faba bean (Vicia faba)
    plants under well-watered and drought-stressed conditions.

    plants (Table 2). All nano-SiO2 treatments mitigated the damage

    of drought stress and signiﬁcantly improved all physiological

    parameters. The highest values were seen in well-watered plants

    treated with 1.5 mM nano-SiO2, while the lowest values were

    recorded in the control water-stressed plants (Table 2).

    Drought-stressed plants increased free proline and soluble

    sugars and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes CAT, POD,

    and SOD. Furthermore, the non-enzymatic antioxidants AsA,

    GsH, and α-tocopherol were higher compared with non-stressed

    faba beans (Table 3). In contrast, the application of nano-

    SiO2 signiﬁcantly increased the free proline and soluble sugar

    contents and the activities of antioxidant enzymes and non-

    enzymatic antioxidant compounds compared with the untreated

    plants under both irrigation regimes. The highest values were

    achieved with the application of 1.5 mM of nano-SiO2 to the

    stressed plants (Table 3). Increasing free proline, soluble sugars,

    antioxidant enzyme activities, and non-enzymatic antioxidant

    compound content helped the faba bean plants alleviate the

    negative impacts of water scarcity.

    In addition, irrigation regimes and nano-SiO2 application

    signiﬁcantly impacted oxidative stress biomarkers (Table 3).

    The levels of H2O2 and O·−

    2

    were signiﬁcantly increased in

    stressed compared with non-stressed plants. Furthermore, the

    application of nano-SiO2 to plants in the water-deﬁcit treatment

    signiﬁcantly lowered H2O2 and O·−

    2 levels compared with those

    in untreated plants.

    Biochemical Parameters

    Drought stress caused a signiﬁcant increase in antioxidant

    activity, ﬂavonoids, and phenolics (Table 4). The application of

    nano-SiO2 signiﬁcantly enhanced these parameters compared

    with those in the untreated plants under both irrigation regimes.

    The highest antioxidant activity and values of ﬂavonoids and

    phenolics were produced by the 1.5-mM nano-SiO2 application

    in the water-deﬁcit treatments, while the lowest values were

    recorded in the well-watered control plants (Table 4).

    Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide

    Gel Electrophoresis Protein Pattern

    The SDS-PAGE patterns displayed nine protein bands (170, 158,

    110, 90, 81, 63, 57, 40, and 30 kD) in untreated faba bean plants

    grown under well-watered or water-deﬁcit conditions (Table 5).

    However, the nano-SiO2 concentrations of 1 and 1.5 mM created

    a protein fraction with a molecular weight of 129 kD only in

    the faba bean plants grown under drought stress. Only nine

    bands were observed in the rest of the treatments in both

    watering regimes.

    Interrelationship Among Evaluated Traits

    The PCA of the agronomic, physiological, and biochemical traits

    showed that the ﬁrst two principal components accounted for

    most of the variability, which was ∼98.41% (83.43% by PC1

    and 14.98% by PC2; Figure 2). In the PC biplot, the traits were

    represented by parallel vectors or those that were close to each

    other, indicating a strong positive association, whereas those that

    were situated approximately opposite (at 180◦) showed a highly

    negative relationship. In addition, the vectors toward the sides

    expressed a slight relationship. The 30 investigated traits could be

    classiﬁed into three groups: the ﬁrst group (15 traits) comprises

    agronomic traits, namely, Pn, Tr, gs, MSI, RWC, and nutrient

    contents (N, P, K+, and Ca+2), the second group (13 traits)

    consisted of the CWP for seed yield and aboveground biomass,

    antioxidant activity, ﬂavonoids and phenolic contents, proline

    and soluble sugar contents, enzymatic antioxidants (POD, CAT,

    and SOD), and non-enzymatic antioxidant compounds (AsA,

    GsH, α-TOC, proline, and soluble sugars), and the third group

    contained H2O2 and O.−

    2 . Furthermore, PC1 separated the

    treatments into two groups. The well-watered treatments were

    located on the positive side, while those under drought stress

    were located on the negative side (Figure 2). The traits in the

    ﬁrst group were associated with well-watered plants, especially

    those that were treated with 1 and 1.5 mM nano-SiO2, while

    the biochemical attributes in the second and third groups were

    associated with the drought-stressed treatments.

    DISCUSSION

    Water scarcity stress poses great challenges to sustainable faba

    bean production due to its sensitivity to drought. Consequently, it

    is vital to identify novel approaches to enhance drought tolerance,

    especially under conditions of abrupt climate change. In the

    current study, drought-stressed faba bean plants exhibited a

    decline in seed yield-related traits and CWP and an increase

    in oxidative and osmotic stress compared with those of

    well-watered plants. As a result, exogenously applied nano-

    SiO2 enhanced gas exchange, water relations, nutrient uptake,

    activities of antioxidant enzymes, and non-enzymatic antioxidant

    compounds, which substantially reduced oxidative stress and

    positively reﬂected the improvement of drought tolerance in faba

    bean plants with enhancements in yield-related traits and CWP.

    The Si nanoparticles have great availability and are easily

    absorbed by plants compared with bulk Si, consequently

    supporting greater ameliorative impacts under abiotic stresses

    (Suriyaprabha et al., 2012; Tripathi et al., 2016). The obtained

    results

    demonstrated

    that

    the

    application

    of

    nano-SiO2,

    particularly at 1.5 mM, considerably boosted photosynthetic

    eﬀectiveness and leaf gas exchange (e.g., Pn, Tr, and gs) in

    plants under water-deﬁcit stress compared to those that were

    untreated. Promoting photosynthetic eﬃciency maintenance

    could be attributed to optimal stomatal conductance and strong

    antioxidant activities, which improve plant tolerance to drought

    stress (Suriyaprabha et al., 2012; Haghighi and Pessarakli, 2013;

    Rios et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2021). Furthermore, the application

    of nano-SiO2 increased the water uptake from roots to leaves

    by enhancing the RWC and MSI in treated faba bean plants

    compared with those in control plants under drought stress.

    Previous studies have also found that maintaining RWC and

    MSI at a healthy status enhances osmotic adjustments and

    metabolic activities under conditions of drought stress (Slabbert

    and Krüger, 2014). In this study, nano-SiO2 application likely

    boosted the water content of plants by decreasing stomatal

    transpiration and increasing turgor pressure and potassium

    absorbance (Romero-Aranda et al., 2006; Tahir et al., 2012;

    Liu et al., 2014; Cerný et al., 2020). Furthermore, nano-SiO2

    application signiﬁcantly improved the absorption of the nutrients

    N, P, K+, and Ca+2 in faba bean plants under drought stress. In

    addition, it has been found that mineral nutrient uptake depends

    mainly on membrane activity, which plays a fundamental role

    in the ion movement from the soil to the plant and controls the

    allocation of cells (Khoshgoftarmanesh et al., 2014; Gupta et al.,

    2016). These enhancements in water movement and nutrient

    absorption enable improvements in all physiological activities of

    the cells.

    Within cells, the accumulation of compatible solutes under

    stress eﬀectively maintains the status of plant cell water.

    For example, proline is an excellent compatible osmolyte

    that improves plant antioxidant systems and aﬀects osmotic

    adjustment (Zhu, 2001; Desoky et al., 2020). Soluble sugars

    also maintain the balance between the vacuole and the osmotic

    quality of cytosol under abiotic stress conditions (Sairam

    et al., 2002). The results indicated that the application of

    nano-SiO2 elevated the proline and soluble sugar contents in

    drought-stressed plants. Therefore, its application improved

    plant tolerance by elevating osmolyte content, altering osmotic

    potential, and maintaining higher turgor in response to drought

    stress (Claussen, 2005; Rizwan et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017;

    Desoky et al., 2020). Furthermore, improved enzymatic and non-

    enzymatic defense systems can alleviate the overproduction of

    ROS, such as O·−

    2

    and H2O2, produced in response to drought

    stress. The enzymatic defense system components SOD, CAT,

    and POD and the non-enzymatic defense system components

    GsH, AsA, and α-TOC were signiﬁcantly increased following

    the application of nano-SiO2 compared with those in untreated

    plants under drought stress. Accordingly, the application of

    nano-SiO2 lowered the concentrations of O·−

    2

    and H2O2 and,

    therefore, reduced oxidative stress in drought-stressed faba bean

    plants. Consequently, the application of nano-SiO2 could be an

    eﬀective tool to increase faba bean tolerance to oxidative stress

    by enhancing ROS scavenging enzymatic and non-enzymatic

    defense systems (Rios et al., 2017; Rady et al., 2019).

    Nano-Silicon and Drought Stress

    FIGURE 2 | Biplot of the ﬁrst two principal components for the physiological,
    biochemical, and agronomic traits of faba beans (Vicia faba). The physiological

    parameters comprised of net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr),
    stomatal conductance (gs), relative water content (RWC), membrane stability index
    (MSI),

    nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) content, proline content
    (Pro), soluble sugars (SSu), peroxidase activity (POD), catalase activity (CAT),

    superoxide dismutase activity (SOD), ascorbic acid (AsA), glutathione (GsH), hydrogen
    peroxide (H2O2), superoxide radical (O.−

    2 ), and α-tocopherol (α-TOC). The

    biochemical parameters included antioxidant activity % (Ant%), ﬂavonoids content
    (Flav), and phenolic content (Phen). The agronomic traits were plant height (PH),

    number of pods plant−1 (NP/P), number of seeds pod−1 (NS/P), 100-seed weight (100-SW),
    seed yield (SY), aboveground biomass (AB), crop water productivity for

    seed yield (CWPs), and aboveground biomass (CWPab). WW-Cont, WW-T1, WW-T2, and
    WW-T3 were foliar applications using tap water, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mM of

    nano-silicon dioxide (nano-SiO2) under the well-watered treatment, respectively.
    DS-Cont, DS-T1, DS-T2, and DS-T3 were foliar applications using tap water, 0.5,
    1,

    and 1.5 mM of nano-SiO2 under the drought stress treatment.

    The application of nano-SiO2 enhanced ﬂavonoids, phenolic

    compounds, and antioxidant activity levels, particularly in

    drought-stressed faba bean plants. The utilization of these

    protection systems helps to overcome oxidative damage, which

    has been suggested to occur through the synthesis of secondary

    metabolites, such as ﬂavonoids and phenolic contents (Blokhina

    et al., 2003). These metabolites can forestall protein denaturation,

    DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation (Król et al., 2014; Quan

    et al., 2016). Although Si is not a fundamental component of

    plants, it has a beneﬁcial impact in improving protection against

    drought stress through the initiation of protective proteins and

    the reduction of ROS (Suriyaprabha et al., 2013; Luyckx et al.,

    2017). In addition, the electrograph of the protein fraction

    proﬁle showed that the application of 1 and 1.5 mM nano-

    SiO2 led to the generation of a new protein fraction (molecular

    weight: 129 kD).

    The application of nano-SiO2 exhibited signiﬁcant positive

    alterations in all the investigated physiological and biochemical

    attributes

    under

    water-deﬁcit

    conditions.

    Accordingly,

    treated plants grew more eﬃciently under drought stress

    compared with untreated plants and coped with water deﬁcit

    conditions.

    Nano-SiO2

    application,

    particularly

    using

    a

    concentration of 1.5 mM as an optimum level, attenuated

    the devastating impacts of drought stress by improving

    photosynthetic

    eﬃciency,

    plant

    water

    status,

    nutrient

    absorption, nutrient uptake, non-enzymatic and enzymatic

    antioxidant activities, and ROS scavenging. These promotional

    inﬂuences were reﬂected in increasing seed yield and all its

    related traits and CWP compared with the corresponding

    untreated plants.

    The

    interrelationship

    among

    the

    evaluated

    parameters

    (Figure 2)

    reﬂected

    that

    the

    agronomic

    traits

    positively

    associated with Pn, Tr, gs, MSI, RWC, and nutrient contents

    (physiological

    parameters).

    We

    speculate

    that

    the

    high

    values of these physiological parameters are associated with

    greater seed yield and contributing traits, particularly under

    conditions of drought stress. Otherwise, the CWPs and CWPab

    demonstrated a highly positive association with antioxidant

    activity, ﬂavonoids, and phenolic compounds. In addition,

    the agronomic traits exhibited a highly negative association

    with H2O2 and O.−

    2

    (Desoky et al., 2020; Mansour et al.,

    2020, 2021). According to these results, it is interesting to

    detect

    speciﬁc

    physiological

    and

    biochemical

    parameters

    highly associated with yield-related traits or CWP under

    water-deﬁcit conditions.

    CONCLUSION

    Drought stress in faba bean plants resulted in reduced gas

    exchange, leaf water potential, leaf turgidity, nutrient uptake,

    photosynthetic rate, and ﬂavonoids and phenolic content

    compared with the same levels in well-watered plants. These

    adverse impacts were reﬂected in decreased yield-related

    traits and CWP. However, exogenously applied nano-SiO2,

    particularly at 1.5 mM, mitigated the negative impacts of

    drought stress and promoted plant growth by boosting all

    of the investigated physiological attributes. In addition, the

    application of nano-SiO2 decreased the membrane leakage

    of electrolytes and membrane lipid peroxidation due to

    reduced drought-stimulated oxidative stress by enhancing the

    activity of osmoprotectants and the enzymatic and non-

    enzymatic defense system components under drought stress.

    Consequently, nano-SiO2 had a positive inﬂuence on the

    physiological, biochemical, and agronomic traits of drought-

    stressed plants and alleviated the inﬂuence of drought stress on

    faba bean plants.

    Modeling contribution of shallow \ngroundwater to evapotranspiration \nand yield\
    \ of maize in an arid area\nXiaoyu Gao1,2, Zailin Huo1, Zhongyi Qu3, Xu Xu1, Guanhua\
    \ Huang1 & Tammo S. Steenhuis2\nCapillary rise from shallow groundwater can decrease\
    \ the need for irrigation water. However, simple \ntechniques do not exist to\
    \ quantify the contribution of capillary flux to crop water use. In this study\
    \ \nwe develop the Agricultural Water Productivity Model for Shallow Groundwater\
    \ (AWPM-SG) for \ncalculating capillary fluxes from shallow groundwater using\
    \ readily available data. The model combines \nan analytical solution of upward\
    \ flux from groundwater with the EPIC crop growth model. AWPM-SG \nwas calibrated\
    \ and validated with 2-year lysimetric experiment with maize. Predicted soil moisture,\
    \ \ngroundwater depth and leaf area index agreed with the observations. To investigate\
    \ the response \nof model, various scenarios were run in which the irrigation\
    \ amount and groundwater depth were \nvaried. Simulations shows that at groundwater\
    \ depth of 1 m capillary upward supplied 41% of the \nevapotranspiration. This\
    \ reduced to 6% at groundwater depth of 2 m. The yield per unit water consumed\
    \ \n(water productivity) was nearly constant for 2.3 kg/m3. The yield per unit\
    \ water applied (irrigation water \nproductivity) increased with decreasing irrigation\
    \ water because capillary rise made up in part for the \nlack of irrigation water.\
    \ Consequently, using AWPM-SG in irrigation scheduling will be beneficial to save\
    \ \nmore water in areas with shallow groundwater.\nIn many of semi-arid and arid\
    \ regions of the world, irrigated agriculture consumes most of the water. For\
    \ exam-\nple, in the 1.12 million ha Hetao irrigation district in the Yellow River\
    \ basin, agricultural irrigation accounts for \n90% of the water use1,2. Especially\
    \ in districts with shallow groundwater such as the Hetao Irrigation district,\
    \ \ncapillary rise of groundwater can be used to supplement surface water irrigation\
    \ and in closed basins can possibly \nsave water for irrigating additional areas.\n\
    Several experiments have been carried out to quantify the amount of water that\
    \ is used by agricultural crops \nfrom groundwater. Bargahei and Mosavi reported\
    \ in an experimental study, groundwater supplemented between \n53% and 55% of\
    \ the water of safflower utilizing saline groundwater and about 82% for safflower\
    \ utilized fresh \ngroundwater at groundwater depths (between 50 cm to 120 cm)3.\
    \ Ghamarnia found that two thirds of the aver-\nage annual safflower water requirement\
    \ (65 cm) could be met with groundwater table depth from 0.6 to 0.8 m4. \nWith\
    \ lysimeter experiments, Kahlown and Ashraf reported that the wheat crop did not\
    \ need any supplementary \nirrigation with a water table at 0.5 m depth and 80%\
    \ sunflower’s water need was supplied by groundwater at 0.5 m \ndepth5.\nYield,\
    \ water productivity (WP) and irrigation water productivity (IWP) vary with both\
    \ groundwater depth \nand irrigation amounts. Mejia et al. conducted a two-year\
    \ study to investigate the effect of groundwater table on \nthe yield of corn\
    \ and found a 5–10% greater yield for corn and 23% for soybeans at 0.5–0.75 m\
    \ groundwater depth \ncompared with the same treatment with groundwater depth\
    \ more than 1 m6. Huo et al. reported that irrigation \nwater productivity (IWP)\
    \ increased with the shallower groundwater tables7.\nAlthough experimental evidence\
    \ has well established that the shallow groundwater can supplement crop water\
    \ \nuse, it is seldom used in irrigation scheduling to decrease the amount of\
    \ water applied because measuring the \ncapillary upward flux is complex and cannot\
    \ be done routinely. Therefore, models are the only way to obtain the \nfluxes.\
    \ However, most of the irrigation management models assume that the groundwater\
    \ is sufficient deep that \nthe water percolates downward out reach of the plant\
    \ roots8–10. Several methods that can estimate the upward \nwater such as Hydrus\
    \ and SWAP are cumbersome because they require spatially varying input data such\
    \ as the \n1Center for Agricultural Water Research in China, China Agricultural\

    \ in Pakistan12. Other models such as by Healy and Cook and Ayars et al. are based\
    \ \non measured moisture contents or water-table fluctuation and cannot be used\
    \ in routine application13,14.\nBecause of the shortcoming in the above mentioned\
    \ models for use in irrigation management with shallow \ngroundwater, the objective\
    \ of this manuscript is, therefore, to develop a quantitative model requiring\
    \ only readily \navailable data that can be used to analyze the water flux at\
    \ water table, to calculate the groundwater contribution \nto crop evapotranspiration;\
    \ and to investigate the effect of groundwater depth and irrigation water amount\
    \ on \nyield, crop evapotranspiration, water productivity and irrigation water\
    \ productivity of maize. Without affecting \nthe maize yield, the irrigation water\
    \ can be reduced in a reasonable range. This will aid managers in optimizing \n\
    water application rates to optimize yields and to determine diversion plans from\
    \ river systems.\nModel Description\nAgricultural Water Productivity Model for\
    \ Shallow Groundwater. \nIn this study, we develop the \nAgricultural Water Productivity\
    \ Model for Shallow Groundwater, AWPM-SG, which is coupling of a crop \ngrowth\
    \ model EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) and a soil moisture model\
    \ of root and vadose \nzone -WIPE (Watershed Irrigation Potential Estimation)\
    \ that simulates both upward movement from ground-\nwater and percolation to the\
    \ groundwater which was originally developed by Saleh et al. for surface irrigation\
    \ in \nBangladesh15,16. The structure of AWPM-SG model is shown in Fig. 1. AWPM-SG\
    \ model needs few parameters \n(soil hydraulic parameters and crop growing parameters)\
    \ listed in Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3 in the \nSection S3 of the Supplementary material\
    \ and simulates water flux on daily time step. The three parts of the \nAWPM-SG\
    \ model consists of a crop module, an actual evapotranspiration module and a soil\
    \ module (Figure S1 \ndrawn by Xiaoyu Gao in the Section S2 of the Supplementary material).\
    \ These three modules are coupled first \ntime in the AWPM-SG model. The model\
    \ is described in detail in the Section S1 of the Supplementary material. \nAn\
    \ overview of AWPM-SG model is given below.\nCrop module. The crop module of AWPM-SG\
    \ is mainly based on the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate \n(EPIC) model.\
    \ EPIC originally developed by Williams et al.17. It has been tested and applied\
    \ widely around the \nworld18–22. Wang and Li reported that the EPIC model predicted\
    \ winter wheat and spring maize yield well on the \nLoess Plateau in China23.\
    \ Niu et al. examined the reliability of the EPIC model in simulating the grain\
    \ sorghum \nyields in the USA and found that the accuracy and reliability varied\
    \ with climate classes and nitrogen treat-\nments24. Brown and Rosenberg validated\
    \ the EPIC model to assess the climate change impact on the potential \nproductivity\
    \ of corn and wheat in the U.S.25. Currently the EPIC model has evolved into a\
    \ comprehensive model \ncapable of simulating photosynthesis, evapotranspiration\
    \ and other major plant and soil process23. The crop mod-\nule includes the phonological\
    \ development, crop growth indexes (LAI, biomass, root growing, crop yield) and\
    \ \nwater productivity (WP, IWP).\nDescription of soil module. Because EPIC cannot\
    \ simulate the crop growth above the ground without the soil \ndata, EPIC was\
    \ coupled with the modified watershed irrigation potential estimation model (WIPE)\
    \ to simulate \nthe whole water recycle. The WIPE model was designed by Saleh\
    \ et al. to study the impact of irrigation manage-\nment schemes on groundwater\
    \ levels in Bangladesh16. The model divides the soil profile into four zones namely\
    \ \nFigure 1. The schematic of the soil water balance calculation and crop growth\
    \ in the Agricultural Water \nProductivity Model for Shallow Groundwater (AWPM-SG).\

    \ and the saturated zone as shown in Figure S1 in the \nSection S2 of the Supplementary material\
    \ 16. The soil texture in zone 1 and 2 are same. The zone 1 is calculated \nusing\
    \ the water balance method. The WIPE model simulates both downward recharge when\
    \ the soil moisture in \nzone 2 is greater than field capacity and upward movement\
    \ when the soil moisture is below field capacity using an \nanalytical solution\
    \ developed by Gardner26. This is a one-dimensional model employing the Thornthwaite-Mather\
    \ \nprocedure to calculate the recharge below the root zone to the aquifer and\
    \ is primarily applicable to shallow aqui-\nfers27. Steenhuis and van der Molen\
    \ successfully used this model on Long Island, NewYork, USA. Other studies \n\
    also employed Thornthwaite-Mather procedure28–30.\nFull detail of the model is\
    \ shown in the Section S1 (Agricultural Water Productivity Model for Shallow \n\
    Groundwater) of the Supplementary material.\nActual evapotranspiration module.\
    \ Actual evapotranspiration (ET) is an input to the EPIC model. We used the \n\
    model of Kendy et al. that previously was able to calculate the actual evapotranspiration\
    \ from soil-water storage \nin North China Plain with good accuracy9. In this\
    \ model, the ratio of Ep to Tp depends upon the development \nstage of the leaf\
    \ canopy, moisture content and root development9,31–34. The input data are the\
    \ daily leaf area index, \nLAI simulated by the EPIC model and simulated soil\
    \ moisture of actual root zone (zone 1) by WIPE model and \nwater balance.\nResults\n\
    Evaluation of AWPM-SG model. \nData of a lysimetric experimental study carried\
    \ in 2007 and 2008 at the \nShuguang experimental station in the Hetao irrigation\
    \ district, were used to calibrate and validate the AWPM-SG \nmodel. The maize\
    \ (Kehe-8) commonly grown in Hetao irrigation district was planted in late April\
    \ and harvested \nin late September. Supplementary Table S4 in the Section S3\
    \ of the Supplementary material shows the irrigation \nscheduling with four times\
    \ irrigation every year. Experiments were carried out in two replicates. The groundwater\
    \ \ndepths were set using the Marriotte bottles at 1.5 m, 2 m, 2.5 m and 3 m before\
    \ planting. After planting the bottles \nwere removed allowing the groundwater\
    \ to vary in response to irrigation and evaporation.\nThe 2007 data were used\
    \ for calibration and 2008 data for validation (Tables S2 and S3 in the Section\
    \ S3 of the \nSupplementary material). The soil data and crop data inputted are\
    \ shown in Tables S2 and S3 in the Section S3 \nof the Supplementary material.\

    \ To investigate the effect of calibrated parameters on the crop \nevapotranspiration,\
    \ groundwater depth, LAI and soil water content of 90 cm soil, the parameters\
    \ sensitivity and \nuncertainty were analyzed together (Figure S2). When the parameters\
    \ vary, the four indexes are linearly related to \nthe change in the parameters\
    \ basically except for the Tb, PHU and C. For the crop evapotranspiration, the\
    \ LAImx \naffects the ET most obviously, and then the be and Tb largely affect\
    \ the ET (Figure S2A and B). The other param-\neters affect the ET slightly with\
    \ the Δ ET/ET less than 5% as the parameters increasing by 25%. Evenly most of\
    \ \nthe parameters have little impact on the ET. The initial LAImx is from the\
    \ recommended value of EPIC. Through \nthe calibration and sensitivity of parameters\
    \ the final LAI is determined. The detailed information is shown in \nFigure S2\
    \ in the Section S2 of Supplementary material.\nFor the groundwater depth, the\
    \ mf, dp, Tb and PHU are the main impact factors. The others almost have \nno\
    \ influence on the groundwater depth (Figure S2C and D). mf is measured in the\
    \ field experiment using \nundisturbed samples. The initial dp is obtained by\
    \ the recommended value of local government and Tb, PHU is \nobtained by the recommended\
    \ value of EPIC. The detailed information is shown in Figure S2 in the Section\
    \ S2 of \nSupplementary material.\nSimilarly to the ET, the main impact factors\
    \ on LAI are LAImx, Tb, PHU, T0 and ad. The other parameters have \nlittle effect\
    \ on the LAI. The initial Tb, PHU, T0 and ad are recommended by EPIC. The detailed\
    \ information is \nshown in Figure S2 in the Section S2 of Supplementary material.\n\
    For the soil water content of 90 cm, the parameters such as mf, ms, mwp, LAImx,\
    \ PHU, Tb affect the soil water \ncontent more obviously than the other parameters.\
    \ Mf, ms, mwp are measured in the experiment. The initial \nLAImx, PHU, Tb are\
    \ recommended by EPIC. The detailed information is shown in Figure S2 in the Section\
    \ S2 of \nSupplementary material.\nCombing the observed data, the uncertainty\
    \ analysis of the parameters on groundwater depth, LAI and soil \nwater content\
    \ are analyzed (Table S6 in the Section S3 of Supplementary material). Through\
    \ the uncertainty \nanalysis of parameters, the d-factors calculated by Equation (7)\
    \ ranges from 0 to 1.44 with averaged value of 0.14. \nLarger d-factor represents\
    \ larger uncertainty. From the data, we can find that for the groundwater depth,\
    \ LAI and \nsoil water content, the most uncertain parameters are same with the\
    \ most sensitive parameter. The most uncer-\ntain parameters are mf, LAImx, mf\
    \ for groundwater depth, LAI and soil water content, respectively. The trend of\
    \ \nuncertainty of parameters are basically similar to the sensitivity. The detailed\
    \ information is shown in Table S6 in \nthe Section S3 of Supplementary material.\n\
    Water fluxes and capillary rise under different groundwater depths. In this model\
    \ the water flux at the boundary \nof zone 2 (RD <   =  RDmx) or zone 1 (RD =\
    \  RDmx) is the water flux at water table. In this model we assume the \nwater\
    \ flux at 90 cm (maximum root) as the groundwater contribution to crop water use.\
    \ In the analysis, ground-\nwater depth is the initial groundwater condition for\
    \ different groundwater depth. The soil water flux obtained by \nadding the percolation\
    \ (calculated with Equation S23 in the Section S1 of Supplementary material) and\
    \ capillary \nrise (Equation S24 in the Section S1 of Supplementary material)\
    \ during the growing period from April 20th to \nSeptember 24th for 2007 for groundwater\
    \ tables from 150 to 300 cm are shown in Figure S3 in the Section S2 of \nthe\
    \ Supplementary material. There were eighteen recharge events for 150 cm groundwater\
    \ depth and only four \nwhen the groundwater was at 2 m or deeper. The root zone\
    \ is wetter when the groundwater is shallow (Fig. 2A) \nand the soil is brought\
    \ up to field capacity faster than when the groundwater is deeper. Assuming that\
    \ all irri-\ngation or rain water in excess of field capacity percolates downward,\
    \ this means that there is more recharge for \nthe shallow groundwater tables.\
    \ For example, with the irrigation of 9.75 cm irrigation on June 26th in 2007,\
    \ the \ngroundwater table rose 53 cm for the 150 cm depth and 1 cm for water table\
    \ at 300 cm (Figure S3 in the Section S2 \nof the Supplementary material). Without\
    \ the rainfall and irrigation, water from groundwater will move upward \nto the\
    \ root zone. The net groundwater contribution (i.e., upward minus recharge) to\
    \ soil root zone for whole \ncrop growth stage was 106 mm (24%) when groundwater\
    \ depth was at 1.5 m, while recharges was 51 mm with \ngroundwater depth of 3\
    \ m. Our modeling results are similar to Huo et al., where the groundwater capillary\
    \ flow \ncomprised 29% of the water use of wheat at 1.5 m groundwater depth from\
    \ planting to harvest and decreased with \nan increase in table depth7.\nScenarios\
    \ for evaluation of water use and yield. \nAfter calibration and validation of\
    \ AWPM-SG, the \nmodel was used to find out the response of groundwater depth\
    \ and deficit irrigation on water use, maize yield, \nWP and IWP. To do so the\
    \ AWPM-SG was run for nine scenarios with 7 GWD levels (100, 150, 200, 250, 300,\
    \ \n350 and 400 cm). D0 (irrigation with 360 mm, 53% of PET), D1 (irrigation with\
    \ 288 mm, 42% of PET), D2 (irri-\ngation with 270 mm, 40% of PET), D3 (irrigation\
    \ with 240 mm, 35% of PET), D4 (irrigation with 180 mm, 26% \nof PET), D5 (irrigation\
    \ with 120 mm, 18% of PET), D6 (irrigation with 90 mm, 13% of PET), D7 (irrigation\
    \ with \n72 mm, 11% of PET) and D8 (no irrigation) were simulated (Table 2). The\
    \ rainfall of 128 mm for all scenarios \nand the irrigation for the D0 treatment\
    \ was similar to the amount in 2007 used for calibration of the model. The \n\
    initial soil water, groundwater depth, irrigation time and fertilizer application\
    \ are set as the lysimeter experiments \nof groundwater at 1.5 m in 2007. The\
    \ initial meteorology of the model is done by repeated meteorology in the \nexperiments\
    \ in 2007. In the analysis for the effect of groundwater on water flux, evapotranspiration\
    \ and yield, \ngroundwater depth is the initial groundwater condition for different\
    \ scenarios.\nEvapotranspiration of maize. The scenario analysis found that evapotranspiration\
    \ (calculated by Equation S32 \nin the Section S1 of the Supplementary material)\
    \ was the greatest for the shallowest groundwater depth at 1 m \namounted to around\
    \ 570 mm per growing season and was nearly independent of the amount of irrigation\

    \ was 0.3 cm3/cm3 and rainfall during the growing season was \n128 mm for the\
    \ all scenarios. Evapotranspiration decreased gradually when the groundwater depth\
    \ increased \nfrom 1 to 4 m depth. For groundwater depth of 1 m, the evapotranspiration\
    \ was around 550 mm independent of \nthe amount of irrigation applied. When the\
    \ groundwater is at 4 m, less water evaporated when irrigation amounts \ndecreased\
    \ and amounted to 300 mm per growing season when the groundwater was at 4 m depth\
    \ and the maize \ncrop was not irrigated (Fig. 3).\nThe groundwater contribution\
    \ to crop evapotranspiration (WF/ET). The predicted water flux at water table\
    \ for \nvarious irrigation treatments and groundwater depths are shown in Fig. 4A.\
    \ Within the crop growth period, root \nzone will become deeper. At the same time,\
    \ groundwater levels will change. So flux between groundwater and \nroot zone\
    \ is dynamic and depend on distance between water table and the rooting depth.\
    \ For the same ground-\nwater depth, the upward water flux increases as the irrigation\
    \ amount becomes smaller, especially for the shallow \ngroundwater depth (Fig. 4A).\
    \ For example, at 1 m groundwater depth, the upward water flux was 202 mm without\
    \ \nirrigation and nearly half of the amount evapotranspirated. The result show\
    \ that under shallow groundwater, \ngroundwater contribution can be considered\
    \ in the irrigation system. When the groundwater table was at 2 m \ndepth, there\
    \ was a net recharge of − 14 mm in the growing season when 360 mm of irrigation\
    \ water was applied \n(Fig. 4A) and without irrigation there was a 23 mm of upward\
    \ flux. Finally, with groundwater at 4 m, 67 mm of the \n360 mm water applied\
    \ is lost from the root zone. Thus when the groundwater depth is more than 2.5\
    \ m, upward \nmovement is negligible as can be seen in Fig. 4A.\n6/26\n7/17\n\

    \ (IWP) (calculated with Equation S13 in the Section S1 of the Supplementary material)\
    \ is the \nratio of crop yield to irrigation amount (Table 3). The WP is nearly\

    \ yield is directly related to the amount of evapotranspiration. It should however\
    \ \nbe noted that this is only true for deficit irrigation where less irrigation\
    \ water is applied than the potential evap-\notranspiration during the summer.\
    \ The WP is increasing slightly with less irrigation at the same groundwater \n\
    depth. For the same irrigation application with more than 180 mm, WP is increasing\
    \ with deeper groundwater.\nThe IWP increased with decreasing water application\
    \ (Table 3, Fig. 5). The averaged IWP value for seven \ngroundwater levels for\
    \ the D0 (irrigation at 53% of PET), D2 (irrigation at 40% of PET), D4 (irrigation\
    \ at 26% of \nPET) and D6 (irrigation at 13% of PET) irrigation treatments were\
    \ 3.4, 4.5, 6.5 and 11.8 kg/m3. This clearly shows \nthe positive effect of water\
    \ table depth on maize yield.\nDiscussion\nIn order to simulate the irrigation\
    \ water management models in arid areas with shallow groundwater, the \nAgricultural\
    \ Water Productivity Model for Shallow Groundwater (AWPM-SG) (Fig. 1) was developed\
    \ for the \nsimulation of the water fluxes, deep percolation and capillary rise\
    \ as a function of groundwater depth. The model \nneeds few parameters (soil hydraulic\
    \ parameters and crop growing parameters) and simulates water flux on daily \n\
    time step. The model was calibrated and validated using the lysimeter experimental\
    \ data in 2007 and 2008. The \nsimulation of soil moisture, groundwater depth\
    \ and LAI resulted in reasonable agreement, which indicated that \nthe model is\
    \ suitable to simulate water fluxes and water productivity in the shallow groundwater\
    \ district.\nThe water flux at water table, crop evapotranspiration and groundwater\
    \ contribution were investi-\ngated with running AWPM-SG in scenarios where the\
    \ irrigation amount and water table depth was varied. \nEvapotranspiration was\
    \ nearly independent of the amount of water applied when the groundwater was shallow\
    \ \nand for groundwater below 1.5 m decreased with smaller amounts of irrigation\
    \ water (Fig. 3 and Table 3). Thus \nFigure 4. Water fluxes at water table and\

    \ make up for the lack of irrigation water. This is agreement of the findings\
    \ of Soppe and \nAyars35, the irrigation applied was 46% less when the water table\
    \ was maintained at 1.5 m depth than when the \nwater table was too deep to be\
    \ reached by the crops, while our results are that ET only decreased by 3% with\
    \ irri-\ngation applied 50% less at 0.5 m water table depth when ET decreased\
    \ by 9% with irrigation applied 50% less at \n3 m water table depth (Fig. 3).\n\
    We found that the quotient of groundwater flux at water table (WF) and the evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) increases \nwith both decrease in irrigation amounts and groundwater depth\
    \ (Fig. 4B). This is similar to the findings of Luo \nand Sophocleous that ratios\

    \ are \nplotted against the depth to water table36. Our results (Fig. 4) are in\
    \ general agreement with experimental results \nof Torres and Hanks and Luo and\

    Sophocleous’s experiments in the sub-humid warm temperate continental monsoon\
    \ Yucheng, China, only 3% of \nthe evapotranspiration was supplied by groundwater\
    \ at 3 m depth36.\nUnder deficit irrigation, maize yield is directly linked to\
    \ crop evapotranspiration (i.e. WP ≈  2.2) and almost \nindependent of the amount\
    \ of irrigation applied for shallow groundwater tables (Table 3). Consequently,\
    \ using \nAWPM-SG in irrigation scheduling together with groundwater monitoring\
    \ will increase the yield per unit of \nwater applied in irrigation district with\
    \ high groundwater. The IWP of maize slightly decreased when groundwa-\nter depth\
    \ increased with linear relationship and significantly increased with less irrigation\
    \ amount (Fig. 5). Thus, \nthese simulations agree with earlier findings of Huo\
    \ et al. and Sun et al.7,38, the amount of water productivity per \nunit of water\
    \ applied for shallow groundwater can be improved with moderate deficit irrigation.\
    \ In addition, the \ndeeper the groundwater level, the WP will be more different\
    \ between different irrigation treatments. For closed \nbasin where the amount\
    \ of irrigation water is limiting, applying less water will increase the overall\
    \ yield per unit \narea in the basin.\nFuture improvement to the model will include\
    \ modules that can simulate other crops. In addition, we will add \na module that\
    \ simulates the movement of salt so that irrigation manager can more effectively\
    \ leach the salt from \nthe profile.\nMaterials and Methods\nExperiments. \nFor\
    \ model calibration and validation, field experiments by Kong were used39. Investigating\

    \ climate, soil, groundwater conditions. Lysimetric experiments provide accurate\
    \ water \nbalances and have been widely used to validate models9,36,40.\nThe Hetao\
    \ irrigation district, is located in the western part of Inner Mongolia Autonomous\
    \ Region. The study \nsite has a typically arid and semi-arid continental climate.\
    \ The average annual rainfall is142 mm and falls mainly \nfrom June to August.\
    \ The average annual pan evaporation is 2300 mm. The average number of sunlight\
    \ hours per \nmonth is 266 h. The mean annual temperature is 7 °C, with monthly\
    \ averages of − 10.1 in January to 23.8 °C in July \n(Figure S4 in the Section\
    \ S2 of the Supplementary material). Soils begin to freeze in the second half\
    \ of November \nto a maximum depth of about 1.0–1.3 m, and is completely thawed\
    \ in the middle of May. Groundwater depth \nvaries between 1.2 to 3.8 m41.\nMaize,\
    \ wheat and sunflower accounts for 31%, 7% and 30% respectively. These proportions\
    \ have varied very \nlittle in recent years42. The experiment with eight non-weighing\

    \ The iron cylindrical lysimeters had a diameter of 1 m and a height of \n3.35\
    \ m. The maize (Kehe-8) commonly grown in Hetao was planted in late April and\
    \ harvested in late September. \nCultivation practices were similar to the practices\
    \ by farmers and recommended by extension agents. Four times \nduring the growing\
    \ season 360 mm of water was applied (Table S4 in the Section S3 of the Supplementary mate-\n\
    rial). The irrigation amount referred to the local farmers’ field. Nitrogen fertilizers\
    \ were applied at a rate of 207 kg/\nha at the first irrigation, 103 kg/ha at\
    \ the third irrigation in 2007 and 276 kg/ha at the first irrigation in 2008.\
    \ \nMarriotte bottles were used to set the initial groundwater depths at 1.5 m,\
    \ 2 m, 2.5 m and 3 m before sowing, and \nthen removed to allow the groundwater\
    \ to change in response to irrigation and evaporation.\nDuring the growing period,\
    \ the meteorological data consisting of air temperature, sunshine hours, relative\
    \ \nhumidity and wind speed for 2007 and 2008 were taken from Linhe weather station\
    \ 8 km away from Shuguang \nand were used to calculate the FAO Penman-Monteith\
    \ reference evapotranspiration (ET0). Daily rainfall was \nmeasured using a rain\
    \ gauge at the experimental site. The rainfall was 132 mm in 2007 and 123 mm in\
    \ 2008, with \nmore than 70% of precipitation occurring in July and August. The\
    \ main weather data was shown in Figure S4 in \nthe Section S2 of the Supplementary material.\n\
    The particle size distribution was obtained using the laser particle analyzer.\
    \ The main soil physical properties \nof the soil are shown in Supplementary Table S1\
    \ in the Section S3 of the Supplementary material. In the root \nzone, the soil\
    \ is loam, which is the representative soil texture in this region42. The dry\
    \ bulk density was obtained \nby oven drying undisturbed soil samples of 100 cm3\
    \ at 105 °C for 48 h. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was \nmeasured in eight\
    \ 100 cm3 undisturbed soil samples using a constant-head permeameter43. Soil water\
    \ retention \ncurves were determined for each horizon in 100 cm3 undisturbed soil\
    \ samples using a pressure membrane appa-\nratus (SEC-1000). The fitted soil hydraulic\
    \ parameters of the Muchlem-van Genuchten model are presented in \nSupplementary Table S3\
    \ in the Section S3 of the Supplementary material 44,45.\nData. \nThe soil moisture\
    \ content was measured every 3–17 days using the time domain reflectometry \n\
    (Tube-TDR) including shortly before and after the irrigation and at seeding and\
    \ harvest. The soil moisture was \nmeasured at 20 cm intervals from the surface\
    \ to a depth of 300 cm. At the same time, it was calibrated with drying \nmethod\
    \ through earth-fetching at regular time.\nThe groundwater depth was monitored\
    \ daily during the crop growth period through monitoring the piezo \nmetric head\
    \ in the access chamber.\nThe crop leaf area index (LAI) was measured every 6–12\
    \ days using a leaf area meter (LI-3000, LI-COR).\nDry maize yield was determined\
    \ after harvesting.\nModel calibration and validation. \nThe simulation period\
    \ for maize was from late April to late September \nin 2007 and 2008 using the\
    \ observed initial soil water content and groundwater depth subject to the imposed\
    \ \nirrigation schedule and fertilizer applications for two years. The 2007 data\
    \ was used for calibration and 2008 to \nvalidate the model. Soil moisture of\
    \ top 90 cm (zone 1 and 2), groundwater depth, and LAI were simulated. The \n\
    soil hydraulic parameters (md, ms, C, α and ks) and the crop parameters were calibrated\
    \ (Tables S2 and S3 in the \nSection S3 in the Supplementary material). During\
    \ the calibration, we set the parameters od model according to \nthe measured\
    \ data and recommended values, and we analyzed the sensitivity and uncertainty\
    \ analysis of param-\neters and found the sensitive parameters for soil water,\
    \ groundwater depth and crop LAI, respectively such as \nLAImx, mf and so on.\
    \ Then we adjust the parameters as their sensitivity to make the simulation result\
    \ of model \nmore close to measured data. At last the calibrated parameters were\
    \ used to validate the model using the data \nof 2008. The default values of the\
    \ EPIC model for maize were used as initial value for simulating crop growth46.\
    \ \nThe default value of maximum rooting depth was 90 cm measured in the experiment\
    \ by Kong39. Initial soil water \ncontent and groundwater depth were specified\
    \ according to measurements. A sensitivity and uncertainty analysis \nof parameters\
    \ was performed for soil water content, groundwater depth and crop LAI.\nThe upper\
    \ boundary condition was determined by the actual evaporation and transpiration\
    \ rates, and the \nirrigation and precipitation fluxed. A no-flux boundary condition\
    \ was specified at the column bottom.\nThe mean relative error (MRE), the root\
    \ mean square error (RMSE), the Nash and Sutcliffe model effi-\nciency (NSE),\
    \ the coefficient of determination (R2) and the coefficient of regression (b)\
    \ were used to quantify \nthe model-fitting performance for both calibration and\

    Get rights and content Abstract The impact of different irrigation scheduling
    regimes on the quantity and quality of olive oil from a low-density olive grove
    in southern Portugal was assessed during the irrigation seasons of 2006 and 2007.
    Olive trees were subjected to one of the following treatments: A—full irrigation;
    B—sustained deficit irrigation (SDI) with 60% of ETc water applied with irrigation;
    C—regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) with irrigation water applied at three critical
    phases: before flowering, at the beginning of pit hardening and before crop harvesting
    and D—rain-fed treatment. Olive oil yield was significantly higher than rain-fed
    conditions in 2006, an “on year” of significant rainfall during summer. No significant
    yield differences were observed in the following “off year”. Among the irrigated
    treatments, olive oil production of treatment B was 32.5% and 40.1% higher in
    2006 and 2007, respectively than the fully irrigated treatment A, despite receiving
    49% less irrigation water. Such strategy could allow for an efficient use of water
    in the region, of very limited available resources, and for modest but important
    oil yield increase. Nonetheless, on the “on year” of 2006 treatment C used 13.9%
    of the water applied to treatment B and produced only 23.9% less olive fruits
    which could also make it illegible as the next possible strategy to use for irrigating
    olive trees in the region, provided that water is secured latter in the summer,
    a period of vital importance for oil accumulation and very sensitive to water
    stress as the poor results of 2007 revealed. The different treatment water regimes
    did not impact on the chemical characteristics of olive oils that were within
    the set threshold limits. Similarly, the sensory characteristics of the olive
    oils as well as bitterness and pungency were negligible for all treatments allowing
    them to be assessed as of “superior quality”.Overall, irrigation treatments had
    no influence on the commercial value of produced oils, being all classified as
    “extra virgin”. Such funding may be of vital importance to farmers willing to
    further their irrigation area, save water and still retain the protected designation
    of origin (PDO) seal of quality for their oil. Previous article in issue Next

    Introduction According to the International Olive Oil Council (IOOC) the world
    area devoted to olive-growing is 8.8 Mha (Carbot, 2007). This area is centered
    mainly in the Mediterranean basin, which has about 99% of the world''s olive groves
    and produced in 2007/2008 around 2 030 800 metric tons of olive oil. In Europe,
    Portugal is the fourth largest olive oil producer, with 34 900 metric tons of
    olive oil produced in 2007/2008, mostly from its Southern Alentejo province where
    olive is a strategic crop providing for safe economic returns to farmers and jobs
    to entire rural communities. According to the latest agricultural census (INE,
    1999) the olive tree cultivation area in the southern province of Alentejo is
    around 148 402 and 37 298 ha in its sub-region of Moura, where the dry-farmed
    cultivars Cordovil, Verdeal and Galega are traditionally grown in orchards of
    around 100 trees ha−1. Due to the characteristically infrequent and limited annual
    rainfall of the region, there is a growing interest in improving the water use
    and oil content of those olive tree orchards through irrigation, if proven to
    be important in yield increases and better fruit quality. The cultivar Cordovil
    is highly appreciated for its high fruit free fatty acid (oleic acid) content
    and the fine sensory properties of extracted oil. It is mainly responsible for
    the seal of quality “Protected Designation of Origin (PDO)” conferred to the olive
    oil coming from the region (CE, 2006); the result of a balanced blend of 35–40%
    Cordovil, 15–20% Verdeal and Galega oils, making the region of Moura in Alentejo
    one of the five protected designation of origin (PDO) regions of Portugal. Being
    olive-growing an integral part of the social fabric of the rural communities and
    one that provides safe economic returns to farmers, there is ambition among the
    olive growers to convert their traditional low-density olive groves into irrigation,
    a process that is already taking place. Also, with consumers demanding better
    quality olive oil and more perceptive about olive oil quality, the fine and distinct
    characteristics of those mono-variety oils from low-density autochthones cultivars
    are assuming a special relevance in the marketplace, as producers seek to find
    market niches for their low-producing but highly appreciated olive oil. Dry-farmed
    cv. Cordovil orchards are traditionally widely spaced to take full advantage of
    the stored water from winter rains for spring and summer growth. Yields are however
    low (Santos et al., 2007). To improve yields, compete with newly introduced and
    productive non-indigenous cultivars and preserve biodiversity and the character
    of the local oil, they are being converted to drip irrigation. Imposed often by
    the severe low water availability in the region, deficit irrigation management
    is being advocated as a way out to better yields, oil quality and economic returns
    of the irrigated orchards. Because of the large range of summer rainfall, microclimate,
    soils and tree spacing in the olive-growing areas, water requirements and the
    strategies used to manage olive trees vary widely. The literature contains few
    results on the irrigation of traditional, low-density olive orchards. Lavee et
    al. (1990) showed that a single complementary irrigation of 75 mm following pit
    hardening was effective in doubling olive production and oil yield in old olive
    trees of cv. Souri, when compared to rain-fed conditions. Pastor et al. (1999)
    reported an increase in yield in an 80 ha irrigated olive orchard compared to
    growth under rain-fed conditions. In a low-density olive orchard of 69 trees ha−1
    Moriana et al. (2007) showed that the trees in the water deficit and rain-fed
    treatments rapidly recovered from water stress after receiving irrigation water
    or autumn rainwater, suggesting that since recovery from water stress is rapid
    when irrigation is concentrated in the second half of the summer, this irrigation
    strategy could allow efficient use of water in areas of limited available resources.
    The current trend in the irrigation of olive trees is to develop either sustained
    (SDI) or regulated deficit (RDI) irrigation strategies, whereby the water is applied
    at a rate less than the needs of evapotranspiration with only very small reductions
    in yield (Goldhamer, 1999, Tognetti et al., 2005). SDI applies a fixed fraction
    of the evapotranspiration rate throughout the irrigation season while RDI imposes
    a period of water stress that is controlled in terms of its intensity. The second
    phase of fruit development, when pit hardening occurs, has been identified as
    the most resistant to water deficit, which is when water supplies can either be
    reduced or halted (Goldhamer, 1999). The third phase of fruit development and
    oil accumulation, after pit hardening, is however very sensitive to water stress
    (Lavee and Wodner, 1991, Goldhamer et al., 1994, Moriana et al., 2003, Tognetti
    et al., 2005), being found to reduce fruit and oil production. Results and sensitivity
    of both SDI and RDI on low-density orchards also show that outcome vary considerably
    by genotype, summer rainfall and related local environmental conditions. Water
    use strategies on irrigation of olive trees are often affected by changes in environmental
    water status, radiation and temperature that markedly impact on their seasonal
    physiological characteristics and oil. Stomata close slowly as water deficit increases
    so that the photosynthetic rate can be maintained over a wide range of leaf water
    potential, and the stomatal response to vapour pressure deficit is attenuated
    in highly stressed plants (Fernández et al., 1997, Moriana et al., 2003, Moriana
    et al., 2007). A successful programme to irrigate low-density olive orchards seems
    to require and depend on knowledge of trees physiological responses and sensitivity
    to different irrigation strategies at different stages of their growth cycle.
    Also, according to Motilva et al. (2000), regimes of water stress may impact on
    oil characteristics and quality. Patumi et al. (1999) and d’Andria (2008) in studies
    conducted on Italian olive varieties concluded that applications of water in excess
    of 66% ETc during the whole season neither led to increases in production nor
    to better fruit quality, a clear indication of the benefits of deficit irrigation
    regimes. d’Andria et al. (2004) had shown that the production and quality of olive
    fruit of five studied cultivars benefited from deficit irrigation and had high
    yield when only 66% of ETc was supplied with irrigation. Grattan et al. (2006),
    in a study carried out on high-density olive trees of cv. Arbequina I-18 in California
    reported maximum productivity when 75% of ETc was supplied with irrigation. They
    argued that the best oil chemical quality is obtained from irrigation regimes
    supplying 33–40% of ETc water. Moriana et al. (2007) in a study conducted on low-density
    olive trees subjected to one of four treatments: rain-fed, 100% ETc, 125% ETc
    and a deficit irrigation treatment with 60 mm of water, obtained no significant
    statistical differences between treatments for fruit yield or oil production.
    However, Grattan et al. (2006) report that increases in yield due to irrigation
    water application can be largely offset by reductions in the percent of oil extracted.
    Concerning oil quality, Patumi et al., 1999, Patumi et al., 2002 found fatty oils,
    acid composition, peroxide levels and shelf life not being affected by the amount
    of irrigation. Conversely, Gómez-Rico et al. (2005) report that oils of trees
    that undergo regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) regimes are of superior quality
    but similar in composition to ones under fully irrigated regimes. They argue that
    olive oil bitterness, spiciness and fruitiness are affected by irrigation, with
    a slight but more noticeable decrease in bitterness with increases in water application.
    Similarly, Muñoz-Cobo (2005) reports oils from highly irrigated olive trees been
    milder in sensory characteristics than counterpart oils from deficit irrigation
    regimes. Definitive conclusions and consensus on the behaviour of yield and olive
    oil characteristics of low-density orchard subjected to different irrigation regimes
    are hard to establish, making the issue an on-going and debatable matter needing
    ever more site specific studies and research. Certainly, capturing the specific
    effects of regional and local climates, soils and indigenous olive trees genotypes
    on yields and oil quality under different irrigation regimes is of importance
    to all olive researchers and technicians. In southern Portugal it is of vital
    significance to farmers that owe their livelihood to olive oil trading and to
    entire rural communities tied up to jobs in olive orchard management as well on
    the being off of their farming community. As seen, in order to apply a successful
    irrigation programme to olive trees it is of critical importance to have knowledge
    of their physiological responses and sensitivity to different irrigation strategies
    at different stages of their growth cycle. It is the aim of the present work to
    study those relationships and quantify yield and olive oil characteristics of
    low-density olive trees of cv. Cordovil grown in orchards in southern Portugal
    under full, sustained and regulated deficit irrigation management. The effect
    of soil and crop water status on olive tree physiological responses obtained via
    the plant water stress indicators stomatal conductance and predawn and midday
    leaf potential is evaluated at different stages of their growth cycle, to quantify
    leaf and plant water status and determine their sensitivity to different irrigation
    strategies. Concurrently, soil water status is evaluated through soil moisture
    profile probe sensors to account for the applied water and its accessibility by
    olive trees rooting system. Subjected to different irrigation schedules and amounts
    that might impact on oil quality, such is quantified by chemical and sensory analyses
    from extracted oils obtained from carefully harvested representative sub-treatments
    selected from each irrigation treatment. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Experiment
    location and design This study was carried out in at the Herdade dos Lameirões
    near Safara, in the region of Moura, province of Alentejo, Portugal (lat. 38°05′15″N;
    long. 07°16′39″W; alt. 75 m) using a representative orchard stand of mature olive
    trees (Olea europaea L. cv. Cordovil). The over 80-year-old mature olive orchard
    was planted on a 12 by 12 m spacing layout and was converted in 2005 from dry-farming
    to drip irrigation. The trees were treated in 2006 and 2007 from mid March to
    the end of October in 2006 and from mid March to the end of November in 2007 using
    one of four irrigation treatments: a treatment A with full-rate irrigation of
    77 trees to the full soil water holding capacity and continuously replenished,
    a SDI treatment B with irrigation of 64 trees to provide for approximately 60%
    of the water applied in treatment A, a regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) or treatment
    C in which water is applied to the 60 trees only during the three critical phase
    periods: before flowering, at beginning of pit hardening and before crop harvesting,
    to provide enough water to replenish the soil moisture to field capacity, and
    a dry-farming treatment D. Phenological stages of the olive trees was recorded
    throughout the irrigation cycle following the widely accepted BBCH decimal code
    and procedure described in Sanz-Cortés et al. (2002), a phenological descriptor
    of olive trees whereby the entire developmental cycle of the crop is subdivided
    into ten clearly recognizable and distinguishable longer lasting phases of principal
    and secondary growth stages. In the process, the pit hardening phase was identified
    and used to establish the onset of irrigation for treatment C, in July 3, 2006
    and July 11, 2007, respectively. Reference evapotranspiration, ET0 was calculated
    using the FAO-Penman-Monteith method and the procedures prescribed by Allen et
    al. (1998). Each tree was water supplied by a single drip line with emitters spaced
    1 m apart throughout the entire length of the emitter line placed at the soil
    surface and laid out along each tree row and serviced by twelve 3.6 l h−1 emitters.
    Weather data and rainfall events were collected by an automatic meteorological
    station placed within a few hundred meters from the olive orchard. Hourly averages
    of the meteorological parameters, wind speed, air temperature, solar radiation,
    precipitation and relative humidity were recorded and evaluated. Half-hour averages
    of the net radiation above the canopy of the trees were measured using one NrLite
    net radiometer (Kipp & Konen, Holland) connected to a data logger (Campbell CR10X,
    Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA). The in situ soil classification indicates
    a clay soil (Vcx) until 0.40 m and silt loam transition to 0.45 m, underneath
    which a restrictive layer of very compact limestone and gravel elements limited
    root development and placement of soil moisture probes. Soil volumetric water
    content at field capacity (−0.03 MPa) was estimated as 0.36 m3 m−3 to 0.18 m,
    and 0.34 m3 m−3 between 0.18 and 0.50 m, whereas wilting point (−1.5 MPa) soil
    volumetric water content was 0.27 and 0.24 m3 m−3, respectively. 2.2. Soil water
    evaluation Two representative trees per treatment were instrumented with access
    tubes for profile probe PR1 sensors (Delta T Devices, Lta., Cambridge, UK) at
    distances of 1, 2, 3 and 6 m along the tree rows and at depths of 0.10; 0.20;
    0.30 and 0.45 m, below which the restrictive layer of limestone and gravel limited
    placement of access tubes and probes. One access tube was also installed between
    rows. Soil water content was monitored and recorded throughout 2006 and 2007 irrigation
    season, with results used to estimate the equivalent depth of water in the soil
    to 0.45 m, and its relative extractable water (REW) defined by Granier (1987)
    as: (1) where R (mm) is the actual soil water content in the root zone; Rmin (mm)
    the minimum soil water content observed during the experiment and Rmax (mm), the
    soil water content at field capacity. To complement the profile probe sensors
    readings and also guide the onset of irrigation, Watermark sensors (Irrometer
    Co. Inc., Riverside, USA) were placed inside the wet bulbs developed by the drip
    emitters at 1 and 3 m from the trunk and along the tree row, at 0.25; 0.45 and
    0.65 m depths. Data were recorded via data logger and averaged on hourly intervals.
    When scheduled for each treatment, according to the full, RDI and SDI options
    and limits of water application, irrigation was applied to trees until reading
    on the Watermark sensor placed at 0.45 m depth approached the water potential
    of −0.06 to −0.07 MPa, a management decision that provided for the least number
    of weekly irrigation and helped to reduce losses via soil evaporation. Table 1
    presents the amount of irrigation water applied to each treatment during 2006
    and 2007. Data collected from an automatic meteorological station near the olive
    orchard provided for the inputs used on the calculation of Penman-Monteith potential
    evapotranspiration (ET0). Table 1. Fruit and oil yield (mean and standard deviation),

    and at chest height. A diffusion of continuous flow LI-1600 porometer (LI-1600
    Inc., IT USES) similar to the one described in Parkinson (1985) was used. Predawn
    (ψb) and midday leaf potential (ψmin) were also evaluated to determine leaf and
    plant water status, according to the methodology described in Goldhamer and Salinas
    Fereres (2001). A pressure chamber type PMS (PMS Inst., Corvallis, OR, USES) was
    used and healthy leaves of the year in the shade and at chest height were monitored,
    after covering them with a wet cloth during the short period of time in-between
    incision and their placement in the pressure chamber. The ψb describes the plant
    water status when a balance between soil and tree water potential is deemed achieved
    Bergonci et al. (2000), while ψmin provides critical tree water potential values
    when transpiration rates are at peak. 2.4. Sap flow measurement The Compensation
    Heat-Pulse method (CHP) developed by Swanson and Whitfield (1981) and modified
    by Green et al. (2003) was used to evaluate tree sap flow and tree transpiration
    rates. As described in Fernández et al., 1996, Fernández et al., 1997 a representative
    tree in each treatment was selected and outfitted with three set of heat-pulse
    velocity (HPV) probes and specific software was used for analysis of results.
    More detail on procedure is found in Santos et al. (2007). 2.5. Orchard yield,
    oil extraction and analyses At harvest, olives from three representative sub-treatments
    in each irrigation treatment were hand picked and weighed. Concurrently, a sample
    of olives of about 3 kg per harvested sub-treatment were selected and transported
    to the laboratory for oil extraction. An Abencor analyzer (MC2, Ingenierias y
    System, Seville, Spain) system that reproduces industrial oil extraction (Grattan
    et al., 2006) was used for extraction of olive oil from the olive samples following
    the procedure and extraction phases described in Berenguer et al. (2006). The
    extracted oil was afterwards transferred to bottles of dark glass and stored at
    4° C temperature while waiting for the chemical and sensory analyses. Oil samples
    were analyzed for acidity (% of oleic acid), peroxide value (meq O2 per kg of
    oil), UV absorbance (K232 and K270) and sensory attributes of organoleptic evaluation,
    according to European Union Regulation EEC 2568/91 and European Union Regulation
    EC 1893/03 regulations. The ripeness index (RI) was evaluated following procedures
    described in Hermoso et al. (1999) by setting the maturity index scale from 0
    (olives with intense green color) to 7 (olives with black skin and flesh purple
    to the pit). The percent of moisture in the resulting olive paste obtained from
    the Abencor extraction was estimated as moisture difference between wet and dry
    paste. The percent of oil content in the dry paste was evaluated by Nuclear Magnetic
    Resonance (NMS 110 minispect analyzer, Bruker) while the oil acidity, an indicator
    of free fatty acid levels in the oil, was expressed as percent of oleic acid (European
    Union Regulation EEC 2568/91 annex II). Free fat acid auto-oxidation plays an
    important role in the flavor characteristics and formation of organoleptic toxic
    compounds that reduce the nutritional value of the olive oil and its market value.
    Peroxide values were evaluated, as they indicate the state of initial oxidation
    of given oil and they are defined as the quantity of active oxygen (meq) in 1
    kg of fat or oil (European Union Regulation EEC 2568/91 annex III). Secondary
    products resulting of oil oxidation where evaluated as UV absorbance, K232 and
    K270, indices that indicate the state of oil conservation and secondary alterations
    induced by technological processes (European Union Regulation EEC 2568/91, annex
    IX). Sensorial evaluation of the oil flavor was done by following the organoleptic
    method of classifying oil in a numerical scale of perception of the intensity
    of flavor stimulus in the mouth. It follows the present European Union Regulation
    EEC 2568/91 annex XII procedures where the intensity of the attribute is measured
    in a scale of 6, being 0 an imperceptible perception and 5, an extreme one. No
    negative attributes were observed. An overall grading procedure in a nine-point
    scale ranging from 1, the lowest quality, to 9, the exceptional quality, was lastly
    applied to attribute a single classification score to each oil simple analyzed.
    This final average score results from blending the quality attributes and weaknesses
    of the analyzed oil, allowing it to be classified as extra virgin when the overall
    grading is equal to or higher than 6.5, as virgin if graded 5.5–6.5, or lampant,
    if classified between 3.5 and 5.5. 2.6. Statistical analysis The software SPSS
    version 15 was used for statistical data analysis. When a significant effect of
    factors in the study or the interaction between them is supported by the analysis
    of variance, the Tukey test with a level of signification α = 0.05 was used for
    identification of differences between mean values. The experimental effect of
    the two trial years was separately analyzed. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Climatic
    characterization For the period in study the average total rainfall was 521.8
    and 333.7 mm in 2006 and 2007 respectively, with the wet season spanning from
    October to April and a long and dry summer season lasting from May to September.
    Worthwhile noticing the impact of 2007 low rainfall on yield and produced oil.
    The dry season is the period for irrigation when trees need water to balance the
    high evapotranspiration rates resulting from the long and dry days, of intense
    net radiation (Fig. 1a and b), high vapour pressure deficit and low soil moisture
    content. Daily atmospheric water demand is high during the period, with potential
    evapotranspiration (ET0) rates reaching values as high as 8 mm day−1 in the months
    of July and August (Fig. 1a and b), and the stored winter rainfall in the soil
    is unavailable for remobilization, being long used during the dry spells of early
    Spring (Santos et al., 2007). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Potential

    Seasonal evolution of relative extractable water (REW) in the soil during 2006
    and 2007 irrigation periods is presented in Fig. 2. With REW values for treatment
    A between 0.89 and 0.98 throughout the 2006 irrigation season (Fig. 2a) indicating
    well-watered trees, predawn leaf water potential readings, ψb were kept high,
    of less or equal −1 MPa (Fig. 3a), a threshold value for plant water stress according
    to Muñoz-Cobo (2005). Concerning treatment B, REW were at all times in-between
    0.74 and 0.92, slightly lower than the values recorded for treatment A, as only
    60% of tree evapotranspiration (ETc) was been replaced by irrigation. Predawn
    leaf water potential readings reflected such fact with values slightly below −1
    MPa. The regulated deficit irrigation regime imposed to treatment C, with water
    applied at periods more sensitive to water deficit (before flowering, at pit hardening
    and about 15 days before harvest), justifies the erratic behaviour of REW presented
    in Fig. 2a. Until the day of year (DOY) 172, a period without irrigation, REW
    gradually decreased to values close to 0.37. Following irrigation in DOY 194,
    REW climbed to a maximum of 0.97, when soil water content was 0.34 m3 m−3 but
    after DOY 194 they gradually declined to their lowest value in DOY 262, when volumetric
    soil water content was of 0.11 m3 m−3. Download : Download full-size image Fig.

    of REW in-between 0.87 and 1.0, except around DOY 235 when they dipped lower due
    to a week failure in the irrigation system. Fig. 2b presents such results. With
    40% less water applied to treatment B, the REW values stayed in-between 0.85 and
    1.0 and close to the ones observed for treatment A, indicating that soil water
    stayed near field capacity. Predawn leaf water potential, ψb were slightly lower
    than −1 MPa (Fig. 3b), also indicating that well irrigated trees. For treatment
    C and during half of the period in evaluation, volumetric soil water content stayed
    low, of around 0.18 m3 m−3 with REW values alternating in-between 0.17 and 0.27.
    The former was recorded in mid August (DOY 235) when most of the soil moisture
    had been depleted. After irrigation, in DOY 201, REW recovered to 0.95, as did
    happen in 2006 (Fig. 3b). In the eight days of measurements, treatment D volumetric
    soil water content was below wilting point and REW values stayed in-between 0.04
    and 0.43. However, when the soil moisture was replenished with 20.8 mm of rainfall,
    REW values quickly bounced back, between DOY 247 and 271 (Fig. 2b). In general,
    REW values remained always below 0.4 in this treatment and ψb (Fig. 3b) also reflected
    such fact with low values of ψb recorded during the period. Higher moisture in
    the soil throughout the summer irrigation cycle and consequent high leaf water
    potential confirm the importance of irrigating olive trees in Alentejo, a Mediterranean
    region denied of meaningful summer rainfall and where olive trees are conditioned
    to thrive in shallow soils of restrictive layer that limit deep soil water storage
    and remobilization by roots. 3.3. Midday stomatal leaf conductance and midday
    leaf water potential During the irrigation season of 2006 the evolution of midday
    leaf water potential (Ψmin) readings (Fig. 4a) was distinct for trees receiving
    the full irrigation (treatment A) and trees submitted to partial water stress
    (treatments B and C). The larger differential was observed at beginning of September,
    on DOY 233, of around −0.60 and −1.05 MPa respectively, reflecting the effect
    of the lower soil water content of treatments B and C, respectively on leaf water
    status. Treatment A, as expected, was the one presenting the highest Ψmin readings
    throughout the season. The deficit irrigation treatments B and C recorded Ψmin
    values that remained very close to −2 MPa in the first three periods of measurements
    (DOY 137, 172 and 194) and not far from the readings of treatment A. However into
    the summer, they decreased in the fourth day of measurements (DOY 233) when readings
    were the lowest, of −2.85 and −3.3 MPa respectively for treatments B and C. On
    the third day of measurements, DOY 194, even though trees of treatment C were
    being supplied with irrigation water and the volumetric soil water was very close
    to field capacity, of about 0.34 m3 m−3, the recovery of Ψmin was not complete
    and stayed slightly below the readings of treatment B. Download : Download full-size

    chamber in different days of 2006 (a) and 2007 (b). ♢, treatment A; ■, treatment
    B; Δ, treatment C; , treatment D. In 2007 the status of leaf water was at its
    highest level for the different treatments on DOY 149 (Fig. 4b), coincident with
    the period under analysis in which volumetric soil water was at its highest for
    all treatments, except for treatment C. From DOY 149 onward they slowly declined
    for all treatments, as seen in Fig. 4b, due to non favorable summer net radiation
    which up to the fifth day of measurement, at DOY 219, presented high values of
    around 600 W m−2 (Fig. 6), to decline to values close to 500 W m−2 afterward.
    Vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was also high in the period, resulting that both
    variables were important factors influencing the transfer of water into the atmosphere
    and promoting the decline in Ψmin readings. Overall, trees of fully irrigated
    treatment A presented the highest values of Ψmin, closely followed by treatment
    B values. Here, Ψmin values were at their lowest level on DOY 235, of −2.85 MPa.
    As for treatment C, in five of the eight days of measurement Ψmin readings were
    lower than treatment B. Likewise in 2006, on DOY 219 and due to irrigation Ψmin
    readings of treatment C showed slight recovery, but never a complete one, since
    Ψmin remained quite apart from treatments A and B readings. It is conspicuous
    from Fig. 4 that for treatment C as the moisture content declined so did Ψmin,
    with lower and lower values, up to −3.05 MPa in the end of the summer, on DOY
    271. The evolution of Ψmin in 2006 and 2007 showing distinct differences among
    irrigation regimes confirm that the SDI regime of continuous water stress imposed
    by treatment B as more beneficial to trees than the regulated deficit regime of
    treatment C. In the latter, the irrigation scheduling applied to trees deprived
    them of needed water in crucial periods of the growing cycle, depicted by the
    progressive decline in their leaf potential values. Furthermore, with the imposed
    stress their recovery was slow and never fully achieved. For treatment D, Ψmin
    readings quickly decreased from early mid June (−2 MPa) until DOY 235 when Ψmin
    was the lowest, of around −3.2 MPa. Between DOY 235 and DOY 247 there was a slight
    recovery of Ψmin readings with the replenishment of moisture to the soil resulting
    from the 17.5 mm rainfall (data not shown). Midday stomatal leaf conductance (gs)
    was also influenced by the different irrigation regimes (Fig. 5). In 2006 (Fig.
    5a), trees of treatment A presented the lowest levels of gs in the spring, on
    DOY 137, of about 0.079 mol m−2 s−1. In this particular day, the volumetric soil
    water was however high, of 0.35 m3 m−3. The day was cloudy and net radiation at
    solar midday was of 431.2 W m−2 (Fig. 6). On DOY 194, gs again decreased noticeably,
    to 0.085 mol m−2 s−1. With high water content in the soil, the decline in gs suggests
    stomata closure due to the relatively VPD, of around 5.53 kPa (Fig. 6). Connor
    (2005) mentioned decreasing stomatal conductance rates and low leaf water potential
    values reflecting leaf responses to adverse climatic variables and a mechanism
    to maintain transpiration efficiency. In the two last days of measurements (DOY
    233 and DOY 262), gs values increased to value as high as 0.176 mol m−2 s−1. In
    general, trees of treatment B showed a gs trend very similar to the one observed
    for treatment A but with slightly lower values. Concerning treatment C, on the
    first three days in which measurements were carried out (DOY 137 172 and 194),
    gs stayed close to 0.10 mol m−2 s−1. On DOY 194, when trees were being irrigated
    gs values were still low, of about 0.101 mol m2 s−1, consequence of the previous
    days of water stress, and despite the already high soil water content, close to
    field capacity. Trees of treatment C presented on DOY 233 the lowest gs values,
    of around 0.073 mol m−2 s−1 when soil water content was low (0.155 m3 m−3), suggesting
    stomata closure due to the low soil moisture. By the end of the summer, DOY 262,
    the value of gs had increased only slightly. Download : Download full-size image

    on three different dates throughout the irrigation seasons of 2006 and 2007. ▴,
    net radiation; , vapour pressure deficit. The set of gs values obtained in 2007
    (Fig. 5b) shows that leaves of treatment A recorded the largest gs value, 0.251
    mol m−2 s−1, in the spring, on DOY 149. Between DOY 163 and DOY 219, gs values
    had declined to 0.17 mol m−2 s−1. On DOY 235 soil water content had decreased
    quite considerably and through the defensive mechanism stomata closure, gs readings
    of 0.094 mol m−2 s−1 were observed. From that day onward, there was a slight recovery
    in gs values, matching those of treatment B. In spite of the high water content
    in the soil, treatment A had only a partial departure from the observed low gs
    values in the last two days of measurement, when VPD and net radiation declined
    considerably by the end of summer. For treatment B, the highest gs reading was
    observed on DOY 219, of about 0.180 mol m−2 s−1, and the lowest on DOY 235, as
    did observed in the same day for treatment A. Early into spring, on DOY 149, treatment
    C gs readings did present values close to those of treatment D, of about 0.157
    mol m−2 s−1. On DOY 201 the recorded values were close to those of treatment B,
    of 0.114 mol m−2 s−1 due to the added irrigation water, and on DOY 219 they were
    again very low and close to 0.080 mol m−2 s−1. They remained low until the end
    of the summer. The evolution of Ψmin and gs in 2006 and 2007 showing distinct
    differences among irrigation regimes confirm that the SDI regime of a constant
    deficit imposed to treatment B as more beneficial to trees than the regulated
    deficit regime of treatment C. In the latter, the applied irrigation scheduling
    and lack of late summer rainfall in 2007 deprived trees of needed water in crucial
    periods of the growing cycle, depicted by the progressive decline of leaf water
    potential and stomatal closure. Furthermore, with the imposed stress their recovery
    was slow and never fully achieved. Such fact agrees with Fernández et al. (1996)
    observation of delays in olive trees recovery after a period of severe water stress,
    probably due to xylem vessels cavitation. Moriana et al. (2003) also point out
    such delay in leaf water status recovery in olive trees. For treatment D, Ψmin
    readings quickly decreased from early in the spring gs values of treatment D were
    high in the first two days of measurements (0.155 mol m−2 s−1) but declined quickly
    throughout summer (0.062 mol m−2 s−1) due to stomatal closure related to the ever
    decreasing level of moisture in the soil. Both in 2006 and in 2007, Ψmin and gs
    values of dry-farming treatment D were very low throughout summer, confirming
    that soil water profile was deprived of stored water for remobilization by the
    root system to fully complement trees water requirements. The results also corroborate
    the need to irrigate the traditional low-density olive trees in Alentejo, to alleviate
    summer water stress and help boost final yield. 3.4. Olive oil yield and characteristics
    Table 1 indicates that olive yield varied considerably in the two years under
    study due to the effect of the biennial variation of fruit production that is
    a typical characteristic of this species. In 2006 “on year” of high yield, there
    were no significant differences in fruit yield between the irrigated treatments.
    Production varied between 4800.9 and 3741.3 kg ha−1, with the higher and lower
    production rates assigned to between B and A respectively. Treatment C was the
    second most productive, showing a reduction in yield of 769.8 kg ha−1 when compared
    to treatment B. Fruit yield of treatment A, that had received the most water,
    was 1059.6 kg ha−1 less than treatment B. Even in the rain-fed conditions of treatment
    D yield were high, of 2875.0 kg ha−1. In 2007 “off year” of poor harvest, there
    was no significant difference in fruit yield between irrigated and non-irrigated
    treatments. In general, yield suffered a severe decline when compared to 2006,
    of 86.5% and 83.7% for treatments A and B, respectively. Concerning treatments
    C and D, the decline was even more pronounced, of 95.9% and 96.2%, respectively.
    This fact suggests that trees under irrigation regimes that are particularly stressful
    to them, such as in the case of treatments C and D, suffer more drastic yield
    reductions in “off years”. Deficit irrigation programmes such as the “regulated
    deficit irrigation” end up suffering more from a net accumulation of leaves and
    fewer flowers which tend to limit production in the subsequent year (Alegre et
    al., 2002). A similar widespread loss of production such as occurred in 2007 had
    been reported by Serrano (1998). They state that olive trees in “off years” are
    prone to yield drop as low as 90% of obtained in “on years”. Sibbett (2002) discussed
    a range of possible factors that can lead to such phenomena including, among others,
    the level of irrigation and time of harvest. It is worth mentioning that nationally
    year 2007 was allegedly a “off year”, with recorded average drop in olive tree
    yield of around 50% Anonymous (2007), jointly attributed to high temperatures
    that occurred in the ten first days of May, during flowering, immediately followed
    by days of very low and below average temperatures. In 2006 the impact of irrigation
    treatments on olive oil yield per hectare was more evident than on fruit yield
    per hectare. Treatments B and D had the highest and lowest olive oil yield, of
    966.3 and 564 kg ha−1, respectively, in harmony with the results of Muñoz-Cobo
    (2005). Treatments A and C produced slightly higher olive oil yield per hectare
    than treatment D (Table 1). Even though there were no statistical differences
    in yield per hectare among irrigation treatments in 2006, treatment B yield was
    considerably higher than the other treatments. In 2007 it was once again the treatments
    B and D that produced the highest and lowest olive oil yield, again with no significant
    statistical differences among treatments. However, despite of the 2007 evident
    decrease in olive oil production compared to 2006, it is worth noticing that treatment
    B produced the highest olive oil yield per ha on both years while treatment D
    had the lowest yield. The 2006 reduction in fruit quantity between treatments
    B and A was of around 22.0% and, in-between treatments B and C it was around 16.0%,
    causing a reduction of olive oil for the same treatments of 32.5% and 23.9%, respectively.
    Similarly, in 2007 the drop in fruit and olive oil production between treatments
    B and A was of 35.6% and 40.1% respectively, and in-between treatments B and C
    of 78.9% and 78.8%. These results contrast with those obtained by Lavee et al.
    (2007) that in a test carried out in Israel reported average yield drop over a
    period of four consecutive years higher for fruit than for olive oil. Treatment
    B emerges as the one carrying the highest fruit and olive oil yield during the
    two years of trial. Using less 431.3 mm of water in 2006 than treatment A, it
    produced 313.7 kg per ha more olive oil and in 2007, despite the widespread drop
    in yield, it produced again more 79.4 kg of olive oil per ha than treatment A,
    using less 363.3 mm of irrigation water. The percentage of fruit moisture during
    the extraction of the olive oil was higher in treatments receiving the highest
    rates of irrigation water (Table 4). Treatments A and D recorded the highest and
    lowest percentage of pulp moisture on both years under study. Compared to 2006,
    olive fruits from the different irrigation treatments presented a lower percent
    of moisture in 2007, probably due to the smaller amounts of water applied that
    year (Table 1). The difference in fruit moisture levels from treatments A and
    D was 8.8% and 16.5% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Concerning oil acidity, in
    2006 treatment A that received the largest amount of water was the one that had
    the highest level of acidity (Table 2) of 0.77%, very close to the threshold value
    defined by European Regulation EC 1989/03 for extra virgin olive oil (<0.8%).
    All other treatments had lower acidity levels and the olive oil from treatment
    D had the lowest level, with 0.53% of acidity. There were no significant differences
    between treatments C and D, the ones with the lowest levels of acidity and also
    which received the lowest levels of irrigation water. In 2007 the behaviour was
    statistically identical to the 2006 results, with treatment A showing 0.73% of
    acidity, slightly higher than the other treatments. It is worth noticing that
    all treatments, with the exception of treatment A, showed a lower percentage of
    acidity in 2007, suggesting that the lower amount of water applied across all
    treatments (except A), could have been the reason for such a drop. The effects
    of irrigation on the acidity levels in olive oil are consistent with the results
    obtained by Berenguer et al. (2006). They found in a study carried out on cv.
    Arbequina over a 2 years period that olive oil from well-watered trees always
    had a higher percentage of acidity in the following year, despite reductions in
    water applications. Similarly, Muñoz-Cobo (2005) obtained higher levels of acidity
    in olive oil of well-watered olive trees. However, a different point of view is
    presented by Dettori et al. (1989) and Tovar et al. (2002) who conclude that olive
    oil acidity is not influenced by the amount of irrigation. Over the two-year study
    period olive oil from all irrigation treatments presented peroxide values which
    were below the official limit set by law, of 20 meq O2 kg−1. In 2006, peroxide
    count was higher in treatment D followed by treatments A and C. The lowest level
    was obtained for treatment B, as seen in Table 2. In 2007 the peroxide count of
    treatment B was still low, and the highest values were obtained for treatments
    C and D. In general, over the two-year period the highest peroxide counts were
    recorded for olive oils of irrigation treatments C and D subjected to more water
    restrictions. In contrast, Salas et al. (1997) and Tovar et al. (2002) observed
    highest concentration of peroxides in well irrigated treatments, while Berenguer
    et al. (2006) obtained inconclusive results. Patumi et al. (1999) and Gómez-Rico
    et al. (2009) reported no relationship between irrigation water levels and peroxide
    counts. Table 2. Quality index of cv. Cordovil olive oil obtained with the four

    the same letter in the same column are not significantly different by Tukey test
    at P ≤ 0.05. Table 2 presents the UV absorbance values at 270 nm (K270) obtained
    in 2006 and 2007. The highest values in 2006 were obtained in olive oils of treatments
    C and D that received the least amount of water and the lowest levels from well-watered
    trees (treatments A and B). In 2007 the highest values were obtained in olive
    oils from treatment C and no significant differences were observed between the
    others treatments. This observation is in agreement with the observation in Berenguer
    et al. (2006) that in years when all treatments receive less water, as in 2007,
    the statistics differences in the values of K270 between treatments are less marked.
    Tovar et al. (2002) and Gómez-Rico et al. (2009) found also no significant differences
    between irrigation treatments in respect to K270 absorbance levels. Concerning
    the UV absorbance at 232 nm (K232), they were lower in the rain-fed treatment
    D, but presented no significant difference between the irrigated treatments (Table
    2). These results contradict those of Muñoz-Cobo (2005), who obtained the highest
    K232 in olive oils produced in dry conditions. Both K232 and K270 absorbance levels
    for all treatments were however lower than the limits defined by legislation (≤0.22–2.50
    for K270 and K232). In terms of olive oil quality parameters, on both years (2006
    and 2007) they were for all treatments within the limits established in the European
    Regulation EC 1989/03, allowing them to be classified as oils of high quality.
    Treatment B, which we had elected as the most favorable irrigation scheme to maximize
    olive yield, also produced the highest quality of olive oil. Generally known as
    having a slightly bitter and sharp flavor, the olive oils from cv. Cordovil obtained
    in our trial treatments in 2006 and 2007 (Table 3) were slightly bitter (0.5)
    or had no bitterness (0.0), mild, as preferred by Portuguese consumers. As for
    sharpness, they were slightly sharp (1) for the two years of the study. Oils from
    treatments C and D had a fruity flavor of 3, slightly better than treatments A
    and B that scored in level 2. However, the quality and flavor of the olive oils
    were greatly influenced by the ripeness index (RI), an indicator to be taken into
    account when producing oils of specific sensory and chemical characteristics.

    nine points being 1 the lowest quality and 9 exceptional. The RI was only determined
    in 2007 on two different dates (Table 4). The first samples tested in November
    for RI showed no significant differences between treatments C and D. It showed
    that treatment A was maturing at a slower rate than the others and had a significantly
    lower level of RI, of 2.73. With the second sample taken a month latter, in December,
    olive from treatment D had the highest RI of 4.85 and no significant differences
    were observed between the irrigated treatments that had RI values of around 4.
    However, treatments A and B had the lowest rates of ripeness, probably due to
    the type of irrigation they were receiving. Worth pointing out that in-between
    the first and second sampling for ripeness, a rainfall of approximately 30.6 mm
    might have caused fruits of treatments C and D also to ripen at a slower rate
    (Grattan et al., 2006, Motilva et al., 2000). Table 4. Influence of irrigation

    ± 0.809a a Treatments with the same letter in the same column are not significantly
    different by Tukey test at P ≤ 0.05. On a general assessment of the olive oils
    produced in 2006, treatment C oils scored with the highest organoleptic value
    of 8 (Table 3) on a scale of 1–9. However, all oils scored 7.5 points and above.
    In 2007, a year of less water applied to trees, the olive oils from treatments
    B, C and D had the highest organoleptic values of 7.5 and treatment A that received
    the most water, scored only 7. In general, all samples scored above 6.5 which
    according to European Regulation EC 1989/03 classify them as olive oils of superior
    quality and therefore “extra virgin”. 3.5. Water productivity Ranking the irrigated
    treatments in terms of oil yield per unit water, treatment C, despite the concentration
    of irrigation only in critical phases of growing cycle, had high water use efficiency
    in 2006, of 11.8 kg of oil per mm of applied water (Table 1). Treatment B was
    the second most productive, with 2.2 kg of oil per mm of water applied. The least
    productive treatment was treatment A which shows a clear decline in yield with
    the amount of water applied. In 2007, an “off year” of drastic reduction in yield,
    treatment B was the most productive with 0.42 kg of oil per mm of water applied,
    followed by treatment C. Treatment A trailed behind with 0.12 kg of oil per mm
    of applied water. It seems that in years of sharp reduction of water availability
    for irrigation, as in 2007, treatment B is the best option for scheduling irrigation
    of olive trees of cv. Cordovil in southern Portugal. Table 5 shows that during
    the period in which sap sensors were installed, the fraction of water applied
    to the soil both in terms of irrigation and rainfall that contributed to the production
    of biomass was different among the irrigation treatments. Trees of treatment A
    made the least use of applied water and had water productivity between 62.8% and
    91.4% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2006 about 37.2% of the water applied
    had been lost through evaporation or drainage and, in 2007 it was of 8.6% as the
    water applied had been reduced by 37.9% compared to 2006. Contrastingly, in 2007
    trees of treatment B in addition of the water supplied by rainfall and irrigation,
    during the period of installation of sap flow sensors they also were able to harvest
    stored water from previous rainfall to provide for tree transpiration. Table 5.

    sensors were installed in March 22. b Water fraction (rainfall and irrigation)
    applied to the soil during the period from installation of sap flow sensors in
    trees: 2007, from March 29 to September 29. Total rainfall in 2006 was 521.8 and
    333.7 mm in 2007. 4. Conclusion Results show that trees responded differently
    to summer rainfall and irrigation water. The sustained, SDI and regulated deficit
    irrigation, RDI scheduling regimes applied to treatments B and C respectively
    led to reduced applications of irrigation water and higher yield. However, over
    the two-year period the sustained deficit irrigation regime proved to be the most
    favorable irrigation strategy for use in the “on” and “off” years of olive oil
    production, leading to appreciable water resource savings and yields. Full irrigation
    of olive trees as assigned to treatment A led to waste of irrigation water, as
    olive trees from beginning of pit hardening until mid September slow down their
    vegetative growth and use less water despite of the amount applied. Results also
    support the hypothesis that irrigation of low-density olive orchards is needed
    as it increases yields and the amount of olive extracted oil. They also confirm
    that irrigation treatments has no influence on the commercial value of produced
    oils, being all of superior quality and classified as “extra virgin”. Being the
    cultivar Cordovil highly appreciated for its high fruit free fatty acid and the
    fine sensory properties of its extracted oil, responsible for the seal of quality
    “Protected Designation of Origin (PDO)” conferred to the region, such findings
    are of vital importance to farmers for they allow them freedom to tackle the re-structuring
    and irrigation of their traditional low-density orchards confident of higher yields
    and fearless of losing quality and the PDO entitlement. Acknowledgements This

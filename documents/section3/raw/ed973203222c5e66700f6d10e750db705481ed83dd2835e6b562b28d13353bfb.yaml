    \ technology. The proposed agricultural \nenvironment monitoring server system\
    \ collects environmental and soil information on the \noutdoors through WSN-based\

    \ of the agricultural \nenvironment monitoring server system, and provides it\
    \ to producers. In addition, a solar \ncell-based power supply is implemented\
    \ for the server system so that it could be used in \nagricultural environments\
    \ with insufficient power infrastructure. This agricultural \nenvironment monitoring\
    \ server system could even monitor the environmental information on \nthe outdoors\

    \ in information communication technology have been accelerating the \nconvergence\
    \ between different industries [1,2]. The convergence and integration of IT with\
    \ \nagricultural technology is expected to be an area that could increase the\
    \ added value and productivity \nof agriculture by applying the ubiquitous technology\
    \ to the agricultural sector which is a primary \nindustry [3,4].  \nTo successfully\
    \ construct such a u-agricultural environment, the development of essential \n\
    ubiquitous technology optimized for agriculture such as sensor hardware, middleware\
    \ platforms, \nrouting protocols and application services for agricultural environments\
    \ is needed.  \nExamples of the convergence of ubiquitous technology with agriculture,\
    \ which is a primary \nindustry, on a trial basis exist, such as the use of sensor\
    \ nodes in vine culture sites and applications of \nubiquitous technology in livestock\
    \ farming sites, and the technology has gradually begun to appear in \nother small\
    \ areas like the increase of production and the improvement of quality at various\
    \ agricultural \nsites [5-9]. \nAn agricultural environment monitoring system\
    \ provides environmental monitoring services and \nfacility controlling services,\
    \ and thus maintains the crop growing environment in an optimal status. \nThis\
    \ system also improves the convenience and productivity of users. However, existing\
    \ agricultural \nmonitoring systems are mostly applied and utilized in closed\
    \ agricultural environments such as \ngreenhouses, cattle sheds, etc., as it is\
    \ difficult to apply agricultural monitoring systems in outdoors \nlocations such\
    \ as paddies, fields, orchards, etc. because of a lack of IT infrastructure. In\
    \ addition, when \nusers want to verify the monitored information in existing\
    \ monitoring systems, the user must manually \ncheck the status through installed\
    \ sensors or terminals installed in the agriculture facilities. \nIn order to\
    \ solve these problems, it is necessary to develop an agricultural environment\
    \ monitoring \nsystem that can monitor environmental information and soil information\
    \ in remote location and can be \nused in agricultural environments which lack\
    \ infrastructure. This paper proposes an agricultural \nenvironment monitoring\
    \ server system to monitor information on the outdoors by utilizing WSN \n(wireless\
    \ sensor network) technology, which is one of such ubiquitous technologies.  \n\
    If the proposed agricultural environment monitoring server system is applied to\
    \ an agricultural \nenvironment, environmental and soil information could be monitored\
    \ even at a remote site, and it is \nexpected that this would contribute to increased\
    \ crop yields and the improvement of quality in the \nagricultural field by supporting\
    \ producers’ decision making about crop production through the analysis \non the\
    \ collected information. \nThe agricultural environment monitoring server system\
    \ proposed in this paper collects \nenvironmental information such as luminance,\
    \ temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, EC, \npH, CO2 etc. which\
    \ affect growth of crops and soil information through the WSN environmental \n\
    sensors and soil sensors installed outdoors, collects image information on the\
    \ outdoors and location \ninformation on the position where the server system\
    \ is installed through CCTVs and GPS modules, \nand the information is converted\
    \ into a database through the agricultural environment monitoring \nserver to\
    \ provide suitable information to producers through to a variety of services.\
    \ In addition, the \nserver system is set up to use power supplied through solar\
    \ cells so that it could be used in agricultural \nenvironments with insufficient\
    \ power infrastructure.  \nSensors 2010, 10 \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \  \n \n \n11191 \nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes related\
    \ research, Section 3 introduces the \nstructure and components of the system\
    \ proposed in this paper and the services provided by the system, \nSection 4\
    \ describes in detail the functions of the system, construction methods for each\
    \ module, \nperformance measurements for each module, implementation and performance\
    \ measurements of the \nfinal system, and Section 5 presents our conclusions.\
    \ \n2. Related Research \n2.1. Environmental Monitoring \nWSNs have become an\
    \ important tool in environmental monitoring. The relatively low cost of the \n\
    devices allows the installation of a dense population of nodes that can adequately\
    \ represent the \nvariability present in the environment. They can provide risk\
    \ assessment information, like for example \nalerting farmers at the onset of\
    \ frost damage and providing better microclimate awareness. \nJohnson and Margalho\
    \ monitored the agroclimate in the Amazon, analyzing short range WSN \ntransmissions.\
    \ They found that more distant nodes suffered a performance loss, while nodes\
    \ closer to \nthe sink maintained their throughput levels.  \nAnother example\
    \ of climate supervision is flood prediction by means of wireless sensors which\
    \ can \ndetect rainfall, water levels and weather conditions. The sensors supply\
    \ information to a centralized \ndatabase system [10]. Pierce and Elliot extended\
    \ the implementation to a regional and on-farm sensor \nnetwork operating at 900\
    \ MHz that provides remote, real-time monitoring and control of farming \noperations\
    \ in two agricultural applications, a weather monitoring network and an on-farm\
    \ frost \nmonitoring network [11]. \nAyday and Safak presented a moisture distribution\
    \ map obtained through the integration of a WSN \nwith a GIS (Geographic Information\
    \ System). The wireless nodes with moisture sensors were located \nat predetermined\
    \ locations; geographic coordinates of these points were obtained with GPS and\
    \ then, \nall the information was evaluated using the GIS [12]. \nHan et al. developed\
    \ a wireless data transmission system using wireless ZigBee motes, developed to\
    \ \nremotely monitor in real time sediment runoff at a low-water crossings. The\
    \ gateway transmitted the \nsensor signals to an Internet server using the GPRS\
    \ [13].  \nHamrita and Hoffacker developed a lab prototype for wireless measurement\
    \ of soil temperatures. \nThe system was based on a commercial 13.56 MHz RFID\
    \ tag. Measurements showed a high \ncorrelation (greater than 99%) with those\
    \ obtained using a thermocouple [14]. \n2.2. Precision Agriculture \nThe development\
    \ of WSN applications in precision agriculture makes it possible to increase \n\
    efficiencies, productivity and profitability in many agricultural production systems,\
    \ while minimizing \nunintended impacts on wildlife and the environment. The real\
    \ time information obtained from the \nfields can provide a solid base for farmers\
    \ to adjust strategies at any time. Instead of making decisions \nbased in some\
    \ hypothetical average condition, which may not exist anywhere in reality, a precision\
    \ \nfarming approach recognizes differences and adjusts management actions accordingly\
    \ [15]. \nSensors 2010, 10 \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n11192 \n\
    Baggio deployed a WSN for fighting phytophtora in a potato field. Phytophtora\
    \ is a fungal disease \nwhich depends on the climatological conditions. 868/916\
    \ MHz motes were used for measuring \nhumidity and temperature. The aim of the\
    \ system was to reveal when the crop was at risk and let the \nfarmer treat the\
    \ plants only when really needed [16]. \n2.3. Viticulture \nPlant monitoring,\
    \ also called phytomonitoring, is easier using WSNs. For example, with the help\
    \ of \na WSN the owner of vineyard can manage the operation of the vineyard more\
    \ efficiently and \nautomatically. Burrell et al. have described a variety of\
    \ sensor network configurations and applications \nthat can address different\
    \ priorities in the vineyard [17]. Beckwith et al. implemented a WSN in a \nvineyard\
    \ consisting of 65,916 MHz motes. Temperature measurements were collected during\
    \ one \nmonth. The information was used for addressing two important parameters\
    \ in wine production: heat \naccumulation and potential frost damage [18]. \n\
    Morais et al. have shown the feasibility of a ZigBee based remote sensing network,\
    \ intended for \nprecision viticulture. The network nodes were powered by batteries\
    \ that are recharged with energy \nharvested from the environment [19]. \n2.4.\
    \ Greenhouses \nAutomation and efficiency are crucial in greenhouse environment\
    \ monitoring and control. In order \nto control and monitor the environmental\
    \ factors, sensors and actuators are essential. Greenhouse crops \ncan benefit\
    \ a lot from the use of WSNs, because inside the greenhouse the crop conditions\
    \ such as \nclimate and soil do not depend on exterior factors and the implementations\
    \ are thus easier than in \noutdoor applications. \nThe first application of WSN\
    \ in a greenhouse was reported in the year 2003. It was a monitoring \nand control\
    \ system developed by means of Bluetooth [20]. Since then, several applications\
    \ have been \ndeveloped, most of them making use of IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee. For\
    \ example, Gonda and Cugnasca \npresented a proposal of a distributed greenhouse\
    \ control and monitoring system using ZigBee [21]. \nYoo et al. described the\
    \ results of real deployment of a WSN IEEE 802.15.4 compliant system to \nmonitor\
    \ and control the environment in greenhouses where melons and cabbages were being\
    \  \ngrown [22]. Lea-Cox et al. developed a WSN in a greenhouse, that integrates\
    \ a variety of sensors \nwhich can measure substrate water, temperature, electrical\
    \ conductivity, daily photosynthetic radiation \nand leaf wetness in real-time.\
    \ Benefits came from an improved plant growth, more efficient water and \nfertilizer\
    \ applications, together with a reduction in disease problems related to over-watering\
    \ [23]. \nLiu et al. reported a WSN prototype with a two-part framework for greenhouses.\
    \ In the first part, \nseveral sensor nodes were used to measure temperature,\
    \ light and soil moisture. The other part consists \nof a GSM module and the management\
    \ software based on a database running on the remote PC [24]. \nZhou et al. designed\
    \ a monitoring system based on ZigBee, using a star network topology inside the\
    \ \ngreenhouse and a mesh topology for the connection between the greenhouses\
    \ and the management \nsystem [25]. Yang et al. reported a multi-functional remote\
    \ sensing system that integrates RFID \ntechnology with spectral imaging and environmental\
    \ sensing in a greenhouse. The multi-spectral \nSensors 2010, 10 \n \n \n  \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n11193 \nimaging system was used for remote sensing\
    \ of the canopy of cabbage seedlings. Greenhouse \ntemperature, relative humidity,\
    \ and lighting conditions were measured above the crop [26]. \n3. System Architecture\
    \ and Service Process \nThe agricultural environment monitoring server system\
    \ proposed in this paper collects \nenvironmental information such as luminance,\
    \ temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, EC, \npH, CO2 etc. which\
    \ affect growth of crops and soil information through the WSN environmental \n\
    sensors and soil sensors installed at the outdoors, and collects image information\
    \ on the outdoors and \nlocation information on the position where the server\
    \ system is installed through CCTVs and GPS \nmodules. The information collected\
    \ in real time like this is converted into a database through the \nagricultural\
    \ environment monitoring server, which provides suitable information to producers\
    \ \naccording to a variety of services. This section describes the structure and\
    \ components of the proposed \nsystem and services provided by the system. \n\
    3.1. System Architecture \nExisting web-based monitoring systems such as WAGRIT\
    \ have a structure that separates data \nacquisition devices and the web server.\
    \ However, the proposed agricultural environment monitoring \nserver system has\
    \ a structure that integrates the WSN sensors, CCTVs, GPS modules, database server,\
    \ \nweb server, DVR server, etc. to collect environmental information on the outdoors\
    \ and image \ninformation into a device for collecting various pieces of information\
    \ on the outdoors environment, \nand provides real-time monitoring and various\
    \ application services based on this information. \nAs shown in Figure 1, the\
    \ proposed system is composed of a physical layer, which consists of WSN \nsensors,\
    \ CCTV, GPS, solar cells etc. to collect information on the outdoors environment,\
    \ a middle \nlayer, which supports communications between the physical layer and\
    \ the application layer and \nconverts the outdoors information collected from\
    \ the physical layer into a database to provide data \nrequested from the application\
    \ layer, and an application layer, which is equipped with interfaces to \nsupport\
    \ various services for producers.  \nThe WSN sensors are composed of environmental\
    \ sensors to collect environmental information \nincluding luminance, humidity,\
    \ temperature etc. and soil sensors to collect soil information including \ntemperature,\
    \ EC, soil pH, etc. After they are distributed outdoors and every sensor node\
    \ forms an \nautonomous network, they send physical information acquired from\
    \ sensor nodes to the server system \nby wireless.  \nThe CCTV system collects\
    \ image information on the outdoors in real time to provide outdoor \nimages to\
    \ user, and the GPS module collects location information on the installed server\
    \ system and \nthe collected outdoors information.  \nThe solar cell supplies\
    \ power for the server system installed outdoors, and the system is therefore\
    \ \napplicable in an agricultural environment with insufficient power infrastructure\
    \ because can operate \neven if no external power is supplied to the server system.\

    The sensor manager manages data acquisition from the soil and environmental sensors,\
    \ extracts the \nsoil and environmental data by processing the collected data\
    \ packets into a format which could be \nstored in the database, and stores it\
    \ in the database or sends it to other server systems for processing by \nconverting\
    \ the processed data into the format suitable for the measurement elements.  \n\
    In addition, the expandability and convenience of the server system is improved\
    \ by enabling it to \nselect the sensors to be used and the database in which\
    \ the data is to be stored through a simple menu \nin order to integrate and manage\
    \ different kinds of sensors. \nThe GPS manager extracts location data coming\
    \ in through serial communication from the GPS \nmodule to store it in the database,\
    \ extracts the latitudes and longitudes from the received data using the \n&GPRMC\
    \ format of NMEA 0183, and stores them in the database through an 'Insert' query\
    \ statement \nafter converting them appropriately for each unit.  \nThe image\
    \ information manager provides images taken from CCTVs to the Web as streaming\
    \ data \nand stores them in the database.  \nThe database stores environmental\
    \ and soil data, image data, location information data and \nenvironmental reference\
    \ values for notifying conditions into each table, and creates average statistical\
    \ \ninformation by using the collected information.  \nThe web server provides\
    \ an environment that users could monitor data processed by the \ncomponents and\
    \ environment of the outdoors through a Web browser anywhere and at any time.\

    3.2. System Services \n3.2.1. Environmental Monitoring Service \nThe environmental\
    \ monitoring service is a service to store in the database environmental and soil\
    \ \ninformation collected from the WSN sensors installed on the outdoors, and\
    \ allow users to monitor \nenvironmental information about the planted crops via\
    \ the Web server anywhere in real time.  \nLooking at the detailed operation of\
    \ this service, the WSN sensors installed in the outdoors collect \nenvironmental\
    \ and soil information and periodically sent the sensing data to the sensor manager,\
    \ then \nthe sensor manager parses and analyzes the received sensing data to extract\
    \ each sensing value and \nconvert its format to store it into each table of the\
    \ database.  \nThe web server fetches environmental and soil information on the\
    \ outdoors stored in the database to \nsend it to a GUI at regular intervals,\
    \ and users can monitor the outdoors environment information on \nvia the GUI.\
    \ Figure 2 shows the operating process of the environment monitoring service.\
    \ \nFigure 2. Operation Process of the Environment Monitoring Service. \n \n3.2.2.\
    \ Image Monitoring Service \nThe image monitoring service is a service to provide\
    \ image information on the outdoors to users \nthrough the CCTV installed on the\
    \ server system. The CCTV sends the collected images on the \noutdoors to the\
    \ image information manager, and the image information manager provides the received\
    \ \nimages to a GUI by means of real-time streaming service via a DVR server and\
    \ classifies the streamed \ndata to store it in the database. In addition, when\
    \ users request image data stored in the database \nthrough the GUI, it would\
    \ be provided to them. Figure 3 shows the operating process of the image \nmonitoring\
    \ service. \n \n \nSensors 2010, 10 \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n\
    11196 \nFigure 3. Operation Process of the Image Monitoring Service. \n \n3.2.3.\
    \ Location Monitoring Service \nThe location monitoring service is a service to\
    \ provide location information on the server system \nand location information\
    \ on the current monitoring place through the GPS module. The provision of \n\
    location information is important because remote sites check for such information.\
    \ The location \nmonitoring service extracts latitude and longitude data from\
    \ the location data received via the GPS \nmodule by the location information\
    \ manager, and stores it into the database. Then, the Web server \nrequests latitude\
    \ and longitude data stored in the database to be sent it, and displays the location\
    \ of the \nserver system on a map based on the latitude and longitude data received\
    \ through the GUI. Figure 4 \nshows the operating process of the location monitoring\
    \ service. \nFigure 4. Operation Process of the Location Monitoring Service. \n\
    \ \nSensors 2010, 10 \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n11197 \n3.2.4.\
    \ Condition Notification Service \nThe condition notification service is a service\
    \ to prevent dangerous conditions beforehand by \nnotifying users in real time\
    \ about changes in the outdoors environment and taking some measure. \nFigure\
    \ 5 shows the operating process of the condition notification service.  \nFigure\
    \ 5. Operation Process of the Condition Notification Service. \n \nThe data sensed\
    \ by the environmental sensors is sent to the sensor manager. The sensor manager\
    \ \nextracts sensing values from the received data to store them into the database.\
    \ The Web server \nmonitors the stored sensing values periodically to notify users\
    \ that an event is ocurred if they are over \nor below some set reference value.\
    \  \n3.2.5. Average Statistics Service \nThe average statistics service is a service\
    \ to show users the sensing information incoming through \nenvironmental and soil\
    \ sensors as a graphic form by compiling statistics into some constant units in\
    \ \norder to understand the environmental properties of the planted crops. Crop\
    \ production could be \nincreased by better understanding the environmental properties\
    \ of plantations and selecting crops \nsuitable to the environment through this\
    \ service. \n4. Implementation and Results \nTo verify the agricultural environment\
    \ monitoring server system proposed in this paper, a prototype \nwas manufactured,\
    \ installed in the real outdoors, and the system was tested. Even though the initial\
    \ \nprototype version 1 could monitor all the outdoors environmental data such\
    \ as soil information, \nenvironmental information, image information, location\
    \ information acquiring from sensors and other \nSensors 2010, 10 \n \n \n  \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n11198 \nphysical devices through the GUI, it could\
    \ not be used normally because the power consumed by the \nserver was significantly\
    \ larger than the power generated by the solar cells so there was a problem that\
    \ \nmaking the effective use time short. In order to solve such a problem, the\
    \ prototype version 2 includes \na low-power system with embedded board modules,\
    \ and incorporates a compact web server and \ndatabase using built using Window\
    \ CE-based mobile programming, so the power supply problem \ncould be solved,\
    \ and the outdoors environment could be monitored effectively. \n4.1. System Configuration\
    \ of Prototype Version 1 \nThe initially manufactured prototype version 1 of the\
    \ agricultural environment monitoring server \nsystem is shown in Figure 6, and\
    \ comprised soil sensors, environmental sensors, CCTV, and GPS \nmodule to collect\
    \ information on the outdoors environment and image information, solar cells to\
    \ \nsupply power for the server system, and a server to process and store the\
    \ collected information. \nFigure 6. Prototype Version 1 of the Agricultural Environment\
    \ Monitoring Server System. \n \nThe soil sensors collect information on soil\
    \ temperature and soil moisture in the outdoors \nenvironment, and Figure 7 and\

    \ of the heat the sensor receives \nfrom the node, the node and the sensor are\
    \ kept at a certain distance from each other. The MSP430 is  \na 16 bit RISC with\

    \ outdoors to store in the database or to send the data to some other server system,\
    \ \nand the implemented sensor manager parses the raw data collected from environmental\
    \ and soil \nsensors into the required unit, as shown in Figure 14. \nFigure 14.\

    \ Web GUI for Agricultural Environment Monitoring Server System. \n \n \nFrom\
    \ the implementation results described above, it could be seen that outdoors environmental\
    \ \ninformation and image information could be collected through sensors and image\
    \ surveillance cameras, \nand the outdoors environment could be always monitored\
    \ through a user-intuitive GUI. \n4.4. Field Test Results \nTo implement the design\
    \ of the system proposed in this paper and evaluate its performance, the \nagricultural\
    \ environment monitoring server system was installed at a real outdoor location\
    \ to monitor \nthe environment.  \nFigure 19 is a graph that represents environmental\
    \ data measured by the proposed agricultural \nenvironment monitoring server system\
    \ that is installed to be operational in the real agricultural \nenvironment,\
    \ and it could be seen from this graph that the agricultural environment monitoring\
    \ server \nsystem normally processes information sensed from WSN sensor nodes\
    \ installed outdoors without \nmalfunction. \nIn addition, according to the power\
    \ consumption field tests, the agricultural environment monitoring \nserver system\
    \ could be operated for about 24 hours by charging with the solar cells for about\
    \ 10 hours, \nand the proposed system could be operated with only the solar cells\
    \ installed on the system, without \nrequiring a wired power supply connection\
    \ or any additional charging process. Figure 20 is a graph \nthat represents the\
    \ results of the power consumption field test of the proposed system. Through\
    \ the \nabove results, it could be found that the proposed agricultural environment\
    \ monitoring server system \ncollects information even in the a real outdoors\
    \ environment without malfunction and provides  \nreal-time monitoring and various\
    \ application services based on the information.  \nSensors 2010, 10 \n \n \n\

    \ paper proposed an agricultural environment monitoring server system that integrates\
    \ \nenvironmental and soil sensors, GPS module, CCTV etc. into a device to collect\
    \ information for \nmonitoring the environment at crop plantations, and provides\
    \ real-time environmental monitoring and \nvarious application services based\
    \ on the information. The proposed agricultural environment \nmonitoring server\
    \ system could work without supplying any external power in an agricultural \n\
    environment with insufficient power infrastructure by using a solar cell module\
    \ as its power supply.  \nAlthough a prototype of the agricultural environment\
    \ monitoring server system was manufactured \nto monitor the outdoors environment\
    \ for implementation of the designed system and performance \nevaluation, and\
    \ the initial prototype version 1 could monitor the outdoors environment, however,\
    \ it \ncould not be used as planned because the power consumed by the server was\
    \ significantly larger than \nthe power generated in the solar cell module so\
    \ that use time was short. In order to solve this problem, \nin prototype version\
    \ 2 the server was rebuilt to implement the system with low power embedded board\
    \ \nmodules, and it was found that this version operated normally through the\
    \ field tests.  \nIf the agricultural environment monitoring server system proposed\
    \ in this paper is applied to the \nagricultural environment, environmental information\
    \ could be monitored even at a remote site, and it is \nexpected that it would\
    \ contribute to an increase in crop yields and the improvement of quality in the\
    \ \nagricultural field by supporting the decision making of producers through\
    \ the analysis of the collected \ninformation. Future study is scheduled to miniaturize\
    \ the current system, and improve the current \nmulti-server communication with\
    \ socket communications to provide a structure in which \ncommunication is possible\
    \ even in regions where the Internet is not connected. \n \nAcknowledgements \n\

    Get rights and content Highlights • Impact of catchment scale activities on water
    quality (WQ) degradation. • WSN suitable for real time and high resolution WQ
    monitoring with some limitations. • Absence of catchment monitoring, use of off-the-shelf
    components and proxy sensors. • Integrate WSN-controlled catchment activities
    for collaborative WQ management. • Collaborative WSNs to share information about
    critical events in a catchment. Abstract The challenge of improving water quality
    is a growing global concern, typified by the European Commission Water Framework
    Directive and the United States Clean Water Act. The main drivers of poor water
    quality are economics, poor water management, agricultural practices and urban
    development. This paper reviews the extensive role of non-point sources, in particular
    the outdated agricultural practices, with respect to nutrient and contaminant
    contributions. Water quality monitoring (WQM) is currently undertaken through
    a number of data acquisition methods from grab sampling to satellite based remote
    sensing of water bodies. Based on the surveyed sampling methods and their numerous
    limitations, it is proposed that wireless sensor networks (WSNs), despite their
    own limitations, are still very attractive and effective for real-time spatio-temporal
    data collection for WQM applications. WSNs have been employed for WQM of surface
    and ground water and catchments, and have been fundamental in advancing the knowledge
    of contaminants trends through their high resolution observations. However, these
    applications have yet to explore the implementation and impact of this technology
    for management and control decisions, to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder’s
    contributions, in an autonomous and dynamic manner. Here, the potential of WSN-controlled
    agricultural activities and different environmental compartments for integrated
    water quality management is presented and limitations of WSN in agriculture and
    WQM are identified. Finally, a case for collaborative networks at catchment scale
    is proposed for enabling cooperation among individually networked activities/stakeholders
    (farming activities, water bodies) for integrated water quality monitoring, control
    and management. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Wireless

    1. Introduction Water is a key natural resource which is vital for the survival
    of all ecosystems on the planet. However, less than 1% of the earth’s water resources
    are accessible to humans as fresh water, in the form of either surface or ground
    water (Krchnak et al., 2002, UNESCO, 2006). Although there is currently sufficient
    water for essential activities (Blanco et al., 2009) including drinking, irrigation,
    and domestic and industrial use on a global scale, the spatial distribution of
    water suggests that, in many cases, it is not available where it is required.
    Because of the unequal distribution of fresh water resources, billions of people
    around the globe live in water-stressed and water-limited environments. Therefore
    it is crucial to preserve water resources although in practice it is continually
    degraded and depleted owing to inappropriately targeted funding initiatives leading
    to poor water management, redundant and outdated agricultural practices and urban
    development (Rosegrant et al., 2002, Verhoeven et al., 2006). The key issues relating
    to global freshwater quality problems in the environment and public health are
    summarised as (FAO, 1996): (1) Non-economic cost of drinking water treatment.
    (2) Millions of annual deaths resulting from water-borne diseases. (3) Ecosystem
    dysfunction and loss of biodiversity. (4) Contamination of marine ecosystems.
    (5) Contamination of groundwater resources. (6) Depletion of usable water resources.
    (7) Deterioration of recreational activities. Problems associated with water quality
    are commonly attributed to nutrient, chemical and pathogen loadings into an aquatic
    system as a result of point source and non-point source activities (EPA, 2009).
    Discharges from point sources are identifiable and come from a single source.
    Examples include contaminants from sewage plant pipes or industries. On the other
    hand non-point source fluxes may come from diffused sources/activities with no
    direct source of entry (FAO, 1996). Examples mainly include agricultural and animal
    farming or peri-urban activities. A diagrammatic representation of major activities
    responsible for the degradation of water on a catchment scale owing to point and
    non-point sources is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    1. Water contamination activities in a catchment. While some regulations have
    been put in place by water quality control organizations in various countries
    to control toxic and chemical loadings from point source as well as non-point
    source (Borja et al., 2004, Pollard and Huxham, 1998), they have not been as effective
    for diffuse non-point sources as for point sources (Heimlich, 2003). In order
    to prevent and reduce water pollution in the US, the use of best management practices
    (BMPs) has been proposed by the EPA (Environment Protection Agency) for controlling
    and managing agricultural practices (UNEP, 1998). However, their effectiveness
    needs to be assessed using sufficient quantities of long term data. Therefore,
    it is established that monitoring nutrient and contaminant contributions by the
    various responsible factors, at key points in a catchment, is vital in assessing
    and preventing degradation of water quality, as well as informing future regulations
    (Coles et al., 2009, Hunter and Walton, 2008). In this paper, we review the impacts
    that different stakeholders have on water resources, and explore how a single
    stakeholder can have unintended impacts on others in a catchment. Various data
    acquisition methods from grab samples to satellite images, have been used to estimate
    and model relationships of land use and water quality degradation in a catchment
    (Glasgow et al., 2004, Shrestha et al., 2008, Bolstad and Swank, 1997, Tong and
    Chen, 2002, Lemos et al., 2007). These sampling methods are further reviewed and
    evaluated in this paper. WSNs have been employed for water quality monitoring
    of surface water (rivers, lakes, and dams), ground water, soil–water and catchments.
    Water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, salinity
    and nitrates have been measured. Preliminary results have been fundamental in
    advancing the knowledge of contaminants trends, although they were based on spatially
    constrained observations. Most of these were small scale prototype deployments
    and were mainly aimed at developing and testing the technology for remote, continuous
    and real-time data availability. However, these applications have yet to explore
    the implementation and impact of this technology for management and control decisions,
    in order to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder’s contributions, in an
    autonomous and dynamic manner. This requires an integration of responsible activities
    into an autonomous water quality monitoring and management mechanism. Therefore,
    the potential for including existing WSN-controlled agricultural activities and
    water bodies, for integrated water quality management, is presented in this review.
    Later, research challenges in the existing applications of WSNs in this area are
    identified which, if addressed, would enable possible extension of the existing
    techniques to an integrated monitoring program. It is argued in this paper that
    it is not feasible to have a single monitoring system covering the entire catchment
    as individual stakeholder’s monitoring requirements vary as they undertake different
    activities. However, this enables a case for collaborative networks in a catchment
    to be proposed for enabling cooperation among individually networked activities/stakeholders
    (farming activities, water bodies) for managing water quality. The structure of
    this paper is as follows. In Section 2, the role of agricultural activities on
    water quality degradation in a catchment is discussed. Section 3 discusses existing
    data acquisition methods for WQM, and discuss their limitations, and Section 4
    investigates the ability of WSNs for water quality monitoring and management in
    a catchment. Section 5 discusses the unresolved research challenges that prevent
    wide adoption of WSNs for monitoring agricultural and water quality parameters
    and achieving water quality management in a catchment. Finally, Section 6 presents
    a case for integrated water quality management using collaboration among individually
    networked activities in a catchment, while Section 7 draws conclusions. 2. Role
    of agricultural activities on water quality degradation and ecosystem dysfunction
    in a catchment Surface and ground water contamination in a catchment is mainly
    attributed to outdated farm management practices. These include excessive use
    of fertilizers for high product yields, traditional irrigation practices, use
    of pesticides and herbicides and poorly managed animal farming operations (Moss,
    2008, EPA, 2009). Other sources include fracking, deforestation, atmospheric deposits
    by rainfall and untreated sewage waste. However, this paper focuses on the impact
    of farm management practices on water quality degradation. These practices may
    result in nutrient, chemical, pathogen and sediment fluxes with main nutrient
    issues being due to excess phosphorous and nitrogen losses (Carpenter et al.,
    1998, Hunter and Walton, 2008). 1 lists the impacts of catchment scale activities
    on the quality of surface and ground water resources. For a related representation

    fertilizer application Fertilizers rich in phosphorous, potassium and nitrogen
    are added to soil to increase crop yields. However, agronomic nutrient recommendations
    are often far in excess of environmental levels (Mueller et al., 1996). Therefore,
    application of nutrients contained in manures and artificial fertilizers often
    remain in the soil or are leached into the drainage water (Vanlauwe et al., 2001,
    McKergow et al., 2003). Enrichment of water because of nutrients, termed as eutrophication
    (Nixon, 1995), can give rise to toxic algal blooms which contaminates drinking
    water and harms aquatic life (Smith and Schindler, 2009, Min and Jiao, 2002).
    This acknowledges the need for a mechanism to monitor and assess nutrient inputs
    to crops, its uptake by crops and losses through runoffs and leaching from farms.
    2.2. Poor water management Irrigation techniques such as surface flooding, localised
    drip and subsurface irrigation might be efficient in some ways but they can lead
    to various problems. Under-irrigation, in the case of drip irrigation, can lead
    to salt buildup on the soil surface and can damage crops. Over-irrigation, in
    the case of surface irrigation, may not only trigger nutrient/chemical runoff,
    but can also cause perched water tables resulting in soil salinity problems (McKergow
    et al., 2003). Furthermore due to scarce water resources, low quality water is
    being increasingly used for irrigation, which is rich in nutrients and salts (Pereira
    et al., 2002). This increases the risk of salt accumulation in the root zone and
    consequent long term damage to crop production and soil fertility (Pitman and
    Läuchli, 2004, Tedeschi and Dell’Aquila, 2005). This acknowledges the need for
    an intelligent water management methodology to avoid wastage of water and allow
    its reutilisation. 2.3. Inadequately managed animal farming operations Manure
    run-off due to rainfall or poorly managed animal farming operations may carry
    pathogens like bacteria and viruses to water bodies, affecting water quality for
    both aquatic life and humans (Lipp et al., 2001, Ferguson et al., 2003). Pathogenic
    micro-organisms are responsible for causing infectious diseases in humans and,
    are a major cause of decline and destruction of coral reefs worldwide (Bellwood
    et al., 2004, EPA, 2012). In order to maintain and improve animal health within
    animal feeding operations (AFOs) facilities and to prevent any pathogen and chemical
    fluxes through fecal discharges from them, it is very important to continuously
    monitor and control the local environment. 2.4. Use of pesticides and herbicides
    Pesticide and herbicide applications on crops contribute to chemical deposits
    in soil, which are carried through runoff and leaching into rivers, lakes and
    groundwater (Cerejeira et al., 2003, Guzzella et al., 2006). Antibiotics are fed
    to livestock as growth enhancers, and manure containing these pharmaceuticals
    is spread on land, from where it leaches into ground water and reservoirs (Daughton,
    2004, Reynolds, 2003). This validates a need for: (i) monitoring microclimate
    of crops to prevent onset of moulds and other diseases, and (ii) a mechanism to
    control chemical laden water into or out of a farm preventing contamination of
    its own or other’s farm or water bodies. 3. Existing water quality data acquisition
    methods This chapter focuses on the major sampling methods which have been used
    to acquire water quality data to assess surface (rivers, lakes, dams) and ground
    water (reservoirs, aquifers) bodies. Also, this information has been used to model
    the relationship between land use and water quality degradation in a catchment
    (Glasgow et al., 2004, Lemos et al., 2007, Shrestha et al., 2008). This chapter
    briefly discusses grab sampling, in situ sampling using data loggers, and remote
    sensing using satellite imaging, while it focuses mainly on the use of WSNs. This
    chapter discusses the suitability of WSNs for water quality monitoring and argues
    how it overcomes the limitations of the other methods. For decades, field measurements
    for water quality evaluation have depended upon costly time- and labour-intensive
    on-site sampling and data collection. Water samples are collected from the field
    and are then analysed in laboratories. This not only give limited point measurements
    but also become an expensive method for remote sites (Glasgow et al., 2004). Additionally,
    transportation of samples may disturb their chemical properties (EPA, PacifiCorp,
    2002). As data utility is affected in grab sampling by extended holding times
    before analysis, monitoring programs have shifted towards continuous measurements
    using in situ sensors (Lemos et al., 2007) Initially data loggers were used for
    in situ monitoring; however they were limited by not providing data in real time
    as sites had to be visited to retrieve data. The expense of data loggers, infield
    reliability, calibration requirements and the need to extract data from them individually,
    prevent them from being used for a dense and long term deployment of sensors.
    Alternatively, remote sensing using optical and thermal sensors on aircrafts and
    satellites can be used to monitor water quality parameters like turbidity, chlorophyll,
    chemicals, nutrients and temperature (Glasgow et al., 2004, Webster and Grossman,
    2003). High resolution remotely sensed data is correlated by empirical or analytical
    models to a water quality parameter (Ritchie et al., 2003). Examples include a
    modelling approach to estimate phytoplankton in a shallow lake using satellite
    imagery with sparsely collected ground reference data, which demonstrates temporal
    stability (Tyler et al., 2006, Matthews et al., 2010). However, this is an expensive
    solution and its application is limited to regions covered by the satellites.
    Also, data sampling frequency may be insufficient and data may not be available
    in real time (Basha and Rus, 2007). It is reasoned that sudden fluctuations in
    water quality and quantity can be monitored using high frequency continuous measurements,
    and considerable differences in measurements are observed in daily/hourly readings
    in comparison to sparse readings (O’Flynn et al., 2010, Kirchner et al., 2004).
    Advancements in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMSs), low-power and low-cost
    microcontrollers and radio modules enabled WSNs for environmental monitoring (Estrin
    et al., 2001), which overcame the limitations of previous expensive, and bulky
    monitoring equipment with low spatio-temporal resolution to a certain extent.
    WSNs are networks of small embedded computers referred to as sensor nodes or ‘motes’,
    spatially distributed to cooperatively monitor environment and transmit data wirelessly.
    The relatively low cost of a WSN allows in principle, the deployment of a dense
    population of nodes that can adequately represent the variability present in the
    environment. WSNs have been used for monitoring and managing farming activities
    (Wang et al., 2006, Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009) and eco-hydrologic processes (Regan
    et al., 2009, Rundel et al., 2009). Water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved
    oxygen (DO), turbidity, salinity and nitrates have been measured in the reviewed
    applications using WSNs. A basic sensor node (Fig. 2) contains units for sensing
    and actuating, data processing, RF communications and power supply management
    (Jafer et al., 2010). A node can have many different types of sensors, for example
    measuring humidity, temperature, turbidity and nitrate but it should be noted
    that the quality of the data is dependent on the quality of the sensor. The acquired
    analogue samples are converted into digital signals using an on-board analogue-to-digital
    converter. The microprocessor may collect samples over time and aggregate them
    before transmitting them through the local radio transceiver to another node or
    a data sink (also termed as a gateway). Information collected from all the nodes
    is aggregated at the data sink and transmitted to and analysed at an off-field
    control node where a decisions might be taken. This could involve sending some
    actuation signal back to the network, for instance turning on sprinklers to irrigate
    the field. Furthermore, alternative networking approaches exist where information
    is processed and used entirely within the network, without the need for a central
    control node. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Sensor node architecture.

    WSNs deployed in a catchment. 4. WSNs for water quality monitoring and management
    WSNs have been employed for water quality monitoring of surface water (rivers,
    lakes, and dams), ground water, soil–water and catchments. These water bodies
    receive contaminants as a result of agricultural activities up in the catchment
    (as discussed in chapter 2). Preliminary results have been fundamental in advancing
    the knowledge of contaminant trends, through spatially constrained observations.
    Most of the applications were small scale prototype deployments and were mainly
    aimed at developing and testing the technology for remote, continuous and real-time
    data availability. These applications have yet to explore the implementation and
    impact of this technology for management and control decisions, in order to minimise
    and prevent individual stakeholder’s contaminant contributions, in an autonomous
    and dynamic manner. When this happens, the loop would be closed and better management
    policies by farmers would come into place. This would require monitoring of nutrients,
    pathogens and chemical contributions of different farming activities responsible
    for water quality degradation. WSNs have been used in agricultural activities
    but not specifically for WQM. For example a number of applications have been developed
    for precision irrigation for automatic and controlled irrigation, reducing the
    chances of water wastage (runoffs which are carrier of nutrients and contaminants)
    (McCulloch et al., 2008). However, runoff coming from elsewhere (e.g. another
    farm) cannot be avoided. This runoff can be carrying nutrients. In that case,
    current precision irrigation system can be extended to use information about runoff
    to modify the irrigation and fertilizer application of its field to save water
    and fertilizer usage. Other applications of WSNs for agriculture include pest
    control and animal farming. Pest control applications which are used to monitor
    microclimate (temperature, humidity, soil moisture) of a field to prevent conditions
    such as moulds etc. have been very important for viticulture (Morais et al., 2008,
    Beckwith et al., 2004). Furthermore, precision livestock using WSNs has been used
    to: (a) maintain animal health by monitoring environment of barns (Cugnasca et
    al., 2008, Darr and Zhao, 2008) and (b) manage cow herds in a virtual moving fence
    to control pasture area (Butler et al., 2004, Nadimi et al., 2008). The following
    sections review the applications of WSNs for WQM of different environmental compartments.
    Furthermore, the potential of including WSN-controlled existing agricultural activities,
    for integrated water quality management, is presented. 4.1. Application of WSNs
    for monitoring water fluxes and quality in different environmental compartments
    These projects are discussed below with respect to the area they monitor in a
    catchment. 4.1.1. Groundwater monitoring Groundwater contamination from human
    impacts is less obvious than surface water and cleaning it is more costly and
    technically demanding (Zektser and Lorne, 2004). Once polluted it may transport
    nutrients and chemicals to coastal waters (Gallagher et al., 1996, Valiela et
    al., 1999). WSNs have been used to measure rate, quantity and direction of water
    contamination flow in two different scenarios, one being to understand prevalence
    of arsenic in Bangladesh ground water, and the other to monitor nitrate propagation
    through soils and groundwater in parts of the USA. Although sensor nodes have
    become inexpensive, the high cost of some sensors (e.g. ammonium) is a major barrier
    for dense deployment of WSNs (Ramanathan et al., 2006). In order to monitor saltwater
    intrusion into coastal aquifers, WSN have been deployed for monitoring water quality
    in a coastal area in Australia. Preliminary data showed potential for helping
    in decision support related to placement of extraction bores for irrigation to
    avoid groundwater degradation. However, it was not possible to set up a well-connected
    radio link in this particular humid environment (Le Dinh et al., 2007). 4.1.2.
    Surface water monitoring A test deployment project, ‘Lakenet’, was undertaken
    for water quality monitoring in a eutrophic lake by University of Notre Dame (Seders
    et al., 2007). The sensor pod system, consisting of MICA2 and MDA300 sensor board
    measuring temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH was deployed for a short term
    (10 days). The primary objective of this deployment was to test the design of
    both the pods and the network under field conditions and to examine its ability
    to collect data continuously and reliably. This project was termed successful
    on the basis of collected data which showed diurnal fluctuations. To demonstrate
    the need for availability of high temporal rate data, as a requirement of water
    framework development (WFD), a WSN project (DEPLOY) was deployed at various locations
    on a river basin in Ireland. It achieved continuous sampling of parameters including
    conductivity, pH, chlorophyll, DO and temperature. The system consists of the
    Tyndall programmable system-on-chip sensor interface and data telemetry system
    using IDS data pod, and an optimised RF section to provide up to 4 km transmission).
    Results showed fluctuations in measurements due to activities such as runoff,
    rainfall or release of water from dams in the river. This demonstrated the potential
    for catchment behavioural analysis using statistical processing and interpretation.
    However, sensor fouling and maintenance issues were raised (Regan et al., 2009,
    O’Flynn et al., 2010). Similarly, another deployment involved performance evaluation
    of a prototype network of wireless nodes (Sunspot) on a dam in Malawi, Africa
    to counter severe health threats caused by degrading water quality. Water parameters
    such as acidity (pH), DO and turbidity were measured by integrating a sensor board
    with a sensor node. These measurements were then compared with numeric standards
    to decide on the suitability of water for drinking (Zennaro et al., 2009). Another
    application intended for WQM on dams utilises a combination of satellite remote
    sensing and WSN to enable real time analysis of satellite and surface data for
    overall coverage and the continuous monitoring of water quality. A floating sensor
    platform (buoy) is developed and deployed on a dam in Cyprus which transfers water
    quality data via wireless network to a remote central database (Papoutsa et al.,
    2010). Considerable research on developing technology to enable contaminant transport
    assessment and characterising urban stream quality and algal dynamics has been
    undertaken by CENS (Centre for Embedded Sensors), UC Los Angeles (Harmon et al.,
    2009, Gilbert, 2010). This started in 2007, by developing a test-bed for salinity,
    nitrate and soil moisture control in a 30acre land by using automatic irrigation
    control (Park and Harmon, 2007). Later progress on developing nitrate sensors
    for groundwater, soils and aquatic systems was made in 2009 (Ratâko et al., 2009).
    In 2010–2011, the project continued to focus on high resolution river observations
    using integrated sensing and model-driven analysis. Sensing is focused on temperature,
    dissolved oxygen and nitrate changes in the river (Harmon et al., 2009). For monitoring
    impact of poor water quality on aquatic life, parameters such as pH, dissolved
    oxygen, turbidity, salinity and electrical conductivity have been measured in
    various applications (He et al., 2011, Zhu et al., 2010). Real time information
    about these aquaculture environmental parameters can provide the means to give
    early warning signals. In one of the applications, based on historical data, the
    system was used to forecast water quality with artificial neural networks and
    control water quality in time to reduce the threat to fish farms. The model for
    forecasting dissolved oxygen half an hour ahead was validated with experimental
    data (Zhu et al., 2010). 4.1.3. Soil–water monitoring Monitoring drainage water
    of farms enables assessment of its quality. In this application (Kim et al., 2011),
    wireless lysimeter sensing stations were used 90 cm below the soil surface to
    monitor water flux leached below root zone under an irrigated cropping system.
    Continually monitored soil–water and weather data, sensed by a distributed network
    of sensors, was wirelessly transmitted to a base station using Bluetooth, which
    was connected to a web server for broadcasting the data via the internet. This
    provided remote online access to drainage water flux and field conditions for
    the whole growing season. This was targeted at measuring volume of drainage water
    based on irrigation frequency and rainfall events for different crops. However,
    this work could be easily extended to also monitor nutrient or salt parameters
    leached out from the soil. Another important project demonstrated the potential
    of WSNs for measuring soil water content, which was shown to be helpful in controlling
    hydrologic fluxes (Bogena et al., 2010). 4.1.4. Catchment monitoring Some work
    has been reported at catchment scale for water quality monitoring. Such catchments
    include mountains, forests, lakes, rivers, and agricultural lands. These are prototype
    deployments aimed at developing the technology and algorithms for large-scale
    remote monitoring and data processing for large volumes of heterogonous data for
    water quality. These are fundamental research efforts in this domain but improvements
    can be made. To find causes and interactions of physical/chemical variability
    on rivers and estuaries, work was started by US Geological Survey on creating
    a wireless catchment in Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve in Southern California.
    It was intended for high density monitoring of the catchment encompassing mountains,
    canyons and river channels. The system was primarily focused on developing and
    testing a network of radios and routers for wireless data transmission and its
    availability on the internet. Various issues were faced due to rugged topography
    and the difficulty of obtaining line-of sight communication. Despite these challenges,
    this provided an effective way of remote monitoring and was used further for monitoring
    meteorological properties related to pollutant loadings (Cayan et al., 2003).
    Similarly, for evaluating variation of regional weather, at mountain-to-sea scale,
    on water quality/quantity, and flooding in a catchment in Hawaii, a prototype
    system to provide 3D geospatial data visualisation utilising WSN was proposed.
    The system consisted of an array of nodes consisting of water quality sensors
    (temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity), weather stations,
    sensor data loggers (InteleCell), and video monitors. Preliminary results showed
    improvement over traditional sampling methods (Kido et al., 2008). The ‘SoilWeather’
    network was used in Finland for providing high temporal resolution on weather
    conditions, soil moisture and water quality (Kotamäki et al., 2009). The work
    was reported to have been used in developing a leaching model at sub catchment
    scale, including an improved hydrological model of the river, for monitoring water
    quality and nutrient retention in rivers and wetland. The network was deployed
    on a catchment covered by forests, river, lakes, and agricultural lands owned
    by private owners, who were the main users of the data. This is an important work
    highlighting data quality and processing issues with high volumes of heterogeneous
    data, received from catchment-scale observation using a single network, varying
    in content, accuracy, and spatial–temporal resolution. Additionally, maintenance
    of sensors due to such issues as bio-fouling, freezing, and rain gauge problems,
    which resulted in erroneous and missing data were viewed as major challenges in
    obtaining high data quality. 4.2. Leveraging current agricultural processes for
    water quality monitoring and management Some of the key research areas in precision
    agriculture which have received considerable attention include precision irrigation,
    pest control, viticulture and animal health monitoring (Wang et al., 2006, Ruiz-Garcia
    et al., 2009). Instead of taking decisions based on hypothetical average conditions,
    the real time information from these systems provides a solid basis for farmers
    to adjust strategies at any time (Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009). There is a potential
    of leveraging existing networked agricultural activities for their extension into
    an integrated water quality management mechanism. In this regard, current agricultural
    processes such as pest control, precision irrigation and animal farming which
    are monitored and controlled using WSN are discussed below. 4.2.1. Pest control
    To determine and prevent the onset of a fungal disease, phytophtora, in a potato
    field, a network of sensor nodes was deployed to sense humidity and temperature.
    Sensed data was sent periodically to a gateway at the edge of the field from where
    it was forwarded to a server using Wi–Fi. The accumulated field data for a day
    was then fed into a decision support system server where it was combined with
    weather forecast to determine the treatment policy each morning, rather than spraying
    pesticides based on hypothetical assumptions. This experiment, though based on
    specialised hardware, still presented many challenges for radio coverage owing
    to crop canopy effect, routing protocol, software bugs and in-field deployment
    (Langendoen et al., 2006). It has had tremendous impact on improving deployment
    and practicality issues in WSN applications (Le Dinh et al., 2007, Liang and Terzis,
    2008). Furthermore, to prevent frost, pest and mould damage in vineyards, which
    are prone to quick damage if overstressed, WSNs have been used to monitor ambient
    temperature, soil moisture and soil temperature (Morais et al., 2008, Beckwith
    et al., 2004). This information enables vineyard owners to monitor the plants
    remotely and manage priorities accordingly (Burrell et al., 2004). These pest
    control applications could be extended, to include chemical sensing, in order
    to assess chemical levels in the crops and soil after pesticides and herbicides
    applications. Information obtained through such a mechanism could then be used
    to inform on and thus potentially control chemical fluxes into water bodies. 4.2.2.
    Animal farming In order to maintain and improve animal health within animal feeding
    operations (AFOs) and to prevent its negative impact on the ecosystem, information
    related to the local environment is very important. Moreover, by having a mechanism
    to monitor and control animal herds in pasture lands, pathogen and organic additions
    to the environment may be controlled and assessed. The deployment of WSNs in many
    AFOs has enabled monitoring of parameters such as temperature, humidity, noise
    and ammonia content in the air which has allowed the management and maintenance
    of healthy environments in these facilities (Cugnasca et al., 2008, Darr and Zhao,
    2008). For managing cattle herds in pasture land, an algorithm called ‘moving
    virtual fence’ was developed. Each animal in the herd was given a smart collar
    consisting of a GPS (for determining animal’s location), a PDA, a WLAN card and
    a sound amplifier. As the animal approached a perimeter, it is presented with
    an acoustic stimulus to drive it away from crossing over a designated virtual
    boundary. By dynamically shifting fence lines, the usage of feedlots is improved.
    In addition, it reduced the overhead of installing and moving physical fences
    (Butler et al., 2004). Other work has investigated online monitoring of cattle
    presence and pasture time using WSNs to register the time animals spend in specific
    areas of the field (Nadimi et al., 2008). This information can be used to indicate
    grass quality and quantity and can also determine the right time to provide access
    to a new grass strip. These applications can be clearly extended to monitor pathogen
    levels animal waste in a barn and their fluxes to water bodies and therefore manage
    it by raising alerts. Also, by managing animal herds with a virtual fence, the
    possible situation of them contaminating water bodies or others fields can be
    avoided or reduced. 4.2.3. Precision irrigation As established in the introduction,
    potable water resources are under pressure. Therefore an efficient way of utilising
    water resources by people in general and agriculture sector in particular is crucial
    to avoiding a global water crisis (Chartres and Varma, 2011). By monitoring soil
    and environmental parameters (like soil moisture, soil temperature, ambient temperature
    and humidity), an informed decision can be made by farmers to control the timing
    and quantity of irrigation. Unlike expensive, sophisticated, high maintenance
    and high energy sensor-based technologies like Adcon Telemetry and Automata, and
    labour intensive data collection from logging stations, WSNs provide real-time
    and less expensive sensing mechanisms for improving irrigation automation (Vellidis
    et al., 2008). It is estimated that 70% of the annual water usage of the agricultural
    industry, in the Australian state of Tasmania, is used to irrigate dairy pastures.
    In order to improve water use efficiency for pasture production, data is collected
    using 70 sensor pods which were developed using off-the-shelf components for this
    experiment. Accurate irrigation at targeted dry areas can be provided by studying
    soil dynamics, using soil and environmental parameters collected from the pasture
    field. Received data showed variation in soil moisture levels with events such
    as rains etc. (McCulloch et al., 2008). Another example made a comparison between
    traditional and sensor scheduling systems in a cotton field (2.3 ha) for the whole
    growing season (Vellidis et al., 2008). The East of the field, divided into four
    different irrigation zones based on soil type and historic yield map, was equipped
    with 9 sensor nodes and centre pivot variable rate irrigation (VRI) system. On
    the western side, 3 sensor nodes were deployed to monitor soil tension, and here
    irrigation was triggered based on traditional assessment of crops. Each sensor
    node was equipped with three moisture and temperature sensors buried at 0.2, 0.4
    and 0.6 m depth under the soil. Results showed water tension at more than double
    the trigger points at 0.4 and 0.6 m depth in western zone despite irrigation,
    whereas the eastern side never surpassed the trigger points. However, it is stated
    that further work needs to be done on the VRI controller for varying quantity
    of irrigation relative to the needs of individual areas, or for different crops
    in a single field. To address such a need, site specific VRI was employed in a
    3.6 ha plot by using six in-field sensor stations. These stations were based on
    off-the-shelf components, with a plug-and-play Bluetooth radio module, and would
    periodically sample data and transmit back to the base station. Each sensing station
    was equipped with water content reflectometers, a soil temperature probe, and
    a humidity probe. The irrigation machine was controlled by a programmable logic
    controller that would update the geo-referenced location of sprinklers from a
    differential GPS, and wirelessly communicate with a computer at the base station.
    This enabled variable rate irrigation according to the needs of individual crops
    in a large field. (Kim et al., 2008). As discussed above, a significant amount
    of successful work has been published using automatic and variable rate irrigation
    with some limitations regarding reliability. However, what is lacking is the inclusion
    of real time information about events elsewhere in the farm to alter irrigation
    decisions. For example, information about possible weather changes, like rain,
    from other networks in a catchment could be used to change time and quantity of
    irrigation by allowing forward planning and prediction. Also, information regarding
    irrigation in one farm can be used elsewhere in the catchment to prohibit entry
    of nutrient flux from that runoff. 5. Research gap in water quality monitoring
    and management using WSNs The literature review for the application of WSN for
    water quality monitoring and agricultural activities presents many possibilities
    and potential, yet identifies numerous limitations. Following are the major limitations
    commonly observed in the reviewed literature. 5.1. Absence of catchment scale
    integrated monitoring and management As identified in chapter 2, a number of catchment-scale
    activities are responsible for water quality degradation. Therefore, to identify
    the individual and major impacts of the diffused pollutant sources, it is vital
    to base the monitoring system on the entire catchment. It has been acknowledged
    in the literature that the varied monitoring needs for individual areas of a catchment
    could be combined to allow an understanding of contaminant flow trends and quantification
    of the contributing factors. WSNs have been successful in understanding the trends
    of nutrients and contaminants fluxes owing to non-point source activities in a
    catchment. However, this understanding is limited as it can currently only use
    small-scale, localised and specific measurements at rivers, lakes, dams and groundwater
    reservoirs (Ramanathan et al., 2006, Le Dinh et al., 2007, Zennaro et al., 2009,
    Papoutsa et al., 2010, Seders et al., 2007, Harmon et al., 2007, O’Flynn et al.,
    2010, Regan et al., 2009). These water resources receive contaminants as a result
    of activities up in the catchment, thus providing insufficient information for
    quantifying explicit responsible activities. Fewer applications are intended for
    large-scale observations (Kido et al., 2008, Kotamäki et al., 2009, Cayan et al.,
    2003), but these are prototype deployments based on limited monitoring points
    across the catchment. A major step in this direction is the new network of terrestrial
    environmental observatories in Germany that provides real-time access to instruments
    in a multi-scale and multi-temporal mode for the monitoring of relevant fluxes
    of trace-gases, water and matter in all important environmental compartments at
    the catchment-scale, e.g. hydrological sensor networks, micrometeorological flux
    stations and clusters of lysimeters (Zacharias et al., 2011). Existing work does
    not implement multi-scale monitoring mechanisms that include all stakeholders
    in a catchment, to assess their individual contributions, which is fundamental
    for the understanding of cumulative impacts on water quality degradation. Current
    projects are focused on the development and deployment of the required infrastructure
    for enabling high-temporal, real-time water-quality observations to be made available
    through GSM or internet on a central data repository (Kotamäki et al., 2009, Kido
    et al., 2008). These do not include addressing management and control decisions,
    to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder’s nutrient/contaminant contributions,
    in an autonomous and dynamic manner. Thus a need can be identified for an autonomous
    and integrated catchment-scale monitoring mechanism, based on targeted wireless
    sensor technologies. 5.2. Absence of suitable sensors Water quality analysis requires
    monitoring of various parameters as represented in the tabulated contaminant constituents
    (Table 1). It is apparent that the advances in sensor development have not kept
    pace with the advances in potential sensor materials (Zhuiykov, 2012). The development
    of sensors from new materials to enable solid-state and film-based sensors requires
    significant development effort before they can be used in real applications, although
    they do offer significant potential. An example of an improved sensor is the development
    of a solid-state water quality sensor with metal oxide sensing electrodes under
    research efforts by Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).
    This has provided the capability to measure pH, DO and dissolved metal ions in
    a way more appropriate for WSN applications (Zhuiykov, 2007, Zhuiykov, 2012).
    It is evident through the surveyed literature that existing work does not include
    all of the contaminants and parameters required for water quality monitoring,
    for example phosphorous, nitrates, and ammonia. This is because suitable in situ
    phosphate and nitrate sensors for terrestrial deployment are not available. The
    available sensors for nitrate monitoring are based on ultraviolet absorption and
    flow cell analysers which are very expensive for dense deployment (Robertson et
    al., 2009). Both electromechanical (Bobacka et al., 2008) and optical sensing
    modes (McDonagh et al., 2008) relevant to nitrogen and phosphorous species are
    still an active research area (Rundel et al., 2009). Furthermore, research on
    the development of miniature, reliable and inexpensive water quality solid-state
    sensors using metal oxide sensing electrodes is underway by CSIRO, CMSE and SSN
    TCP laboratories (Zhuiykov, 2012). In the absence of affordable and reliable in
    situ sensors for all of the necessary water quality parameters, estimation of
    constituent fluxes in streams and rivers relies on surrogate sensors which give
    proxy measurements. Examples include use of turbidity (clarity of water) and fluorescence
    intensities as a surrogate for suspended sediments and biochemical oxygen demand
    (Minella et al., 2008, Hudson et al., 2008). Another study demonstrated successful
    surrogate relationship, for road and roof surfaces, of dissolved total nitrates
    and total phosphates with total dissolved solids (TDSs). For measuring TDS, electrical
    conductivity was used as a surrogate (Miguntanna, 2009). These surrogates have
    been fundamental in advancing our knowledge about the trends in the actual parameters.
    However it is also noted that measurement error and uncertainty in the derived
    surrogate relationships can have a substantial effect on the uncertainty of flux
    estimates made using surrogates (Horsburgh et al., 2010) and require significant
    calibration of the environments in which they are deployed. Although sensor development
    is on-going (Zhuiykov, 2012), there are still few useable sensors for many of
    the parameters, thus it can be concluded that there is a requirement for accurate,
    inexpensive, low-power, long-lived, robust and miniature sensors for effective
    water quality analysis. 5.3. Issues related to the use of off-the-shelf components
    Current applications of WSNs for WQM are based on the use of off-the-shelf components
    which often fail to address the diverse range of environmental and degradation
    problems that can coalesce at catchment scales. Existing devices are not made
    to address the specific requirements of a particular application. Various limitations,
    as discussed above, have been faced in the existing literature by the use of off
    the shelf components (Le Dinh et al., 2007) such as the coverage problem (Regan
    et al., 2009), signal attenuation (Vellidis et al., 2008), configuration and operational
    difficulties (Trubilowicz et al., 2009), and absence of a network model for catchment
    areas with hilly terrains which has the potential to affect the radio links. Standards
    for WSNs were developed primarily for urban monitoring situations such as buildings
    and industries. However, they are less suited to remote and large scale applications
    such as agriculture with coverage and crop canopy problems due to the propagation
    environment and typical range requirements. For example, high frequency systems
    (typically 2.4 GHz) commonly rely on line-of-sight systems and physical obstructions
    such as plants, or conditions such as rain, can significantly reduce the communication
    range to as little as a few metres. Furthermore, these frequencies are unsuitable
    for underground WSNs, which are ideal for non-invasive soil monitoring, as they
    suffer data losses due to soil water content (Akyildiz and Stuntebeck, 2006, Li
    et al., 2007). In an experiment, sensor and link failures were handled by: (1)
    identifying patterns in data to indicate sensor failure and (2) using decision
    trees based on data flow models to identify link failure (Ramanathan et al., 2006).
    Top level concepts and protocols are applicable without any changes but care is
    needed for practical deployment and it may be that certain applications require
    a significant rethink of the communication requirements, which may not be addressed
    by current off-the-shelf solutions. This is an on-going research for the application
    of underground wireless sensor networks. (Bogena et al., 2009) evaluated signal
    attenuation by factors like soil depth, soil water content and soil electrical
    conductivity. They concluded that in a hybrid underground approach, which combines
    below ground and above ground data transmission, sufficient power will remain
    to ensure long distant data communication. As long term and spatiotemporal monitoring
    is required for effective analysis of water degradation trends in a catchment,
    a low cost, low power and reliable system is required. Existing literature has
    shown that many nodes lasted from only a few days to months, therefore effective
    design changes like wake up and power control need to be considered to prolong
    their lifetime to years. Furthermore, although separate sensor boards (Zennaro
    et al., 2009, O’Flynn et al., 2007) can be integrated with nodes to enable a multi
    sensing system with various sensor types, improvements can be made to take this
    further. The plug and play system constrains sensors to be compatible with that
    system, whereas a more reconfigurable interface may well extend the choice of
    sensors at the expense of some complexity in specifying to the host node what
    the sensor requires in terms of resources. Therefore, there is a requirement for
    a reconfigurable sensor interface for a sensor node, e.g. SDI-12, as this would
    allow a more rapid deployment for a specific application and thereby reducing
    the costs of the WSNs. In addition, various deployment and maintenance issues
    were faced due to the placement of sensors in soil and water. Bio-fouling of sensors
    deployed in water required regular cleaning and maintenance (Regan et al., 2009).
    6. A case for collaborative WSNs for integrated catchment-scale water quality
    management Through the review of related work and its limitations, it is established
    that for effective water quality management at a catchment scale, a system of
    individually networked activities needs to be included into an integrated monitoring
    system. Information sharing of critical parameters between networked environmental
    compartments and WSN-controlled agricultural activities can enable identification
    and quantification of the contributing factors in water degradation. This would
    further address management and control decisions, to minimise and prevent individual
    stakeholder’s nutrient/contaminant contributions, on waterways as well as on other
    stakeholders, in an autonomous and dynamic manner (Zia et al., 2013). Fig. 4 illustrates
    information sharing among individual networks in a catchment. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Collaborative catchment-scale management using integrated
    WSNs. It is proposed that monitoring should be based on three levels covering
    the micro-to macro- scales. Micro-scale monitoring is aimed at improved understanding
    of small scale processes such as leaching of nutrients in soil and groundwater
    and retention of fertilizers by soil. Then a medium scale monitoring which is
    focused on assessing agricultural practices such as improved irrigation strategies,
    and use of alternative fertilizers or reduced application rates while maintaining
    same crop yields. Finally, macro-scale monitoring considers catchment level, sub-catchment
    level and regional land use assessments. Monitoring environmental compartments
    continuously and spatially can identify specific local sources for nutrient/contaminant
    fluxes (e.g. a barn or a farm). If this information is fed back to the identified
    stakeholder in real time, there is the potential to control or minimise the fluxes
    emanating from the location. If there are other networks monitoring nutrient/contaminant
    levels and fluxes near the source location, then the information provided by these
    networks can be correlated with data from the original monitoring point. If it
    correlates well then this has identified a route from the source to the appropriate
    nearby network as well as characterising that route in terms of quantity and time
    constant, thus allowing a model of cause and effect to be built up for the locality.
    Based on this information, the responsible stakeholder can then assess its adopted
    practices and alter strategies to reduce its contribution to water quality degradation.
    A collaborative control and management strategy requires that individually targeted
    monitoring units or local networks, representing different stakeholders in a catchment
    e.g. a farm, should be able to share information with each other about runoffs,
    contaminants or nutrient fluxes. These events may be intense but are short-lived
    and so information sharing becomes important as they may be very fast compared
    with the usual sampling rate, and so may normally be missed. Allowing event information
    to be transmitted across multiple networks as they are detected will allow prediction
    of when the repercussions of that event might be seen downstream, allowing other
    stakeholder networks in the vicinity to adjust their monitoring strategy to improve
    the value of information e.g. by increasing their sample rate to catch transient
    events. This would than support the development of advanced models that are able
    to simulate catchment processes in a more detailed way. Implementing such a mechanism
    allows every stakeholder the option to contribute and use any data flowing through
    the catchment from other networks. 7. Conclusion This paper has reviewed the potential
    impact of agricultural activities on water quality degradation in a catchment.
    It has proposed that the varied monitoring needs for individual areas of a catchment
    could be combined to allow an understanding of contaminant flow trends, their
    quantification and management of the contributing factors. This identifies a need
    for an autonomous and collaborative mechanism, based on targeted wireless sensor
    technologies. Furthermore, it is concluded that for effective and integrated water
    quality monitoring and management at a catchment scale, a system of individually
    networked activities is needed. This is likely to take the form of a combination
    of networks that have been installed for local monitoring purposes (e.g. at farm
    scale, primarily to provide local information for that farm), and some specific
    networks aimed at filling in information gaps in the catchment. This system of
    networks should be able to share information about critical parameters for events,
    such as rain, or floods, that could trigger consequences, such as contaminants
    runoff and so requires a higher level application to make use of this information,
    and also requires the individual networks to be aware that similar networks nearby
    are capable of passing information to them. This will inevitably lead to some
    form of standardisation of communication protocol and data representation between
    enabled environmental networks. Applications of WSNs for water quality monitoring
    and management for a catchment hold huge potential. However, certain limitations
    have been identified in this review such as small scale, single application deployments,
    limitations of off-the-shelf components, the lack of suitable sensors and the
    cost of deployment and data collection. Furthermore, it is determined that important
    application specific requirements are not well catered for by using off-the-shelf
    components such as variable sampling rates, well-defined and flexible sensor interfaces,
    lifetime, ease of deployment and configuration for hydrologists, and a network
    model for the broader environment. Hence, it is emphasized that although there
    is continual and improving design of sensor nodes for individual applications
    there is still a requirement for more flexibility in node design with a view to
    allowing networks to successfully interact with each other. In the absence of
    affordable and reliable in situ sensors for WQM, measurements rely on surrogate
    sensors which give proxy measurements. Therefore, it is concluded that there is
    still a need for accurate, inexpensive and miniature sensors with a long field
    life for WQM. Nevertheless, developments on all these areas are on-going, and
    as such deficiencies are addressed, the ability to monitor at catchment scales
    will improve. We argue that by implementing a collaborative mechanism that allows
    every stakeholder the option to contribute and use any data flowing through the
    networks, the overall value of that information will be increased. References

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: The rapid growth of the Internet of Things
    (IoT) has accelerated strong interests in the development of low-power wireless
    sensors. Today, wireless sensors are integrated within IoT systems to gather information
    in a reliable and practical manner to monitor processes and control activities
    in areas such as transportation, energy, civil infrastructure, smart buildings,
    environment monitoring, healthcare, defense, manufacturing, and production. The
    long-term and self-sustainable operation of these IoT devices must be considered
    early on when they are designed and implemented. Traditionally, wireless sensors
    have often been powered by batteries, which, despite allowing low overall system
    costs, can negatively impact the lifespan and the performance of the entire network
    they are used in. Energy Harvesting (EH) technology is a promising environment-friendly
    solution that extends the lifetime of these sensors, and, in some cases completely
    replaces the use of battery power. In addition, energy harvesting offers economic
    and practical advantages through the optimal use of energy, and the provisioning
    of lower network maintenance costs. We review recent advances in energy harvesting
    techniques for IoT. We demonstrate two energy harvesting techniques using case
    studies. Finally, we discuss some future research challenges that must be addressed
    to enable the large-scale deployment of energy harvesting solutions for IoT environments.

    ago, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) published its first report
    on the Internet of Things (IoT) [1]. The IoT paradigm was first defined as a new
    dimension added to the world of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs)
    that allows making connections for anyone and anything, anytime and anywhere to
    create a new dynamic network of networks [1]. Today, IoT is no longer an emerging
    trend. It has become one of the most important technologies of the current century
    with applicability in many industries such as transportation, energy, civil infrastructure,
    smart buildings, environment monitoring, healthcare, defense, manufacturing, and
    production. IoT continues to grow. Experts predict that, by 2025, about 22 billion
    IoT devices will be connected to the Internet and will communicate in this IoT
    environment [2]. The IoT ecosystem has the following main components [3]: IoT
    devices (sensors and actuators) are responsible for collecting data or controlling
    a certain process. IoT connectivity (protocols, gateways) is responsible for transferring
    data in the online, cyber-physical world. The IoT cloud stores data and it is
    also the place where decisions are made. IoT analytics and data management are
    responsible for processing the data. End-user devices and user interfaces help
    to control and configure the system. Each of these components must address significant
    scientific and technological challenges for achieving efficient and scalable implementations.
    For example, the energy efficiency paradigm associated with IoT devices must be
    considered early on during their design phase [4]. Enabling a seamless flow of
    information throughout the IoT ecosystem is another important challenge because
    wireless connectivity is highly complex, and the fast-evolving wireless standards
    contribute to this. The development of new Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques
    to analyze huge amounts of data and make real-time decisions is another major
    challenge. Also, security and privacy must be considered because existing security
    protocols such as Data Encryption Standard (DES), Advanced Encryption Standard
    (AES) and Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA), are not suitable for IoT devices
    due to their resource (memory, processing power) constraints and heterogeneity
    [5]–[7]. We describe the challenge associated with the energy efficiency paradigm
    for some IoT devices (such as wireless sensors) below. The IoT vision benefits
    from the features of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) [8], [9] and relies on these
    systems for gathering data about the environment and for performing actions following
    the analysis of the collected data. IoT uses Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity
    for assuring that every one of its components, or “things”, has a distinct address,
    while WSNs do not necessarily require a connection to the Internet. However, due
    to the continuously increasing power of microelectronics combined with their decreasing
    costs, improved power efficiency of hardware technologies along with better wireless
    communication protocols, WSNs have become a vital component of the IoT ecosystem.
    WSNs can extend the Internet, or the cyber environment, into physical spaces [4],
    [10]. Moreover, IoT and WSN have become almost inseparable [11], wireless sensor
    networks being recognized as a key enabler of IoT [12]. Some of the domains, wherein
    IoT technologies have been integrated with WSNs include healthcare [13], agriculture
    [14], smart cities [15] and smart buildings [16], manufacturing [17], and transportation
    systems [18]. Figure 1 shows a typical IoT scenario where data also is collected
    using WSNs. FIGURE 1. Typical IoT scenario including Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSNs). Show All The use of wireless sensor networks has proven to be beneficial
    in specific applications where access is difficult, such as remote locations or
    on moving parts of machinery [19]–[22]. Generally, a wireless sensor is made up
    of four main components, namely the sensorial part, the processor, the transceiver,
    and a power supply, as Figure 2 shows [23]. In general, wireless sensors have
    limited capabilities in terms of processing power and storage and must operate
    on small amounts of energy because the power source, in most of the cases is a
    battery which has limited capacity. Other challenges encountered in the deployment
    of solutions that rely on wireless sensors include reliable communication, coverage
    and deployment issues, security, QoS (Quality of service) assurance, and the efficient
    management of large amounts of data [10]. Therefore, the long-term and self-sustainable
    operation of wireless sensors (IoT devices) is a critical issue and must be addressed
    properly. Energy Harvesting (EH) technology is an environment-friendly solution
    that has the potential to extend the lifetime of these sensors. Energy harvesting
    refers to the harnessing of energy from various external sources and its conversion
    into electricity. FIGURE 2. Wireless sensor (IoT device) components. Show All
    This work deals with the analysis of energy harvesting techniques suitable for
    IoT devices. We summarize our research contributions as follows: We motivate why
    energy harvesting is important for the IoT ecosystem. Based on a comprehensive
    review of energy harvesting solutions for IoT, we analyze different techniques
    to harvest energy from various sources. We present two IoT energy harvesting devices
    developed by the authors, along with considerations regarding their design, implementation,
    and testing. We organize the rest of the article as follows. The second section
    highlights why energy harvesting is important for IoT. In this section, we highlight
    the limitations of using batteries as the main power source for wireless sensors.
    The third section presents an overview on energy harvesting techniques that can
    be used in IoT. We present a classification of these techniques according to the
    sources from which energy is harvested energy. We analyze recently proposed energy
    harvesting techniques for IoT. In the fourth section we describe the energy harvesting
    models and consumption models that have been proposed for implementing energy
    harvesting IoT devices. We then present two case studies from our previous works
    on solar energy harvesting and Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesting. We describe
    the architecture, operation, and energy characteristics of a solar powered environmental
    IoT device based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication. We present a prototype
    for a BLE-enabled environmental beacon, powered by a RF energy harvesting element
    in the fifth section. The sixth section discusses a few technical challenges that
    still need to be addressed on the design and development of energy harvesting
    devices even though progress has been made in recent years on self-powered IoT
    devices. Finally, we make some concluding remarks in the final section. SECTION
    II. Motivation for Energy Harvesting in IOT It is desirable for the network lifetime
    to be as long as possible. Therefore, energy efficiency and long battery lifetime
    are of crucial importance in the design and development of wireless sensors (IoT
    devices). However, a battery has a finite capacity and, even though there have
    been breakthrough developments in communication protocols, operating systems,
    and in the implementation of powerful power management mechanisms, highly efficient
    MAC (medium access control) and routing protocols, it will eventually get depleted.
    To ensure the operation of the network, costly maintenance operations for battery
    replacement must be performed. The scale of wireless sensor networks coupled with
    sensor placement, often in inaccessible locations, make these maintenance operations
    difficult in many cases [24]. The use of batteries as power supply for wireless
    devices has other drawbacks besides their ability to provide power for a finite
    amount of time. These include reduced energy densities and leakage, that discharges
    the battery even when it is not used. Moreover, the application space of batteries
    is limited by the impact of temperature on their proper operation, extreme conditions
    leading to capacity and power losses [25]. Another problem, that is common to
    the operation of wireless sensors is the proper management of short high-current
    pulses that affect the capacity and lifetime of batteries [26]. Battery weight
    and dimensions directly affect capacity, and their reduction for achieving small
    form factor designs will lead to a shorter operation time for the devices they
    power. Another major concern is related to the environment because batteries contain
    harmful chemicals and toxins that make their disposals more complex [25], [27].
    Although most batteries can be recycled and many governmental initiatives have
    been established for increasing the recycling rates, improvements in this direction
    are still necessary [28]. Currently, there is also a generalized trend of reducing
    the environmental impact of information and communication technology, and this
    also applies to wireless sensors, where the goal is toward the achievement of
    sustainable and energy efficient systems [29]. These are some of the reasons why
    energy harvesting elements are included in the design of current wireless sensors.
    These energy harvesting components can act as secondary power sources or can completely
    replace batteries. The use of energy harvesting extends mote’s lifetime by replenishing
    its energy from an energy source, such as solar cells, vibration or fuel cells,
    acoustic noise, or mobile suppliers (robots) [10]. In this way, the long-term
    and self-sustainable operation of wireless sensors, one of the most important
    issues in the widespread use of IoT, is assured [29]. Energy harvesting or energy
    scavenging is the process through which energy from external sources, such as
    mechanical load, vibrations, temperature gradients, or light, is captured and
    converted to obtain relatively small levels of power supplied to electronic devices
    [4], [30]. The intake of energy from the surrounding environment leads to a green
    energy source that replaces primary batteries or charges secondary cells and represents
    a cost-effective and environmentally sound method for wireless devices [31]. The
    three components of a common energy harvesting system are the source (external
    energy that is collected), the harvesting architecture (mechanisms), and the load
    (the consumer) [32]. The energy can be used immediately at the time it is harvested
    or it can be stored for future use, resulting in two main architectures, namely,
    Harvest-Use and Harvest-Store-Use [32]. Figure 3 shows the two distinct architectures
    for a wireless sensor node with energy harvesting elements. Depending on the configuration
    of the system, belonging to one of the two architectures, its power generation
    part includes specific energy harvesting circuits that convert ambient energy
    to Direct Current (DC) energy, power management units that increase the efficiency
    of power generation and its use, and storage elements, that can store energy and
    power the electronics. All these components and their associated characteristics
    and actions are the subject of intense research efforts, that target the manufacturing
    of energy-autonomous wireless sensors when deployed in the IoT environment. FIGURE

    Harvest-Store-Use. Adapted from [32]. Show All SECTION III. Energy Harvesting
    Techniques for IOT For energy harvesting several energy sources can be considered.
    These can be classified into the following categories according to the sources
    from which the harvested energy comes: ambient, mechanical, human, organic and
    hybrid. The ambient energy sources are available in the environment and can be
    easily accessed without any costs. These ambient sources can in turn be divided
    into the following categories: solar, Radio Frequency (RF), thermal, wind, and
    hydro based energy sources [24]. Vibrations and pressure are mechanical energy
    sources that are deployed explicitly in the environment for harvesting purposes
    [24]. Humans through their motion and physiology, organisms, and plants, represent
    other sources of energy that can be scavenged. In some cases, the use of only
    one energy source is not enough, therefore several types of energy sources must
    be combined to reap sufficient power needed by electronic equipment. A. Ambient
    Energy Harvesting Solar and RF are the main ambient energy sources that are naturally
    or artificially always present in the environment and can be considered in making
    self-powered devices for the IoT ecosystem. This is why in this work we focus
    only on these ambient sources. 1) Solar Energy Harvesting Solar power is the most
    abundant energy source on earth, with approximately 173×1012 kW of energy produced
    continuously, a quantity that exceeds by far the world’s demand and use [33].
    The total energy that reaches the earth’s surface annually is approximately 3.4×1024
    J, an amount that is 7000 to 8000 times higher than the yearly primary energy
    consumption of the globe [34]. This energy is harvested through helio-chemical
    (photosynthesis), helio-electrical (photovoltaic converters), and helio-thermal
    (thermal energy production, solar water heaters) processes [35]. The helio-electrical
    process is based on the PhotoVoltaic (PV) effect, that can be observed when two
    dissimilar materials convert solar rays into DC (direct current) power when struck
    by light [24]. The device that is used for generating electricity from sunlight
    is the solar cell or the photovoltaic cell, that is a solid-state electrical junction
    device [24]. It is usually built from silicon, using a process like the one used
    in the manufacturing of transistors and Integrated Circuits (ICs) [34]. The main
    types of PV cells, depending on the materials in their composition, are the mono-crystalline,
    polycrystalline, and amorphous silicon, or thin-film cells [34], [36]. The parameter
    used for comparing their performance is their efficiency which is defined as the
    ratio of the maximum output power to the incident light power under 100 mW/cm2
    illumination [37]. The first category (mono-crystalline PV cells) has the highest
    efficiency, between 15 and 24%, but the corresponding mono-crystalline PV cells
    are the most expensive. The second group, made up of polycrystalline PV cells,
    has an efficiency between 14 and 20%, while thin-film cells are the cheapest,
    but with an efficiency lower than 13.2% [36]. In the context of wireless sensors,
    the use of solar cells for harvesting energy from the environment is a mature
    technique and is the most common mechanism used for prolonging the lifetime of
    the power supply [38]–[40]. Solar cells offer the highest power density, of approximately
    15 mW/cm2, as compared to various other energy harvesting techniques [41]. Even
    though solar power is uncontrollable, and the conversion efficiency is affected
    by the day-night cycle, seasonal changes, weather conditions, and ambient temperature,
    it can be predicted and modeled so that adequate strategies are adopted for assuring
    continuous power to electronic devices [42]–[46]. To ensure uninterrupted operation
    (during the periods such as night and the presence of clouds when ambient light
    is not available) of the device powered by solar energy harvesting components,
    an architecture that includes storage elements, as Figure 4 shows, is the most
    common [47], [48]. The energy storage can be a rechargeable battery, a supercapacitor,
    or a combination of the two with each choice having its own advantages and limitations.
    The power is stored when the amount generated exceeds the consumption of the device,
    or when it is in sleep or inactive mode and this stored power is used when the
    energy source is missing or when required by the system [48]. PV cells are a well-known
    technology which have been used in a wide range of IoT devices. When PV technology
    is used in conjunction with adequate energy storage, power consumption optimization,
    appropriate circuit design and dimensioning, we can develop efficient energy autonomous
    devices [49]–[53]. FIGURE 4. Main components of a solar energy harvesting system.
    Adapted from [47]. Show All Energy harvesting using PV technology was initially
    intended for outdoor use. PV cells have been designed mainly for generating energy
    from sunlight with conversion efficiencies in indoor environments having smaller
    values as compared to higher conversion efficiencies with outdoor environments
    [54], [55]. However, advances in manufacturing processes and circuits along with
    improved designs of IoT devices have enabled the deployment of indoor solar powered
    systems [56]–[59]. Furthermore, significant progress has also been made in the
    development of energy supplies for moderate power systems, that consume power
    in the range of 1 to 10 W, combined with the current popular use of low-power
    IoT devices requiring between 10 and 100 mW [60]. This allows energy autonomous
    embedded systems to run data-intensive tasks such as computer vision and facilitates
    the implementation of edge computing technologies. 2) RF Energy Harvesting Wireless
    Internet, radio and satellite stations, and digital multimedia broadcasts are
    sources of RF or electromagnetic signals, between 3 kHz and 300 GHz of frequency
    spectrum, that can be converted into electrical energy with the help of an antenna
    and a rectifier circuit, as Figure 5 shows. This type of energy exists around
    us (indoors and outdoors) at different levels, and it is always available (day
    or night). This energy can be retrieved without limit, but it has several disadvantages
    such as low density and low efficiency that is inversely proportional to distance
    [61]. Based on a review of the past literature in this area [61]–[63], we found
    that RF waves energy harvesting is the best solution in many scenarios when it
    comes to low-energy IoT devices. The works in [64], [65] and [66] highlight the
    potential of using RF Energy Harvesters (RFEHs) to power IoT devices for environmental
    and healthcare monitoring. Other approaches for harvesting energy from RF signals
    include opportunistic charging from nearby smartphones [67], or the sharing of
    energy between different wireless systems close to each other [68]. FIGURE 5.
    Main components of a RF energy harvesting system. Adapted from [61]. Show All
    B. Mechanical Energy Harvesting Mechanical vibrations and pressure are energy
    sources that surround us, and these sources can be considered in making self-powered
    IoT devices used in a wide range of applications. 1) Mechanical Vibrations Energy
    Harvesting Mechanical vibrations have a sufficiently high energy density and,
    in some cases, where IoT devices are deployed indoors or in overcast areas, their
    use can replace solar harvesting systems. The energy from low frequency (< 100
    Hz) or high frequency (>100 Hz) vibrations is usually harvested through piezoelectric,
    triboelectric, electromagnetic, and electrostatic energy harvesters. The Piezoelectric
    Energy Harvesters (PEHs) work based on the combination between the mechanical
    and the electrical behaviors of certain categories of materials such as crystals
    and ceramics [69]. These harvesters do not require external voltage sources, have
    a minimum of moving parts, and can generate power with voltage levels that can
    be easily conditioned (i.e., converted to DC) [70]. This type of harvesters benefits
    from high-power density, simplicity in their design and fabrication, and they
    use a wide range of frequencies. Based on the literature review in this area,
    we found that the piezoelectric energy harvesting is the most widely researched.
    The works in [70]–[74] analyze state-of-the-art of energy harvesting using piezoelectric
    generators at micro and nano scale and highlight that this method is one of the
    most promising solutions to power IoT devices. In [75], the authors used PEHs
    installed on an actual roadway for five months, with vehicles traveling at speeds
    of 10–50 km/h. The maximum generated power of 2080 mW and a power density of 20.79
    W/m2 were recorded with a vehicle speed of 30 km/h, and 2381 mW and a power density
    of 23.81 W/m2 at a vehicular speed of 50 km/h. Another test presented in [75]
    involved the use of eight PEHs installed on the highway rest area. The results
    obtained prove the harvesters’ ability to successfully operate 24 LED indicators
    that can ensure drivers’ safety at night, to monitor in real time the conditions
    inside the harvesters through their sensors (temperature, strain, and leakage),
    and to collect traffic data such as the number of vehicles passing the harvester
    zone. The ElectroMagnetic Energy Harvesters (EMEHs) work based on the relative
    motion between a conductor (such as a coil) and a magnetic field (created by a
    magnet) in response to mechanical vibrations. This category of harvesters has
    attracted considerable attention due to their ability to generate high output
    currents, robustness, and their low-cost designs. However, they continue to be
    challenging in terms of poor transduction properties of planar magnets and the
    limited number of induction loops when it comes to IoT small-scale devices [69].
    In [76], the authors proposed a battery-free solution to power a Bluetooth board
    with a DC voltage equal to 2 V by a low voltage vibration electromagnetic converter
    (with an open circuit output voltage equal to 1.8 V peak to peak for a frequency
    of 24 Hz) as energy source. In [77], the authors present an EMEH working at low
    frequency ambient vibrations (< 100Hz). To demonstrate the design, a macro level
    prototype was used, and the voltage generated for a frequency of 50 Hz and 20
    turns of copper coil is 20 mV, i.e., 1mV per turn. The approach described in [78]
    presents a viable hybrid solution which includes an EMEH to collect the energy
    from the bridge’s vibrations and ambient wind surges to implement IoT devices
    for bridges’ health monitoring. Two prototypes with multi-resonant frequencies
    have been designed. The first prototype, suitable for narrow band vibration environments,
    has a frequency band from 1 to 18 Hz and acceleration levels below 0.4 g and generates
    an open circuit voltage of 810 mV and an optimum power of 354.51 μW . It also
    produces an adequate voltage and power levels (up to 7.84 μW ) from wind surges
    from 0.5 m/s to 9 m/s. The second prototype, suitable for vibration surroundings,
    has a frequency band from 1 to 45 Hz and acceleration levels below 0.6 g and generates
    an open circuit voltage of 618 mV and an optimum load power of 2214.32 μW . It
    can harvest the power (up to 9.14 μW ) from ambient wind with speed from 0.5 m/s
    to 6 m/s. The ElectroStatic Energy Harvesters (ESEHs) use the mechanical vibrations
    to move the charged capacitor plates of a variable capacitor structure against
    the electrostatic forces between the electrodes which are separated by air, vacuum,
    or a dielectric material [69]. Unlike PEHs and EMEHs, ESEHs require a DC voltage
    (bias voltage) supplied by a battery to oppositely charge the capacitor plates.
    ESEHs generate high output voltage and relatively larger output power density,
    provide a wider choice of frequencies at the low-frequency range, and offer the
    possibility to build low-cost devices. In [79] the authors present an ESEH (whose
    footprint is as small as 1 cm2) that can reach an output power of 495 μW sinusoidal
    vibration. Used in real life conditions, under impact vibration inside of a tire
    tread, the harvester generates an output power of 60 μW on a traveling speed of
    60 km/h. The result of the research contributes to the evolution of intelligent
    automobiles in terms of tire sensors (IoT devices). The work presented in [80]
    proposes an ESEH design based on the electrostatic coupling methods. The results
    demonstrate that the ESEH can harvest more than 1 μW from 59 to 148 Hz, and more
    than 0.5 μW from 14 to 152 Hz at an acceleration of 2 grms (Root Mean Square acceleration).
    It was successfully used to power an energy autonomous temperature sensor node
    with a data transmission beyond a distance of 10 m at 868 MHz. 2) Mechanical Pressure
    Energy Harvesting Mechanical pressure is exploited to implement energy harvesters
    using the piezoelectric method, but to a lesser extent than vibrations. For example,
    the work in article [81] demonstrates the feasibility of using this energy source.
    C. Human Energy Harvesting The human body is an energy warehouse which can ensure
    alterative power supply through the collection of energy from heat and motion
    [82]. This type of energy source can be exploited by wearable and implantable
    electronic devices that are IoT devices used to monitor the activity of healthy
    people or the patient’s condition. However, this energy harvesting approach encounters
    difficulties due to the following factors: human motion has a relatively low frequency
    (typically under several tens of Hz) and also it is highly stochastic and irregular;
    the human body temperature depends on the daytime rhythm and on the instant disturbance
    of daily activities performed [82]. Additionally, the devices must be worn by
    people and therefore they must have reasonable size and weight and must interfere
    only minimally with the natural functions of the body [83]. The research conducted
    in this field has focused on the extraction of energy from human body focusing
    on heat [84]–[91] and biomechanical energy [83], [92]–[96]. 1) Human Heat Energy
    Harvesting Human heat energy harvesting is based on the changes of the human body
    temperature and uses two types of energy harvesters: the ThermoElectric Energy
    Harvester (TEEH) that utilizes a spatial-temperature gradient and the PyroElectric
    Energy Harvester (PEEH) which requires a temporal variation in temperature. The
    work [84] presents an ultra-low power batteryless energy harvesting Body Sensor
    Node (BSN) capable of acquiring, processing, and transmitting ElectroCardioGram
    (ECG), ElectroMyoGram (EMG), and ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) data. The BSN is totally
    powered by a commercially available TEEH with about 60 μW output power with 30
    mV output voltage. In the heart-rate extraction mode where the transmitter is
    duty-cycled, the sensor node, including regulation, consumes only 19 μW . The
    authors of [85] describes a hidden TEEH of human body heat, integrated into an
    office shirt. It generates power in the range of 5-0.5 mW at ambient temperatures
    of 15 °C to 27 °C. The tests made highlight that the thermoelectric shirt produces
    more energy during nine months of use (if worn 10 h/day) than the energy stored
    in alkaline batteries of the same thickness and weight. Its technical properties
    make it a reliable power supply for low-power IoT devices used in healthcare.
    More information on TEEHs for human heat energy harvesting is provided in [86]–[88].
    The temperature variations of the human body are not high during the day. In this
    condition, the available heat energy for PEEHs is limited. This is why when it
    comes to human body energy harvesting applications, PEEHs are combined with other
    types of energy harvesters. Such an approach is demonstrated in [89] through a
    proof of concept of a hybrid harvester combining piezoelectric and pyroelectric
    properties for building self-powered healthy monitoring and interactive sensing
    systems. The tests made to determine the output voltage and current from the pyroelectric
    effect, in the absence of any strain, by varying the temperature of the hot plate
    to which the sensor is attached from 295 K to 303 K, yielded an output voltage
    and current pulse peaks up to 0.1 V and 20 nA respectively. These correspond to
    a peak power density of 2 mW / cm−3. Also, the approaches [90], [91] present viable
    hybrid solutions which include PEEHs to implement wearable IoT devices. 2) Biomechanical
    Energy Harvesting Biomechanical energy available from human motion can be classified
    into kinetic energy and elastic energy [82]. Given the complexity of the physical
    mechanisms, several types of energy harvesting devices are used: electromagnetic,
    electrostatic, piezoelectric, and triboelectric [82], [92]. Based on our review
    of the literature [82], [92]–[94] in this area, we found that a wide range of
    devices and applications have been reported. These published studies show that
    in terms of power generation, the electromagnetic energy harvesters are the best
    candidate to capture the kinetic energy. However, the benefit that the IoT devices
    based on smart material-based energy harvesters offer to those who wear them cannot
    be ignored. The authors of [95] described an electromagnetic energy harvester
    prototype to efficiently scavenge the kinetic energy of human limbs swing. In
    real walking conditions, the maximum power achieved was 1.84 mW and 2.95 mW for
    the device worn on the wrist and ankle respectively, while the corresponding power
    densities are 573.21 μW / cm3 and 919.01 μW / cm3, respectively. The results confirm
    that the energy harvester can entirely power a pedometer at various walking speeds.
    The work in [96] presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a fiber-based
    generator that converts biomechanical energy (motions/vibrations) into electricity
    using electrostatic mechanisms. The average output power density of ∼0.1 μW /
    cm2 makes this generator usable as an effective building element for a power shirt
    to trigger a wireless body temperature sensor system and as a self-powered active
    sensor to quantitatively detect human motion. D. Bioenergy Harvesting There are
    also more special types of energy harvesting. For example, the use of plants for
    generating the energy required for powering wireless sensors has been investigated
    in [97]. The plant-as-battery approach is meant to simplify the deployment of
    wireless sensors in agricultural applications, where the measurement of soil moisture,
    ambient humidity, or the monitoring of plants for detecting pests are some of
    their common functions. The authors of [97] describe an approach that exploits
    the ability of plants to produce electric signals that are harvested by a power
    management unit, generating a power between 800 and 1400 nW during a day. This
    energy is sufficient for transmitting an electric signal with a single switch
    using low power bistatic scatter radio principles. The use of soil energy for
    powering wireless sensors has been proposed in [98], where the temperature and
    air moisture are measured and transmitted using BLE technology to terminal devices
    such as smartphones. The soil cell fabricated by the authors supplies an average
    power of 60 to 100 μW which is sufficient to power the BLE sensor so that it can
    perform the aforementioned tasks. These approaches can help in the development
    of environmentally friendly monitoring applications in IoT contexts. E. Hybrid
    Energy Harvesting There are cases wherein the scavenging of energy from a single
    source does not generate the amount of power required for the operation of the
    IoT device at all times. This challenge led to the design of systems that include
    multiple energy harvesting units, combined with energy storage components [99].
    An example is solar energy harvesting. As we have mentioned earlier, generating
    DC from light can assure the required energy for the operation of wireless sensor
    nodes. However, the main drawback of using solar energy is its reliability, that
    is affected by weather conditions and spatial-temporal factors, such as the Sun’s
    position during the day [41]. Therefore, hybrid solutions, where solar energy
    harvesting is complemented by other mechanisms or power supplies have been proposed
    [41], [48], [99]. Hybrid energy harvesters combine circuits that generate power
    from single energy sources, such as solar, radio frequency, and vibrations and
    can also use multiple types of transduction mechanisms for converting energy to
    electricity [100]. By generating a power output equal to, or larger than the overall
    consumption of an IoT device for a certain period, energy-autonomy is achieved.
    In [101], the authors presented the design, implementation, and evaluation of
    a self-powered WSN node with wind, solar, and thermal energy. The average generated
    capacity by the harvesting mechanisms of 7805.09 J exceeds the energy consumption
    of the node, measured at approximately 2972 J, demonstrating the practicality
    of the hybrid approach. Table 1 presents a summary of this section. It describes
    each energy source along with the technology used to harvest it, the advantages
    and disadvantages of these technologies, the range of power density obtained,
    and the application domains that can get benefit if they use them to develop self-powered
    IoT devices. TABLE 1 Analysis of Energy Harvesting Techniques SECTION IV. Energy
    Harvesting Modeling The previous section presented the main energy sources and
    energy harvesting technologies that can be used to develop IoT devices. Regardless
    of the technology used, from the design phase of IoT devices with energy harvesting
    characteristics, we must maintain a balance between the generated and stored power
    and that which is consumed. In this context, various energy harvesting models
    and consumption models have been proposed for two main approaches, namely, Harvest-Store-Use
    and Harvest-Use (not very common and not suitable for energy sources that are
    uncontrollable or unpredictable). The energy harvesting models used in the Harvest-Store-Use
    approach take into account the capacity of the storage element (the harvested
    energy can always be stored, or the harvested energy can be stored up to a limit
    and the rest is lost). Also, the harvested energy can be modeled as a deterministic
    or a stochastic process. If the incoming energy and its fluctuations are known
    in advance, as in the case of predictable energy sources, the deterministic model
    is suitable. Otherwise, the stochastic approach is the right one. However, in
    each one of the cases, the basic idea for assuring battery-free operation for
    IoT devices is to harvest at least the amount of energy required for the proper
    operation of the electronics. Usually, the power source must provide enough energy
    for data processing operations, transmission and/or receive actions, and sleep
    periods. Figure 6 shows the voltage on a supercapacitor that is charged by a solar
    cell which powers a temperature sensor and a relative humidity wireless sensor.
    These sensors send data periodically to a cloud platform through the Internet.
    The graph indicates a favorable situation wherein the solar cell is capable to
    charge the storage element with enough energy for assuring autonomous operation.
    FIGURE 6. Voltage on the storage element (supercapacitor) during operation - T
    and RH Wi-Fi sensor [53]. Show All As we have previously mentioned, although energy
    harvesting poses many challenges, the majority of these can be overcome by efficient,
    energy aware, system designs [103]. Since the amount of scavenged energy is so
    low (as Table 1 shows), in most cases the energy harvesting IoT device must operate
    on amounts of power as low as possible. Several strategies have been proposed
    for prolonging the lifetime of wireless IoT devices, including duty-cycling [104],
    sleep scheduling [105], the reduction of the required transmission distance for
    IoT devices through efficient clustering [106], optimized strategies for adaptively
    setting the rates of sensor reading and data transmission depending on available
    energy [56], or the development of scheduling schemes that take into account power
    consumption when waking up the wireless sensing systems [107]. Some practical
    techniques for reducing the energy required by an IoT device, also used in the
    development of low-power embedded systems, include Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS)
    [108], the reduction of the frequency of the processing unit [109], or the appropriate
    selection of peripherals in the device [110] or of the type of memory involved
    in data processing and storage (i.e., Flash or RAM -- Random access memory) [111],
    the adaptation of transmission power depending on required communication range
    and environment [112], [113], or logic for deciding the moment and format for
    sending slow varying data [114]–[116]. All these approaches for assuring low-power
    operation must be scheduled and further modified depending also on the amount
    of energy that is generated or stored by the IoT device at each moment in time
    [50]. Since in most cases of wireless IoT devices, communication is the most expensive
    operation from an energy perspective [117], many of the research efforts focus
    on efficient communication protocols [117]–[121] and on the optimization of the
    transmission, through careful planning and simple data exchanges [114], [122],
    [123]. However, with the development of extremely low-power communication technologies,
    such as BLE [124], and the inclusion in the design of IoT devices of many sensors,
    some of them with special requirements regarding timing and energy supply, such
    as gas sensors, it is possible that sensing and data processing consume the most
    energy in their design [4], [125]. In these cases, algorithms for determining
    the optimal time for sensor sampling, considering the amount of energy scavenged
    and stored, must be developed for assuring energy autonomy in the case of energy
    harvesting IoT devices [50]. The calculation of the energy budget required by
    the IoT device during operation is also of great importance in the selection of
    a proper power source. The energy profile [104] of the IoT device can be used
    for estimating the amount of power required for its proper operation. Figure 7
    presents the power signature of an IoT device that measures the temperature, relative
    humidity, carbon dioxide level, absolute pressure, and light intensity, and sends
    the data to a predefined IP address using Wi-Fi connectivity and the User Datagram
    Protocol (UDP) protocol [126]. By knowing the amount of energy consumed during
    all the activities performed by the device and their duration, the average energy
    required by the system can be computed. This estimation can then be used for choosing
    strategies for optimizations (i.e., modifying the sleep / wakeup ratio, sampling
    sensors with different rates, etc.) and for properly designing the energy harvesting
    elements. FIGURE 7. Profile of the current drawn by a Wi-Fi sensor during wakeup
    (T, RH, P, CO2, and light intensity) [126]. Show All To ensure autonomy from an
    energy perspective, the energy harvesting elements in the IoT device’s structure
    must be capable of providing the energy required for its proper operation. Therefore,
    the prediction of the amount of energy harvested and stored energy is computed
    using energy harvesting and storage models. Next, we present a brief overview
    of energy harvesting models presented in the literature. In [127]–[130], the authors
    applied deterministic models for power management of the energy harvesting devices.
    The approach in [127] uses cooperative Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) protocols
    to balance the energy consumption of self-power devices to match their own battery
    recharge rate. The research has shown that cooperative ARQ enables wireless sensors
    to efficiently transmit data using lower levels of energy than in non-cooperative
    protocols. In [128] and [129], the authors describe an optimal scheduling scheme
    (power management algorithm) for IoT devices to maximize the average data transmission
    rate and to maintain the energy neutrality of these devices over a day. The work
    in [130] highlights an optimal scheduling scheme for an IoT device that uses two
    energy-harvesting sources (solar and wind). The proposed algorithm optimally sets
    the overall IoT device power consumption based on the utility and on the energy
    required by tasks, and uses the weather forecast information available at the
    beginning of each day and the power level of the storage element. Since the solutions
    developed based on the deterministic approach need accurate predictions of the
    system state, which are not always applicable to the IoT ecosystem, attention
    has shifted to stochastic models capable to adapt the energy management to the
    uncertainty of the energy harvesting method. Many approaches [131]–[139] in this
    direction are found in the literature. Some of these approaches use the Poisson
    process (which is a continuous-time Markov process) [131] or the Markov model
    [132]–[135], but in recent years researchers have developed other techniques that
    would be suitable in the energy harvesting modeling process, such as the Gama
    process [136], the Gaussian model [137], reinforcement learning methods [138],
    or the Kalman Filter based model [139] as we discuss below. The work in [135]
    introduces a stochastic model that uses Markov Chain theory to estimate the performance
    of battery-less IoT devices (using a capacitor as storage element) for uplink
    and downlink transmissions. The proposed model takes as inputs the current consumption
    of different device states, the capacitance, the energy harvesting power, how
    often a transmission will take place, the probability of receiving a downlink
    packet, the uplink and downlink packet size, and the Spreading Factor to be used.
    The Spreading Factor is the amount of spreading code applied to the original data
    signal and has values between 7 and 12 [140]. The model determines the uplink
    Packet Delivery Ratio achievable and the probabilities of successfully receiving
    downlink packets. The authors evaluated the performance of the proposed model
    in terms of the device configuration, application behavior, and environmental
    conditions. The results show that a capacitor of 47 mF can support a Spreading
    Factor of 7 for uplink and downlink at an energy harvesting rate of 1 mW, even
    when more than once per minute data transmissions are performed. A Spreading Factor
    of 11 can be supported by a supercapacitor of 1 F at an energy harvesting rate
    of 10 mW. Also, the authors stated that it is possible to achieve communication
    between battery-less IoT devices, but it must be pointed out that the turn-on
    voltage threshold of these devices significantly affects their performance. In
    [136], the authors proposed a stochastic model for a RF harvesting system that
    uses the gamma process to model the energy stored into the storage element (in
    this case a finite battery). They also used the renewal reward theory (a generalization
    of the Poisson process) to establish an optimal transmission policy to enhance
    the operation of the RF harvesting system. In [137], the authors presented single
    form accurate probabilistic energy models for hybrid power harvesting IoT devices.
    These models enable the dimensioning of the storage unit depending on the energy
    requirements of the device in whose structure it is used. Furthermore, the design
    and performance evaluation of hybrid energy harvesting IoT devices is facilitated
    by the predictability of energy harvesting systems parameters, such as the amounts
    of harvested, combined, and stored energy, and the efficiency of the recharging
    process, that is achieved in the proposed methodology. The authors of [138] proposed
    a reinforcement learning algorithm for solving the access control and continuous
    power control problems in an energy harvesting IoT system having limited uplink
    access channels. The energy harvesting IoT system analyzed is composed of multiple
    user devices and one base station. Simulation results have shown that the method
    proposed achieves better performance than other existing approaches (i.e., quasi
    binary power control, discrete power control, modified water-filling) in terms
    of throughput. The authors of [139] propose a platform suitable for BSNs. The
    BSN monitors and records the instantaneous usable power generated by wearable
    IoT devices with energy harvesting characteristics (solar and TEEH), while monitoring
    human activity and environmental data. To predict the amount of usable harvested
    energy based on environmental parameters (light intensity, temperature difference)
    and human behavior (activity level), the authors developed and validated a Kalman
    Filter based model. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is used to compare
    the prediction performance. The value of this metric for the proposed model is
    better compared with other models (regression, moving average, and exponential
    smoothing) used in the same testing conditions. Table 2 summarizes the aforementioned
    modeling approaches proposed for different types of energy sources and highlights
    the goals and the main results obtained. TABLE 2 Summary of Energy Harvesting
    Models As Table 2 shows, energy harvesting systems adopt the Harvest-Store-Use
    architecture in the case of unpredictable or non-controllable energy sources.
    Therefore, energy storage is of paramount importance in the design and operation
    of energy harvesting IoT devices. As pointed above, many energy harvesting designs
    assume that energy generation is not constant, and can only be predicted, and
    therefore the efficient management and proper use of the energy stored in supercapacitors
    or batteries is required. The two options for energy storage in energy harvesting
    IoT devices include rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors, each one of them
    having their own advantages and limitations [141]. There are also systems that
    include both batteries and supercapacitors, leading to energy supplies that respond
    better to high discharge pulses [142]. Batteries are the main choice because of
    their high energy density, but supercapacitors are more often considered due to
    their high maximum recharging cycle lifetime, that can result in longer service
    life of the device they are powering. However, supercapacitors or electric double-layer
    capacitors, that are nothing more than extremely large value capacitors, cannot
    come close to the energy density offered by batteries, and suffer from high self-discharge
    rates, of 30% as compared to 5% encountered in batteries [103], [141]. Modeling
    the behavior of supercapacitors has important implications for the design of energy
    harvesting IoT devices [143]. Efficient energy modeling of energy harvesting IoT
    devices enables the design of optimal energy buffers for achieving uninterrupted
    operation. This challenge of designing proper energy buffers was previously solved
    by over-dimensioning [144]. SECTION V. Case Study Systems In this section, we
    present two IoT case study systems, in which the sensing devices are fitted with
    energy harvesting mechanisms helping them achieve energy autonomy. We describe
    the implementation details of the hardware along with considerations and lessons
    learned from the corresponding design, implementation, and operation phases. In
    the first case study, we used solar energy harvesting, while the second case study
    is based on RF energy harvesting. Both systems use environmental BLE beacons,
    that operate in an IoT scenario (Figure 8), thus becoming IoT sensing devices
    [50], [126]. Beacons are a class of wireless sensing systems that only transmit
    data to base stations which can be fixed or mobile [115]. The IoT devices in the
    two case studies (monitoring systems) broadcast the measured parameters, and BLE-enabled
    terminals (such as smartphones) receive this data. The smartphones running monitoring
    applications relay the data to the cloud through Internet links. Using cloud computing
    resources, we can perform data processing, visualization, and prediction on the
    data stored in the cloud. FIGURE 8. IoT scenario for use-case systems’ operation.
    Adapted from [50], [126]. Show All A. Solar-Powered Environmental BLE Beacon 1)
    Case Study System Overview BLE is a wireless communication technology [145] that
    is being increasingly used in IoT applications because of its simplicity, ubiquity
    in most current electronic devices, and low power operation [146], [147]. Applications
    such as retail [124], environmental monitoring [125], indoor localization [148],
    museum guiding [149], or inventory management [150] are using BLE beacons. The
    IoT sensor device presented in [126] measures light intensity, temperature, and
    relative humidity of the environment. We have described the advantages and limitations
    posed by BLE devices advertising the acquired data to nearby monitoring applications
    in general and of this device in particular in our previous work [126]. Here,
    we focus on the energy harvesting mechanism that was used in the device’s architecture
    and the strategies that were implemented for achieving energy autonomy. We achieved
    energy independence even in the case when a modified variant of the IoT device
    was fitted with a CCS811 gas sensor [50], [151]. It is a well-known fact that
    the use of gas sensors in energy-constrained devices, such as wireless sensors,
    is problematic due to their requirements in terms of power and wake-up times.
    The work in [50] presents the use of adaptive duty-cycling strategies that resulted
    in energy-efficient autonomous operation of the IoT device. 2) Hardware Architecture
    The architecture of the IoT device consists of a programmable BLE-enabled radio
    on chip component, the Cypress Semiconductor EZ-BLE PRoC Module [152], an SHT21
    temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) sensor [153], an MPL115A2, absolute
    pressure (P) sensor [154], and a PT3001 digital ambient light sensor [155]. The
    power source includes a bq25504 ultra low-power boost converter with battery management
    for energy harvesting applications [156], two IXYS KXOB22- 04×3L amorphous silicon
    solar cells connected in series [157], a single-cell coin rechargeable battery
    (accumulator) [158], and two TPS78330DDCT low-dropout linear regulators (LDOs)
    [159]. Figure 9 shows theses various components and Figure 10 shows the integrated
    hardware. As the solar energy source cannot be controlled, the device is built
    using a generate-store-use architecture, where a rechargeable battery stores the
    energy that is subsequently supplied to the electronics of the device. FIGURE
    9. Architecture of solar-powered BLE beacon [50], [126]. Show All FIGURE 10. Manufactured
    solar-powered BLE beacon (CCS811 not populated). Show All To enable better control
    over the power consumption of the device, two TPS78330DDCT Low-DropOut linear
    regulators (LDOs) were used for providing power to the processing and sensing
    parts of the device. Therefore, the firmware can control the power source for
    both the central part of the device and the sensing component. As the beacon periodically
    samples the sensors in its structure, processes the acquired data, and broadcasts
    it, the sensors’ power supply can be switched off between readings so that the
    overall power consumption of the system can be minimized. 3) Optimizations for
    Achieving Energy Autonomy and Results Our initial work has shown that the BLE
    beacon can achieve energy autonomy without requiring advanced power-optimization
    techniques when the gas sensor is not operational [126]. The setting of the processor’s
    clock frequency to a value of 3 MHz, the readings of the attached sensors (T,
    RH, P, light) once every minute, and the transmission of an advertisement every
    3 s resulted in a 37 μA average current drawn by the device. This value is sufficiently
    low to allow stand-alone operation, with the solar cells being capable of charging
    the accumulator within a single day with good weather. In this scenario, the sensors
    are powered only once a minute, when they are read, and the resulting data is
    used to update the advertisement packet. The control module spends almost all
    the time in sleep mode and wakes up once every three seconds for 3 ms to transmit
    the advertisement packet, and 140 ms every minute for communicating with the attached
    sensors. The addition of the CCS811 gas sensor in the design of the IoT device
    for providing data regarding the eCO2 (equivalent CO2) and Total Volatile Organic
    Compounds (TVOC) levels in the air required the use of more complex mechanisms
    for achieving autonomy from an energy perspective [50]. These firmware optimization
    mechanisms were needed because of the higher power consumption and requirement
    for longer wake-up periods of the gas sensor. We implemented adaptive duty-cycling
    strategies in the design of the firmware running on the IoT device considering
    the light intensity and the amount of energy stored in the accumulator. We incorporate
    these strategies to lower the overall power consumption of the IoT device. Furthermore,
    the advertising interval also had to be increased for reducing the overall energy
    consumption of the IoT device. Thus, we used an interval of 5 s instead of the
    previous 3 s interval. The IoT device consumes more energy when the attached sensors
    are active and take measurements than when the transmission of advertisements
    of the collected data takes place. Therefore, the sensors in the structure of
    the IoT device are sampled with different rates, depending on their power consumption
    and on the voltage value estimated for the rechargeable battery and as well on
    the light intensity. Thus, the T, RH, and the light intensity sensors are powered
    up and read every minute, when the battery voltage is also measured and computed
    using a special circuit in the design as described in [50]. If the intensity of
    light and the battery level are above some thresholds, the wake-up period is prolonged,
    and the gas sensor performs the reading operation. Otherwise, the reading of the
    CCS811 sensor is postponed until a future wake-up period with favorable conditions
    (battery level and light intensity are above previously set thresholds) takes
    place. By choosing appropriate values for the thresholds and for the maximum number
    of delay periods for the reading of the gas sensor, efficient activity planning
    that enables energy autonomy can be reached despite unfavorable weather conditions
    (presence of clouds) and of the day/night cycle, as the results in [50] have shown.
    We achieve this result by carefully dimensioning (size of the solar cells in the
    structure of the IoT device) the energy harvesting circuits and by efficient hardware
    and software designs (separate power source for the sensors, battery level measurement
    circuit, adaptive duty-cycling strategy). B. RF Energy Harvesting Environmental
    BLE Beacon 1) Case Study System Overview In the second use case system, we replaced
    the power source of the BLE beacon by an RF energy harvesting element as Figure
    11 shows. The IoT device in this case is also based on a harvest-store-use architecture.
    Figure 11 shows the block diagram of the system [4]. FIGURE 11. Architecture of
    RF-powered BLE beacon [4]. Show All The resulting IoT device operates in a similar
    way as the previous system we have described in the previous section. However,
    due to the smaller amounts of scavenged energy using RF harvesting elements, it
    was not possible to power on the CCS811 gas sensor. Since the generated energy
    cannot sustain the operation of the CCS811 gas sensors, the RF energy harvesting
    BLE beacon presented can measure T, RH, light intensity, and atmospheric pressure.
    2) Hardware Architecture As Figure 11 shows, the power supply of the first use
    case system was replaced by an RF energy harvesting circuit that charges a supercapacitor.
    Since the CCS811 gas sensor requires energy levels that cannot be provided by
    the energy harvesting circuit and longer wakeup periods, it was removed from the
    IoT device. The power supply consists of a P1110 Powerharvester charging module
    [160], to which a 50 mF capacitor is connected for storing the generated energy.
    The P1110 evaluation board generates energy from signals having frequencies in
    the range of 850–950 MHz and charges the on-board supercapacitor powering the
    BLE-enabled IoT device. Although a capacitor assuring many charging-discharging
    cycles is used instead of a rechargeable battery, it suffers from having high
    leakage current, with values (5– 10 μA ) comparable to the sleep current ( ∼1−10
    μA ) of wireless sensor nodes. In the setup presented here, the 50 mF capacitor
    discharges itself from 3.3 V to 2.3 V in less than 5 hours. A Global System for
    Mobile Communications (GSM) phone operating within a band close to the one required
    by the P1110 module (2G technology) placed at 5 cm from the harvester antenna
    is able to charge the capacitor to 3.3 V in less than three minutes. By knowing
    these values and the energy profile of the powered IoT device, an estimation of
    the rate at which the energy harvesting mechanism should charge the energy storage
    element can be computed, and adjustments to the design of the entire system can
    be performed. We have presented a detailed description of the design and the experimental
    results obtained in [4]. 3) Optimizations for Achieving Energy Autonomy and Results
    The firmware on the IoT device implements a simple duty-cycled system where the
    attached sensors are read every 30 seconds and the advertisement period is set
    to 3 seconds. Since we wanted to test the feasibility of using RF energy harvesting
    for such a system, no other optimizations were performed on the application running
    on the central unit of the IoT device. Our experimental results demonstrated that
    the 30 cm2 antenna of the P1110 RF Powerharvester can deliver the power required
    by the IoT device that samples the attached sensors every half minute and sends
    an advertisement packet every 3 seconds, when a 2G GSM phone closer than 10 cm
    is in an active call. However, this was made possible after finding the optimal
    distance between the energy source and the energy harvesting component and the
    proper alignment between the two. The supercapacitor in the design is another
    challenge because of its high self-discharge current, and should be replaced by
    other, more efficient, energy storage elements. Another challenge when designing
    such circuits is represented by the efficient measurement of the signals involved.
    For example, the current drawn by the BLE beacon varies in a very short amount
    of time between microamperes and tens or hundreds of milliamperes. This quick
    variation requires measurement equipment with wide input ranges and large sampling
    rates. However, probably the biggest challenge when designing RF energy harvesting
    IoT devices is in the miniaturization of the hardware. IoT-enabled sensors should
    have small form factors and should be low cost, while better RF energy systems
    require larger antennas and more complex circuitry. Although the work presented
    in [4] demonstrated that RF energy harvesting could generate enough power for
    certain IoT devices, this is possible only when specific conditions (such as an
    active source in the immediate proximity of the system, signal in the frequency
    range required by the harvester) are met. C. Discussions and Lessons Learnt From
    the Case Study Systems Energy Harvesting Designs The development and analysis
    of the operation of the IoT devices presented here identified several design issues
    that could be useful for researchers focusing on energy harvesting IoT devices’
    implementations. 1) Hardware The hardware design of the two case study systems
    demonstrated that significant energy savings can be achieved by using simple methods.
    One is the use of a separate power source for the sensors attached to the IoT
    device. This way, the software has control over the operation of the sensors and
    can efficiently schedule their active periods. This design feature enabled the
    solar powered IoT device to adapt the reading of the attached sensors depending
    on the amount of energy generated and on the level of the accumulator. Another
    useful energy saving feature is the lowering of the operational frequency of the
    microcontroller. The frequency value should be close to the one that makes the
    static component of the current drawn by the IoT device the main consumer, and
    not the dynamic one. Reducing the operating frequency from 48 MHz to 12 MHz did
    not significantly increase the data processing time, but considerably lowered
    the power consumption. 2) Energy Harvester There is a category of energy harvesting
    methods which can provide sufficient energy for prolonged periods of time and
    also offer the advantage of miniaturization. These include solar cells and piezoelectric
    circuits. On the other hand, there are energy harvesting mechanisms that generate
    small amounts of energy at discrete moments in time, while also occupying more
    space. An example of such a method is RF energy harvesting. This represents a
    major challenge in the development of energy harvesting IoT devices, since these
    must be small and based on simple designs. Currently, these requirements seem
    to be fulfilled in a more facile way by the first category of energy harvesting
    mechanisms (solar cells and piezoelectric circuits). One option for using RF energy
    harvesting could be to embed the antenna into objects such as clothes in the case
    of wearable IoT devices. An energy budget of between 50 and 60 μ Ah generated
    by an energy harvesting circuit could assure autonomous operation from an energy
    perspective, without the need of using a battery as the main power supply, for
    a wide range of IoT devices. Given that we expect billions of IoT devices deployed
    in coming years, energy harvesting could provide significant savings in terms
    of energy and of materials and efforts used for the manufacturing and disposal
    of batteries. 3) Software Algorithms for optimizing the energy consumption can
    overcome problems such as the non-controllability of the energy source. The firmware
    developed for the first use case system, that generates energy from sunlight,
    manages to adapt the operation of the IoT device and reduce the energy used during
    periods when the conditions are not favorable (cloudy weather, nighttime, small
    amount of energy stored in the accumulator). Software plays a major role in the
    prediction of harvested energy in the case of solar energy, while in the case
    of RF energy harvesting, hardware seems to be more important in optimizing the
    operation of the IoT device. The use of an algorithm for selectively sending data
    depending on its variation (i.e., send more rarely slow changing data) would increase
    energy efficiency in both cases. 4) Cost Our case study systems show that energy
    harvesting leads to an increase of the cost of an IoT device of 15 to 20 Euros.
    However, in many designs, energy harvesting could provide at least the energy
    required for sleep mode periods and for leakage currents. If we assume a sleep
    current between 3 and 10 μA , this could lead to savings of 26.3 to 87.6 mAh for
    the main energy source, that could be a battery. For an energy efficient IoT device,
    this could mean doubling of its lifetime, from 5 to 10 years. SECTION VI. Technical
    Challenges Even if have witnessed recent advances in the design and development
    of energy harvesting devices over the past decade, several technological challenges
    still need to be addressed before the manufacturing of self-sustainable IoT devices
    becomes prevalent. Some of them are: Harvested energy modeling. A balance between
    the generated power and the consumed power must be maintained. This implies the
    efficient power profiling of IoT devices and the adaptation of their operation
    to the amount of harvested energy. The availability of the harvested energy varies
    mostly with time in a non-deterministic manner. Therefore, the estimation of the
    amount of energy scavenged is computed using prediction techniques and conventional
    power management approaches (i.e., Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and software
    Phase Locked Loops (PLL)) are applied to manage the power coming from the energy
    sources. Recently proposed energy forecasting models should be improved to provide
    accurate results, while the power management choices should be made to minimize
    the loss of energy. Additionally, the power source must provide enough energy
    for the following tasks: data processing operations, transmission and/or receive
    actions, and sleep periods. In most cases, it is not the data processing that
    is the most energy-demanding task. It is the transmission and reception of data
    over the wireless Internet. Therefore, future researchers should develop optimized
    consumption models to minimize the energy cost during wireless data transmissions
    and investigate novel techniques to adapt the wireless communication protocols
    according to the energy harvesting process’ characteristics. Harvested energy
    storage. This involves the development of suitable storage elements such as rechargeable
    batteries and supercapacitors because the technology used for storing the harvested
    energy affects the cost, size, and the operating life of the IoT devices. Batteries
    have high energy densities, but they are not well suited for long-life IoT devices
    due to the cycling degradation phenomenon [161]. Moreover, both high and low temperatures
    reduce their capabilities. Supercapacitors have lower energy density than batteries,
    but cyclic degradation does not affect them. Furthermore, supercapacitors suffer
    from increased current leakage that would consume a large part of the harvested
    energy. Therefore, future researchers should investigate new techniques that can
    find the best candidate for harvested energy storage which must meet the following
    criteria: low cycling degradation, low current leakage, high energy density, and
    continued operation even in harsh environments such as at very low and very high
    temperatures. Energy harvesting from multiple sources. There are cases wherein
    a single source of energy harvesting is insufficient to power IoT devices. By
    combining energy from multiple sources, the reliability of IoT devices can be
    increased. The work in [162] presents the recent developed architectures and techniques
    of low power management circuits that use energy harvested from multiple heterogeneous
    sources of energy. The analysis highlights that the proposed architectures are
    suitable for specific applications. For example, the complementary use of harvesters
    or the Power ORing topology are simple schemes appropriate in cases where it is
    not expected that all the input energy sources deliver a significant amount of
    power at the same time. The multiple input switched-inductor and switched-capacitor
    converter architectures are also used to combine energy for heterogeneous sources.
    Regardless of the chosen architecture, designers must consider the development
    of configurable impedance matching schemes for the purpose of MPPT control. Researchers
    should also focus their attention on the development of intelligent algorithms
    capable of selecting the input sources of energy depending on their availability
    thereby eliminating the need for the energy storage element. Size and cost efficiency.
    There are situations where the size and the weight of IoT devices are critical
    (i.e., wearable and implantable IoT devices). But these devices produce a small
    amount of energy which is not enough to be used to perform their main functions
    (i.e., powering the device and the attached sensors, data transmission). Small-scale
    harvesting solutions (micro, nano) that can power IoT devices and support the
    operation of other functions (i.e., monitoring the health status of patients,
    acting as stimulators for regenerating tissues) must be developed considering
    the low cost of fabrication. The scientific literature emphasizes that PEHs can
    be effectively used for powering small and very-small IoT devices. Therefore,
    future researchers should develop new eco-friendly materials to enable micro and
    nanofabrication of PEHs with improved flexibility and output power density. Recent
    advances in the field of microelectronics are promising and can be used to develop
    robust, miniaturized, low power, and low-cost energy harvesters. Environmental
    impact with renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources help to mitigate
    environmental pollution, and thus, they are used to develop new IoT devices because
    this industry has experienced a significant growth in the past few years. Batteries
    used in IoT devices without energy harvesting mechanisms eventually get depleted
    and, in some cases, they are thrown away in several weeks or months. If there
    are no battery recycling mechanisms, then the environment suffers. The challenge
    in this case is the development of energy harvesting IoT devices with a lifetime
    significantly longer than the one provided by batteries. Also, it is worth noting
    that some energy harvesting IoT devices employ toxic or rare materials (i.e.,
    bismuth telluride for TEEHs, lead zirconate titanate for PEHs, cadmium for PV).
    Therefore, the use of eco-friendly materials, such as electroactive polymers,
    carbon nanowire semiconductors, to design the electronics components of the energy
    harvesting IoT devices is another challenge that must be addressed. Biodegradable
    and biocompatible IoT devices must be considered by developers of such devices
    for a sustainable future. SECTION VII. Conclusion Energy harvesting has been receiving
    a lot of attention by various research communities and industry involved in the
    design and implementation of self-powered IoT devices. In this article, we analyzed
    the energy harvesting technologies used primarily in the IoT environment. We conclude
    that some energy harvesting technologies can provide a significant amount of energy
    for a long time using small size PV cells or piezoelectric devices. In contrast,
    other energy harvesting techniques provide a small amount of energy at discrete
    moments of time and require large circuits for capturing the energy, but they
    do not depend on certain cycles such as day/night, working days/weekends, nor
    are they easy to shield (i.e., RF). The appropriate energy harvesting technique
    depends mainly on the parameter to be measured, the use case scenario of the IoT
    device (fixed/mobile, surface/built-in), but also on its location (indoor/outdoor).
    To demonstrate the potential of solar and RF energy sources, we described two
    IoT case study systems from our previous work with harvesting mechanisms in terms
    of their design, hardware implementation and operation. Finally, we have discussed
    some future technical challenges, whose addressing will facilitate the large-scale
    deployment of energy harvesting solutions for IoT. List of Acronyms AbbreviationExpansion

    (PLF) encompasses the combined application of single technologies or multiple
    tools in integrated systems for real-time and individual monitoring of livestock.
    In grazing systems, some PLF applications could substantially improve farmers’
    control of livestock by overcoming issues related to pasture utilisation and management,
    and animal monitoring and control. A focused literature review was carried out
    to identify technologies already applied or at an advanced stage of development
    for livestock management in pastures, specifically cattle, sheep, goats, pigs,
    poultry. Applications of PLF in pasture-based systems were examined for cattle,
    sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry. The earliest technology applied to livestock
    was the radio frequency identification tag, allowing the identification of individuals,
    but also for retrieving important information such as maternal pedigree. Walk-over-weigh
    platforms were used to record individual and flock weights. Coupled with automatic
    drafting systems, they were tested to divide the animals according to their needs.
    Few studies have dealt with remote body temperature assessment, although the use
    of thermography is spreading to monitor both intensively reared and wild animals.
    Global positioning system and accelerometers are among the most applied technologies,
    with several solutions available on the market. These tools are used for several
    purposes, such as animal location, theft prevention, assessment of activity budget,
    behaviour, and feed intake of grazing animals, as well as for reproduction monitoring
    (i.e., oestrus, calving, or lambing). Remote sensing by satellite images or unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs) seems promising for biomass assessment and herd management
    based on pasture availability, and some attempts to use UAVs to monitor, track,
    or even muster animals have been reported recently. Virtual fencing is among the
    upcoming technologies aimed at grazing management. This system allows the management
    of animals at pasture without physical fences but relies on associative learning
    between audio cues and an electric shock delivered if the animal does not change
    direction after the acoustic warning. Regardless of the different technologies
    applied, some common constraints have been reported on the application of PLF
    in grazing systems, especially when compared with indoor or confined livestock
    systems. Battery lifespan, transmission range, service coverage, storage capacity,
    and economic affordability were the main factors. However, even if the awareness
    of the existence and the potential of these upcoming tools are still limited,
    farmers’ and researchers’ demands are increasing, and positive outcomes in terms
    of rangeland conservation, animal welfare, and labour optimisation are expected
    from the spread of PLF in grazing systems. Previous article in issue Next article

    Implications New technologies help farmers to improve animal welfare and management,
    and to deepen understanding of animal behaviours. They are already applied in
    intensive rearing systems but could also be useful in pasture-based systems, where
    livestock control can be difficult owing to their physical scale, variability,
    and density of the feed base and remoteness. Raising awareness of available technological
    solutions for extensive farming conditions could enhance the adoption among farmers
    and researchers. Increasing their use in grazing systems could be also beneficial
    for animal welfare and rangeland conservation, as well as supporting farmers in
    decision-making, reducing workload, and increasing profits. Introduction Precision
    Livestock Farming (PLF) is defined as “individual animal management by continuous
    real-time monitoring of health, welfare, production/reproduction, and environmental
    impact” (Berckmans, 2017). PLF includes the combined application of single or
    multiple tools in integrated systems. This has been made possible by technological
    developments over the last 20 years in fields such as information and communication
    technologies, internet of things, wireless communication networks, and Internet
    access availability (Terrasson et al., 2017). Advances in engineering and biomaterials
    research, which have led to the miniaturisation of electronic devices and decreased
    cost of electronics, have also been pivotal drivers for the diffusion of PLF (Neethirajan
    et al., 2017). PLF could provide farmers with continuous, non-intrusive, and objective
    data collection, able to detect small but significant changes in behavioural patterns
    or apparently unrelated parameters, which greatly improve farmers’ decision management
    (Frost et al., 1997). In pasture-based systems, this type of support for farmers
    is very important considering that farmer’s control on animal is less frequent.
    In the last decades, the PLF sector has rapidly evolved, from its earlier applications
    for electronic milk meters to novel wearable sensors and integrated systems capable
    of detecting an animal’s physiological and reproductive status with acceptable
    reliability through behaviour analysis, rumination monitoring, and online real-time
    data harvesting (Halachmi et al., 2019). The information collected is elaborated
    and made available to end-users on smartphones and laptops, enabling farmers to
    put in practice better management of one or more production inputs or to identify
    and intervene before the onset of clinical illness (Andonovic et al., 2018). Currently,
    PLF is mainly developed for intensive farming systems, especially indoors, where
    farm structures and facilities are well suited for the needs of present digitisation
    (limited space, control of environmental conditions, easy access to electricity,
    and information and communication technologies). However, PLF could also be very
    useful in pasture-based systems, especially during seasonal grazing, when farmers’
    control of livestock can be difficult owing to the physical scale of pasture-based
    systems, variability, and density of the feed base and remoteness. The application
    of PLF to livestock systems has already been reviewed by several authors (Neethirajan,
    2017, Neethirajan et al., 2017, Halachmi et al., 2019), without regard to the
    rearing systems where the devices were applied. A focus on pasture-based/extensive
    livestock systems was addressed by Handcock et al., 2009, González et al., 2014,
    and Bailey et al. (2021) who examined the use of PLF technologies to monitor cattle
    behaviour and management at pasture. Odintsov Vaintrub et al., 2021, Fogarty et
    al., 2018 reviewed the application of PLF in sheep farming. Recently, Herlin et
    al. (2021) examined the use of digital tools to assess animal welfare in grazing
    cattle and sheep. The present work aimed to provide a focused review on the available
    PLF technologies for livestock on pasture-based systems, as well as to identify
    the main hurdles to further adoption of PLF applications in these systems. Material
    and methods Screening An extensive literature screening, as shown in Fig. 1, was
    performed to evaluate the state of the art application of PLF in pasture-based
    farming systems. The search was conducted on Google Scholar® and Scopus® databases,
    without any limits on the date, country, or climate. Download : Download high-res

    searching process based on keywords related to the parameter of interest (e.g.,
    BW, Temperature, position, activity, health, etc.), rearing system, sensor (e.g.,
    accelerometer, global positioning systems, virtual fencing, etc.), species (e.g.,
    cattle, sheep, goat, poultry, pig, etc.), and the following selection process
    according to chosen selection criteria (e.g., year of publication, testing conditions,
    novelty, development state). Abbreviations: PLF = precision livestock farming;
    RFID = radiofrequency identification; eID = electronic identification; UAV = unmanned
    aerial vehicle; GPS = global positioning system. Three consecutive approaches
    were used to carry out the screening process: (i) use of combined keywords, such
    as “PLF” AND parameter of interest (e.g., temperature, BW, virtual fencing, etc.)
    AND “extensive” OR “grazing” OR “pasture”; (ii) use of the specific PLF technology
    as keyword (e.g., Global positioning system (GPS), accelerometer, etc.) AND the
    animal species (“cattle,” “bovine,” “sheep,” “goat,” “beef,” “dairy,” “pig,” “swine,”
    “Sus scrofa,” “chicken,” “poultry”); (iii) examination of the references reported
    both in the reviews on PLF and in the articles selected in steps (i) and (ii).
    This third screening phase was carried out to check whether additional articles
    were considered suitable for the chosen topic. Selection After the screening phase,
    articles were grouped according to the technologies used and the objective of
    each PLF application (e.g., GPS for location, tracking, or behavioural studies;
    accelerometers for health monitoring, oestrus detection, etc.). This grouping
    established the main structure of the present work, as described in Section 3.
    Among the articles resulting from the screening phase, an initial selection was
    performed by examining every Material and Methods section. This phase was mainly
    aimed at ensuring that the PLF technologies reported were actually applied in
    pasture-based systems, and the devices were tested under field conditions. Then,
    the remaining articles were examined in greater depth to identify the ones most
    representative of each selected technology. Since the objective of the present
    work was to perform a focused literature review, a further and final selection
    step was carried out using the publication year as the preferential criterion
    to choose the most recent studies between similar ones, especially for those technologies
    that are more widespread, such as GPS. A summary of the articles selected for
    the type of device and animal species is presented in Table 1. Table 1. Number

    2 Precision Livestock Farming applications in pasture-based systems The applications
    of PLF in pasture-based systems were reviewed, considering both precommercial
    research technologies and commercial solutions. PLF technologies were organised
    according to the aim for which they were used and the parameters they assessed.
    Some are already used in intensive livestock systems but have also been applied
    in pasture-based systems, while others are specifically thought to address specific
    issues related to pasture-based systems. The variable development stages were
    also noted. Some devices developed for scientific research were also reported
    because of their indirect contribution to outlining novel management practices
    with effective applications in rangelands. Animal identification Several animal
    identification methods are used, some of which rely on technologies already available
    on the market or at the final development stages, as recently reviewed by Awad
    (2016). According to the classification performed by Awad (2016), classical cattle
    identification systems were grouped into permanent methods (ear notching, ear
    tattooing, hot iron, or freeze branding), temporary methods (ear tagging with
    plastic or metal tags), and electronic methods. Electrical methods mainly consist
    of radio frequency identification tags (RFID) and can be grouped into boluses,
    ear tags, and injectable glass tags. The tag on the animal transmits the information
    by radiofrequency to the tag reader; usually, this is the only part of the system
    that requires an external power source. RFID offers an easy and affordable way
    to identify, track, and monitor livestock, thus improving the traceability of
    animals along the supply chain (Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). The adoption of
    RFID technology in practical farm management has allowed the development of managerial
    software where daily records on individuals (e.g., medical treatments, growth
    performance, pedigree, reproductive performance, etc.) are automatically stored
    (Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). The most widespread is the electronic ear tag,
    which is widely used in grazing systems and is a mandatory identification system
    in some countries. The endo-ruminal bolus is less widely used (Rutter, 2017).
    Compared to RFID ear tags, injectable RFID tags offer a high level of reliability
    and security and are difficult to remove, modify, or lose (Carné et al., 2009).
    However, this also means that transponder recovery can be difficult along the
    supply chain (Awad, 2016). In addition, in crowded conditions, such as in cows
    in the milking parlour, Štoković et al. (2009) observed reading failure using
    an endo-ruminal bolus, whereas Pinna et al. (2006) reported 100% readability in
    static conditions (restrained animals) using a hand-held tag reader. Lately, also
    smart ear tag embedded with accelerometer to detect several parameters related
    to animal welfare and reproductive performances are available on market (e.g.
    Allflex SenseHub®, SCR Engineers Ltd.). They can also be used to identify the
    individuals, but their recognition as an official identification system depends
    on countries. Body weight Accurate measurement of BW is important for livestock
    management at pasture; indeed, i.e. it is critical for determining stocking rates.
    As reported by Wangchuk et al. (2018), though the weighing scale is the gold standard
    for obtaining direct measures, it is time-consuming and stressful for animals;
    additionally, its use is not always easy depending on farm facilities and animal
    location (e.g., for animals kept in seasonal pastures). Wangchuk et al. (2018)
    reported several techniques for estimating the BW of livestock, starting from
    linear body measurements. These are less accurate than weighing scales and do
    not address the issue of individual animal handling. To overcome these problems,
    platforms known as “Walk-over-Weigh” (WOW) have been developed and applied in
    the dairy industry (Brown et al., 2015). However, they have become an option in
    pasture-based systems where animals remain for weeks or even months without being
    handled. Some improvements made in recent years, such as solar-powered batteries
    and data transmission systems, have allowed their use in rangelands for sheep
    and cattle. The WOW consists of a specially designed crate on which the animal
    walks, allowing the body mass to be estimated using continuous averaging techniques
    (González-García et al., 2018). They can also be equipped with a tag reader to
    automatically identify the animal being weighed. The WOW is usually placed at
    a restricted entry point for an attractant (e.g., feed, water) so that when the
    animal enters, it is weighed and identified. Growth rates can then be calculated
    and used as prediction tools to monitor the condition of the animals, for example,
    for the early detection of pasture-borne nematode infections (Segerkvist et al.,
    2020), as well as to open new pasture areas when scarcity of resources start affecting
    the growth. Automated data harvesting reduces stress on animals (with no handling
    necessary) and labour. However, raw data need to be checked, manually or by software,
    to delete inaccurate records that might be generated. Bad data can also be produced
    if, for example, the animal is running, if more than one animal stands on the
    scale at once, or if animals stand with only two legs on the platform (Brown et
    al., 2015). Recently, attention has been focused on problems related to repeatability
    and data accumulation. Brown et al. (2014) reported that at least 3 weeks were
    required to obtain the 12 consecutive individual records required to estimate
    live weight. Repeatability found by Simanungkalit et al. (2020) in grazing cattle
    was slightly higher than that found by Brown et al. (2014); however, at least
    five to ten individual measurements were needed to reach consistent weight records.
    González-García et al. (2018) suggested that, by providing 2–3 weeks of adaptation
    and using a ‘flow-control’ device (S module), would be possible to overcome most
    of the problems reported in former studies. However, the time needed for the system
    to ‘learn’ each animal remains an issue for rapid decision-making. A WOW system
    without a tag reader but coupled with a device for data storage was used for overall
    live weight assessment (Brown et al., 2012). In this case, an average of 5 days
    was enough to estimate flock weight with 95% confidence intervals of less than
    2 kg, and was also cheaper and simpler than a WOW linked to individual identification.
    Differences in consecutive live weight measures were used by Aldridge et al.,
    2017, Menzies et al., 2018a to identify the postpartum anoestrus interval of grazing
    cattle, thus enhancing reproductive efficiency and supporting genetic selection.
    Menzies et al. (2018a) concluded that this application of WOW was promising, but
    further research was required for the 10 days of accuracy obtained on the parturition
    date to be sufficiently reliable for genetic programmes. Image analysis based
    on 2D and 3D sensors is gaining attention to estimate body condition scores, BW,
    and morphometric evaluations. This would provide farmers with contactless, automated,
    real-time, and continuous detection of two parameters of pivotal importance for
    breeding, animal welfare (Qiao et al., 2021, Kamchen et al., 2021), and to determine
    when the animal has reached the market’s requirements for slaughtering. However,
    these techniques have, to date, been tested mainly in indoor systems, most likely
    because of the need for optimal and constant environmental conditions to obtain
    animal contours, as well as animal motion and position in front of the sensor
    to extract useful features reliably (Qiao et al., 2021). For pigs, Ymaging® (Spain)
    (see Table 2) has recently developed a portable device called PigWei to estimate
    pig live weight both indoors and outdoors; it offers a specific customisation
    for Iberian pigs reared both indoors and outdoors. Table 2. Main systems on the

    GPS = Global Positioning System. 1 Functionalities as reported on the website
    of the seller. Automatic drafting systems Automatic drafting systems generally
    rely on the combined use of other PLF devices, such as WOW and/or RFID. Farms
    endowed with automatic drafting gates can divide animals in the herd according
    to the features of interest. For instance, animals that have reached the slaughtering
    weight, or females close to parturition, newborn lambs or calves, animals that
    need feed supplementation or medical treatments can be allocated to different
    spaces (Morgan-Davies et al., 2018; DataMuster®, Patent 2005233651 owned by Sheep
    CRC Ltd see Table 2). Temperature In indoor systems, environmental temperature
    and humidity were the first parameters monitored by online devices. These parameters
    are used to calculate the temperature and humidity index (THI), which evaluates
    the level of thermal stress in a given environment (Renaudeau et al., 2012). THI
    scores are used to quickly intervene before the animals enter heat stress. In
    rangelands, animals are free to move towards shelters and tree-covered areas to
    self-regulate their temperature. However, self-regulation is not always possible,
    for example, in arid and semi-arid rangelands, as well as in tropical climates,
    where tree coverage might be insufficient to control heat stress. Therefore, the
    monitoring of environmental parameters and THI could be very useful during grazing
    and could support farmers in herd management according to pasture features (e.g.,
    tree patterns) (Pezzopane et al., 2019). In addition to heat stress evaluation,
    body temperature reflects the physiological activity of the animal body and, for
    this reason, reflects the health status of animals (Zhang et al., 2019). Rectal
    temperature is usually the most common and accurate method, but manual measurement
    is time-consuming and labour-intensive, and can cause intense stress to the animal,
    affecting its reliability (Zhang et al., 2019). To overcome these issues, other
    types of measuring devices have been developed, such as surgically implanted devices,
    infrared devices, and endo-ruminal boluses equipped with temperature sensors (e.g.,
    smaXtec GmbH). Surgically implanted devices have been used to monitor the body
    temperature and heart rate of domestic sheep that freely range on unfenced mountain
    pastures (Fuchs et al., 2019). When integrated into a monitor system capable of
    online data transmission, these could be a feasible method for real-time monitoring
    of body temperature during grazing. Alternatively, infrared off-animal devices
    can also be used. Despite recent implementations of infrared technology in agriculture
    in general and in livestock, its use for real-time monitoring in outdoor conditions
    has not yet been reported. However, in free-range grazing animals, the advantage
    of not necessitating capture is counterbalanced by factors that affect the accuracy
    and reliability of the measurement. Sensors and devices should be calibrated with
    a known standard of thermometry, considering changes in meteorological parameters
    between measurements which can impact the quality of the transmission of infrared
    waves emitted by the animal as well as the quality of the reception of the waves
    (Sellier et al., 2014). Moreover, it is important that the body surface to be
    analysed is clean, because dirty or wet coats may modify the emissivity (McManus
    et al., 2016). The resolution of the equipment, as well as the distance at which
    the measurement was carried out, is also fundamental for a successful analysis.
    In free-range grazing livestock, research using infrared thermography has been
    applied to evaluate the effects of tree shading on the behaviour and body surface
    temperatures of beef cattle in a tropical climate (Giro et al., 2019), and to
    evaluate the thermoregulatory response of female buffalos raised in a tropical
    climate (Brcko et al., 2020). However, it could also be a practical method to
    realise quick assessments of suspicious health issues or to monitor the herd health
    status during routine checks, even in animals at pasture. In addition, unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been proposed for detecting temperature data emitted
    from ear tags in cattle and for counting cattle through visual analysis (Chamoso
    et al., 2014, Barbedo et al., 2020, Shao et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2020). Animal
    location and prevention of livestock theft GPS devices have been used to prevent
    cattle theft in several parts of the world. In an Italian study, where a GPS collar
    was coupled with the global system for mobile communication (GSM), animals were
    tracked using software that alerted the farmer when an animal moved outside its
    grazing area, denoted by a virtual perimeter (Tangorra et al., 2013). Despite
    the interesting implications for farmers, an important hurdle to on-farm extensive
    use of GPS-embedded devices is the high cost of this technology; providing each
    livestock unit with a GPS tracker is often economically unaffordable for most
    farmers. Therefore, attempts have been made to reduce the unit cost. For instance,
    Karl and Sprinkle (2019) tested low-cost collars ($54) built using commercial
    off-the-shelf electronic components. However, apart from their economic convenience
    and easy handling, the collars were characterised by several limitations compared
    with commercial devices, such as limited battery duration (weeks) and lack of
    wireless data transmission. To overcome wireless data transmission and financial
    cost constraints of tracking solutions based on GPS, Maroto-Molina et al. (2019)
    developed and tested under farm conditions a low-cost solution that required only
    some animals of the herd being fitted with GPS collars connected to a Sigfox network
    and the rest with low-cost Bluetooth tags. Another important factor limiting the
    use of GPS-embedded devices for herd location is the battery lifespan. In rangelands,
    animal handling is reduced to a minimum with manual interventions spread over
    long periods of time. Efficient tracking systems should cover the entire grazing
    season while avoiding or minimising battery changes. This issue has gradually
    been overcoming by the implementation of solar panels embedded to the devices.
    A network architecture of herd localisation with most of its nodes kinetically
    powered from animal movements was successfully tested to track and localise Scandinavian
    reindeer herds in Lapland (Dopico et al., 2012). GPS locators have also been used
    in combination with other tools such as accelerometers and temperature sensors
    (e.g., Ceres tag®, digitanimal®, see Table 2) to monitor animal activity and health.
    Another emerging use of GPS is virtual fencing, which will be discussed in Section
    3.7. To overcome accuracy-related problems, such as loss of satellite reception
    owing to atmospheric conditions, topography, canopy and near infrastructure, or
    satellite-related errors (Ganskopp and Johnson, 2007), some alternatives to GPS
    for tracking the animals in pastures have been evaluated. The application of outdoor
    image analysis using top-view cameras, which are currently used indoors to monitor
    animals, was evaluated. In fenced pastures, Bonneau et al. (2020) applied a framework
    that combined low-cost time-lapse cameras, machine learning, and image registration
    to monitor the location of animals belonging to two flocks of goats. The obtained
    precision and sensitivity were 90% and 84.5%, respectively. However, these authors
    also observed that some factors including topography, animal size (with newborns
    being hardly detected), and objects on the background could reduce the sensitivity
    to 70.7% and the precision to 83.8%. However, the main advantage of the framework
    was its financial cost, which was significantly lower than that of GPS. Camera
    lapse has been applied to accurately determine the number and position of cattle
    at waterpoints in order to calculate enteric methane emissions using micrometeorological
    methods (Benvenutti et al., 2015). Image analysis provided more reliable and accurate
    estimates of the position and number of animals located within 55 m of the camera,
    compared with GPS collars. Lastly, UAVs have also been proposed for monitoring
    and tracking animals in extensive pastures (Jung et al., 2016, Wamuyu, 2017, Vayssade
    et al., 2019, Li and Xing, 2019) Pasture evaluation and grazing management Assessing
    pasture availability and quality from remote sensing The quality and quantity
    of pasture play a crucial role in the management of pasture-based systems. These
    methods are traditionally evaluated through labour- and time-consuming methods
    (i.e., field measurements and chemical analysis). Owing to their flexibility in
    acquiring data over a large range of time and space, remote sensing (RS) techniques
    represent a rapid and effective method for pasture monitoring. In grassland monitoring,
    RS data are normally acquired through three different types of sources: optical
    sensors, synthetic aperture radar sensors, and light detection and ranging sensors
    (Wachendorf et al., 2018). The most commonly used optical sensors are based on
    space-borne sensors. These acquire multispectral images, at different spatial
    and temporal resolutions, to develop a grass production or a quality estimation
    regression model driven by field samples and vegetation indices, for example,
    normalised difference vegetation index or biophysical variables (e.g., leaf area
    index). For example, Jin et al. (2014) estimated grassland biomass and its spatiotemporal
    dynamic variation among different years in three different regions of China using
    MODIS satellite images. MODIS satellite data have also been coupled with simulation
    models for the prediction of grassland productivity as well (Maselli et al., 2013).
    Furthermore, leaf area index derived from SPOT images has been shown to have good
    accuracy (R2 = 0.68) in biomass estimation (Dusseux et al., 2015). Mountain pastures
    are also an important feed resource for livestock. In this scenario, satellite
    RS can cover large areas, such as mountain meadows. However, as explained by Barrachina
    et al. (2015), high heterogeneity in grass composition and the effects of meteorological
    variables make biomass prediction less accurate. Despite this, vegetation index
    values obtained from Landsat-5 satellite images were successfully applied in mountain
    areas to model above-ground biomass. The evolution of satellite programs allows
    free data acquisition in a shorter time and with higher resolutions. For example,
    the Sentinel-2 multispectral imager can provide data with a spatial resolution
    of 60–10 m in a spectral range of 440–2200 nm, every five days. Sentinel-2 images
    were used, for instance, to predict above-ground biomass across different fertiliser
    treatments (R2 = 0.81) in red edge bands (Sibanda et al., 2015). Likewise, good
    results were obtained with Sentinel-2 images in the estimation of pasture quality
    and its spatiotemporal variability (Lugassi et al., 2019). Although satellite
    images allow measurements over large areas, the images are not always available
    owing to changing weather conditions (e.g., cloudy days). To overcome these issues,
    satellite-based synthetic aperture radar RS, integrated with optical remote sensing
    (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) might also be used in pasture monitoring, as they provide
    high spatial resolution in adverse weather conditions (Wang et al., 2019). Recent
    studies have involved the combination of satellite data and optical sensors (e.g.,
    multispectral cameras) mounted on UAVs (Liu et al., 2019). Although UAVs are also
    negatively influenced by weather conditions, their flight missions are more flexible,
    and the sensors can reach finer spatial resolutions than non-commercial satellite
    images. For instance, drone-based multispectral camera sensors can reach a spatial
    resolution of <5 cm with a flying altitude of 45–50 m in the spectral range of
    550–790 nm (Fawcett et al., 2020). Despite this, only a few studies in the scientific
    literature have looked at applications of UAV-based systems for assessing grasslands.
    Promising results have been reported by Askari et al. (2019), who showed that
    the ratio of red and green bands had the maximum impact on the prediction of CP
    using a low-cost multispectral camera. Other relevant studies were conducted by
    Gao et al. (2019), who used UAV multispectral images to predict DM and CP, and
    by Insua et al. (2019), who developed a UAV-modelling approach to evaluate the
    nutritive values of grass-based pasture. Future commercial development of RS techniques
    in grassland monitoring remains a challenging endeavour for research because a
    large amount of data sampling in the field is still required for regression analysis.
    However, empirical evidence on pasture production shows that RS techniques can
    decisively support farmers towards sustainable herd management, for instance,
    helping them choose the right stocking rate in relation to the availability of
    forage, optimising pasture efficiency, and reducing labour requirements. Moreover,
    when coupled with other precision livestock tools (e.g., virtual fencing), a predictive
    system could be useful for encouraging rotational grazing management systems.
    Animal behaviour, activity time budgets, and grazing intake The first technology
    applied in grazing research was GPS, which has been used to study the grazing
    behaviour and preferences of herds or individuals (Table 3). For instance, spatial
    and vegetation preferences of cattle and sheep have been investigated (Putfarken
    et al., 2008, Ganskopp and Bohnert, 2009, Schoenbaum et al., 2017), as well as
    the effect of social hierarchy on the exploitation of pasture resources by sheep
    flocks (di Virgilio and Morales, 2016). GPS was used to assess cow-calf contact
    patterns, activity, and pasture use patterns of heritage and desert-adapted commercial
    beef cows and young calves (Nyamuryekung’e et al., 2021). GPS was recently used
    to track the interactions between Iberian pigs and wild ungulates during the ‘montanera’
    period (Triguero-Ocaña et al., 2020). Table 3. Studies on grazing behaviour and
    activity budget for different livestock species reared in pasture-based systems.

    An exception to the predominant use of GPS in monitoring animal behaviour and
    pasture use was found in poultry. In this sector, the only studies identified
    on the application of PLF technologies in pasture-based systems reported the use
    of RFID on laying hens to monitor the impact of different stocking densities on
    outdoor resource utilisation (Campbell et al., 2017a) and the individual ranging
    behaviour according to flock size (Gebhardt-Henrich et al., 2014). This is likely
    due to the limited range of outdoor hens compared to the distance travelled by
    other pastured species. More recently, GPS-collared cattle were used to model
    spatial patterns of phosphorus depletion and accumulation in mountain pastures
    during summer grazing (Koch et al., 2018). Similarly, urination frequency, nitrogen
    load in each urination event and spatial distribution patterns of urine were investigated
    for grazing sheep and cattle using a GPS unit coupled with a thermistor suspended
    below the vulva which recorded urination events as changes in temperature (Betteridge
    et al., 2010). Beyond the spatial distribution of animals and preferred grazing
    sites, GPS data are able to provide useful information for decoding and classifying
    a series of animal activities (Anderson et al., 2012) including changes in walking,
    lying, feeding, and ruminating patterns, all of which are important signs of alterations
    in animal welfare. As animal welfare has become a priority in recent years, technologies
    aimed at its assessment have been developed at a rapid pace. This is the case
    for accelerometers, which have become the primary tools used for recording activities.
    Examples of accelerometers used to enhance animal welfare have been reported to
    detect lameness in grazing dairy (O’Leary et al., 2020) and beef (Poulopoulou
    et al., 2019) cattle. They have also been used to record and classify standing,
    lying, resting, ruminating, and grazing behaviours in cattle and sheep (Yoshitoshi
    et al., 2013, Alvarenga et al., 2016, Werner et al., 2019). In addition to their
    low energy requirement compared to GPS devices, accelerometers are very accurate
    in detecting head position, which allows discrimination between grazing, lying
    and standing (Pereira et al., 2018). Several devices embedded with accelerometers
    are already available in the market for dairy and beef cattle (e.g., Moomonitor®,
    Dairymaster; Allflex SenseHub®, SCR Engineers Ltd.; Ceres tag®, CeresTag Pty Ltd;
    IceTag® and IceQube®, IceRobotics, Ltd, see Table 2). These devices offer farmers
    real-time monitoring of animal welfare, building up historical activity trends
    at the animal and herd levels, thus alerting the farmer to abnormal behaviour.
    An interesting application of accelerometers, already offered by several market
    monitoring devices, is the detection of hyperventilation and, thus, heat stress
    (e.g., Allflex SenseHub®, SCR Engineers Ltd., see Table 2). GPS and accelerometers
    have been used in combination. Gou et al. (2019) compared three methods to classify
    livestock activity in pastures and observed that the tri-axis accelerometer model
    was the most precise (96% accuracy), but location could be very important in rangeland
    systems; thus, the GPS-tri-axis model or GPS alone (90% accuracy) was more suitable
    for grazing animals. Moreover, accelerometer technology has low energy requirements,
    and their joint application can enhance the GPS battery lifespan by setting the
    GPS to actively record only when the accelerometer detects a movement at a certain
    speed (Terrasson et al., 2016). Recently, the use of Inertial Measurement Unit
    (IMU) sensors has been reported. The IMU is a combined device which includes several
    different sensors (accelerometer, gyroscopes, magnetometer) that are able to measure
    linear acceleration, rotation angle (pitch, roll, and yaw) and angular velocity.
    An IMU from a common mobile phone was used on cattle (Andriamandroso et al., 2017),
    obtaining 92% of accuracy in activity classification, reaching 95% for rumination
    activity. Focusing on grazing activity, research went deeper to detect jaw movements
    in order to classify them as bite (grabbing and tearing off), chew (crashing),
    and bite-chew (overlap of chewing and biting activities) movements, and to count
    their number and duration, with the objective of discriminating between grazing
    and ruminating. The assessment of jaw movements has also allowed for a novel approach
    to estimate feed intake in pastures. For this purpose, two types of sensors have
    been used: pressure sensors and acoustic sensors (Rutter et al., 1997, Clapham
    et al., 2011). As reported by Rutter et al. (1997), pressure sensors consist of
    a noseband made of a silicon tube packed with carbon granules. The electrical
    resistance of the sensor changes as the animal opens or closes the jaw. These
    changes were recorded and subsequently analysed using software to determine the
    activity cycles. In contrast, acoustic sensors mainly rely on a microphone located
    on the head of the animal or near the mouth, as described by Clapham et al. (2011).
    The acoustic signal was recorded, and frequency, intensity, duration, and time
    between events were used to classify them as bite and chew events. However, the
    signal classification was performed later. To lengthen monitoring and to reduce
    the storage needed, systems with an embedded processor were developed to perform
    algorithms for real-time and automatic classification of acoustic signals in chewing,
    bite, and chew-bite events in different livestock species (cattle, sheep, and
    goats) (Navon et al., 2013, Chelotti et al., 2016). Algorithm implementation for
    real-time classification of acoustic signals has greatly increased the feasibility
    of using this method to assess jaw movements. Indeed, when compared to pressure
    sensors, the acoustic technique more precisely identified bite, chew, and chew-bite
    events, whereas pressure sensors tended to misclassify a significant proportion
    of chews as bite (Nadin et al., 2012). Direct estimation of grass intake by accelerometers
    was performed according to different methods including by collar-mounted devices
    recording daily activity budgets, such as grazing (Greenwood et al., 2017) or
    with the aid of bite counts (Oudshoorn et al., 2013). A commercial on-farm system
    was also implemented by combining a noseband pressure sensor for jaw movement
    detection and a tri-axis accelerometer for activity monitoring, showing a high
    level of accuracy in measuring feeding behaviour (Werner et al., 2018). Alternatively,
    the accelerometer was mounted under the jaw with the specific purpose of assessing
    jaw movements and then grass intake according to bite events (Alvarenga et al.,
    2020). However, data collected through sensors should be carefully used to estimate
    grass intake to ensure the fulfilment of nutritional requirements. Pasture can
    vary in composition and quality, and bite speed and bite mass differ owing to
    sward height, density, and DM concentration (Wilkinson et al., 2020). Few applications
    of accelerometers and RFID have been reported to study the drinking behaviour
    and herd water intake of grazing animals (Williams et al., 2020). The approach
    relies on the unique head-neck position of cattle during drinking, which can be
    well identified by a neck-mounted tri-axial accelerometer. Water intake was calculated
    using a water trough equipped with a water flow metre. The combination of these
    technologies allowed the number, duration, and frequency of visits per animal
    to a water point, the number and duration of drinking events per animal visit,
    and the time each animal spends drinking to be recorded (Williams et al., 2020).
    Thus, further developments could allow the farmer to monitor that herd water intake
    needs are met, even in environmentally challenging situations such as during droughts
    and the dry season. Most of the listed technologies on grazing activity and feed
    intake quantification may not have a substantial commercial application under
    farming conditions, but they are helpful tools for understanding the spatial utilisation
    of pastures, vegetation preferences, and excretion patterns of grazing livestock.
    Therefore, the information collected can be translated into best practices and
    tools for active management of the herd with the final aim of maintaining pasture
    quality and biodiversity, as well as controlling overgrazing and grassland degradation
    (Bailey et al., 2018). For instance, a combination of GPS, accelerometer, and
    UAV was used to understand the impact of feed restriction in gestating sows at
    pasture on their foraging behaviour and on vegetation cover (Aubé et al., 2021).
    UAVs were also used to assess grazing preferences of several livestock species.
    This is an interesting upcoming tool to support farmer’s decisions on creating
    specific grazing groups according to animals’ age or behaviour, or on setting
    the correct stocking rate according to available resources (Trukhachev et al.,
    2019). Virtual fencing Virtual fencing (VF) is a recently implemented system aimed
    at controlling grazing. Through VF, farmers can choose and delineate an area where
    livestock can graze. The traditional physical boundary is replaced by an acoustic
    stimulus; when the animal is approaching the VF, an acoustic cue warns it to stop.
    If the animal ignores the cue, it receives an electric shock as a positive reinforcement.
    The system comprises collars with a GPS tracker and a battery-powered device that
    administers the electric shock. Currently, most VF systems rely on GPS locators,
    allowing greater flexibility in choosing grazing areas (Rutter, 2017). The rising
    interest in VF solutions has highlighted two main issues: animal welfare (Campbell
    et al., 2017b) and battery performance. The first issue can be addressed by developing
    proper training protocols based on associative learning methods (Kearton et al.,
    2019) and by investigating changes in activity time budgets (walking, lying, standing)
    and stress-related parameters. No (Campbell et al., 2017b) or few differences
    (Campbell et al., 2019b) in time spent lying (less than 20 minutes for every training
    session) were observed between cattle managed with VF compared to electric tape
    boundaries, whereas no differences between treatments were observed in faecal
    cortisol metabolite concentrations. An interesting output of several studies on
    training and application of VF was the large variability between animals in the
    time required for learning to respond to the audio cue (Campbell et al., 2019b,
    Lomax et al., 2019, Marini et al., 2019). Verdon et al. (2020) observed that less
    fearful heifers were more unresponsive to audio and electrical stimuli. From the
    perspective of wider commercial diffusion, the system should ensure that all the
    animals can learn how to properly interact with the system, and individual variability
    should be limited to the time needed to learn. Moreover, herd behaviour should
    be studied, as the learning process might be socially facilitated (Marini et al.,
    2018, Campbell et al., 2019a). This does not exclude the possibility that the
    size of the group can affect the success of training. Indeed, in large flocks,
    sheep are known to form subgroups, and the responses of individual sheep to passive
    recruitment can be affected by group size (Marini et al., 2019). The application
    of VF for pasture management should always consider pasture availability to ensure
    animal welfare. Increased hunger states may challenge the effectiveness of VF
    technology as feeding is the major attractant for animals (Verdon et al., 2020).
    VF can also be applied in a more dynamic situation than delineating an exclusion
    zone containing an attractant. Campbell et al. (2017) tested GPS-based VF, gradually
    shifting the limits over 22 days and enabling the animals to enter greater percentages
    of the grazing paddock. Animals learned the VF location within approximately 48
    h, but as the inclusion zones changed, animals were responsive to the audio cue
    and did not fear the old boundaries. Similar results were also observed by Lomax
    et al. (2019) in dairy cattle. VF has also proved to be an interesting tool for
    temporarily excluding livestock from environmentally sensitive areas, such as
    cattle from a riparian zone (Campbell et al., 2019a). Moreover, virtual fencing
    systems on the market (i.e., eShepherd®, Agersens, AU; Halter®, NZ; Vence®, CA,
    USA; Nofence®, NO; see Table 2) offer farmers additional tools to improve livestock
    management at pasture, such as tools to optimise rotational or strip grazing,
    and real-time animal monitoring to detect changes in behaviour denoting heat,
    lameness, or calving. Due to animal welfare concerns, some attempts to manage
    the herd without electric stimulus as negative reinforcement have been conducted
    using only the audio cue as a deterrent (Umstatter et al., 2013). However, the
    results did not ensure the same level of effectiveness in excluding animals from
    the chosen areas. As an alternative, audio delivery devices embedded in collars
    or harnesses have been proposed to recall animals towards a feed attractant, which
    might assist the farmer in grouping the animals for management operations (Umstatter
    et al., 2015). Herd management Systems consisting of GPS trackers and aerial pasture
    monitoring have been tested as supporting tools for grazing planning to avoid
    overgrazing and grassland degradation. Li et al. (2020) proposed a cloud grazing
    management and decision system based on WebGIS that was able to display the herd’s
    real-time position, its historical trajectory, and to monitor and estimate grassland
    growth and intake by both UAV and satellite RS images. This information was available
    in real-time for end-users, providing a decision-making basis for herd management.
    Similarly, di Virgilio et al. (2018)—combining the data retrieved by an animal-attached
    multi-sensor tag, consisting of a tri-axial accelerometer, tri-axial magnetometer,
    temperature sensor, and GPS with landscape layers from GIS—developed a PLF methodology
    for the management of Merino sheep in Patagonian rangelands. The authors used
    the acquired data on behavioural patterns, feeding rates, predation risk, competition
    for grazing resources, landscape, and environmental parameters to estimate the
    energy balance and to predict individual growth, survival, and reproduction. As
    demonstrated by VF devices on the market, this technology has already become a
    system acting as a “virtual shepherd,” thanks to the integration with other sensors
    on the animal, i.e., accelerometers for activity budgets, and external data such
    as weather forecasts and topographic data, to identify risky areas or areas suitable
    for feeding and pasture availability by RS (Terrasson et al., 2017). Moreover,
    Jung and Ariyur (2017) theorised that multiple UAVs could be used to gather herds.
    Similar experiences were reported in Australia and New Zealand by Yinka-Banjo
    and Ajayi (2019), where UAVs have successfully been used to muster sheep and cattle
    and to guide the animals to feeding, drinking, or milking areas. However, very
    little research has been carried out on domestic animals, although the use of
    UAVs for wildlife monitoring is steadily increasing (Barbedo and Koenigkan, 2018).
    Several systems on the market consisting of combined sensors already provide farmers
    with complete information on health, reproductive status, heat stress, localisation,
    and calving, and a non-exhaustive list of these solutions is given in Table 2.
    Reproduction monitoring: oestrus, parturition, pedigree Oestrus Owing to the economic
    importance of reproductive traits and the widespread use of artificial insemination,
    the first sector to apply new computerised methods was dairy farms. Among the
    early automatic methods for oestrus detection, pedometers appear to be the most
    widespread (Abeni et al., 2019). In recent years, accelerometers and integrated
    monitoring systems with embedded accelerometers have become popular for monitoring
    animal activity and predicting oestrus (Brassel et al., 2018, Adenuga et al.,
    2020). Nevertheless, the need for remote oestrus detection in cattle and sheep
    strongly depends on breeding management; if it includes planned mating, real-time
    monitoring of oestrus is of pivotal importance for herd management. Andersson
    et al. (2016) successfully tested a wireless intravaginal probe for grazing cattle.
    It worked using a combination of conductivity, temperature, movement, and position
    to detect oestrus. The probe’s battery duration was estimated to be approximately
    five years using a measurement interval of 30 min and a transmission range of
    100 m. To address the additional power requirements of transmission over long
    distances, such as for dispersed herd grazing in a natural environment, the authors
    foresaw the implementation of the system, including battery-powered repeater nodes
    in a collar. Parturition The simplest tool used for parturition events in pasture-based
    systems was a GPS-embedded collar. In gestating sheep, GPS technology was able
    to identify parturition time by changes in daily and hourly walking means and
    speed and by changes in the spatial movements of ewes in the days immediately
    after the presumed parturition (Fogarty et al., 2020). Reliable prediction of
    calving time is also very important for cattle kept in pastures. Indeed, during
    calving, farmers’ quick intervention could help to avoid calving loss in cows
    in poor health or with primary labour insufficiencies, as well as reduce potential
    calf injury caused by the mother or by environmental factors (Calcante et al.,
    2014). However, to ensure prompt intervention, the exact location of the animal
    needs to be provided. For this purpose, Calcante et al. (2014) patented a GPS-calving
    alarm device that alerts the farmer via SMS. The SMS includes birth event date
    and hour, animal ID, and geographical coordinates of the partum point. The GPS
    coordinates are imported into a common mobile application. Considering the component’s
    lifespan, the device was able to cover up to 10 calves/year at a unitary cost
    of € 31.5 per birth. In addition to oestrus detection, accelerometers have also
    been used for calving detection. The sensor is mounted on the tail and detects
    tail movements associated with approaching calving. Alerts are sent to farmers
    by app notification or GSM (CalveSense®, SCR Engineers Ltd.; Moocall®; smaXtec®,
    GmbH, see Table 2). The systems also work in pasture-based systems owing to embedded
    SIM or solar-powered antennas that transmit the signal locally received by animal-mounted
    devices. Pedigree Grazing herds or flocks often consist of fertile females and
    males; in this situation, the main problem is to reconstruct the offspring’s pedigree
    rather than monitoring oestrus. Some systems to rebuild maternal pedigree are
    mainly based on RFID technology. To determine maternal pedigree in Australian
    sheep flocks, a system called Pedigree Matchmaker® was built using software designed
    by the Cooperative Research Centre for Sheep Industry Innovation (Sheep CRC).
    It permits the attribution of each lamb to its ewe by recording the order in which
    RFID tags are read as animals pass near the tag reader entering in a fenced space
    containing an attractant. The pairs of animals that moved together corresponded
    to the lamb-ewe pairs. Although 21 days of recording was needed to achieve 80–85%
    of maternal parentage in three flocks of 100–200 ewes (Richards and Atkins, 2007)
    and one herd of 41 beef cows (Menzies et al., 2018b), this system was considered
    labour-saving and less expensive than manual catching or DNA matching. It can
    also improve the genetic progress in pasture-based livestock systems. Similarly,
    still working on the proximity between ewe and lamb, Sohi et al. (2017) proposed
    a matching system based on Bluetooth, which showed a higher accuracy in a shorter
    time than Pedigree Matchmaker. However, although this system did not require any
    walk-by structure to register the pedigree, it involved animal handling to put
    on and remove Bluetooth tags before obtaining the maternal pedigree. In the grazing
    context, it may be challenging to apply and recover animals into walk-by structures.
    Some solutions based on RFID-built pedigree are already available in the market
    (e.g., DataMuster®). In this case, the problems related to data collection, storage,
    and transmission were solved, offering opportunities for farmers to have the system
    working online by GSM or wireless connection or offline by storing the data. In
    some cases, tracing paternal parentage can also be important. An initial attempt
    was made by Abell et al. (2017), using accelerometer data and various classification
    algorithms (random forest, random tree, and decision tree), to tentatively predict
    bull behaviour events in a multiple-sire pasture. The authors succeeded in discriminating
    between lying, standing, walking, and mounting; however, mounting event accuracy
    only ranged from 74 to 80%, and was considered inadequate. Another system to assess
    contemporary parentage and oestrus in sheep was proposed by Alhamada et al. (2017).
    The system was composed of an RFID device fixed with a harness on the male, whereas
    the female had an electronic identifier that recorded the accepted mounts. Predation
    Predation of grazing livestock is a major issue in many countries. The difficulties
    of continuously monitoring the animals, the unpredictable movements of wild predators,
    and the difficulty of quickly reaching the livestock being attacked have been
    major issues for the successful reduction, or at least containment, of this phenomenon.
    With the advent of new technologies, different approaches have been attempted
    in different countries. In the USA, where predation events against grazing cattle
    are mainly caused by wolves, Clark et al. (2020) tried to combine GPS data on
    wolves’ preferred rendezvous sites and spatial cattle resource selection patterns
    during the summer grazing season. Their objective was to predict the spatial risk
    of wolf-cattle encounters and associated predation events using spatial models.
    A wolf-cattle encounter risk map was developed to identify where, on different
    landscapes, predation was most likely to occur. The research was validated only
    in a few small areas but provided a predictive model with interesting applications
    for farmers, if further implemented and maintained by regularly collecting data
    on tracked wolves and predation events. In contrast, Manning et al. (2014) used
    GPS devices to quantify the behavioural responses of two sheep flocks under attack.
    The authors observed that centripetal rotation (circling behaviour of the flock,
    with individual sheep seeking the centre) of animals occurred in 80% of the simulated
    predation events, and the velocity of sheep was significantly higher during simulated
    events. The spatial–temporal data derived from GPS devices, with appropriate mathematical
    modelling, might be used to identify predation and alert the farmer. Finally,
    Sendra et al. (2013) proposed a prototype of a smart wireless sensor network composed
    that measures the frequency of heart and corporal temperature. Data were interpreted
    by a smart algorithm able to detect episodes of collective stress on the flocks
    of goats and sheep caused by any predator attack overnight. When an attack was
    ongoing, the system automatically activated audible and visual alarms to scare
    off predators and sent an alarm signal to the farmer. The prototype should be
    tested under farm conditions, but it presents some useful features for further
    implementation. For instance, it is self-sufficient considering the energy limitations
    of field conditions. It is recharged by a solar panel, and a control unit limits
    its operation to nighttime. Moreover, providing an immediate response to scare
    predators while waiting for human intervention could have an actual impact on
    avoiding killings. Future perspectives and conclusions Applying PLF in pasture-based
    systems provides several advantages, as we have discussed in detail. Livestock
    research has already benefitted from PLF technologies providing access to a large
    amount of information on animals’ grazing behaviour and activities without human
    disturbance and for long periods of time, as well as in remote locations that
    are difficult for human observers to access. The opportunity to monitor the animal,
    regardless of its location and the moment of the day (i.e., also during night),
    is an undeniable benefit for the farmer, who can be immediately warned in case
    of abnormal behaviours and, therefore, promptly intervene (Waterhouse, 2019).
    Moreover, wearable sensors and field technologies can collect information useful
    for overall herd management, from pedigree reconstruction to the planning of medical
    treatments or feeding supplementation according to pasture availability. In the
    context of climate change, the development of tools to monitor several climatic
    parameters in a pasture could become of inestimable importance to support farmers
    in decision-making and to prompt interventions for livestock before the onset
    of welfare issues. Remote sensing of pasture availability, identification (and
    exclusion) of environmentally sensitive areas, and virtual management systems
    could become a pivotal tool for grazing management and grassland preservation
    (Rutter, 2017). Moreover, further development of PLF for animal production could
    also involve the final production phases, such as transportation and transformation,
    covering the entire supply chain and improving traceability of products. Nevertheless,
    the development and application of PLF technologies in livestock farming are expanding
    both in indoor/confined and pasture-based livestock systems. Research in rangelands
    has greatly benefitted from such solutions; however, PLF use among farmers in
    rangeland systems is still limited compared to intensive livestock systems. This
    is likely related to several hurdle characteristic of pasture-based systems that
    are still unsolved. Firstly, battery lifespan must guarantee long-term functionality
    and minimum maintenance to avoid frequent capture operations. To overcome this
    issue, several strategies have been tested, including more battery performance
    (as long as battery size and weight remain wearable by animals), more efficient
    duty cycles, compression of data, and new energy harvesting techniques (Llaria
    et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2018). Finally, solar panels are increasingly used
    to extend the battery lifespan, even if their performance depends on the climatic
    conditions. The second issue is related to data management under open-field conditions.
    The transmission coverage range can be challenging, especially in mountain areas
    or tree-covered pastures (Llaria et al., 2015). This means that devices for PLF
    application in rangelands need to ensure adequate storage capacity to maintain
    the collected data until the conditions are suitable for transmission, or efficient
    wireless delivery systems. The improvement of these latter technologies might
    be especially useful from the perspective of real-time monitoring. Finally, a
    certain flexibility is required because free-ranging animals have plenty of feeding
    and water sources, and can move for very large distances, so identifying a reliable
    system for downloading and transmitting the data often is site-specific and very
    flexible solutions are needed (Kwong et al., 2011). Regardless of technological
    constraints, the on-farm application of PLF technologies must meet some economic
    and operational requirements, such as (i) fitting within current management practices,
    (ii) requiring no additional labour, (iii) being economical and more advantageous
    than current management, (iv) providing at least the same accuracy as traditional
    methods, and (v) having a user-friendly design (Halachmi et al., 2019). From an
    economic perspective, an important factor that should be considered is that farms
    rearing animals at pasture often have lower returns than intensive farms, so investing
    in PLF technologies is not always affordable. The feasibility of applying PLF
    in pasture-based systems is mainly related to significant labour reduction, both
    to finance the purchase of the PLF technologies and to obtain tangible benefits
    from the investment (Waterhouse, 2019). Some concerns also targeted the loss of
    jobs, the deskilling of the remaining positions, and the possible increase of
    labour due to false-positive alerts and reports that need to be checked in rushed
    environments (Werkheiser, 2020). Ethics approval The authors did not use any live

    \  \nPlant disease and pest greatly affect agricultural production \nand food\
    \ security in China.  With global warming and farmland \necological environment\
    \ changes, occurrence of plant diseases and \npests becomes more frequent year\
    \ by year[1,2].  In August 2012, \ndisasters such as corn armyworm occurred in\
    \ Northeast and North \nChina, covering an area of more than 5.3 million ha. \
    \ In July 2013, \nthe second generation of armyworm burst in Shanxi Province.\
    \  \nGround machinery has poor controlling effects on high-stalk crops \nlike\
    \ corn, more-than-38-million-ha-area autumn grain crops were \nharmed.  The second\
    \ armyworm outbreaks had become the largest \narmyworm outbreak in Shanxi during\
    \ the past 20 years[3].  It is \nurgent to establish an efficient crop protection\
    \ system to prevent \nsuch kinds of pest outbreaks[4].  \nUnmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) for plant protection, along \nwith the agricultural aviation industry\
    \ have been developing rapidly \nin recent years in China[5-6].  Aerial spraying\
    \ by UAV is a new \nplant protection practice in China and is characterized by\
    \ high \nefficiency and high utilization rate of pesticide.  Compared to \nconventional\
    \ aerial spraying technologies, the advantages of aerial \nspraying by a UAV are\
    \ discussed as follows.  It can effectively \nsolve problems causing by high-stalk\
    \ crops, manual and ground \n                                                \

    \ on paddies and steep, mountainous terrains.  \nIt is also an efficient way to\
    \ monitor and control large-area pest and \ndisease outbreaks, reduce the use\
    \ of rural labor and pesticide [7-9].  \nFurthermore, the plant protection UAV\
    \ that operates at low altitude \nand low loading can suspend in the air to achieve\
    \ high-precision \nposition with GPS.  Additionally, the downward airflow generated\
    \ \nby rotors helps to increase penetrability of droplets on canopy to \nimprove\
    \ the pesticide effect[10-12]. \nIn addition, with further improvement of domestic\
    \ land transfer \nrate, large-scale agricultural production has become a trend.\
    \  A \nnew type of plant protection mode with scaled-up and \nmechanization is\
    \ urgently needed [13].  The Ministry of Agriculture \nhas passed fertilizer and\
    \ pesticide reduction action plan, referring to \na goal for achieving zero growth\
    \ of fertilizer and pesticide use by \n2020.  Therefore, the plant protection\
    \ UAV that has the ability to \nachieve the effect with ultra-low volume spraying\
    \ fit the goal well.  \nIn recent years, China’s agricultural UAV manufacturing\
    \ industry \nhas increased dramatically driven by the huge market demand.  \n\
    This, in turn, stimulates the rapid development of plant protection \nUAV and\
    \ its application technology.  To further understand the \nstatus and issues of\
    \ the development of plant protection UAV and \nits spraying technologies in China,\
    \ the Department of Agricultural \nMechanization Management of the Ministry of\
    \ Agriculture \ncommissioned South China Agricultural University to write the\
    \ \nreport on Analysis of the Development Situation and Policy \nSuggestion for\
    \ Agricultural Plant Protection UAV in China in 2016.  \nBased on this report,\
    \ a statistical analysis was performed on the \ndevelopment and application of\
    \ plant protection UAVs in China.  \nThis analysis’ primary focus was the distribution\
    \ of ownership and \nactual operating area of plant protection UAVs in various\
    \ provinces \n2   December, 2018                        Int J Precis Agric Aviat\

    \ \nand regions.  The current status of UAV-based spraying \ntechnologies was\
    \ reviewed and summarized.  Furthermore, the \nkey development directions of spraying\
    \ technologies for plant \nprotection UAV in the future were pointed out.  It\
    \ is expected to \nprovide references for scientific research and application\
    \ of \nresearch institutions and enterprises, and promote and encourage \nthe\
    \ development of plant protection UAV industry in China. \n2  Application status\
    \ of plant protection UAV \n2.1  Distribution of ownership and development area\
    \ of plant \nprotection UAV \nAccording to the report on Analysis of the Development\
    \ \nSituation and Policy Suggestion for Agricultural Plant Protection \nUAV in\
    \ China in 2016, there were 4,262 plant protection UAVs for \nactual field operation\
    \ by the end of June 30, 2016.  The majority \nof these UAVs are electric, multi-rotorcraft\
    \ with pesticides loadings \nbetween 5 and 30 L.  These UAVs are operated primarily\
    \ by \nplanting cooperatives, agricultural service organizations and \nprofessional\
    \ flying defense organizations. \nAs is shown in Figure 1, there are large differences\
    \ in terms of \nthe ownerships of plant protection UAVs across the various \n\
    provinces and cities.  This differences were associated with the \nstandardization\
    \ of local agricultural production, the scale of \noperation, the level of mechanized\
    \ development, and the local \nsubsidy policy for purchasing agricultural machines.\
    \  Henan \nProvince, the largest agricultural production province, has the \n\
    highest quantity (720 and accounting for 16.89% of the total) of \nplant protection\
    \ UAVs.  Several other major agricultural provinces \nsuch as Hebei, Liaoning,\
    \ Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, Shandong, Hunan \nand Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\
    \ all have more than 200 \nUAVs.  Summing their UAVs up and the number reaches\
    \ 2,406, \nrepresenting 56.45% of the total.  At the same time, Heilongjiang \n\
    Province, also as a major agricultural production province, only has \na relative\
    \ small number of UAVs (88, accounting for 2.06% of the \ntotal) since manually\
    \ piloted fixed-wing aircrafts were mainly used \nfor agricultural aviation plant\
    \ protection operation. \n \nNote: BJ—Beijing, TJ—Tianjin, HE—Hebei, SX—Shanxi,\

    \ distribution of plant protection UAVs in various provinces in China \n \nFigure\
    \ 2 shows regional distribution of plant protection UAVs \nin China in seven major\
    \ geographic areas: North China, Northeast \nChina, East China, Central China,\
    \ South China, Southwest China \nand Northwest China.  The highest number of plant\
    \ protection \nUAVs are located in Eastern China (Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang,\
    \ \nAnhui, Fujian, Jiangxi and Shandong provinces) and Central China \n(Henan,\
    \ Hubei and Hunan provinces) which sums up to 1,608 \n(37.73%) and 1,164 units\
    \ respectively.  These two geographic \nareas are followed by Northwest China\
    \ (Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, \nNingxia and Xinjiang), North China (Beijing, Tianjin,\
    \ Hebei, \nShanxi and Inner Mongolia), and Northeast China (Heilongjiang,  \n\
    \ \nFigure 2  Ownership distribution of plant protection UAVs in \nvarious regions\
    \ in China \nJilin and Liaoning Provinces) with 386 (9.16%), 385 (9.03%) and \n\
    319 (7.48%) respectively.  South China (Guangdong, Guangxi \nand Hainan provinces)\
    \ and the southwestern China (Chongqing, \nSichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan and Tibet)\
    \ possess the fewest UAVs in \noperation, totaling 163 (4.52%) and 160 (3.75%)\
    \ respectively. \nIn Figs.1 and 2, it can be seen that the most advantageous areas\
    \ \nfor UAV application in China are large agricultural provinces and \neconomically\
    \ developed areas such as Henan, Shandong, Hunan, \nZhejiang, Jiangsu and Xinjiang.\
    \  Xinjiang province is home to \nmany farm which are suitable for plant protection\
    \ UAV operations.  \nThis is a primary reason that plant protection UAV manufacturers\
    \ \nare attracted to set up branches in Xinjiang, in an attempt to further \n\
    promote aerial spraying operation by plant protection UAV.  As an \neconomic-developed\
    \ area, Guangdong Province has the largest \nnumber of agricultural UAV manufacturing\
    \ enterprises in the \ncountry; however, they do not possess the highest number\
    \ of plant \nprotection UAVs in operation.  One explanation for this is the lack\
    \ \nof local government subsidies for plant protection UAVs in \nGuangdong \n\
    Province. \n \nIn \n2014, \nthe \nZhuhai \nMunicipal \nGovernment of Guangdong\
    \ Province allocated special funds to \nsubsidize plant protection UAV up to 30%\
    \ of retail value.  Despite \nthese subsidies, there was little effect on the\
    \ quantities of plant \nDecember, 2018          Lan Y B, et al.  Current status\

    \ \ntraditionally the areas and provinces with high holdings of plant \nprotection\
    \ UAV often have subsidies from local governments, thus \npromoting the local\
    \ application of plant protection UAV. \n2.2  Operation status of plant protection\
    \ UAV \nAccording to the report on Analysis of the Development \nSituation and\
    \ Policy Suggestion for Agricultural Plant Protection \nUAV in China in 2016,\
    \ there were 476,035.67 hectares for \noperational area of plant protection UAV\
    \ nationwide in 2015.  \nAs is shown in Figure 3, Henan Province has the largest\
    \ operation \narea of 135,225.3 hectares (28.41% of the total operation area in\
    \ \nChina), followed by the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region \n(including Xinjiang\
    \ Production and Construction Corps) of \n76,440.08 hectares (16.06%).  Thirdly,\
    \ Hubei Province (56,540 \nhectares, 11.46%), Shandong Province (42,192.5 hectares,\
    \ 8.86%) \nand Shaanxi Province (32,346 hectares, 6.79%) each had an area \nof\
    \ over 30,000 hectares.  The operation area of Anhui Province \n(25,142.8 hectares)\
    \ and Fujian Province (21,586 hectares) each \nare roughly 20,000 hectares, and\

    \ \nprotection UAV are primarily comprised of the large agricultural \nprovinces,\
    \ such as Henan, Hebei, Shandong and Xinjiang, etc.  \nAmong them, Henan Province\
    \ had the highest subsidies for plant \nprotection UAV with the largest area of\
    \ application and promotion.  \nIn return, the operating area of UAVs in central,\
    \ eastern and \nnorthwest of China which are the main cereal grain production,\
    \ \nwhich are far greater than that of other regions. \n3  Research progress of\
    \ plant protection UAV-based \nspraying technologies \n3.1  Key technologies for\
    \ aerial spraying \n3.1.1  Aerial variable-rate spraying technology \nAerial variable-rate\
    \ spraying technology is able to increase the \nprecision of plant protection\
    \ spray applications.  With this \ntechnology, crops are able to be sprayed for\
    \ different purposes by \nsynthesizing information about target crops, such as\
    \ field pest and \ndisease area, crop row spacing and plant density and other\
    \ \napplication parameters[14].  Compared to traditional high-capacity \nspray\
    \ technology, variable-rate spraying technology can reduce the \nproblem of pesticide\
    \ overuse, reduce droplet drift, and improve the \nefficiency of pesticide. \n\
    Zhu et al.[15] applied pulse width modulation (PWM) \ntechnology to develop a\
    \ precision spraying system for plant \nprotection UAVs.  Their results demonstrated\
    \ that the precision \nspraying system could be controlled by PWM technology.\
    \  The \nnozzle sprayed uniformly along the flying direction of UAV \nwithout\
    \ missing any spray or spraying too much.  On the basis of \nbuilding the PWM\
    \ variable-rate spraying system for UAV, Wang et \nal.[16] developed the ground\
    \ measurement and control unit by \n4   December, 2018                       \
    \ Int J Precis Agric Aviat      Open Access at https://www.ijpaa.org         \
    \                Vol. 1 No.1 \nLabWindows/CVI.  The pressure and flow rate of\
    \ the spraying \nsystem was remotely controlled through a wireless data \ntransmission\
    \ module.  In this way, variable-rate spraying \nadjustment for plant protection\
    \ UAV was achieved.  In order to \nsolve problems such as the dull spraying control\
    \ system for plant \nprotection UAV, Wang et al.[17] designed a dynamic spraying\
    \ \ncontrol system and method for plant protection UAV, which the \nflow rate\
    \ was able to match the operating speed accurately and \nautomatically with multi-sensor\
    \ fusion technology.  The results \nshow that when operating speed was changed\
    \ from 0.8 to 5.8 m/s, \nthe average deviation between practical flow rate and\
    \ theoretical \nflow rate was only 1.9%.  In addition, in order to avoid the \n\
    problems of low utilization rate of pesticides and environmental \npollution caused\
    \ by plant protection UAV spraying, Wang et al.[18] \ndeveloped a precision spraying\
    \ control system for UAV based on \nimage recognition, which used algorithm to\
    \ classify and identify \nthe crop area and non-crop area in aerial image of the\
    \ field, and \ncontrolled the nozzle based on recognized results to achieve precise\
    \ \nspray.  The application of variable-rate spraying technology for \nplant protection\
    \ UAV have provided technical reference for \nresearch, and provide reference\
    \ guides for the development of \nprecision agricultural spraying technologies\
    \ in the future. \n3.1.2  Aerial electrostatic spraying technology \nAerial electrostatic\
    \ spraying technology is an innovative \napplication of traditional ground electrostatic\
    \ spraying technology \nin spraying system of plant protection UAV[19,20].  In\
    \ the process \nof aerial spraying, the electrostatic field between nozzle and\
    \ target \ncrop is established by high voltage static electricity, which made\
    \ \npesticide liquid charge with the same polarity as nozzle after \natomizing.\
    \  According to the principle of electrostatic induction, \nground plant canopy\
    \ will cause opposite charge of droplet.  As the \nsame-sex charges inter-repelled\
    \ and the opposite-sex charges \ninter-attracted, the charged droplet will make\
    \ directional movement \nto the ground and eventually attach to various parts\
    \ of the target \ncrop plants with the effect of electrostatic field forces and\
    \ other \nexternal forces[21-23].  The electrostatic spraying technology not \n\
    only make droplet attach on the front of the crop leaves, but also in \nthe middle\
    \ and lower parts of the plants and the back of leaves, \nwhich increase the droplets\
    \ deposition rate while reducing droplet \ndrift, and improve the ecological environment\
    \ around the \napplication area. \nRu et al.[24] designed the electrostatic spray\
    \ system for UAV \n(XX8D), and the system was tested at different altitudes with\
    \ \nelectrostatic and non-electrostatic spray in-paddy.  The result \nshowed that\
    \ the electrostatic spray has a significant effect on \nincreasing droplet deposition.\
    \  This test is the first time for the \nelectrostatic spraying system to be used\
    \ in spraying operation of \nplant protection UAV, but application of electrostatic\
    \ spraying \ntechnology in plant protection UAV remains to be further studied.\
    \  \nTherefore, Jin et al.[25] designed an aerial electrostatic spray system \n\
    for single-rotor helicopter (AF-811).  Their studies included the \neffective\
    \ spraying width and droplet deposition about their system \nwas carried out and\
    \ showed that the spraying system had several \nadvantages such as droplet deposition\
    \ increase and drift reduction.  \nSimilarly, Cai et al.[26] developed a new type\
    \ of contact electrostatic \nspray system based on the F-50 unmanned helicopter\
    \ flight \nplatform, and the effect of spray deposition on different charging\
    \ \nmethods was compared.  The result showed that the contact \ncharge and the\
    \ induction charge can improve the droplet deposition \nand the uniformity of\
    \ aerial spray, and the uniformity with contact \ncharge is better.  Lian et al.[27]\
    \ designed a set of electrostatic spray \nsystem for multi-rotor UAV (YG20-6 plant\
    \ protection UAV) and \ntested the spray effect of the system with the best operating\
    \ \nparameters.  The test result showed that average droplets \ndeposition density\
    \ in the upper and middle of collecting device \nwere 133.8 drops/cm2 and 113.8\
    \ drops/cm2 respectively, and \nincreased by 13.6% and 32.6% compared with the\
    \ non-electrostatic \nspray. \n3.1.3  Other key technologies for aerial spraying\
    \  \nWith regard to other key technologies for aerial spraying, \nHuang et al.[28]\
    \ developed a low-volume spraying system for small \nUAV, which cooperated with\
    \ fully autonomous agricultural UAV \nto spray pesticides for crops in specific\
    \ areas.  The experiments \nhave verified that the system can be applied in crop\
    \ fields and \nachieve increased precision crop management.  Ru et al.[29] \n\
    designed a remote control system based on the unmanned \nhelicopter from German\
    \ VARIO company.  By carrying out the \ntheory research on main influence facts\
    \ of centrifugal atomizing \nspray effect and the tests for nozzle performance,\
    \ the optimal \noperating parameters of centrifugal atomizing nozzle were obtained.\
    \  \nXue et al[30] designed an UAS to accommodate a spray system, \nwhich was\
    \ interfaced with electronic control systems to activate \nspray releases based\
    \ on the GPS coordinates and pre-programmed \nspray locations.  This system has\
    \ route planning and real-time \ndisplay, and can be configured for autonomous\
    \ flight following \nflight plans with automatic control of the spray system.\
    \  Han et \nal.[31] designed an agricultural unmanned helicopter with high \n\
    application accuracy that combined with manual controlled spray \nand automatic\
    \ navigated spray.  It can collect real-time data on the \ngrowth and victimization\
    \ of crops through the cameras installed \nbelow the UAV.  By controlling spraying\
    \ time and flow rate to \nachieve precision spray, and it can greatly improve\
    \ the efficiency \nand accuracy of pesticide application.  The P20 four-rotor\
    \ \nagricultural UAV (Guangzhou XAIRCRAFT Co.,Ltd) adopted the \nGNSS RTK technology\
    \ to achieve centimeter-level accuracy of \nUAV spraying operation, which provides\
    \ conditions for precision \nspraying.  These key technologies have provided technical\
    \ support \nand quality assurance for aerial spraying of plant protection UAV,\
    \ \nand greatly promoted the application and development of plant \nprotection\
    \ UAV and its spraying technologies. \n3.2  Development of key components for\
    \ aerial spraying \nThe key component for aerial spraying of plant protection\
    \ \nUAV is the most important factor of pesticide efficacy, and its \nquality\
    \ is directly related to the efficiency of aerial spraying.  \nTherefore, a great\
    \ deal of research is focused on application \nefficiency of aerial spraying and\
    \ have been carried out by domestic \nscholars. \nTo meet the requirements of\
    \ high concentration and low \nvolume spraying for plant protection UAV, nozzle\
    \ is one of the \nmost important parts of plant protection UAV for aerial \nspraying[32-34].\
    \  Zhou et al.[35] tested the performance of an \nelectric-driven centrifugal\
    \ nozzle designed for aerial spraying with \na special test-bed.  The results\
    \ showed that rotary speed of spray \ndish, flow rate of the nozzle and spray\
    \ height have a large influence \non droplet size and spray width, but little\
    \ on droplet distribution.  \nMoreover, optimal spray parameters of unmanned helicopters\
    \ have \nbeen obtained based on the main goals of high efficiency, \nsatisfactory\
    \ uniformity and low energy for plant protection UAV[35].  \nAimed at aerial electrostatic\
    \ single-nozzle applied in the light plane, \nZhou et al.[36] improved and redesigned\
    \ the electrostatic electrode, \nnozzle processing technology, high-voltage wires\
    \ and electrode \nconnection.  The theory and experiment of the nozzle’s \nDecember,\
    \ 2018          Lan Y B, et al.  Current status and trends of plant protection\
    \ UAV and its spraying technology in China            Vol. 1 No.1   5 \natomization\
    \ charged mechanism and performance were studied.  \nThese results showed that\
    \ the new aerial electrostatic nozzle can \nfully meet the need of aerial spray\
    \ and achieve satisfactory effect in \nthe prevention of pests and diseases. \
    \ To solve some problems in \nthe application of the ultra-low-volume spraying\
    \ of plant protection \nUAVs in China, Wen et al.[37] developed a new swirl nozzle\
    \ based \non the mechanism of swirl atomization and the modular approach.  \n\
    The hydrodynamics and the atomization characteristics of the flow \nfield in the\
    \ nozzle are studied numerically and experimentally.  \nThe physical properties\
    \ of the fluid and the effect of the atomizer \ngeometry on the atomization characteristics\
    \ are obtained.  The \npresent method and results on the spraying mechanism of\
    \ nozzle \nprovide the important reference for research and developing the \n\
    ultra-low-volume variable spraying system of plant protection \nUAV.  In terms\
    \ of other key components for aerial spraying, Chen \net al.[38] designed an anti-shake\
    \ tank for plant protection UAV, \nwhich can reduce the inertia of liquid turbulence\
    \ caused by attitude \nchanges during operating, and to ensure application quality\
    \ of plant \nprotection UAV in the dynamic operation.  In order to achieve \n\
    real-time monitoring of liquid quantity in pesticide tank, Jiang et \nal.[39]\
    \ developed a solution called dual-pressure liquid quantity \nmonitoring system.\
    \  This system consisted of double pressure \nsensors for liquid-level monitor,\
    \ wave filter for liquid level \nturbulence, and conversion model for liquid level\
    \ and liquid \nquantity.  The results showed that the process of data output of\
    \ the \nsystem is stable and reliable in different flying attitude, which \ncould\
    \ avoid the problems such as less spray and low operating \nefficiency caused\
    \ by insufficient pesticides in pesticide tank.  An \nair-assisted hydraulic spraying\
    \ system for the JT-30 plant \nprotection UAV was designed by Xinjiang Jiangtian\
    \ Aviation \nTechnology Co,.Ltd, which used air flow generated by \nhigh-pressure\
    \ centrifugal fan to make droplets more uniform.  In \nthe influence of air flow,\
    \ the deposition and penetration of droplets \nin lower part of plant have been\
    \ improved, and the drift of droplets \nalso reduce effectively.  Lan et al.[40]\
    \ designed a control device of \nspray bar for multi-rotor plant protection UAV.\
    \  The device is \nable to adjust spray width by adjusting the angle of spray\
    \ bar, as \nwell as lower the height of nozzle to reduce droplet drift and to\
    \ \nimprove application efficiency of plant protection UAV.  In \naddition, Lan\
    \ et al.[41] also designed an anti-drift spray device for \nplant protection UAV,\
    \ which can reduce the impact of wind field \non droplet deposition by increasing\
    \ the distance between nozzle \nand the UAV rotor to achieve the goal of precision\
    \ aerial spraying. \n3.3  Operating parameters for aerial spraying \nOperating\
    \ parameters of plant protection UAV primarily \nconsists of flight height and\
    \ speed have a large impact on droplet \ndeposition distribution, and influence\
    \ the operation effect and \npesticide utilization.  Therefore, the factor of\
    \ operating parameters \nof aerial spraying is essential for spray quality of\
    \ plant protection \nUAV.  In order to achieve the optimal spraying effect, the\
    \ \nexploration of impact factors on spraying effect and the \noptimization of\
    \ operating parameters has become research hot \ntopics with the wide application\
    \ of plant protection UAV. \nIn the aspect of the exploration of impact factors\
    \ on \nUAV-based spraying effect, Qiu et al.[46] studied the relationship \nbetween\
    \ spray deposition characteristics and flight height, flight \nvelocity of small\
    \ unmanned helicopter (CD-10, Wuxi Hanhe \nAviation Technology Co., Ltd) and the\
    \ interaction between two \nfactors, and arranged a test by a second factor three\
    \ level test.  A \nmodel of the relationship between droplet deposition distribution\
    \ \nand the two factors of flight height and velocity was developed \nwhich can\
    \ provide guidance for the actual production application.  \nChen et al.[47] used\
    \ a single-rotor, small unmanned helicopter \n(HY-B-10L, Shenzhen Hi-tech New\
    \ Agriculture Technologies Co., \nLtd) with different flight parameters of 1-3\
    \ m in the working height \nand 2-5 m/s in the flying speed in the 3 trials, and\
    \ the similar \nresults were obtained.  In order to evaluate the effect of the\
    \ factors \nand degree of influence on multi-rotor electric UAV-based \nspraying\
    \ deposition to increase the level of droplets deposition on \ntarget, Qin et\
    \ al.[48] investigated the spraying parameters by the \ncentral combination test\
    \ and design concept of Box-Behnken based \non the single-factor test.  The results\
    \ show that the decreasing \neffect sequence on droplet deposition levels on target\
    \ is flight \nheight, flight velocity and nozzles flow rate.  In exploring the\
    \ \neffect of plant protection UAV-based spraying for fruit trees and its \napplication\
    \ prospect, Chen et al.[49] studied the influence of \nspraying parameters of\
    \ UAV on droplet deposition distribution in \ncitrus canopy by an orthogonal test\
    \ of three factors.  The results \nshowed that the factors that affected droplet\
    \ deposition were in \norder of flight velocity, flight height, and nozzle flow\
    \ rate.  On \nthis basis, Zhang et al.[50] also found types of nozzle and the\
    \ shapes \nof tree crown have effects on droplet deposition.   \nSince the amount\
    \ of liquid spraying by plant protection UAV \nis equal to the sum of the amount\
    \ of droplets deposited on target \ncrops, the amount of droplets drift in the\
    \ air and the amount of \ndroplets lost on the ground, Wang et al.[51] studied\
    \ the effects of \nflight mode (forward and backward), flight height and \nenvironmental\
    \ crosswind on the distribution of droplet deposition \nbased on testing method\
    \ of deposition quality balance.  It shows \nthat the factor of environmental\
    \ crosswind have a significant \nimpact on droplet deposition, and preliminarily\
    \ presumed that the \ndifferent rotor airflow produced by two flight modes of\
    \ flying \nforward and backward have a significant impact on the droplet \ndeposition.\
    \  With the gradual attention to the wind field of UAV \nrotor, Tang et al.[52]\
    \ measured the movement and deposition of \ndroplets with a high speed particle\
    \ image velocimetry (PIV) \nmethod at different rotating speeds of rotors (1000-3000\
    \ r/min) or \nat different transverse injecting points (20-50 cm away from its\
    \ \nnearby rotors) in the downwash flow field of a multi-rotor \nagricultural\
    \ UAV, and the effect of different degrees of downwash \nflow field on the movement\
    \ and deposition of droplets was studied.  \nIn order to reveal the impact mechanism\
    \ of droplet deposition \ndistribution by the wind field below agricultural UAV\
    \ rotor in \ndepth, Chen et al.[11,53] measured the wind field below rotor by\
    \ \nusing a wireless wind speed sensor and analyzed the effect of \nthree-dimensional\
    \ wind field below single-rotor and multi-rotor \nUAV rotor on droplet deposition\
    \ distribution in rice canopy.  The \nexperimental and research results mentioned\
    \ above have revealed \nthe impact mechanism of various factors on droplet deposition\
    \ of \nplant protection UAV aerial spraying from different angles and \ndegree,\
    \ and it also provided theoretical guidance and reference \nvalue for practical\
    \ spraying of plant protection UAV. \nIn addition, in the aspect of optimization\
    \ of operating \nparameters of plant protection UAV, researchers have carried\
    \ out \nexplorations on different types of UAVs and crops.  As listed in \nTable\
    \ 1, for UAV operating parameters optimization, various UAV \nmodels have been\
    \ tested under different flight parameter settings to \nfind more suitable flight\
    \ altitudes and speeds that could achieve \noptimum spray droplet deposition for\
    \ UAV spraying on many \ncrops (Table 1 is a summary of optimal operating parameters\
    \ \nobtained by spraying test).  Zhang et al.[54] tested the temperature \nchange\
    \ rate between unsprayed and sprayed by thermal infrared \n6   December, 2018\

    \ deposit on rice \ncanopy, and the optimal application parameters of UAV were\
    \ that \nflight altitude of 2 m and flight velocity of 1.5 m/s.  Qin et al.[55]\
    \ \nexplored the effect of spray droplet deposition from applications \nusing\
    \ a UAV (N-3, Nanjing Research Institute for Agricultural \nMechanization Ministry\
    \ of Agriculture) on late season maize at \ndifferent application heights and\
    \ effective spraying swath width \nand showed that 7 meters in the working height\
    \ and 7 meters in \nthe spraying swath should be chosen as reference of spraying\
    \ \npesticides.  Moreover, Qin et al. [48] also investigated the spraying \nparameters\
    \ of multi-rotor UAV by the central combination test \nand design concept of Box-Behnken\
    \ based on the single-factor \ntest, and the optimal combination of spraying parameters\
    \ (flight \nheight of 2.0 m, flight velocity of 3.7 m/s and nozzle flow rate of\
    \       \n430 mL/min) was obtained from the established model.  Chen  \net al.[49]\
    \ achieved the optimal spraying parameters of six-rotor \nplant protection UAV\
    \ by an orthogonal test of three factors for \norange tree according to the results\
    \ of droplet deposition.  \nSimilarly, Zhang et al.[50] have done a spraying test\
    \ for orange \ntrees through the use of four-rotor plant protection UAV, and \n\
    found that the droplet density on the tree canopy reach a \nmaximum when flight\
    \ altitude of UAV was 1 m.  The \nexperimental results mentioned above have provided\
    \ a data \nsupport and guidance for aerial spraying of plant protection UAV \n\
    to reduce liquid drift and improve the utilization rate of pesticide \nto a greater\
    \ extent. \n \nTable 1  Optimal operating parameters of different types of UAVs\

    1 \nN/A \n \n3.4  Test of aerial spraying efficacy \nIn the process of aerial\
    \ spraying of plant protection UAV, the \ncomplexity of the operating environment\
    \ and the variability of \noperating parameters leading to droplet deposition\
    \ and droplet \nmovement are difficult to predict.  Therefore, the deposition\
    \ effect \nand distribution characteristics of pesticide has become an \nimportant\
    \ reference for guiding the aerial spraying operation.  In \norder to detect the\
    \ distribution of droplet deposition quickly and \nbetter understand the distribution\
    \ characteristics of droplet \ndeposition of aerial spraying, the study of aerial\
    \ spraying efficacy \nhas become an important part of plant protection UAV aerial\
    \ \nspraying technologies. \nTo verify and evaluate the artificial path planning\
    \ and the \nactual operating effect in visual remote flight mode, Peng et al.[56]\
    \ \ndesigned a wireless transmission system based on GPS and \nimplemented straight\
    \ flight experiment and the real-time path \nplanning flight experiment on the\
    \ base of the paddy field boundary \nwhich determined by visual and experience.\
    \  The results showed \nthat the artificial planning route deviated from the ideal\
    \ flight path \nsignificantly for the reason of no reference, and the skip rate\
    \ was \n17.1%, duplication operation occupied 8.2%, and outside wasted \nregion\
    \ accounted for 0.7%.  Wang et al.[57] proposed a novel \nmeasurement method of\
    \ spatial pesticide spraying deposition \nquality balance for UAV, which were\
    \ made for collecting the \ndroplets of UAV pesticide application in 4 directions\
    \ (top, bottom, \nupwind and downwind) to analyze the spatial droplet deposition\
    \ \ndistribution.  The method can provide valuable information for the \nresearch\
    \ of UAV pesticide application techniques and the \nestablishment of the standard\
    \ of spray deposition and drift tests of \nUAV in crop field.  In addition, in\
    \ order to realize the rapid \nacquisition of the effect of droplet deposition\
    \ spraying by plant \nprotection UAV, Zhu et al.[117] developed a custom software\
    \ \npackage entitled “DepositScan” for evaluating the droplet \ndeposition distribution,\
    \ which allowing for determination of \nindividual droplet sizes, overall distributions,\
    \ total droplet number, \ndroplet density, spray deposit volume and percent coverage\
    \ from \nthe exposed card.  Zhang et al.[54] tested the temperature change \n\
    rate between unsprayed and sprayed by thermal infrared imager \nand WPH642 UAV\
    \ to reflect the droplets deposit on rice canopy, \nand showed that the thermal\
    \ infrared imager could reflect the \ndroplets deposit law exactly.  Zheng et\
    \ al.[58] established a \ndetection method that uses the reflective wave of laser\
    \ radars.  \nPositional information for applied droplets was recognized and \n\
    extracted and the coordinate was transformed, and the sample time \nthat could\
    \ describe the droplets distribution was analyzed and \ndetermined.  In addition,\
    \ the dynamic proportion was used to \neliminate the drift droplets and the effective\
    \ distribution range was \ndetermined.  Zhang et al.[59] developed a sensor with\
    \ a variable \ndielectric capacitor and network system to measure deposition \n\
    volume in near real-time.   The results of testing showed that \ncompared to water\
    \ sensitive paper image analysis, the degree of fit \nfor the distribution curve\
    \ is 0.9146 with relative measurement \nerrors of 10%-50%.  Similarly, Cai et\
    \ al[60] designed a sensor for \nreal-time detection of the effect of droplet\
    \ deposition in aerial \nspraying application based on the principle of common-plane\
    \ \nplug-in capacitor, with measurement accuracy of 0.1 μg/cm and \nsingle point\
    \ measurement speed of 10 μs.  The sensor is able to \nmeasure the amount of droplet\
    \ deposition and observe the process \nof droplet evaporation.  Compared with\
    \ traditional ground \ndetection techniques, these studies have shortened the\
    \ cycle of \nactual tests and simplified actual test process.  This which is \n\
    helpful in accelerating application and popularization of aerial \nspraying technology,\
    \ improving its effect.  \n3.5  Promotion and application of plant protection\
    \ UAV-based \nspraying technology \nIn order to accelerate the research and popularization\
    \ of plant \nprotection UAV-based aerial spraying technologies, many \nexperimental\
    \ demonstrations and technical promotions for different \ncrops were carried out\
    \ by national research institutes and enterprise \nunits related to UAV, such\
    \ as South China Agricultural University, \nNanjing Research Institute for Agricultural\
    \ Mechanization, China \nAgricultural University, DJI Technology Co., Ltd, X-aircraft\
    \ Co., \nLtd, et al.  Since the national key research and development plan \n\
    of high efficiency ground and aerial spraying technology and \nintelligent equipment\
    \ was set up in 2016, the precision agricultural \naviation team from South China\
    \ Agricultural University has carried \nDecember, 2018          Lan Y B, et al.\
    \  Current status and trends of plant protection UAV and its spraying technology\
    \ in China            Vol. 1 No.1   7 \nout more than 40 research projects in\
    \ various crops such as orange \ntrees, rice, cotton and wheat in Yunnan, Hunan,\
    \ Xinjiang, Henan \nand other provinces.  This has played a significant role in\
    \ \npromoting and leading the development of plant protection \nUAV-based aerial\
    \ spraying technologies.  Further supporting and \nenhancing the effectiveness\
    \ of plant protection UAV-based aerial \nspraying technologies, the National Aviation\
    \ Plant Protection \nScience and Technology Innovation Alliance was established\
    \ in \n2016 by Anyang Quanfeng Aviation Plant Protection Technology \nCo., LTD\
    \ and South China Agricultural University.  The Alliance \norganized more than\
    \ 60 groups concerned with agricultural UAVs \nand has become an important landmark\
    \ for the application and \ndevelopment of UAV-based aerial spraying technologies\
    \ in China.  \nThe alliance has organized a number of enterprises to carry out\
    \ \nwheat aphid control and cotton defoliant spraying tests in 2016 and \n2017.\
    \  In August 2016, over 20,000 hectares were impacted by the \noutbreak of mythimnaseparata\
    \ walker disease in Shaanxi Province.  \nThe alliance organized a number of member\
    \ units and mobilized \nhundreds of UAV for emergency prevention and relief work.\
    \  This \nwas the first cooperation for UAV-based aerial spraying in China \n\
    which established an operational model for the use of UAV for \nlarge-scale pest\
    \ control moving forward. \n \nFigure 5  Plant protection UAVs spraying for different\
    \ crops \n \n4  Analysis of development trend of plant protection \nUAV-based\
    \ spraying technologies \n4.1  Precision aerial spraying technology \nThe basic\
    \ requirement of plant protection and pesticide \napplication is to have good\
    \ efficacy.  Meanwhile, increasing the \neffective utilization but reducing the\
    \ use of pesticides are also the \ninevitable requirements for the future development\
    \ of plant \nprotection technologies.  Precision aerial spraying technology \n\
    serves as an effective means to achieve this goal through the use of \nvarious\
    \ technologies and information tools.  These tools and \ntechnology allow UAV\
    \ technologies to achieve maximum \nproductivity of agricultural aviation operations.\
    \  There are a \nnumber of technologies that assist aerial applicators including\
    \ \nglobal positioning systems (GPS) and geographic information \nsystems (GIS),\
    \ remote sensing system (RS), and variable-rate (VR) \ncontrollers, as exhibited\
    \ in Figures 1.  Remote sensing systems \nprovide precise images for spatial analyses\
    \ of plant stress due to \nwater or nutrient status in the field, disease, and\
    \ pest infestations.  \nThrough image processing and GIS, remote sensing data\
    \ are \nconverted \ninto \nprescription \nmaps \nfor \nvariable-rate \naerial\
    \ \napplication[61,62]. \nNowadays, some aerial spraying has achieved variable-rate\
    \  \nspraying to a certain degree, which can adjust the flow of spraying \nsystem\
    \ based on the flight parameters of UAV and keeping the \ndosage of every area\
    \ basically unchanged.  But it is not the real \nprecise spraying for plant protection\
    \ UAV.  Precision spraying \nneeds to spray variably according to the extent of\
    \ crop diseases and \ninsect pests.  In the future, we need to strengthen the\
    \ research of \nimage processing, variable-rate spraying, data fusion and other\
    \ \ntechnologies, and apply these technologies to aerial spraying of \nplant protection\
    \ UAV to achieve its precise spraying. \n4.2  Basic theory of spraying technology\
    \ \nIn the process of pesticides spraying, the droplets spraying by \nplant protection\
    \ UAV are smaller than other plant protection \nmachinery and are susceptible\
    \ to influence factors such as wind \nfield generated by rotor and environmental\
    \ air-flow.  It will lead \nto some problems such as instability of droplet deposition\
    \ region, \nunclear of droplet motion law and ease of droplet drift etc.  It is\
    \ \nworth noting that droplet deposition and drift is an important factor \nin\
    \ deciding the efficiency of pesticide application.  At present, the \ndomestic\
    \ research on the law of droplet deposition and drift for \nvarious types of plant\
    \ protection UAVs is still not thorough.  Due \nto of the diversity of plant protection\
    \ UAVs and the variety of \ncrops in China, further research not only need to\
    \ study the droplet \ndeposition law of aerial spraying under different weather\
    \ conditions \n(temperature, humidity and atmospheric) and operating parameters,\
    \ \nbut also need to establish an accurate simulation model of droplet \ndeposition\
    \ distribution.  This model can select optimal operating \nparameters and droplet\
    \ size for different types of plant protection \nUAV by analyzing the droplet\
    \ deposition law before field tests to \nachieve the best pesticide spray effect.\

    \ cooperative technology \nWith the extensive implementation of precision aerial\
    \ spraying, \ninformation detection and pesticide spraying of UAV have different\
    \ \nrequirements, and single UAV is difficult to effectively accomplish \nvarious\
    \ tasks at the same time.  In order to make up for the \nshortcomings of single-UAV\
    \ operations, researchers have begun to \nresearch multi-UAV cooperative technology.\
    \  Multi-UAV \ncooperative operation is based on single-UAV operation, to achieve\
    \ \nintelligent networking of multi UAVs.  Each single UAV is \nrequired to be\
    \ able to coordinate the task for the whole so as to \neffectively cover a large\
    \ area and conduct information interaction \nand collaboration.  With technological\
    \ advances in Internet of \nThings (IoT) and big data, multi-UAV cooperative operation\
    \ will \nbe a greater extent to save labor costs and improve the efficiency of\
    \ \nprecision aerial operations. \n4.4  Supporting technologies for plant protection\
    \ UAV-based \naerial spraying \nIn recent years, plant protection UAV-based aerial\
    \ spraying \noperation has become one of the most important components of \nagricultural\
    \ aviation applications as its large-scale application.  As \nUAV-based \naerial\
    \ \nspraying \napplication \nwith \nhigh-degree \natomization of spray liquid,\
    \ droplets have easy to drift and other \ncharacteristics.  In order to ensure\
    \ the effective application of \nUAV-based \naerial \nspraying, \nsupporting \n\
    technologies \nfor \nUAV-based aerial spraying have a huge research potential,\
    \ such as \nR&D technologies for nozzle, chemical agent and adjuvant, etc.  \n\
    In which, these nozzles may include the electrostatic nozzle, the \nadjustable\
    \ spray nozzle for droplet size and spray flow and others.  \nThese chemical agent\
    \ for aerial spraying by UAV may include the \nultra-low-volume liquid, the nano-biological\
    \ agent and others.  \nThese chemical adjuvant for aerial spraying by UAV may\
    \ include \nthe modified vegetable-oil adjuvant, the organosilicone adjuvant \n\
    and others.  The development and application of these \ntechnologies will provide\
    \ a strong guarantee for precision \nagricultural aviation application by effectively\
    \ reducing drift and \nloss of droplets and promoting the absorption of the active\
    \ \ningredients in crop. \n5  Conclusions \nAccelerating the popularization and\
    \ application of plant \nprotection UAV is of urgent need in the construction\
    \ of modern \nagriculture in China.  Nowadays, practices have proven that plant\
    \ \nprotection UAV and its spraying technologies have made great \nprogress and\
    \ application in China due to their irreplaceable \nadvantages in terms of non-limitation\
    \ on crop growth and \ntopographical conditions, operational efficiency improvement,\
    \ cost \nefficiency and so on.  With the development of economy, China \nfaces\
    \ the severe situation of insufficient rural labor brought by \npopulation aging\
    \ and urbanization.  In order to ensure the stable \nand sustainable development\
    \ of agriculture in China, and accelerate \nthe process of agricultural mechanization\
    \ and modernization, plant \nprotection UAV which replaced traditional manpower\
    \ sprayer meet \nthe requirements of the current development of agricultural \n\
    modernization.  And its low-altitude and low-volume spraying \ntechnologies have\
    \ greatly promoted the level of plant protection \nmechanization in China. \n\
    In addition, from the perspective of the development history of \nUAV in Japan,\
    \ other developed countries and the domestic market \ndemand, plant protection\
    \ UAV is thriving.  These technologies \nhave broad market prospects and ever-expanding\
    \ potential \napplications.  In order to ensure the healthy development and \n\
    application of plant protection UAV, the urgency of the in-depth \nstudy of plant\
    \ protection UAV and its low-altitude and low-volume \nspraying technologies couldn’t\
    \ be ignored.  Meanwhile, a better \nunderstanding \nof \nplant \nprotection \n\
    UAV-based \nspraying \ntechnologies will help to design and optimize plant protection\
    \ UAV \nand its spray components, and so as to promote the efficient use of \n\
    pesticides, provides great significance to the healthily and orderly \ndevelopment\
    \ of the plant protection UAV market in China. \n \nAcknowledgments \nWe acknowledge\

    \ 2012\nAbstract:\nA ﬂood warning system incorporates telemetered rainfall and\
    \ ﬂow/water level\ndata measured at various locations in the catchment area. Real-time\
    \ accurate data collection\nis required for this use, and sensor networks improve\
    \ the system capabilities. However,\nexisting sensor nodes struggle to satisfy\
    \ the hydrological requirements in terms of autonomy,\nsensor hardware compatibility,\
    \ reliability and long-range communication. We describe the\ndesign and development\
    \ of a real-time measurement system for ﬂood monitoring, and its\ndeployment in\
    \ a ﬂash-ﬂood prone 650 km2 semiarid watershed in Southern Spain.\nA\ndeveloped\
    \ low-power and long-range communication device, so-called DatalogV1, provides\n\
    automatic data gathering and reliable transmission. DatalogV1 incorporates self-monitoring\n\
    for adapting measurement schedules for consumption management and to capture events\
    \ of\ninterest. Two tests are used to assess the success of the development. The\
    \ results show an\nautonomous and robust monitoring system for long-term collection\
    \ of water level data in\nmany sparse locations during ﬂood events.\nKeywords:\
    \ real-time data acquisition; sensor network; hydrological monitoring; ﬂood\n\
    warning system\nSensors 2012, 12\n4214\n1.\nIntroduction\nA warmer climate, with\
    \ its increased climate variability, will increase the risk of both ﬂoods and\n\
    droughts [1], whose management and mitigation are important to protect property,\
    \ life, and natural\nenvironment. Real-time accurate monitoring of hydrologic\
    \ variables is key for ﬂood forecasting, as\nwell as for optimizing related warning\
    \ systems for damage mitigation. Recent studies show that in\nthe speciﬁc case\
    \ of semiarid and arid areas, adequate deployment of monitoring networks is essential\n\
    to a real understanding of the underlying processes generating run-off in storm\
    \ events, and to achieve\neffective emergency systems (e.g., [2]).\nTraditionally,\
    \ researchers have directly collected data at the places of interest. This has\
    \ now been\ncommonly substituted by automatic sensor and datalogger systems, which\
    \ provide high temporal data\nresolution, while reducing operational human resource\
    \ requirements. Dataloggers permit local automatic\nand unattended data gathering,\
    \ and reduce environmental perturbation. However, data retrieval from\nstandard\
    \ dataloggers and storage in processing and control/warning centers still has\
    \ to be done either\nmanually, which prevents its applicability in ﬂood warning\
    \ systems, or through wired connections, which\nleads to substantial investments\
    \ and operational costs. To confront these problems, sensor network\ntechnology\
    \ has been proposed in many monitoring applications [3]. Yet, speciﬁc literature\
    \ on sensor\nnetwork for ﬂood forecasting is sparse, with only a few examples\
    \ available (e.g., [4–8]).\nBasically, a sensor network comprises a set of nodes,\
    \ where each node includes a processor, a wireless\nradio module, a power supply,\
    \ and is equipped with sensor hardware to capture environmental data. Each\nnode\
    \ performs the tasks of data gathering, physical parameter processing, and wireless\
    \ data transmission\nto the control server. Speciﬁcally, for hydrologic applications,\
    \ sensor nodes must also fulﬁll a number of\nadditional requirements:\n• Power\
    \ lifetime: Power sources are often not available at the locations of hydrological\
    \ interest.\nMoreover, these locations are usually unprotected, and if renewable\
    \ energy devices are used, there\nare prone to vandalism or theft. Thus, sensor\
    \ nodes must have low-consumption, which along with\nexisting standard batteries,\
    \ should last at least one hydrologic cycle.\n• Sensor hardware compatibility:\n\
    Most hydrologic sensor nodes include a datalogger device\nconnected through a\
    \ cable to one or more measurement instruments. The datalogger must provide\n\
    multiple wired interfaces to be able to communicate with a range of speciﬁc sensor\
    \ hardware\ninterfaces. This also involves issues of power supply, and selective\
    \ time for power dispatching,\nwhich leads to optimal power management and facilitates\
    \ the expansion of connected instruments.\n• Reliability: Harsh weather conditions\
    \ may cause failures in the wireless communication over\nthe monitoring network.\
    \ Backup mechanisms in local sensor dataloggers must be used to avoid\ninformation\
    \ losses in unexpected crashes.\n• Long-range communication: Hydrologic measurement\
    \ locations are commonly sparse over large\nareas, and far away from the control\
    \ center (i.e., tens or hundreds of kilometers). Sensor nodes\nmust have a peer-to-peer\
    \ connection with the control center.\nSensors 2012, 12\n4215\nIn general, these,\
    \ sometimes opposing, requirements are difﬁcult to be satisﬁed by existing\ndeveloped\
    \ solutions. For example, multiple sensor readings and long-range communication\
    \ are high\npower-consumption tasks, which diminish battery lifetime.\nFor instance,\
    \ many existing wireless\nsolutions for agriculture applications (e.g., [9–11])\
    \ use a set of tens or hundreds of motes, which\ncollaborate to gather dense data\
    \ in a small area.\nMotes have low consumption, but they provide\nlimited sensor\
    \ interfaces, and short-range communication.\nOn the other hand, several hydrologic\n\
    and meteorologic applications have been implemented with a few wireless datalogger\
    \ stations, which\nindividually obtain multi-sensor data in a few sparse locations\
    \ over a large area (e.g., [5,12–14]). These\ndataloggers permit high computing\
    \ and long-range communication. However, they have an excessive\ninvestment cost\
    \ and a high consumption that may be, in the long-term, unsustainable.\nThis paper\
    \ describes the design, development, and deployment of a real-time monitoring\
    \ system for\nhydrological applications. The paper is focused on the description\
    \ in detail of our wireless datalogger\ndevice, so-called DatalogV1 [15], which\
    \ combines the low consumption of motes and the reliable\ncommunication of most\
    \ powerful multi-sensor datalogger stations in order to satisfy the requirements\
    \ of\nﬂood warning system scenarios. The DatalogV1 provides automatic monitoring\
    \ and long-term autonomy\nin sparse points over large areas.\nTo demonstrate the\
    \ goodness of the DatalogV1 design, we deployed a monitoring network in the\n\
    Rambla del Albuj´on watershed, in Southern Spain. The severity of ﬂash ﬂoods in\
    \ the Rambla del\nAlbuj´on has caused important environmental and economic damages\
    \ over the last years. Accordingly, the\nwireless monitoring network is intended\
    \ to provide real-time accurate hydrologic information to support\nan operational\
    \ model-based ﬂood warning system. This is an excellent test to asses the DatalogV1\n\
    performance and success in a real case scenario.\nThe remainder of the paper is\
    \ organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the context of environmental\nmonitoring\
    \ and ﬂood warning systems. Section 3 depicts our hydrologic monitoring scenario.\
    \ Section 4\npresents the design of DatalogV1 hardware. Section 5 shows the implementation\
    \ of DatalogV1 software.\nSection 6 describes the architecture developed for remote\
    \ hydrologic monitoring. Section 7 describes the\ndeployment of the monitoring\
    \ network in the Rambla del Albuj´on watershed. Section 8 shows the results\n\
    obtained regarding power consumption and data collection. Section 9 provides concluding\
    \ remarks.\n2.\nEnvironmental Monitoring\nEnvironmental monitoring is the most\
    \ popular application for sensor networks. At present, sensor\nnetworks have been\
    \ applied for a number of applications as, e.g., soil moisture monitoring [16],\
    \ solar\nradiation mapping [17], aquatic monitoring [18], glacial control and\
    \ climate change [19], forest ﬁre\nalarm [20], landscape ﬂooding alarm [21], and\
    \ forecasting in rivers [22]. The ability to place autonomous\nand low cost nodes\
    \ in large harsh environments without communication infrastructure enables accurate\n\
    data collection directly observed from interest areas. With sensor networks, environmental\
    \ data can be\nobserved and collected in real-time, and used for forecasting upcoming\
    \ phenomena and sending prompt\nwarnings if required.\nSensors 2012, 12\n4216\n\
    2.1.\nModel-Based Flood Warning System Context\nThe developed sensor network was\
    \ incorporated within the context of a model-based ﬂood warning\nsystem in the\
    \ Rambla del Albuj´on watershed. A model-based ﬂood warning system, for mitigating\
    \ the\neffects of ﬂooding on life and property, incorporates a catchment model\
    \ based on observed/forecasted\nrainfall and telemetered observations of hydrologic\
    \ state variables at various locations within the\ncatchment area. Generally,\
    \ observed variables are ﬂow and/or water level in channels. Also, other\nvariables\
    \ such as soil moisture and piezometric levels may be of interest, depending on\
    \ the watershed\nresponse. Real-time updating of the ﬂood forecasting involves\
    \ the continual adaptation of the model\nstate variables, outputs and parameters,\
    \ so that the forecasts for various times into the future are based\non the latest\
    \ available information and are optimized, in some sense, to minimize the forecasting\
    \ errors\n(e.g., [23]). This is the process of data assimilation. Implementation\
    \ of environmental sensor networks\nfor data assimilation within model-based ﬂood\
    \ warning systems involves complex engineering and\nsystem challenges. These systems\
    \ must withstand the event of interest in real-time, remain functional\nover long\
    \ time periods when no events occur, cover large geographical regions of interest\
    \ to the event,\nand support the variety of sensor types needed to detect the\
    \ phenomenon [8].\n3.\nHydrological Monitoring and Forecasting in the Rambla del\
    \ Albuj´on Watershed\nThe Rambla del Albuj´on watershed (650 km2) is the main\
    \ drainage catchment in the Campo de\nCartagena basin, in Southern Spain (see\
    \ Figure 1). The main channel in the watershed is 40 km long and\nﬂows into the\
    \ Mar Menor; one of the big coastal lagoons in the Mediterranean (135 km2). The\
    \ Campo\nde Cartagena basin is an area with semiarid Mediterranean climate, where\
    \ the average temperature\nranges from 14 oC to 17 oC, mean potential evapotranspiration\
    \ is 890 mm yr–1 and mean precipitation is\n350 mm yr–1. Most rainfall comes in\
    \ short-time storm events, and the watershed hydrologic response is\nhighly complex\
    \ and non-uniform.\nPrevious studies have shown the complex ﬂash-ﬂood response\
    \ of the Rambla del Albuj´on watershed\nand the importance of spatially distributed\
    \ observation for adequate forecasting (e.g., [2]). Also, for\nﬂooding evaluations,\
    \ stage gauges provide an advantage over ﬂow gauges that the observations remain\n\
    unbiased when ﬂow goes out of banks, in which case the validness of calibrated\
    \ rating curves (stage-ﬂow\nrelationships) is prevented. In this sense, remotely-sensed\
    \ information (from aerial photography and/or\nsatellites) is appealing as it\
    \ contains much more spatial information than typical stage gauge networks\nin\
    \ operational watersheds. Accordingly, recent studies are evaluating the potential\
    \ of aerial photography\nand remotely sensed (from satellites) synthetic aperture\
    \ radar to provide measurements over large\nareas of water levels and ﬂood extents\
    \ in lakes and rivers (e.g., TerraSAR-X or COSMO-Skymed\nconstellations [24]).\
    \ However, the current low temporal frequency of satellite acquisitions relative\
    \ to\ngauging station sampling indicates that remote sensing still does not represent\
    \ a viable replacement\nstrategy for data assimilation into model-based forecasts\
    \ [25]. Also, before the ﬂow goes out of banks,\nthe accuracy of standard stage\
    \ gauges is higher than that provided by airborne information, which is\nkey for\
    \ early warnings. Thus, if economically viable, a spatially distributed network\
    \ of stage gauges\nremains the best option to capture the observations required\
    \ to feed the forecasting and data assimilation\nprocesses.\nSensors 2012, 12\n\
    4217\nAt the Rambla del Albuj´on watershed, we implemented a hydrological monitoring\
    \ system consisting\non a network of stage gauges located at eight critical junction\
    \ points between major tributaries. The\nmonitoring locations were carefully chosen\
    \ in order to achieve effective water level monitoring during\nﬂood events and\
    \ a reliable model-based forecasting system. Figure 1 shows the selected locations\
    \ which\nare far away (∼50 km) from the control center at the University of Murcia,\
    \ to the North of the watershed.\nIn this area, an existing phone infrastructure\
    \ enables the communication among the server in the control\ncenter and the DatalogV1s\
    \ in the ﬁeld. The DatalogV1s must be autonomous only with batteries, because\n\
    no power source exists in the monitoring area and solar panels are frequently\
    \ stolen or vandalized. In\nthe following sections, we describe the design and\
    \ development of the DatalogV1 to provide remote data\ngathering of the water\
    \ stage in channels during ﬂoods.\nFigure 1. Deployment scenario. The embedded\
    \ image shows the location of the Rambla del\nAlbuj´on watershed at the Southeast\
    \ of the Iberian Peninsula. The violet line describes the\nwatershed boundary\
    \ drawn on a digital terrain model (DTM). Within the watershed, the main\nchannel\
    \ network is shown in blue, and labeled squares indicate deployed gauge locations.\n\
    Sensors 2012, 12\n4218\n4.\nDesign of DatalogV1 Hardware\nThe DatalogV1’s design\
    \ was developed to address the requirements of the described application. The\n\
    block diagram of DatalogV1 is illustrated in Figure 2(a). The critical components\
    \ are a low-power\nmicrocontroller (µC) module that supervises the DatalogV1’s\
    \ operation, multiple sensor interfaces\n(Pulse, SDI-12, RS-485, Analog) that\
    \ enable to take measurements from different kinds of sensor\ndevices, and a GPRS\
    \ module for long-distance communication with the control center.\nMoreover,\n\
    two communication modules (USB and Bluetooth) enable the in-situ interactions\
    \ via a laptop. All\nelectronic components and a battery are mounted in an IP65\
    \ waterproof box to protect from harsh\nweather conditions, as shown by Figure\
    \ 2(b). The DatalogV1’s design is balanced between low-power\nconsumption for\
    \ long-lifetime, and computational capability for multi-sensor reading and long-range\n\
    communication. The hardware design of these components is described in the next\
    \ subsections.\nFigure 2. Two different views of the DatalogV1. (a) Block diagram\

    \ Microcontroller Module\nThe circuit schematic of the microcontroller module\
    \ is shown in Figure 3. The central part of the\nschematic represents the low-power\
    \ 8-bits microcontroller (PIC18LF8722) manufactured by Microchip.\nThe PIC18F8722\
    \ operating to 3.3 V is ideal for low power applications (≃nanoWatts) with 120\
    \ nW sleep\nmode and 25 µW active mode. It provides high processing speed (40\
    \ MHz) with a large 256 KB RAM\nmemory. A 12 MB dataﬂash memory is included for\
    \ local storage of sensor data. The top-left portion of\nthe schematic (IC3) shows\
    \ a security mechanism to avoid microcontroller blockage in case that available\n\
    energy is not enough. Thus the microcontroller resets when there is less than\
    \ 2.4 V. The center-left part\nof the schematic contains the crystal oscillator\
    \ setting to 11 MHz. (OSC1/OSC2 tags). The oscillator\nprovides a precise clock\
    \ signal to stabilize frequencies for sensor readings and data transmissions.\n\
    Sensors 2012, 12\n4219\nFigure 3.\nCircuit schematic of the microcontroller module.\n\
    The center portion is the\nmicrocontroller used to control DatalogV1 operation,\
    \ and the center-left is the crystal\noscillator used for setting the clock.\n\
    4.2.\nDesign of Sensor Interfaces\nDatalogV1 provides multi-sensor interfaces\
    \ to take readings from a wide set of hydrologic\ninstruments. Its sensor interfaces\
    \ are two pulse counters, two digital connectors (RS-485 and SDI-12),\nand eight\
    \ analog inputs.\nEach pulse counter reads from a tipping-bucket rain gauge (pluviometer)\n\
    which generates a discrete electrical signal for every amount of accumulated rainfall.\
    \ Digital interfaces\nsupply power to and read measurements from instruments,\
    \ which can themselves include some degree\nof computational capability. Analog\
    \ connectors enable the reading of simple instruments which modify\nthe supplying\
    \ voltages to return voltage values proportional to the physical observed variables.\
    \ These\nmultiple interfaces are compatible with the most of hydrological sensor\
    \ devices in the market.\nPulse-counters typically connect to rain-gauge devices.\n\
    The standard rain gauge collects the\nprecipitation into a small container.\n\
    Every time the container is ﬁlled and emptied, it generates a\nelectric pulse.\
    \ According to the number of pulses and the size of the container, DatalogV1 estimates\n\
    the precipitation without requiring power supply.\nSensors 2012, 12\n4220\nFor\
    \ each digital interface, DatalogV1 can supply and read multiple sensors. Both\
    \ RS-485 and SDI-12\ninterfaces consist of three electronic wires for data, ground\
    \ and supplying voltage. The RS-485 is a\nstandard serial communication for long\
    \ distance and noisy environments. In addition, the SDI-12 is a\nserial data interface\
    \ at 1,200 baud designed for low-power sensors. Using serial protocols, DatalogV1\n\
    can directly obtain the physical measurements.\nThe analog inputs allow to read\
    \ 8 differential sensors, 16 single-ended sensors, or a combination\nof both options.\
    \ A differential connection comprises four electronic wires acting as voltage-supplier,\n\
    ground, positive-voltage, and negative-voltage, while a single-end connection\
    \ contains two electronic\nwires for supplying-voltage and positive-voltage.\n\
    The main difference between differential and\nsingle-ended is the way to obtain\
    \ the voltage value. In single-ended, the voltage value is the difference\nbetween\
    \ the positive voltage and the ground at 0 V. However, single-ended connections\
    \ are sensitive to\nelectrical noise errors, which are solved by differential\
    \ connections. Because twisting wires together will\nensure that any noise picked\
    \ up will be the same for each wire, the voltage value in differential inputs\
    \ is\nthe difference between the positive and negative voltages.\nFigure 4. Circuit\
    \ schematic of analog interfaces. (a) Selector of analog connections to\nplugged-in\
    \ sensors, (b) ADC converter from output voltage to digital data.\n(a)\n(b)\n\
    To obtain the measurements of the physical variables, output voltages are processed\
    \ using three main\nhardware components: multiplexer, ampliﬁer, and ADC converter.\
    \ Two multiplexers MC74HC4051D\nfrom Motorola company enable to select the output\
    \ voltage of a speciﬁc analog sensor (Figure 4(a)).\nEach multiplexer contains\
    \ 3 control pins CA0, CA1, and CA2 to choose an output voltage among 16\npossibilities.\
    \ The selected output voltage is ampliﬁed for preserving high effective resolution.\
    \ DatalogV1\nuses an AD8622 ampliﬁer, manufactured by Analog Devices, that provides\
    \ high current precision,\nlow noise, and low power operation. The pre-conﬁgured\
    \ ampliﬁcation depends on the output range\nSensors 2012, 12\n4221\nof the selected\
    \ sensor.\nFinally, the ampliﬁed output signal is converted to a digital value\
    \ through\nan Analog-Digital Converter (ADC), as shown by Figure 4(b).\nDatalogV1\
    \ contains a 13-bit ADC\nMCP3302, manufactured by Microchip, that provides high\
    \ precision and resolution. This ﬂexible design\nprovides full compatibility with\
    \ presumably all kind of available sensors for hydrologic use.\n4.3.\nDesign of\
    \ GPRS Communication Module\nA GPRS module is used to transmit monitoring data\
    \ from DatalogV1 to the control center. Figure 5\nshows the GPRS module implementing\
    \ all functions for wireless communications.\nFigure 5. Circuit schematic of the\
    \ GPRS module. The center portion is the GPRS module\nused to control the long-distance\
    \ communication, and the top-left portion is the SIM card\nconnection.\nThe top-left\

    \ a programmable 256 KB SRAM memory and includes a\nARM9 32-bit processor at 104\
    \ MHz. This Q2686 chip makes possible to join a GSM/GPRS base-station\nand receive/send\
    \ data reliably in quad-band communications on the 800, 900, 1,800 and 1,900 MHz\n\
    Sensors 2012, 12\n4222\nbands.\nAlso, the chip makes it easy to upgrade to 3G\
    \ when needed. This GPRS module enables\nlong-distance UDP/IP communications through\
    \ cellular radio networks.\n4.4.\nDesign of Power Module\nThe power module consists\
    \ of two power sources and three regulable mechanism to provide a secure\nsupply\
    \ of electronics components. The main energy source is a 12 V DC battery of 7,000\
    \ mAh power\ncapacity which can be rechargeable using an optional solar panel.\
    \ To adapt the input tension of the\nsolar panel (17–20 V) to a lower tension\
    \ (12–15 V) to supply the battery, we use a commutated DC/DC\nregulator in step-down\
    \ mode, as shown by Figure 6(a). The microcontroller turns on the DC/DC regulator\n\
    when it detects that the battery has a low level according to a pre-established\
    \ threshold. Three circuits\nguarantee stable energy levels for battery, solar-panel,\
    \ and sensors, as shown by Figure 6(b). The circuits\nof battery and solar-panel\
    \ include security mechanisms to avoid a too low power level input to the\nsensors.\
    \ For this, the circuit of sensors is used, before readings are taken, to check\
    \ if the power supply is\nstable as to obtain an accurate measurement.\nFigure\
    \ 6.\nCircuit schematic of the battery, solar-panel, and power-control modules.\n\

    \ (a) Power supply for GPRS,\nsensors, and ADC converter, (b) power supply for\
    \ microcontroller.\n(a)\n(b)\nTo reduce the power consumption, DatalogV1 keeps\
    \ almost all electrical components deactivated,\nsuch as GPRS, sensors, and ADC.\
    \ Only the microcontroller circuit is always supplied at 3.3 V\nSensors 2012,\
    \ 12\n4223\n(Figure 7(a)) through a linear regulator LM2936 from National Semiconductor\
    \ with ultra-low current\nin the stand-by mode. This LM2936 regulator features\
    \ low drop-out voltage (50 mA) to minimize power\nlosses. Also, this circuit includes\
    \ a diode (D10) to provide a security power to protect the microcontroller\nand\
    \ all board at most 5 V. When it is necessary, the microcontroller supplies independently\
    \ the electrical\ncomponents using two DC/DC converters, two linear regulators\
    \ and a MOSFET switch (Figure 7(b)).\nConcretely to supply sensors, a DC/DC converter\
    \ and the MOSFET switch is combined to create\na adjustable commutation cell.\n\
    The design of the commutation cell includes high-power isolated\nchips in order\
    \ to reduce interferences. At the same time, it has a good linearity and load\
    \ regulation\ncharacteristics, and allows to establish the voltage supply between\
    \ 3 V and 10 V. The chosen MOSFET\nis a FDC6330L, manufactured by Fairchild Semiconductor,\
    \ which provides high performance for\nextremely low on-resistance (<0.2 V). The\
    \ DC/DC used is a MC34063AD, manufactured by Texas\nInstruments, which make possible\
    \ high voltage transmission. This technique provides a high power\nefﬁciency.\n\
    5.\nDesign of DatalogV1 Software\nThis section explains the software design of\
    \ DatalogV1 for semiarid hydrological scenarios.\nIn\nsemiarid zones, channels\
    \ are often ephemeral, i.e., they are often dry throughout the year as the result\n\
    of infrequent and irregular precipitations, and ﬂows can sharply increase during\
    \ short storm events.\nTherefore, regular periodic monitoring provides little\
    \ relevant information. Also, sensor acquisition and\nmassive data transmission\
    \ in dry periods leads to a waste of energy. Thus, DatalogV1 has been enabled\n\
    to react to the rainfall-runoff events, providing only relevant data when needed\
    \ and so reducing power\nconsumption.\nTo address this issue, a low-consumption\
    \ dynamic schedule is proposed for the major operations:\nsensor collection and\
    \ data communication. This schedule keeps the DatalogV1 in sleep mode with\nall\
    \ electrical components deactivated for most of the time. During the collection,\
    \ the DatalogV1 is\nactivated to supply sensor devices and take readings and afterwards\
    \ it returns to sleep mode. The dynamic\nmeasuring schedule uses two different\
    \ observation frequencies: low and high. The energy-saving low\nfrequency is used\
    \ most of the time in semiarid areas, as channels are commonly dry. When a relevant\n\
    event is detected, the high observation frequency is activated. Also, only when\
    \ a number of stored sensor\nmeasurements is reached, the DatalogV1 activates\
    \ the GPRS modem to transmit data to the control\nserver. This schedule takes\
    \ useful measurements increasing the autonomy of the monitoring system.\nThe development\
    \ environment for the DatalogV1 software is IAR Embedded Workbench for\nMicroChip,\
    \ and the programming language is C [26]. The DatalogV1’s software is divided\
    \ into three\nmain modules. First, the main loop module is responsible for initializing\
    \ the conﬁguration parameters\nand managing the low-consumption dynamic schedule\
    \ for sensor reading and wireless communication.\nSecond, the sensor reading program\
    \ is in charge of the power supply to sensors and collection of sensor\nobservations.\
    \ Third, the wireless communication program is designed for receiving and sending\
    \ data\npackets over a GPRS network based on UDP/IP protocol.\nSensors 2012, 12\n\
    4224\n5.1.\nMain Loop Routine\nThe main loop routine performed by the microcontroller\
    \ is illustrated in the ﬂowchart of Figure 8.\nThe operation of the main loop\
    \ program is divided into six parts. First, the microcontroller initializes\n\
    RTC clock, I/O ports, peripheral modules, and hardware interruptions. Second,\
    \ the microcontroller\nreads EEPROM and saves in memory the conﬁguration parameters\
    \ of all operations.\nThird, the\nmicrocontroller conﬁgures the external modules,\
    \ such as the GPRS module and sensors interfaces.\nFourth, the microcontroller\
    \ is kept in sleep mode during the most time possible and a watchdog process\n\
    generates a wake-up interrupt every second. When the watchdog ﬁnishes the microcontroller\
    \ resumes to\nworking mode. Then, the microcontroller checks if there is some\
    \ pending task to be done. Otherwise,\nthe microcontroller must return to sleep\
    \ mode. To indicate a pending task, the microcontroller uses ﬂags\nin active mode.\
    \ After dealing with the active tasks, the microcontroller returns to sleep mode.\n\
    Figure 8. Flowchart showing the main loop routine of node operation.\nThe low-consumption\
    \ schedule manages the activation of reading and communication tasks. The\nimplementation\
    \ of the schedule consists of a reading timer, a counter of stored sensor data,\
    \ and a GPRS\ntimer. By default, the reading timer is conﬁgured in low observation\
    \ frequency, set to a measurement\nevery 10 minutes. If the reading of a sensor\
    \ exceeds a pre-established threshold, then a relevant event is\nassumed to happen,\
    \ and the fast mode is activated, so the reading timer ﬁres every minute. This\
    \ way, the\nsensor data are saved until there is a pre-conﬁgured amount to transmit\
    \ over GPRS network. In addition,\na GPRS timer is used to guarantee a maximum\
    \ time among transmissions, currently set to one hour. This\nschedule reduces\
    \ the power consumption in reading and transmission, providing a reliable keep-alive\n\
    system.\nSensors 2012, 12\n4225\n5.2.\nSensor Reading Routine\nThe reading routine\
    \ must manage a wide range of hydrological sensor with different output types:\n\
    pulse-counter, digital, and analog. The reading of a pulse-counter rain-gauge\
    \ is based on a wake-up\ninterruption, When rainfall accumulates, the rain-gauge\
    \ generates an electrical signal which wakes up\nthe microcontroller to keep a\
    \ register of the number of pulses per hour. The reading of each digital\nsensor\
    \ (RS-485, SDI-12) requires the use of a serial protocol to communicate with the\
    \ sensor device.\nSo, the microcontroller supplies the sensor devices during the\
    \ measurement time and request the sensor\nfor the physical parameter. The reading\
    \ of analog sensors (differential, single-end) needs the use of an\nanalog-digital\
    \ converter (ADC) to obtain the physical measurements. Moreover, we group the\
    \ analog\nreading of several sensors with common features in order to save supplying\
    \ energy. Below, we explain\nin detail the reading process for analog devices\
    \ according the ﬂowchart of Figure 9.\nFigure 9. Flowchart showing the periodic\
    \ task of reading several sensor with different power\nsupply.\nReading task\n\
    Manage sets of sensors\nwith the same voltage\nStart ADC with\nthe specific voltage\n\
    Supply\na set of sensors\nWait a stable voltage\nRead the set\nof sensors\nSwitch\
    \ off the set\nof sensors and ADC\nAre all sensors read?\nEnd\nY\nN\nIn analog\
    \ readings, the microcontroller divides all active sensor inputs into several\
    \ sets with the same\nsupplying voltage and the same output voltage. So, each\
    \ sensors set is measured simultaneously. First,\nthe microcontroller selects\
    \ a set of sensor inputs and activates the ADC converter. The sensor devices\n\
    and the ADC converter is supplied with the speciﬁc voltage. Then, the microcontroller\
    \ waits until the\noutput voltages are stable which is determined for the maximum\
    \ measurement time of sensors selected.\nSensors 2012, 12\n4226\nWhen the measurement\
    \ time ﬁnishes, the ADC converts each read voltage output to the corresponding\n\
    physical value. So, the microcontroller stores the measured values along with\
    \ the time sequence when\nthey were collected, and it switches off the sensors\
    \ and the ADC converter. This scheme is repeated\nwhile there is some analog sensors\
    \ which are still not reading.\n5.3.\nGPRS Communication Routine\nThe main operation\
    \ of GPRS communication is to transmit sensor data collected by the DatalogV1.\n\
    In addition, the GPRS communication is in charge of sending health-status information\
    \ and receiving\nsoftware changes from the control server. To communicate with\
    \ the control server, the DatalogV1\nactivates the GPRS module brieﬂy, and then\
    \ returns to sleep mode. The DatalogV1 and the control\nserver follows the UDP/IP\
    \ protocol, as it has lower complexity and consumption than TCP/IP.\nFigure 10.\
    \ Flowchart showing the periodic task of GPRS communication from the node to\n\
    the control server.\nFigure 10 shows the ﬂowchart of the communication routine\
    \ divided into ﬁve parts. When the GPRS\ntask is activated, the microcontroller\
    \ switches on the GPRS modem, and sends a command with the\nconﬁguration parameters\
    \ of the communication. Then, the GPRS modem ﬁnds the nearest base station\nin\
    \ its coverage area and establishes the connection conditions of the phone network.\
    \ Once the GPRS\nmodem is registered in the base station, the DatalogV1 sends\
    \ a synchronization packet to the control\nserver and waits the respective response.\
    \ The response packet indicates if a new version of ﬁrmware\nor conﬁguration is\
    \ available. In this case, the DatalogV1 sends a software request and changes\
    \ to the\nupdate state. During the update process, the DatalogV1 receives the\
    \ ﬁrmware and conﬁguration packets\nand commits the changes to itself. After the\
    \ DatalogV1 is updated, the data sending is conducting.\nDuring the data transmission,\
    \ the DatalogV1 sends sensor historical and health status packets to the\ncontrol\
    \ server. When the transmission ﬁnishes, the microcontroller switches off the\
    \ GPRS modem.\nSensors 2012, 12\n4227\nWireless communication is prone to transmission\
    \ errors and intrusive attackers.\nTo guarantee\nreliable communications, DatalogV1\
    \ provides three level of security: integrity, conﬁdentiality and\nauthentication.\
    \ To implement those, we use three common mechanisms: CRC checking, AES/CBC\n\
    encryption, and SHA-2 hash.\n• CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) mechanism checks\
    \ the packet integrity and detects error bits\nproduced by wireless interferences.\n\
    • AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in CBC mode is a symmetric-key encryption\
    \ algorithm to\nprovide a conﬁdential communication. The AES function converts\
    \ the input plaintext into the ﬁnal\noutput of ciphertext. To avoid the same ciphertext,\
    \ we include a padding of random values.\n• SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm) implements\
    \ a cryptography function to provide authentication\npurposes.\nIn addition, phone\
    \ network limits the maximum transmission unit MTU to less than 2 KB. For\nthis\
    \ reason, the DatalogV1 must divide historical data into several frames ordering\
    \ for time collection\nsequences. When the control server receives the data frame,\
    \ it responds with an acknowledgement\nindicating the last sequence received.\
    \ In the case of ﬁrmware of conﬁguration changes, the control server\ndivides\
    \ the software update into several portions using offset sequences. When the DatalogV1\
    \ receives\nupdate frames, then it replies an acknowledgement response, which\
    \ includes the last offset sequence of\nsoftware received. This ACK scheme guarantees\
    \ the bi-directional communication.\nFigure 11. Flowchart showing the required\
    \ task to send and receive frames using GPRS\nmodule.\nSend a packet\nDivide the\
    \ packet\ninto several frames\nDeal with the\nnext frame\nMake Hash,\nEncrypt\

    \ CRC,\nEncrypt and Hash\nReassemble\nthe packet\nIs completed?\nProcess the packet\n\
    Check ACK\nfor syncronization\nCheck ACK\nfor data\nCheck update\nfor request\n\
    Sensors 2012, 12\n4228\nTo process frames, the microcontroller performs the sending\
    \ and reception subroutines shown in\nFigure 11. In the sending subroutine, the\
    \ microcontroller divides the GPRS packet into multiple frames.\nEach frame consists\
    \ of a header, the identify of the DatalogV1, and the payload. A SHA-2 hash is\n\
    applied to the payload and the identify to generate a 256 bits hash ﬁeld. The\
    \ header including the hash\nﬁeld is encrypted to generate a 256 bits unreadable\
    \ header. For the payload and the unreadable header,\nthe microcontroller determines\
    \ the CRC value saved at the end of the frame. The created frame is sent\nand\
    \ a timer is conﬁgured to wait the reception of its acknowledgement response.\
    \ When a frame is to\nbe received, the microcontroller should decide if all security\
    \ ﬁelds are correct. So, the microcontroller\nchecks the CRC ﬁeld, decrypts the\
    \ header and veriﬁes the SH2-2 hash. If some checking is incorrect,\nthe frame\
    \ is discarded. In other case, the microcontroller extract the payload to reassemble\
    \ the original\npacket. When the packet is received completely, it is processed.\
    \ Figure 12 shows the format of the data\nframe used during the GPRS communication.\n\

    \ may cause that DatalogV1 to have poor radio connectivity or hardware\nfailures.\
    \ To avoid information losses, the DatalogV1 provides a backup system based on\
    \ persistent\nmemory, cycle buffer, and keep-alive timer. The persistent 12 MB\
    \ data-ﬂash enables to store hundreds\nof thousands data registers during several\
    \ days. The DatalogV1 implements a cycle buffer with two\npointers that mark the\
    \ last transmitted register and the last measured register.\nA keep-alive timer\n\
    indicates the maximum response time from the control server to detect communication\
    \ failures. When\nthe timer ﬁnishes, the DatalogV1, previously to stop the communication,\
    \ marks the last transmitted\nregister that has been conﬁrmed from the control\
    \ server. The next occasion the GPRS communication is\nreestablished, the DatalogV1\
    \ transmits data from the transmitted register. This implementation provides\n\
    a reliable communication solution to prevent information losses.\nSensors 2012,\
    \ 12\n4229\n6.\nRemote Monitoring System\nThe monitoring system enables to gather\
    \ sensor information from remote DatalogV1s and supports\ndata analysis and decision-making.\
    \ To administrate the monitoring system, a complete end-user interface\ncarries\
    \ out historical data queries and warning messages for health status. In hydrologic\
    \ applications, the\nmonitoring system enables the establishment of water level-based\
    \ real-time alarm mechanisms for ﬂood\nemergencies.\nTo provide data collection\
    \ and storage management, we use a dedicated server running a Supervisory\nControl\
    \ and Data Acquisition System (SCADA). The SCADA server is completely developed\
    \ in\nJAVA Language. The SCADA implements a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)\
    \ to manage GPRS\ncommunication with each individual DatalogV1. Each PLC is charge\
    \ for receiving sensor data and\nhealth status and transmitting software updates.\
    \ To store all received information, the SCADA uses\nan object-relational database\
    \ management system (ORDBMS), which currently is PostgreSQL v8.4.\nPostgreSQL\
    \ is a free solution that supports almost all SQL constructs, transactions, and\
    \ user-deﬁned\ntypes.\nTo minimize the perturbation in areas of environmental\
    \ interest, the monitoring system must\nallow remote maintenance tasks.\nIn these\
    \ cases, the objective goes toward zero human presence\nfor maintenance and administration\
    \ during the monitoring period.\nFor this reason, the SCADA\nserver provides a\
    \ Java Web Start interface that enables the access to the monitoring system directly\n\
    from the Internet using a standard web browser.\nUsing the web interface, end-users\
    \ can perform\nadministration tasks, such as conﬁguration changes, software updates,\
    \ and health-status control. Also,\nthese administration tasks are required during\
    \ in-situ installation and removal situations. To assist in-situ\ninteractions,\
    \ a version of SCADA software for laptop has been developed. A laptop with SCADA\
    \ can\nbe connected to the DatalogV1 through both an USB connector and wireless\
    \ Bluetooth communication.\nThus remote and in-situ administration of the monitoring\
    \ system is made possible. The proposed wireless\nmonitoring system is shown in\
    \ Figure 13.\nThe monitoring system provides data analysis for alarm messages\
    \ by the web interface. The SCADA\nserver analyzes and processes the water level\
    \ which serve to (a) directly detect ﬂood situations when\nthe gathered data go\
    \ up established thresholds, and (b) feed the model-based ﬂood forecasting and\
    \ data\nassimilation system. Issues of warnings will eventually be obtained for\
    \ SCADA operators based on the\ntwo approaches, so the SCADA operators can more\
    \ soundly decide on warning issues to be submitted\nto stakeholders. Currently,\
    \ the ﬁrst approach is fully implemented. The model-based ﬂood forecasting\nsystem\
    \ is in implementation phase. The approach is to assimilate ﬂow depth data into\
    \ a distributed\nhydrological model with semi-distributed parametrization to allow\
    \ for model structure and parameter\nidentiﬁcation. The currently selected model\
    \ is MARIAM [2]. The selected data assimilation method is\nthe Monte Carlo based\
    \ Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) [27], which even under Gaussian assumptions,\n\
    allows for some non-linearities to be updated in the ensemble during the assimilation\
    \ step. We are\ncurrently evaluating several available options and variations\
    \ of the original ﬁlter. In addition, the SCADA\nchecks the health status of DatalogV1\
    \ to enable warning messages when the communication period\nor low battery deviate\
    \ from normal situations. Its functionality provides reliability data gathering\
    \ and\nﬁne-grained control without human presence in the ﬁeld.\nSensors 2012,\

    \ of Monitoring System: Hydrologic Sensor and Protective Structure\nSelection\
    \ of hydrological instrumentation is an important factor in the autonomy of the\
    \ monitoring\nsystem, as reading of sensor measurements is a frequent and high\
    \ power consuming task.\nThis\nconsumption not only depends on the nominal power\
    \ required by the sensor but also on the time it\nrequires to take a reading,\
    \ including excitation time. For our application, we used 7 pressure sensors\n\
    (UNIK-5000; General Electric Sensing), which provide high accuracy and fast measurement\
    \ time,\nleading to low power consumption. UNIK-5000 sensor has a piezo-resistive\
    \ pressure transducer, which\nmeasures the water pressure at the end of the sensor\
    \ probe and returns a voltage output in milliamperes\n(4–20 mA). The vertical\
    \ accuracy of the sensor is 10% of the measurement range, which in our\ndeployment\
    \ was 0–5 m or 0–7.5 m, depending of the depth of the channel cross-sections and\
    \ maximum\nexpected ﬂow depths. DatalogV1 maps the voltage readings into the water\
    \ column (cm) by using a\ntank-calibrated linear function.\nTo map water columns\
    \ to ﬂows, a channel recognition and GPS/GLONASS ﬁeld campaign was\nconducted\
    \ obtaining the deﬁnition of channel characteristics and slopes. At every measurement\
    \ location,\nwe took a 3 cross-sections as far apart as possible (order of several\
    \ hundred meters) within channel\ntransects which we considered relatively uniform\
    \ (so changes in ﬂow regime are highly unlikely in\nthe transect). That is, one\
    \ at the measurement point, another upstream and yet another downstream.\nThe\
    \ location of the water depth probes was precisely measured within each central\
    \ cross-section.\nRating curves to map water levels to ﬂows were obtained through\
    \ simulating steady-state conditions\nand subcritical ﬂow with the hydraulic simulation\
    \ software HEC-RAS [28], and applying a Manning’s\nfriction coefﬁcient n = 0.035.\n\
    Sensors 2012, 12\n4231\nDebris is common in channelized ﬂow in ﬂash ﬂoods all\
    \ over the region. Thus, we used a protective\nsafety structure for the UNIK-5000\
    \ sensors, as shown in Figure 14. That is, the UNIK-5000 sensor is\nplaced inside\
    \ a PVC tube, which has an array of small oriﬁces along its axis. Oriﬁces are\
    \ transversal\nto ﬂow, so water pressure is hydrostatic, and the uncertainty in\
    \ water level measurements due to inertial\nenergy is negligible. The UNIK-5000\
    \ is wired to the DatalogV1 located at the top of the PVC tube. The\ndesign allows\
    \ water entering into the pipe, while preventing debris impacts.\nFigure 14. Protective\
    \ deployment in the Albujon watershed. The DatalogV1 device is\ninserted into\
    \ a 400 × 400 cm cement housing. The housing has 70 cm diameter hole that\nconnects\
    \ a 65 cm diameter and 7 m length PVC pipe, which protects the UNIK-5000 sensor.\n\
    Within the Rambla del Albuj´on deployment, a special measuring location is a city\
    \ center where\nvandalism is likely. To confront this problem, we selected a Radar\
    \ Level Sensor (OTT RLS), which\nenables accurate and high resolution measurements\
    \ (cm) without physical contact with the water ﬂow.\nThe OTT RLS sensor has a\
    \ very high consumption. Fortunately, we could plugged into the public\nelectricity\
    \ grid to provide supply for the DatalogV1 device at this speciﬁc point. Both\
    \ the DatalogV1\nand the OTT RLS sensor were perched below a high-level bridge\
    \ (10 m height) to prevent vandalism.\nTable 1 summarizes the features of the\
    \ deployed hydrologic sensors.\nTable 1. Features of hydrologic sensors deployed\

    \ are available from a existing dense rain gauge network deployed\nin the Rambla\
    \ del Albuj´on watershed. The network comprises two subnetworks, both of them\
    \ with\ntipping-bucket gauges with a resolution of 0.2 mm. One is operated by\
    \ the Agroclimatic Information\nService of Murcia (SIAM), and the other belongs\
    \ to the Automatic Hydrological Information System\n(SAIH), operated by the Water\
    \ Authority (Segura Basin Hydrological Confederation; CHS). The spatial\ncoverage\
    \ is fairly uniform, and 16 rain gauges fall within the watershed or in a near\
    \ neighborhood. Data\nare also transmitted in real-time from these collaborating\
    \ organisms to the SCADA system.\n8.\nTesting Results\nThe goal of our ﬁeld development\
    \ is to provide a long life-time monitoring system to obtain\ncontinuous accurate\
    \ water level information to be assimilated into a model-based ﬂood warning system.\n\
    Here we focus on two tests conducted to assess the success of the monitoring system.\
    \ The ﬁrst test\nwas done to validate the functional operation in terms of robustness\
    \ and reliability. The second one was\nperformed in order to assure the low-consumption\
    \ and the autonomy during a complete hydrological\ncycle.\n8.1.\nHydrological\
    \ Monitoring Results\nThe deployment to test the functional operation was done\
    \ in the Rambla del Albujon watershed, on\nthe 28 October 2010. Usually, the spatial\
    \ variability in semiarid hydrological systems is high. Thus\nsome nodes may well\
    \ be recording ﬂow data while other stay dry in other watershed areas. Up to\n\
    date, just some of the DatalogV1s wired to UNIK-5000 sensors have captured relevant\
    \ information.\nThis is not hydrologically uncommon, due to the general lack of\
    \ precipitation in the given semiarid\nenvironment, where ﬂash ﬂoods are occasional\
    \ but occur abruptly every few years. Still, the available\nmeasurements serve\
    \ well to the purpose of evaluating the monitoring system. The most signiﬁcant\
    \ event\nsince the deployment occurred during one week in November 2011. Figure\
    \ 15 shows the water level\nreadings gathered by the gauge stations which recorded\
    \ signiﬁcant data. Despite existing harsh weather\nconditions, the monitoring\
    \ system showed it robustness and reliability, communicating the collected\nmeasurements\
    \ to the central base without any data losses.\n8.2.\nAutonomy Results\nThe DatalogV1\
    \ was designed and developed for energy efﬁciency. The consumption depends on\n\
    the pre-established conﬁguration. In the worst case (high observation frequency\
    \ mode), the DatalogV1\nruns a data reading every minute and a data transmission\
    \ every hour. Using a Tektronic TDS 3014B\noscilloscope, we measured the power\
    \ used for the main periodic states: sleep, sensor acquisition, and\nGPRS transmission.\
    \ In easier terms, GPRS transmission is divided into two subtasks: registration\n\
    and communication. Table 2 shows the approximate power and duration of each task.\
    \ The average\nconsumption E per hour is denoted as:\nSensors 2012, 12\n4233\n\
    Estate = Power · Duration/Frequency [mAH]\n(1)\nE = Esleep + Eacqui + Eregis +\
    \ Etranss = 0.352 mAh\n(2)\nwhere Equation (1) estimates the power used for each\
    \ state and Equation (2) indicates the total\nconsumption, which is 0.352 mAh.\
    \ As expected, the GPRS module consumes most of the energy while\nthe chosen UNIK\
    \ sensor and microcontroller are very power efﬁcient. Using a 7,500 mAh battery,\
    \ the\nautonomy is 887 days, which is more than enough to monitor one annual hydrological\
    \ cycle.\nFigure 15.\nWater level collected during one week, corresponding to\

    \ Future Works\nThe paper describes the design and implementation of a real-time\
    \ monitoring system for hydrologic\napplications. The proposed monitoring system\
    \ presents useful characteristics as large network capacity,\nsensor hardware\
    \ compatibility, low power consumption, low cost, and minor impact on the natural\n\
    environment. The testing results shows that the system is energy efﬁcient, has\
    \ a robust communication\ncapability, and provides real-time accurate measurements.\
    \ Its ﬂexibility enables a wide application span\nfor autonomous data collection\
    \ with reliable transmission in few sparse points over large areas. We are\ncurrently\
    \ evaluating the incorporation of a ZigBee radio module in the design to be able\
    \ to gather data\nfrom wireless sensor networks in zones with dense measuring\
    \ points. Also, hydrology-related current\nwork involves the real-time assimilation\
    \ of gathered data into a model-based forecasting system.\nSensors 2012, 12\n\

    \ ecosystems which directly inﬂuence local climates, ﬂora,\nfauna, and human activities.\
    \ Their monitorization plays a key role in their preservation, which is\nmost\
    \ commonly done through the use of environmental sensing buoy networks. These\
    \ devices\ntransmit data by means of satellite communications or close-range base\
    \ stations, which present\nseveral limitations and elevated infrastructure costs.\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are another\nalternative for remote environmental\
    \ monitoring which provide new types of data and ease of use.\nThese aircraft\
    \ are mainly used in video capture related applications, in its various light\
    \ spectrums,\nand do not provide the same data as sensing buoys, nor can they\
    \ be used for such extended periods\nof time. The aim of this research is to provide\
    \ a ﬂexible, easy to deploy and cost-effective Wireless\nSensor Network (WSN)\
    \ for monitoring marine environments. This proposal uses a UAV as a mobile\ndata\
    \ collector, low-power long-range communications and sensing buoys as part of\
    \ a single WSN.\nA complete description of the design, development, and implementation\
    \ of the various parts of this\nsystem is presented, as well as its validation\
    \ in a real-world scenario.\nKeywords: remote sensing; WSN; UAV; LPWAN; LoRa;\
    \ marine monitoring; low power electronics\n1. Introduction\nEcological monitoring\
    \ is an area of great interest for remote sensing, mainly due to the increased\n\
    concern for the preservation of the environment, as well as the impact of climate\
    \ change and human\nactivity. Diverse implementations have been widely used in\
    \ ﬁelds such as forest monitoring [1,2],\nwildlife preservation [3,4] and agriculture\
    \ monitoring [5,6].\nAnother ﬁeld in which remote sensing has played a key role\
    \ in recent years is the marine\nenvironment.\nIt is probably one of the most\
    \ important areas in ecology, as changes in this\nenvironment directly impact\
    \ the biodiversity and atmospheric conditions, as well as any ﬁshing-related\n\
    activities [7–9]. Moreover, it is also one of the harshest settings to monitor\
    \ for any type of deployment,\nas it requires waterproof robust technology to\
    \ endure the high levels of humidity and salinity, wave\ncollisions, and extreme\
    \ weather conditions [10]. The way in which marine environments have\nbeen monitored\
    \ has changed little in the past few decades, with the majority of implementations\n\
    being based on satellite imagery, underwater devices with various sensors, and\
    \ buoy developments.\nThe latter are by far the most commonly used, being mostly\
    \ applied to ambient variable measurement,\neither as stationary or drifting devices,\
    \ each with its own speciﬁc purpose. These devices can\nmeasure several variables\
    \ simultaneously and monitor areas for long periods of time. Currently,\nthere\
    \ are at least 1354 stations and 1421 drifter buoys deployed globally, according\
    \ to data from the\nSensors 2017, 17, 460; doi:10.3390/s17030460\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 460\n2 of 22\nNational Data Buoy Center [11] and The Global\
    \ Drifter Program [12] correspondingly. Yet one of the\nmain drawbacks of using\
    \ buoys is the process for data extraction. The most commons methods\nare long-range\
    \ communications, close-range wireless transmissions, or dry-land data collection.\n\
    Long-range transmissions require either a previously established infrastructure,\
    \ such as a ground\nbase station, or satellite connectivity. When using a ground\
    \ station, the buoys must be ﬁxed to a\ngiven position, or several stations must\
    \ be established for drifting buoys. Additionally, these types\nof wireless communications\
    \ tend to have a range limited to less than 100 m per ground station, thus\nthe\
    \ high usage of satellite communications. In the case of short-range communications\
    \ and dry-land\ndata collection, an aquatic vessel is required to reach the buoys\
    \ and either extract the data or the buoy\nitself. All the previously mentioned\
    \ methods are hardly sustainable due to expenses associated with\nmonthly fees,\
    \ maintenance, or person-hours.\nCurrently, one of the most novel approaches for\
    \ monitoring marine environments is the use\nof Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).\
    \ These devices can cover areas several km wide, given their\nlong-range communications,\
    \ enabling the possibility of monitoring hard to reach areas with relative\nease,\
    \ as well as acquiring similar data than that of satellite imagery. In this last\
    \ area, its contributions\nhighly beneﬁt from the possibility of extracting data\
    \ at a higher resolution than satellites, but in contrast\nthey may only cover\
    \ smaller areas of analysis [13]. Additionally, as they are airborne devices,\
    \ UAVs\ndo not face the same challenges as marine monitoring deployments. Implementations\
    \ using these\ntypes of devices have been used for wildlife [14–17], environmental\
    \ [18,19], and hazardous marine\nmonitoring [20]. Usually the data type acquired\
    \ by a UAV in a marine implementation are those that\ncan be collected using infrared,\
    \ multispectral, or conventional cameras, yet environmental data are, for\nthe\
    \ most part, unattainable. Moreover, given their short life span of tens of minutes\
    \ and the need for\nuser interactions, monitoring for extended periods of time\
    \ is difﬁcult to achieve, as it would require\nseveral landings and battery replacements.\n\
    To overcome the limitations of UAV and buoy based implementations, the use of\
    \ a hybrid Wireless\nSensor Network (WSN), which uses both technologies, is proposed\
    \ in this article. This type of UAV\nassisted WSN system architecture has become\
    \ increasingly used in the past few years, given recent\nadvances in both areas.\
    \ In the agricultural sector, these type of implementations have been used to\n\
    monitor crops remotely, by using a UAV as a data collector [21,22] and, in some\
    \ cases, as a trigger\nfor countermeasures against pests [22]. Similarly, the\
    \ use of UAVs has been proposed as a means of\nmanaging disaster situations, in\
    \ conjunction with both WSN [23,24] and cellular networks [24,25],\nwhich presents\
    \ several improvements over current implementations. In other areas, such as the\n\
    entertainment sector, UAV assisted WSN have been proposed to provide enhanced\
    \ user experiences in\nvarious types of events, such as music concerts or sports\
    \ [26].\nIn aquatic environments, similar approaches as the one proposed in this\
    \ article can be found in\nthe literature, such as the work of Zolich et al. [27]\
    \ and Barbatei et al. [28]. Zolich et al. propose the use\nof a UAV to collect\
    \ data from stationary low-cost and low-power consuming buoys, which provide\n\
    data regarding various underwater sensors. To transmit data to the UAV, they used\
    \ an 868 MHz radio\nmodule which implements the Tiny Mesh protocol, with a power\
    \ consumption of 24 mA in reception\nand 560 mA in transmission, both at 3.3 V.\
    \ In their experimentation, they were able to transmit with a\nmaximum data rate\
    \ of 4399.97 bps and a data link range of 485 m, whilst the UAV was hovering at\n\
    approximately 9 m above sea surface. Barbatei et al. use a similar system architecture\
    \ with a UAV\nas a data mule and custom designed modular stationary buoy devices,\
    \ which house a temperature\nsensor, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), GPS module,\
    \ micro SD storage, and a wireless transmitter,\nall managed by a 16 bit microcontroller.\
    \ The wireless transmitter used in their implementation is\na Radiocrafts RF1280\
    \ module, which transmits at 868 MHz frequency with a FSK modulation with\nan\
    \ estimated data rate of 4.8 kbps. According to their study, this provides an\
    \ approximate range of\ncommunications of 264 m with the UAV, with a low current\
    \ consumption of 21 mA in reception and\n28 mA in transmission, and a 3.3 V voltage\
    \ supply.\nSensors 2017, 17, 460\n3 of 22\nThe system proposed in this article\
    \ aims to use a swarm of drifting buoys, contrary to static\nones presented in\
    \ the previously mentioned work, as primary environmental sensors, covering wide\n\
    areas of seashore, and a UAV as a data sink and dynamic network router. The use\
    \ of drifting buoys\nmakes the use of short-range communications with the UAV\
    \ completely unviable, thus, to be able to\nlocate and extract the data with a\
    \ UAV, it is desirable to have long-range communications to simplify\ntheir interaction.\
    \ The selection of a proper wireless communication protocol to fully integrate\
    \ these\ndevices is paramount. There are several possibilities for these type\
    \ of transmissions, yet the recent\ndevelopment of the Low Power Wide Area Network\
    \ (LPWAN) protocols present new opportunities\nwith the beneﬁts of a reduced energy\
    \ consumption and moderate data rate [29,30]. One of the most\npromising technologies\
    \ in LPWANs is the LoRa spread spectrum modulation, which has been proven\nto\
    \ be able to communicate data across several kilometers with a low power consumption\
    \ [30–33].\nThe unique modulation of this technology not only offers the possibility\
    \ of transmitting below the noise\nﬂoor, but has also a high resilience to external\
    \ interference [34]. As a slight drawback, similar to most\nLPWANs, the LoRa technology\
    \ presents a limited transmission bitrate, which is sufﬁcient for most\nsensing\
    \ applications although not ideal for high data streaming. Having stated the capabilities\
    \ of the\nLoRa modulation, as well as the requirements of the application, it\
    \ can be seen that it seems to properly\nsuit the necessities of this implementation,\
    \ avoiding the use of satellite or GSM communications, as\nwell as additional\
    \ cumbersome infrastructure.\nIn the following sections of this paper a full description\
    \ of the proposed system and its\nfunctionalities are encompassed. Afterwards,\
    \ from both a hardware and ﬁrmware perspective, the\narchitecture of the system\
    \ is analyzed, as well as the custom network layer protocol designed for this\n\
    implementation. Finally, the description of a series of trials, their methodology,\
    \ a ﬁeld test for the\nvalidation of the system, a discussion of the results,\
    \ and the ﬁnal conclusions are explained.\n2. SIMMA Functional Overview\nThe implementation\
    \ of this multi-device solution was sought out to cover the necessities of the\n\
    SIMMA research project in Mexico. The aim of this project is to monitor different\
    \ variables in the\nMexican shoreline, using low-power and low-cost sensing buoys\
    \ which can be scattered across a wide\narea. The buoys, as stated before, are\
    \ to be used mainly as drifting devices, although a scenario where\nthey are used\
    \ as stationary buoys, by anchoring them to the seaﬂoor, has also been contemplated\n\
    within this project. To be able to access their data, a UAV is to be used as a\
    \ mobile data harvester and\nnetwork manager. By design, UAVs can be controlled\
    \ across great lengths using different wireless\ncommunications, using mostly\
    \ different types of UHF transmissions for video and ﬂight data feeds,\nas well\
    \ as ﬂight controls. To be able to act as a network router, it was important to\
    \ select a wireless\ncommunication technology which would not affect the operation\
    \ of the UAV, as any interference could\nhave catastrophic consequences. One of\
    \ the key characteristics of LoRa is its unique modulation, which\nallows its\
    \ coexistence and operation with other RF technologies presumably without interference\
    \ [34],\nthus the use of this type of transmission seems adequate for its interaction\
    \ with the UAV and its\nmultiple radio modules.\nUnder the SIMMA project, there\
    \ are two main functional scenarios: data extraction and search\nand rescue. In\
    \ both cases, the buoys will be periodically collecting data regarding water temperature,\n\
    wind speed and its GPS coordinates, as well as air temperature, pressure, and\
    \ humidity. In the data\nextraction scenario, after the buoys have been set on\
    \ the shore line and ambient variables have been\ncollected, the UAV will ﬂy in\
    \ the last known direction of the buoys, periodically searching for them.\nOnce\
    \ the buoys have been found, the UAV will start transmitting data acquisition\
    \ messages to collect\nthe data stored in the buoys. After the completion of this\
    \ task, or if it starts running low on battery, the\nUAV will return to home.\
    \ Given that the buoy recruiting and data collection process is fully automated,\n\
    to be able to monitor the network activity of the SIMMA system, a secondary optional\
    \ ground station\ncan be set on the beach. This ground station will not interact\
    \ with the UAV, it is only meant to be used\nas a network analyzer or sniffer\
    \ (Figure 1).\nSensors 2017, 17, 460\n4 of 22\nSensors 2017, 17, 460 \n4 of 21\

    \ The straight-line arrow \nindicates the main data transmission flow, the dashed\
    \ arrow represents the communications with the \noptional ground station and the\
    \ others indicate the environmental input to the buoys. \nIn the search and rescue\
    \ scenario, the UAV will be used to locate missing buoys that may have \ndrifted\
    \ away from the rest of the swarm. Given that the buoys may be either stranded\
    \ or in a distant \nlocation, the UAV will be flown in the suspected direction\
    \ of the buoys and will try to collect the \nposition of any buoy in its path\
    \ before its return to home. This functionality simplifies the recovery \nof the\
    \ buoys, which, in many cases, are lost to strong currents or vandalism [10,35,36].\
    \ \n3. SIMMA System Architecture \nAs stated previously, for this proposal a multi-device\
    \ solution was implemented to try and cover \nthe different necessities of the\
    \ SIMMA project. Two distinct hardware were developed with LoRa \nwireless communications:\
    \ the control node and the sensor node. The control node functions either as \n\
    a network master, mounted on the UAV, or as a network monitor in a ground station;\
    \ the sensor node \nhardware can only be placed inside the buoy (Figure 2). \n\
    \ \nFigure 2. Functionality of the hardware developed for the SIMMA project. \n\
    For both hardware, a firmware was developed with a custom network layer protocol\
    \ which will \nbe referred to as LoRaNET. Additionally, to be able to interact\
    \ with the SIMMA system, a Graphical \nUser Interface (GUI) was also developed\
    \ to simplify the process of configuration and mode switching. \nWhen using a\
    \ base station as monitor, the GUI may also be used to display the system’s activity.\

    \ at the Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain.\nGiven the complexity of the system,\
    \ and to better explain the full functionality of this proposal,\nthis section\
    \ has been divided in various subsections covering the electronic hardware, software,\n\
    ﬁrmware, and the GUI. Moreover, the description of the UAV and buoys used in the\
    \ implementation\nis also covered.\n3.1. LoRaNET\nThe implementation of a design\
    \ speciﬁc network layer protocol was sought out given that the\ncurrent LoRa protocol,\
    \ LoRaWAN [37], does not include the functionality for the transceiver in\nthe\
    \ 433 MHz frequency band, which is the operating frequency that is to be used\
    \ for the SIMMA\nproject. Moreover, there is less ﬂexibility while conﬁguring\
    \ the LoRa settings which may increase the\ntransmission range, as well as a high\
    \ packet overhead which incurs directly in the power consumption.\nLoRaNET is\
    \ a proprietary network layer implementation, designed for this speciﬁc proposal,\n\
    which uses the LoRa modulation, oriented for ultra-low power WSN, where the synchronization\
    \ needs\nand bandwidth are not elevated. LoRaNET is able to implement a star network\
    \ topology and deﬁnes\ntwo simple types of nodes:\n•\nMaster node: Creates and\
    \ manages the network, assigning network addresses to the other nodes\nand centralizing\
    \ the message trafﬁc;\n•\nSlave node: Any other node that is part of the network.\n\
    Every time a LoRa network is created, a series of basic parameters are established\
    \ for its\nfunctionality. Within these parameters are the network ID, the maximum\
    \ wait time for an answer\nwithin the network, the maximum wait time for a node\
    \ to leave the network after the last message,\nand the number of attempts a message\
    \ can be re-sent if there is no acknowledgment of message\nreception. These parameters\
    \ must be adjusted accordingly with the LoRa RF settings, which alters the\ntransmission\
    \ range, as the time on air of a message may vary greatly.\nOnce the network has\
    \ been created, the master node can recruit any slave node within its reach\n\
    as long as it is not part of any active network. If a message can be answered\
    \ by several slave nodes\nsimultaneously, as when recruiting, scanning the network\
    \ or with any type of broadcast message, the\nanswer is sent in pseudo-random\
    \ intervals, reducing the possibility of RF packet collisions.\nWhen a slave node\
    \ has been recruited, the master assigns him a 2 byte unique ID in the network,\n\
    which is associated with the device’s MAC address. If for any reason a slave gets\
    \ disconnected, upon\nreconnection it will be assigned the same ID. The master\
    \ node will always be assigned the 0x0000\naddress, and the 0xFFFF address is\
    \ reserved as a broadcast identiﬁer.\nIn the Table 1, a summary of the main commands\
    \ implemented in the current version of LoRaNET\nis shown.\nSensors 2017, 17,\

    \ employed. The main processing\nunit is a 16 bit PIC24FJ128GC006 microcontroller\
    \ [38], which manages all the peripherals and\ncommunications. Given its architecture,\
    \ it offers several low power conﬁgurations that can be used\nto increase the\

    \ was\nselected [39], as it offers the possibility of transmitting data in a wide\
    \ range of frequencies with the\nLoRa modulation. Additionally, the board was\

    \ master node through the LoRa communications. The first \nof these are used to\
    \ modify the transceiver’s internal registers, which alter the transmission \n\
    frequency, spreading factor, coding rate, and channel bandwidth [44,45]. These\
    \ settings will \ndetermine the range and data rate at which transmissions will\

    \ defines a framework where pieces of code \nare organized into bundles that can\
    \ be managed separately (e.g., installed, updated, removed, etc.). \nThese bundles\
    \ are agents which might be dedicated to specialized tasks, such as handling a\
    \ serial \nport or providing a command line interface. Moreover, they communicate\
    \ and interact with each \nother by means of services which are published within\
    \ the framework, which are available to each \nbundle. \n \nFigure 7. Control\
    \ node software architecture. \nFigure 7. Control node software architecture.\n\
    Although several bundles are implemented in this application, to better understand\
    \ the\nfunctionality of this device, the following must be described:\n•\nPeripheral\
    \ and device bundles: Enable the usage of the diverse communication transceivers\n\
    present in the IoT cape, publishing them in the framework. They are composed by\
    \ two layers:\nthe peripheral and the device layer. The former gives access to\
    \ the ports and communication\ninterfaces—such as GPIOs, UARTs, SPI and I2C—so\
    \ that they may be accessible from the\nframework. The former provides the methods\
    \ to conﬁgure and manage each of the transceivers;\n•\nLoRaNET bundle: Implements\
    \ the LoRaNET network layer, providing the methods to manage or\nconnect to an\
    \ existing network;\n•\nSIMMA bundle: Deﬁnes the application layer and the main\
    \ functionality of the device;\n•\nContext Manager (CM) bundle: Manages and stores\
    \ the data originating from the sensor nodes,\nguaranteeing its allocation in\
    \ the data base, as well as its access from external systems through\na Representational\
    \ State Transfer (RESTful) API or the direct data processing in the platform.\n\
    This same API has been enhanced to enable control, conﬁguration and notiﬁcation\
    \ of events from\na remote interface (external to the OSGi framework).\nAdditionally,\
    \ this device also functions as a UI which accesses the historical data of the\
    \ sensor\nnodes, through the CM, to convey commands or conﬁgure the system.\n\
    Depending on their role, the control nodes can be conﬁgured either as masters\
    \ or monitors.\nA master node is responsible for creating and maintaining the\
    \ network, assigning network addresses to\nthe other nodes and centralizing the\
    \ message trafﬁc. The master node functionality can be summed up\nin two types\
    \ of tasks, one for conﬁguring the system and another for retrieving data. In\
    \ the former, the\nmaster node is able to change the LoRa RF settings of the network\
    \ it will create, conﬁgure the sensor\nnodes with these same settings and modify\
    \ the sensor nodes operating conﬁguration, mentioned\nin the previous section.\
    \ In the latter task, the master node is able to retrieve relevant data from the\n\
    sensor nodes and store it in its memory. The monitor nodes, on the contrary, may\
    \ only function as\ninformation providers to the users, with the single task of\
    \ reporting the activities of a master node\nwhen it is onboard the UAV without\
    \ any interactions (Figure 8).\nSensors 2017, 17, 460\n10 of 22\n \nthe master\
    \ node is able to change the LoRa RF settings of the network it will create, configure\
    \ the \nsensor nodes with these same settings and modify the sensor nodes operating\
    \ configuration, \nmentioned in the previous section. In the latter task, the\
    \ master node is able to retrieve relevant data \nfrom the sensor nodes and store\
    \ it in its memory. The monitor nodes, on the contrary, may only \nfunction as\
    \ information providers to the users, with the single task of reporting the activities\
    \ of a \nmaster node when it is onboard the UAV without any interactions (Figure\
    \ 8). \n \nFigure 8. Control node’s task diagrams. \nFigure 8. Control node’s\

    \ drifter buoy, which has an “X” style sail and four\nﬂoatation devices. This\
    \ design is commonly used in oceanographic surface monitoring, given its ease\n\

    \ UAV Design\nThe UAV is based on a Delta Wing design, built with a foam frame\

    enough (4.2 kg with battery and electronics) to be launched by hand or a small\
    \ launchpad (Figure 11).\nSensors 2017, 17, 460\n12 of 22\n \n3.5. UAV Design\

    \ \nThe UAV is equipped with a Panda II autopilot system kit [51], which includes\
    \ a GPS receiver \nmodule, three-axis MEMS gyros, three-axis accelerometer, three-axis\
    \ magnetic sensor, a barometric \npressure sensor, and an airspeed meter. This\
    \ system provides a high precision flight control with \nthree different operation\
    \ modes: manual, AFSS activated (active stabilization), and autopilot. The \n\
    autopilot can be controlled and configured with the use of the GCS software provided\
    \ by the \nmanufacturers. This software provides a graphical interface which provides\
    \ real-time data for \nvarious flight parameters of the UAV and an electronic\
    \ map for waypoint navigation. To \ncommunicate the GCS with the UAV, an FY-605\
    \ wireless data radio at 462.125 MHz is utilized [52], \nproviding an extended\
    \ transmission range of up to 15 km. Moreover, the UAV has a 900 MHz First \n\
    Person View (FPV) video transmitter, with its corresponding integrated camera,\
    \ and a UHF Long \nRange System (LRS) receiver at 455 MHz. These last two wireless\
    \ modules are used to control the \nUAV in manual mode with a radio controller.\
    \ \nTaking into consideration the UAV’s battery weight, servos, and electronic\
    \ systems previously \nmentioned, the aircraft is able to carry approximately\
    \ 600 g of payload. Given that the master node, \nits housing, and battery pack\

    \ Methodology\nAs the LoRa communications play a key role in the system, it was\
    \ one of the ﬁrst things that\nneeded to be tested. As stated previously, the\
    \ LoRa modulation has been widely studied and its\nachievable range proven, yet\
    \ its operation at 433 MHz has not been analyzed in detail. This analysis,\nand\
    \ a comparison with the 868 MHz band, was done in a previous study [32], where\
    \ several RF\nconﬁgurations were tested with a beta version of the sensor node\
    \ communications block. From this\nexperimentation, several LoRa RF conﬁgurations\
    \ were selected for further technical testing.\nWith the control and sensor node\
    \ hardware used in this article, stress and stability tests were\ndone in a laboratory.\
    \ Periodically, the sensor node would capture data from all the ambient sensors\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 460\n14 of 22\nand GPS module, store the data in its memory\
    \ and await LoRaNET messages. The control node was\nconﬁgured to automatically\
    \ create a network, search and recruit sensor nodes, and download their\ndata.\
    \ This was accomplished with the master node connected directly to the GIU. These\
    \ tests were\ndone several times, after ﬁxing the identiﬁed coding errors, until\
    \ the ﬁrmware and software of the\ndevices were stable for the next trials.\n\
    To accomplish the third objective, several experimentations were deemed necessary.\
    \ The ﬁrst trial\nwas done by transmitting a sequence of data packages across\
    \ a shore line with both transceivers at sea\nlevel, trying to emulate LoRa transmissions\
    \ in the worst-case scenario. For this trial, various LoRa RF\nconﬁgurations were\
    \ tested, whilst maintaining the operation frequency at 433 MHz, as was required.\n\
    Amongst these conﬁgurations, it was also possible to validate the spreading factor\
    \ of 128 chips/symbol,\nbandwidth of 125 kHz, and coding rate 4/5 RF LoRa conﬁguration,\
    \ which was not veriﬁed in the ﬁrst\n433 MHz analysis. This last conﬁguration\
    \ test yielded an approximate transmission range of 5 km.\nAfterwards, there was\
    \ a need to verify if the LoRa transceiver communications would have\nany type\
    \ of negative impact on the wireless communications used in the UAVs autopilot\
    \ module,\ngiven the similar frequencies to the 433 MHz band. In the same location\
    \ of the last trial, LoRa data\npackages were transmitted across the shore line\
    \ whilst simultaneously transmitting with the UAVs\nFY-605 transceiver at 434\
    \ MHz to a computer with the GCS software. Although the FY-605 is to be used\n\
    in the 462.125 MHz band, it was conﬁgured to 434 MHz to also emulate a worst-case\
    \ scenario. Across\nthe whole experiment, there was no visible interference in\
    \ the GCS software or LoRa transmissions.\nEven though this previous trial practically\
    \ guaranteed that the LoRa master node could\noperate without interference, a\
    \ ﬁnal test was done to truly validate the communications in ﬂight.\nThis experiment\
    \ was done using a sensor node placed on the ground, a network monitor node\n\
    connected to a computer with the GUI and by mounting a master control node inside\
    \ the UAV\n(Figure 13).\n \nneeded to be tested. As stated previously, the LoRa\
    \ modulation has been widely studied and its \nachievable range proven, yet its\

    \ various \nLoRa RF configurations were tested, whilst maintaining the operation\
    \ frequency at 433 MHz, as was \nrequired. Amongst these configurations, it was\
    \ also possible to validate the spreading factor of 128 \nchips/symbol, bandwidth\
    \ of 125 kHz, and coding rate 4/5 RF LoRa configuration, which was not \nverified\
    \ in the first 433 MHz analysis. This last configuration test yielded an approximate\
    \ \ntransmission range of 5 km. \nAfterwards, there was a need to verify if the\
    \ LoRa transceiver communications would have any \ntype of negative impact on\
    \ the wireless communications used in the UAVs autopilot module, given \nthe similar\
    \ frequencies to the 433 MHz band. In the same location of the last trial, LoRa\
    \ data packages \nwere transmitted across the shore line whilst simultaneously\

    \ it was configured to 434 MHz to also emulate a worst-case scenario. Across \n\
    the whole experiment, there was no visible interference in the GCS software or\
    \ LoRa transmissions. \nEven though this previous trial practically guaranteed\
    \ that the LoRa master node could operate \nwithout interference, a final test\
    \ was done to truly validate the communications in flight. This \nexperiment was\
    \ done using a sensor node placed on the ground, a network monitor node connected\
    \ \nto a computer with the GUI and by mounting a master control node inside the\
    \ UAV (Figure 13). \n \nFigure 13. Initial flight test. To the left the sensor\

    Having placed the master node in the UAV, the aircraft was ﬂown in manual mode\
    \ in close\nproximity to the sensor node in a circular pattern. This test granted\
    \ the last successful validation of the\nsystem, prior to the ﬁnal ﬁeld test.\n\

    \ \nFor this last trial, a relatively controlled environment was needed to avoid\
    \ any possible loss of \nthe end devices. Thus the beach of El Tecolote (La Paz,\
    \ B.C.S., Mexico) was selected, due to its ease \nof access and deployment. In\
    \ this location, three buoys where placed approximately 60 m away from \nthe beach\
    \ (24.33657, −110.32229 UTM), with a separation of a few meters amongst each other,\
    \ \ncapturing environmental and positioning data every minute, granting high amounts\
    \ of information \nin a short period of time (Figure 14). \n \nFigure 14. Drifting\
    \ Davis buoy placed in El Tecolote (Mexico) beach for environmental data collecting.\
    \ \nPrior to their placement, all the slave nodes (sensor nodes and monitor) were\
    \ configured at the \n433 MHz frequency band, with a spreading factor of 128 chips/symbol,\
    \ a bandwidth of 125 kHz and \na coding rate 4/5, which provides a high data transfer\
    \ rate at the expense of transmission range \nreduction, with only the minimum\
    \ of noise immunity. The maximum amount of bitrate was \nestimated using tools\
    \ and formulas provided by the transceiver´s manufacturer [44]. Although with\
    \ \nother LoRa RF configurations increased distances are attainable, these settings\
    \ allow the validation \nof the systems functionality as a whole. \nTo verify\
    \ the proper communication between the UAV and buoys, a network monitor was \n\
    placed at the beach connected to a computer. Given that the buoys and the network\
    \ monitor were \nfairly close to each other, once the network monitor lost the\
    \ reception of data from the UAV, it could \nbe inferred that the same would happen\
    \ with the buoys. After a given time in which the buoys had \ncollected enough\
    \ data, the UAV with the master node was launched from the beach, in automatic\
    \ \nmode, following pre-established waypoints (Figure 15). \nFigure 14. Drifting\

    Although the validation trial only tested the data extraction functional scenario,\
    \ this controlled\ntrial allowed the validation of each of the systems devices\
    \ as a whole. Given that the search and\nrescue is the simpler functional scenario,\
    \ by doing a data extraction the search and rescue was also\nSensors 2017, 17,\
    \ 460\n18 of 22\ncorroborated, as the ﬁrst activity in the data extraction is\
    \ the localization of the slave nodes and\nafterwards the recollection of their\
    \ data, including the GPS position.\nAnalyzing the results obtained in the trials,\
    \ and comparing them to the proposals of\nZolich et al. [27] and Barbatei et al.\
    \ [28], several improvements were achieved. In terms of wireless data\ntransmissions,\
    \ the use of LoRa communications was proven to reach a notably higher transmission\n\
    range of 4 km with a data rate of 5.4 kbps, which is 10 times the range achieved\
    \ by Zolich et al. with\nan increased data rate. This also further exceeds most\
    \ buoy based wireless implementations, except\nfor satellite communications, which\
    \ present additional costs. Moreover, in the work submitted by\nZolich et al.\
    \ there was radio interference detected with a secondary radio transmitter mounted\
    \ in the\nquadcopter, even though this transmitter and the TinyMesh radios operated\
    \ at different operating\nfrequencies (433 MHz for the latter, 868 MHz for the\
    \ former). In the validation tests carried out,\nit was proven that no interference\
    \ was detected in the UAV’s ﬂight communications by the LoRa\ntransmissions, and\
    \ vice versa. In terms of low power consumption, the RN2483 LoRa transceiver has\
    \ a\npower consumption of 28.8 mA in transmission and 14.2 mA in reception, both\
    \ at 3 V. In contrast with\nthe radio used by Barbatei et al., which has a lower\
    \ energy print compared to Zolich et al., the LoRa\ntransceiver consumes less\
    \ energy in both transmission and reception, even though its performance is\n\
    similar. All of the previously mentioned facts translate to a lower energy consumption\
    \ per data packet\ntransmission, which in consequence increases the lifespan of\
    \ a node, with a greater transmission range.\nEven though the range limits of\
    \ the LoRa modulation were not tested in this article, as these have\nalready\
    \ been validated in other studies [30–33,54,55], for scenarios where a greater\
    \ transmission radius\nis desired, there are several things that must be taken\
    \ into consideration for a proper deployment.\nSince any UAV is restricted to\
    \ a ﬁnite amount of ﬂight time, it is important to consider the bitrate of\nthe\
    \ LoRa transmissions, the frequency at which the environmental data is captured\
    \ and the mode of\noperation of the UAV. By increasing the spreading factor of\
    \ the LoRa devices the maximum transmission\nradius is increased, but consequently\
    \ the bitrate is reduced. Furthermore, if the data capture frequency\nis high\
    \ and the buoys have been left for an extended period of time, high amounts of\
    \ data will be\naccumulated on each buoy. With these type of conﬁgurations it\
    \ would at least be required to modify\nthe ﬂight plan of the UAV, ﬁrst identifying\
    \ the location of the buoys, then returning home and making\na data extraction\
    \ afterwards. An alternative to this would be to set the UAV for search and rescue\n\
    mode and later extracting the data, either by collecting the buoys from their\
    \ location, or to try and\nset a temporary base station near the buoys location\
    \ with a master node (connected to a laptop) and\nmanually download the data from\
    \ the sensor nodes. It is worth noting that in a prior work [32],\nit was proven\
    \ that by increasing the spreading factor to 256 chips/symbol transmissions could\
    \ be\ndone to a receiver station at approximately 7 km. Assuming that this same\
    \ distance is achievable in a\nmarine-coastal environment, with such a spreading\
    \ factor, a bandwidth of 125 kHz and coding rate of\n4/5, the bitrate would only\
    \ be reduced to 3.1 kbps but effectively almost doubling the transmission\nradius.\
    \ Such a conﬁguration would still be viable for an elevated data capture frequency\
    \ in the slave\nnode and the mid-air data extraction with the UAV.\nAnother possible\
    \ scenario is when the buoys are ﬁxed to the seaﬂoor and their location is known.\n\
    Under these circumstances there are two possible ways of extracting the data from\
    \ the buoys, using the\nUAV from a remote location to collect the data or with\
    \ a master base station. The ﬁrst scenario would\nbe exactly the same as when\
    \ the buoys are drifting, except that the location is already known and a\nmore\
    \ precise ﬂight pattern can be planned. If only a master base station were to\
    \ be used, the LoRa\nRF conﬁgurations of the nodes could be set for long-range\
    \ transmissions and with high data capture\nfrequency, with a functional behavior\
    \ similar to that of current buoy implementations. The main\nadvantage of this\
    \ operation mode is the possibility of transmitting data across several kilometers,\
    \ and\nthat the base station is only formed by a master node connected to a laptop,\
    \ allowing the station to be\nstatic or mobile.\nAlthough this system completely\
    \ fulﬁlls the requirements of the SIMMA project, there are several\nimprovements\
    \ that can be made to create a more robust and functional WSN. In addition to\
    \ the already\nSensors 2017, 17, 460\n19 of 22\nmentioned enhancements made in\
    \ the post-ﬁeld analysis section, the inclusion of energy harvesting\ntechnologies,\
    \ as proposed by Zolich et al. [27], is one of the most desirable improvements,\
    \ as it would\nallow the buoys to monitor areas for an almost indeﬁnite time.\
    \ Also, the addition of other types of\nsensors and backup wireless communications,\
    \ such as GSM, would grant the system with important\necological data and new\
    \ ways to ﬁnd marooned devices. Regarding the use of the UAV, it would be a\n\
    signiﬁcant improvement if the aircraft carried additional sensors, such as infrared\
    \ or multispectral\ncameras, granting additional information that could be correlated\
    \ with the data extracted from the\nbuoys. This could be feasible with the same\
    \ aircraft design, given that the UAV can carry additional\npayload, other than\
    \ the master node, yet this was not contemplated within this article. Moreover,\n\
    further integrating the UAV with the LoRa master node would be of great use, as\
    \ information provided\nby the master node could automatically trigger different\
    \ behaviors on the UAV, such as a change in\nﬂight pattern or an emergency return-to-home.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nIn this article, the design and implementation of a UAV assisted\
    \ long-range buoy based WSN\nfor the monitorization of marine-coastal environments,\
    \ as well as an improvement to current\nimplementations, has been proven. The\
    \ development of a LoRa mobile wireless network, from\na hardware and ﬁrmware\
    \ perspective, was presented, as well as the implementation of the novel\nLoRaNET\
    \ network protocol for LoRa devices. These two developments, applied to the SIMMA\
    \ end\ndevices, provide an easy-to-use and low power solution, with an extended\
    \ range of several kilometers,\nas well as a more cost-effective alternative with\
    \ fewer infrastructure requirements. Furthermore,\nit serves as a less invasive\
    \ method for monitoring natural protected areas and reservoirs.\nThe integration\
    \ of the UAV, the Davis monitoring buoys, and the LoRa communications as a\nsingle\
    \ system, adds a needed ﬂexibility to current implementations and the possibility\
    \ of studying\npreviously unreachable areas, since the buoys can be placed with\
    \ a small vessel and the UAV can be\nﬂown from almost any area, given its great\
    \ communications reach.\nAlthough this proposal was aimed at marine monitoring,\
    \ this same system architecture can be\nused for other types of environments.\
    \ For instance, the upper part of the buoy, where the slave node’s\nelectronics\
    \ are housed, could be used as a portable meteorological station to temporarily\
    \ monitor\ndifferent areas for a given time interval.\nAcknowledgments: Trasviña-Moreno\

    \ (PM) monitoring system was\ndeveloped that can perform three-dimensional stereoscopic\
    \ observation of PM2.5 and PM10 in the\natmosphere. The UAV monitoring system\
    \ was mainly integrated by modules of data acquisition\nand processing, wireless\
    \ data transmission, and global positioning system (GPS). Particularly, in this\n\
    study, a ground measurement-control subsystem was added that can display and store\
    \ collected\ndata in real time and set up measurement scenarios, data-storage\
    \ modes, and system sampling\nfrequency as needed. The UAV PM monitoring system\
    \ was calibrated via comparison with a national\nair-quality monitoring station;\
    \ the data of both systems were highly correlated. Since rotation of the\nUAV\
    \ propeller aﬀects measured PM concentration, this study speciﬁcally tested this\
    \ eﬀect by setting\nup another identical monitoring system ﬁxed at a tower as\
    \ reference. The UAV systems worked\nsimultaneously to collect data for comparison.\
    \ A correction method for the propeller disturbance\nwas proposed. Averaged relative\
    \ errors for the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations measured by the\ntwo systems were\
    \ 6.2% and 6.6%, respectively, implying that the UAV system could be used for\n\
    monitoring PM in an atmosphere environment.\nKeywords: PM2.5; PM10; autonomy and\
    \ selectivity; three-dimensional stereoscopic monitoring;\npropeller disturbance;\
    \ environmental monitoring\n1. Introduction\nWith the rapid advancement of urbanization\
    \ and industrialization, large-scale activities of\nindustrial production and\
    \ transportation discharge a large amount of air pollutants into the atmosphere,\n\
    causing widespread public and government attention [1–3]. Fine particulate matter\
    \ (PM2.5) and\ninhalable particles (PM10) are the primary pollutants. PMs not\
    \ only cause serious harm to people’s\nhealth, but also have an increasingly serious\
    \ impact on crop production and agricultural-product\nquality [4–7]. A larger\
    \ concentration of ﬁne PM in the air aﬀects plant respiration. Under smoggy\n\
    weather, poor light conditions can aﬀect plant photosynthesis and crop yield.\
    \ Meanwhile, smoggy\nweather can also lead to delays in the growth period of crops,\
    \ frequent pests and diseases, and the\ndecline in the yield and quality of agricultural\
    \ products, as well as cause harmful substances to remain\nin the crops. Eating\
    \ harmful crop products can indirectly hurt people’s health [8–10]. Therefore,\n\
    large-scale three-dimensional PM measurements are needed to provide decision support\
    \ for the precise\nSensors 2020, 20, 57; doi:10.3390/s20010057\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 57\n2 of 19\ncontrol of atmosphere pollution, and to provide\
    \ technical support for follow-up studies to resolve PM\ninﬂuence farmland crops.\n\
    Presently, traditional PM monitoring methods can be divided into four categories.\
    \ The ﬁrst is\nﬁxed-point observation, usually with the vertical distribution\
    \ of PM2.5 mass concentration in the\nnear-surface layer measured from meteorological\
    \ towers [11–13]. The tower, as a relatively traditional\nobservation method,\
    \ has a wide range of applications. However, it is ﬁxed on spot and diﬃcult to\n\
    move, with limitations on observation range and height. The second is tethered\
    \ aerostat observation,\nwith diﬀerent sensors loaded on tethered balloons to\
    \ measure vertical distribution of high-level\ncontaminants [14–18]. However,\
    \ a tethered aerostat cannot ﬂexibly observe in a wide range. The third\nis the\
    \ high-altitude observation of a manned aircraft equipped with sensors to measure\
    \ pollutant\nconcentration. Although a manned aircraft can perform observation\
    \ at a wide range, its cost is relatively\nhigh and it is rarely used for experiment\
    \ research. The fourth is the remote sensing of low Earth orbit\nsatellites [19–24].\
    \ Although their detection range is large and the macroscopic distribution of\
    \ pollutants\ncan be reﬂected on diﬀerent time and space scales, observation at\
    \ a particular time and location is\nusually limited by satellite orbits, making\
    \ it diﬃcult to conduct real-time measurement as required to\nobtain microﬁne\
    \ monitoring data.\nWith the development of modern control and intelligent technologies,\
    \ the application of unmanned\naerial vehicles (UAVs) has received wide global\
    \ attention. As an observation platform, a UAV is easy to\noperate, with good\
    \ stability and high ﬂexibility and security [25,26]. In an environmental emergency,\n\
    UAVs can quickly overcome the inconvenience of traﬃc to reach many airspace and/or\
    \ dangerous areas\nthat cannot be reached by humans where a pollution accident\
    \ is located, and quickly check the situation.\nIt has good timeliness and provides\
    \ decision support for the precise management of environmental\nissues [27]. When\
    \ a UAV is used for the observation of PM concentration above crops, it provides\n\
    a better monitoring platform, and can ﬂexibly and eﬃciently perform large-scale\
    \ three-dimensional\nmeasurement to provide technical support for the study of\
    \ the subsequent impact of PM on crops.\nIn recent years, UAV monitoring systems\
    \ have rapidly developed. On 8–9 December 2015,\nthe meteorological center of\
    \ China meteorological administration used unmanned helicopters to detect\nthe\
    \ vertical variation of aerosol mass concentration in Fangshan, Beijing [28].\
    \ Peng Z R used the mobile\nsensor carried by the UAV to monitor PM2.5 concentration\
    \ in Hangzhou [29]. UAVs can be used\nfor aerial-pollutant measurements, but there\
    \ are several limitations to existing UAV PM monitoring\nsystems: ﬁrst, the purpose\
    \ of most previous studies [30,31] is mainly to integrate sensors into the UAV\n\
    to acquire, store, and display data in real time. UAV control mode is relatively\
    \ simple, and measurement\nfrequency and storage mode are ﬁxed and cannot be remotely\
    \ controlled by the user at real time.\nFor example, Miguel Alvarado et al. integrated\
    \ photoelectric dust sensor SHARPGP2Y10 and loaded\nit onto small ﬁxed-wing and\
    \ multirotor helicopters to collect data during ﬂight, and the measured data\n\
    could be displayed and stored in real time at the ground station [32], but the\
    \ system could not perform\nremote control over the real-time selection of measurement\
    \ frequency and storage mode. When the\nUAV system performs large-scale monitoring,\
    \ the matching between measurement frequency and\nobservation-area and ﬂight-parameter\
    \ size (ﬂight speed and duration) is very important. When a UAV\nsystem is observed\
    \ under the planned route, the ﬁxed measurement frequency of its predecessors\
    \ may\nnot be suitable for planning each collection task, and it cannot be accurately\
    \ monitored at a certain\npoint; especially according to diﬀerent situations or\
    \ emergencies encountered at a monitoring site,\nmeasurement frequency needs to\
    \ be replaced in real time, but the system cannot meet the functional\nrequirements.\
    \ Therefore, the UAV monitoring system still has challenges in terms of function\
    \ setting.\nSecond, in existing research [33–36], some studies use 3D scanning\
    \ and Computational Fluid Dynamics\n(CFD) technology to simulate and analyze the\
    \ motion and distribution of the airﬂow ﬁeld generated\nby the drone rotor in\
    \ an ideal environment, other studies have been tested in the ﬁeld, so as to ﬁnd\
    \ the\nposition of the sensor with less disturbance. The position of the sensor\
    \ is relatively ﬁxed. However,\nin existing research, there are few experimental\
    \ studies on accurate PM values by propeller disturbance\nSensors 2020, 20, 57\n\
    3 of 19\nin a complex environment. Therefore, in an external environment, the\
    \ inﬂuence of propeller disturbance\non measured PM concentration in a UAV monitoring\
    \ system needs further research.\nIn view of the above problems, this paper developed\
    \ a set of UAV monitoring systems that\nachieve three-dimensional spatial PM observation.\
    \ A ground measurement-control subsystem was\nadded with better functions for\
    \ remotely controlling measured-frequency and data-storage modes.\nThe information\
    \ of PM concentration, geographical location, and time can be viewed in real time\n\
    through the ground measurement-control subsystem. This study also conducted an\
    \ experiment\nto investigate the inﬂuence of propeller disturbance on measured\
    \ PM concentration, while also\nproposing a method to correct propeller disturbance\
    \ eﬀect and further improve the practicability of the\nsystem. Therefore, the\
    \ developed UAV system could better provide technical support for the study of\n\
    atmosphere environments and the impact of PM on farmland crops.\nThe rest of the\

    \ uses ATmega2560 as the main processor, which is easy to\noperate, rich in interface,\
    \ and fast in processing speed; it provides protection for a large amount of data\n\
    processing. The onborne PM sensor is PMS5003ST, a general sensor for digitalized\
    \ PM measurement\nbased on the laser-scattering principle. The sensor can be embedded\
    \ in a variety of instrumentation\nor equipment for monitoring or improving an\
    \ environment related to the suspended particulates\nin the air to provide concentration\
    \ data accurately in a timely manner. This PM sensor has a small\nsize and it\
    \ is easy to integrate into a UAV. The GPS module uses an ATGM336H-5N31 component\n\
    to collect observation-time, latitude, longitude, and altitude information. After\
    \ the onborne PM\nobservation subsystem completes data acquisition, the subsystem\
    \ needs to synchronize the GPS\nwith the PM sensor. After collecting all information,\
    \ all data are converted into a complete data\npacket, and a speciﬁc communication\
    \ is formed in the whole process. The protocol stores the GPS\ntime, PM2.5, PM10,\
    \ GPS latitude, longitude, and altitude information for data storage and remote\n\
    real-time transmission. From them, the storage module uses CH376S for data memory,\
    \ and the wireless\ndata-transmission module uses the wireless XBeePRO900HPS3B250MW\
    \ component to transmit data\nand control commands in real time between the onborne\
    \ PM observation subsystem and the ground\nmeasurement control subsystem. The\
    \ power module uses a 10,000 mAh battery, and each module\nprovides suitable and\
    \ stable voltage, which is an important guarantee for the realization of the\n\
    circuit. After the hardware-circuit design of each module, the software program\
    \ was designed for the\nsubsystem so that parameters of the onborne PM observation\
    \ subsystem could be collected and stored\nin the real-time transmission function.\n\
    The ground measurement-control subsystem mainly remotely transmits data from the\n\
    PM observation subsystem in real time while realizing the real-time setting function\
    \ of the\nmeasurement-frequency and data-storage mode. The main control chip (ATmega2560)\
    \ controls\neach module, the power module uses a 2200 mAh lithium-ion battery,\
    \ the storage module uses\nCH376S, the wireless data-transmission module uses\
    \ a wireless XBeePRO900HPS3B250MW component,\nthe control and display module has\
    \ a 2.4 inch color touch screen that is mainly used to display\nmeasurement data\
    \ and the function and remote-control status of the onborne PM observation\nsubsystem.\
    \ The monitoring-frequency and data-storage mode can be set by the user according\
    \ to the\nuser’s requirements. The ground remote-measurement-control subsystem\
    \ integrates the design of each\nmodule and completes the software development\
    \ of the subsystem, thereby realizing the functions of\nreal-time display, viewing,\
    \ storage, monitoring-frequency setting, and storage-mode selection.\n3. Design\
    \ of Observation-Mode-Setting Function of Atmosphere PM Monitoring System\nPreviously\
    \ existing UAV monitoring systems mainly display and transmit observed data in\n\
    real time to their ground component [30–32,37]. However, the measurement frequency\
    \ and storage\nmode of the monitoring system are ﬁxed. Functional requirements\
    \ of the UAV monitoring system\nbecome increasingly higher to further improve\
    \ the eﬃciency and autonomy of the UAV monitoring\nsystem. When the UAV system\
    \ is monitored, there is a matching relationship between UAV ﬂight\nparameters\
    \ (ﬂight speed and endurance time), and measurement frequency and storage mode.\n\
    Therefore, the functional modules of the system need to be further optimized.\
    \ The design of the system\nmeasurement-frequency and storage-mode setting function\
    \ is necessary. In this study, the design\nof the system setup function was added,\
    \ which mainly added a new ground measurement-control\nsubsystem that can display,\
    \ view, and store measurement-frequency settings and storage methods in\nreal\
    \ time. The ground measurement-control subsystem can perform two-way communication,\
    \ and not\nonly receive onborne PM observation-subsystem remote-transmission back-data\
    \ packets, and carry\non analysis to it, thus displaying measured data in real\
    \ time, but also send control instructions, thus\nremotely controlling the onborne\
    \ PM observation-subsystem measurement frequency and data storage\nin real time.\
    \ System observation is mainly achieved by selecting the control command through\
    \ the\nground measurement-control subsystem, and then performing real-time communication\
    \ through the\nwireless data-transmission module on the ground measurement-control\
    \ subsystem and the wireless\nSensors 2020, 20, 57\n6 of 19\ndata-transmission\
    \ module on the onborne PM observation subsystem.\nWhen the onborne PM\nobservation\
    \ system receives the signal, control instructions of the onborne PM observation\
    \ subsystem\nare invoked to remotely set system functions in real time. The function\
    \ setting of this system is mainly\nbased on the C language for software design,\
    \ and the main system-function-setting ﬂowchart is shown\nin Figure 3.\nSensors\

    \ system was examined in ﬁeld calibration experiments. For example, Man Sing\n\
    Wong calibrated the monitoring system at the roadside air-quality monitoring station\
    \ in Mong Kok,\nHong Kong [38]. Therefore, this study conducted a calibration\

    \ PM2.5 (left) and PM10 (right) concentration measurements between onborne \n\
    PM observation subsystem and standard instrument at national air-quality monitoring\
    \ station. \nIt can be seen from Figure 8 that linear correlation between the\
    \ two datasets was relatively good, \nwith R2 = 0.97 and 0.90 for PM2.5 and PM10,\
    \ respectively. However, their mean relative errors were \nlarge, with MRE = 19.2%\
    \ for PM2.5 and MRE = 27% for PM10. Due to the limitation of the sensor \ncalibration\
    \ before leaving the factory, deviation between PM2.5 and PM10 was quite different.\
    \ The \nspecific reasons are as follows: (1) Since the laser diode used in the\
    \ sensor had only one wavelength, \nthe PM sensor was affected by particle concentration\
    \ and composition. Critical particle composition \naffected the performance of\
    \ the laser light-scattering sensor. (2) Light scattering depends on the \nrefractive\
    \ index of the material, and the light absorption of the material may also affect\
    \ the light \nreceived by the intensity phototransistor. Particle size also directly\
    \ affects the light-scattering and \nabsorption coefficients. (3) Sensor performance\
    \ depends on particle composition because light \nscattering is affected by the\
    \ refractive index. In summary, PM2.5 and PM10 are different in size, so \nwhen\
    \ a particle is monitored by the laser-scattering principle, the measurement errors\
    \ of PM2.5 and \nPM10 are quite different. Laser-scattering PM sensors demonstrated\
    \ the ability to report PM \nconcentrations with relatively high linearity and\
    \ moderate reproducibility [39]. In addition, the \nmeasurement uncertainty can\
    \ further reduce the average measurement over a longer period of time. \nThere\

    \ onborne\nPM observation subsystem and standard instrument at national air-quality\
    \ monitoring station.\nIt can be seen from Figure 8 that linear correlation between\
    \ the two datasets was relatively\ngood, with R2 = 0.97 and 0.90 for PM2.5 and\
    \ PM10, respectively. However, their mean relative\nerrors were large, with MRE\
    \ = 19.2% for PM2.5 and MRE = 27% for PM10. Due to the limitation\nof the sensor\
    \ calibration before leaving the factory, deviation between PM2.5 and PM10 was\
    \ quite\ndiﬀerent. The speciﬁc reasons are as follows: (1) Since the laser diode\
    \ used in the sensor had only one\nwavelength, the PM sensor was aﬀected by particle\
    \ concentration and composition. Critical particle\ncomposition aﬀected the performance\
    \ of the laser light-scattering sensor. (2) Light scattering depends\non the refractive\
    \ index of the material, and the light absorption of the material may also aﬀect\
    \ the\nlight received by the intensity phototransistor. Particle size also directly\
    \ aﬀects the light-scattering\nand absorption coeﬃcients. (3) Sensor performance\
    \ depends on particle composition because light\nscattering is aﬀected by the\
    \ refractive index. In summary, PM2.5 and PM10 are diﬀerent in size, so when\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 57\n10 of 19\na particle is monitored by the laser-scattering\
    \ principle, the measurement errors of PM2.5 and PM10 are\nquite diﬀerent. Laser-scattering\
    \ PM sensors demonstrated the ability to report PM concentrations with\nrelatively\
    \ high linearity and moderate reproducibility [39]. In addition, the measurement\
    \ uncertainty\ncan further reduce the average measurement over a longer period\
    \ of time. There was also systematic\nerror between both datasets, implying that\
    \ the data collected by the onborne PM observation subsystem\nneeded to be calibrated.\n\
    PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations measured by the onborne PM observation subsystem\
    \ were\ncorrected and calibrated by using their ﬁtting equations f 1(xi) and f\
    \ 2(xi). For veriﬁcation purposes,\na new dataset of 20 samples was collected\
    \ by the onborne PM observation subsystem, and calibrated\nby the ﬁtting equations\
    \ shown in Figure 8. The calibrated data were compared with the corresponding\n\
    measurements at the national air-quality monitoring station and are shown in Figure\
    \ 9.\nSensors 2020, 20, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n11 of 20 \n \n \nFigure 9. Same as\

    \ Effect on Atmosphere PM Measurement \nWhen the UAV PM monitoring system is flying,\
    \ its propeller largely disturbs the air, leading to \nmeasurement conditions\
    \ and results that are quite different from those in the absence of the UAV \n\
    [34,35,41]. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to test the impact of UAV propeller\
    \ disturbance \non the observation results, and to find a correction method to\
    \ ensure the reliability of the UAV-\ncorrected data. The existing research [33,34,36]\
    \ on the influence of UAV propeller disturbance on \nmonitoring concentration\
    \ is mainly to select a fixed point near the ground to test UAV propeller \ndisturbance,\
    \ so as to find out the better position of sensor, determine the average relative\
    \ error of the \nsystem, and evaluate the system as a whole, so as to provide\
    \ support for the system to be better \napplied to high altitude. In view of the\
    \ previous studies, the experiment setup included a fixed tower \n3.5 m high above\
    \ the ground at the institute of water-saving agriculture in arid areas of China.\
    \ A \nthree-cup anemometer was installed at the upper end of the tower to check\
    \ the disturbance of the \nUAV propeller (Figure 10). In the absence of outside\
    \ wind weather, the UAV system gradually moved \naway from the three-cup anemometer\
    \ (500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 mm), and the UAV system \nhovered at this\
    \ position for 180 s. After several tests, as is shown in Figure 11, when it was\
    \ 1000 mm \naway from the anemometer in the horizontal direction, it was found\
    \ to have no disturbance effect in \nthe air, consistent with obtained results\

    \ at each height level. Data were collected at a time interval of 5 s and\naveraged\

    \ 15, we can see that PM concentrations presented minima near the ground and\n\
    some ﬂuctuations with increasing heights, but height variations were relatively\
    \ small in the range\nof 0–150 m. The lowest PM concentrations near the surface\

    \ and the increasing demand for UAV monitoring systems, a UAV\nmonitoring system\
    \ for atmosphere PM was developed that is capable of the ﬂexible and eﬃcient\n\
    stereoscopic monitoring of PM concentrations. In particular, a ground measurement-control\
    \ subsystem\nwas designed that can display and store monitored particle concentrations,\
    \ geographical locations,\ntime, and satellite number, and set the monitoring\
    \ frequency of the UAV monitoring system, in real\ntime. The data-storage mode\
    \ can automatically or manually be set by autonomous selection. These\nfeatures\
    \ greatly improve previously used UAV systems, whose sensors were mainly integrated\

    \ environmental monitoring system that\nmeasures temperature, humidity, luminosity,\

    \ Alvarado et al. integrated sensors for temperature and humidity (SEN51035P)\n\
    and dust (GP2Y10) into a drone that transmit the data back to the ground station,\
    \ enabling real-time\ndisplay and the recording of the monitored data [34]. In\
    \ contrast, our system has better autonomy and\nselectivity, and provides users\
    \ with more convenient services.\nIn this study, the selected onborne sensor was\
    \ PMS5003ST, and we performed a calibration test.\nAfter calibration, the MRE\
    \ of PM2.5 and PM10 was 9.0% and 11.2%, respectively, with respect to the\nstandard\
    \ measurements at the national air-quality monitoring station. The measurement\
    \ precision of\nour system was comparable with those of the previous studies.\
    \ For example, a PM2.5 measurement\nsystem developed by Niu Ji used an optical\
    \ method calibrated with concentration sensor BGPM-02,\nresulting in an MRE of\
    \ about 5% [48], which was better than ours. However, the GP2Y10 sensor used\n\
    by Miguel Alvarado et al. was calibrated with a standard air chamber, showing\
    \ an MRE of 14.9% [32],\nwhich was slightly worse than ours. The reasons for MRE\
    \ system deviations may be as follows: ﬁrst,\nonborne sensors SM-PWM-01A, GP2Y10,\
    \ and PMS5003ST have diﬀerent accuracy levels. Second,\nreference instruments\
    \ for the calibration are also diﬀerent, with diﬀerent accuracy levels. Finally,\n\
    the experiment environments for the calibration tests were also diﬀerent, either\
    \ indoors (Niu Ji) or\nin a standard air chamber (Miguel Alvarado), in contrast\
    \ to our ﬁeld test under diﬀerent weather\nconditions of wind speed, temperature,\
    \ and humidity. In this study, a PM sensor on the basis of the\nprinciple of laser\
    \ light scattering was selected. Previous studies [39,49,50] showed that: (1)\
    \ similar to\norganic components, the water absorption of infrared radiation,\
    \ and due to the reduced light intensity\nreceived by the phototransistor, PM\
    \ concentration is overestimated. (2) High concentrations of humidity\nmay cause\
    \ circulation circuits to malfunction. The PM sensor causes a bias in the measurement\
    \ results.\n(3) When relative humidity is as high as 68%, the PM may deliquesce.\
    \ PM hygroscopicity (usually\naﬀected by the weather) may be a cause of uncertainty\
    \ in sensor measurement data. (4) Extreme\nSensors 2020, 20, 57\n16 of 19\ntemperature\
    \ conditions may aﬀect the reported particulate concentration because the ﬂow\
    \ rate of the\nparticulate ascending airﬂow and the sensor are determined by the\
    \ temperature diﬀerence between\nthermistor and environment. (5) Wind speed also\
    \ aﬀects sensor monitoring. Diﬀerences in wind\nsize and direction aﬀect PM spatial\
    \ distribution, which also aﬀects sensor measuring. In summary,\nthe calibration\
    \ environment is diﬀerent and aﬀects the calibration results of the system. All\
    \ in all,\nall three factors, alone or together, may cause diﬀerences in the calibrated\
    \ measurements.\nWhen the UAV system is in ﬂight operation, propeller rotation\
    \ disturbs the air and aﬀects the\nobserved concentration; it was necessary to\
    \ correct the eﬀect. This study established a comparison test\nbetween two identical\
    \ UAV systems, with one ﬁxed on top of a tower and another hovering in the air\n\
    under diﬀerent particle concentrations. The MRE between the measurements was PM2.5\
    \ (9%) and PM10\n(8.3%), respectively. A linear-regression relation between the\
    \ two datasets was established and used to\ncorrect the propeller eﬀect. The corrected\
    \ data reduced the MRE to PM2.5 (6.2%) and PM10 (6.6%).\nThese appeared to be\
    \ larger than the MRE = 3.84%, 3.71% and 1.65% for CO2, temperature, and humidity\n\
    measurements, respectively, reported by Roldán JJ et al. [33]. Diﬀerences may\
    \ be due to the following\naspects: (1) diﬀerences between six-rotor and quadrotor\
    \ UAVs; (2) diﬀerent objects monitored by the\nsystems; (3) diﬀerences between\
    \ our and Roldán JJ’s experiment methods. In the study of Roldán JJ,\nmeasurements\
    \ were taken at a distance of 5 m from the sources at intervals of 1 m. The ﬂying\
    \ height of\nthe quadrotor drone was 0.5 m. The drone was moved by hand, impacting\
    \ the observation results.\nIn contrast, our experiment had a ﬁxed tower, and\
    \ better excluded the inﬂuence of manual operation\non the measurement results;\
    \ (4) in the experiments of Roldán JJ, automatic UAV movement was\ncarried out,\
    \ but not synchronized with the manual one, and the time lapse may have caused\
    \ deviation.\nIn contrast, our experiment was equipped with the same monitoring\
    \ system and measured at the\nsame time, better avoiding deviation caused by time\
    \ asynchrony. In view of these obvious diﬀerences,\nin order to enable the UAV\
    \ system to carry out ﬂight monitoring more accurately, meteorological and\nenvironmental\
    \ parameters should be taken into account for multiparameter modeling analysis\
    \ and\ncorrection, so as to further improve the monitoring accuracy of UAV monitoring\
    \ system.\n9. Conclusions\nThe UAV system for atmosphere PM monitoring has good\
    \ application. This study designed\na set of the system including a six-rotor\
    \ UAV, an onborne PM observation subsystem, and ground\nmeasurement-control subsystem.\
    \ The system has a three-dimensional stereoscopic function, and can\nremotely\
    \ transmit, store, and display measurement data, and altitude, latitude, longitude,\n\
    and observation-time information in real-time. In particular, the ground measurement-control\n\
    subsystem can not only select and set the storage mode of the observed data, but\
    \ also automatically\nset the measurement frequency of the system. The system\
    \ was stable in communication from 0 to\n500 m. The system was calibrated by measurements\
    \ of the national air-quality monitoring station.\nAt the same time, a UAV propeller-disturbance\
    \ test was carried out, and a method of correcting the\npropeller-disturbance\
    \ eﬀect was proposed. The MRE between the corrected and referenced data of\nPM2.5\
    \ and PM10 concentrations was reduced to 6.2% and 6.6%. Finally, ﬂight-application\
    \ tests in\nvertical and horizontal directions were respectively carried out.\
    \ The system worked stably, and it\ncan provide technical support for the study\
    \ of atmosphere environment monitoring and subsequent\nresearch on the impact\
    \ of PM on crops in a farmland environment.\nAuthor Contributions: W.H. was the\

    \ wire based on tilt angle measurement was proposed, the \nmathematical model\
    \ of catenary for power wire was established. Sag calculation models of power\
    \ wire in the \nsituation without swinging and swinging were derived. By measuring\
    \ the power wire axial angle and swing angle \nwith dual-axis tilt sensor, the\
    \ sag could be accurately calculated with the wire swinging. By testing the sag\
    \ detection \nsystem, the result showed that the sag detection system could meet\
    \ the engineering requirements of sag measurement. \n \nKeywords: Tilt, sag, catenary\
    \ model, online monitoring \n1. Introduction \nWith the continuous development\
    \ of society, there is more and more power density, industrial \nelectricity consumption\
    \ increases gradually. In power shortage areas, if relying on local resource \n\
    generation only, the situation that demand exceeds supply of electricity would\
    \ appear, which restricts the \nsocial development of industry and agriculture,\
    \ and retards the progress of society. However, after use of \nthe new transmission\
    \ line method, the cost and environmental issues were becoming increasingly \n\
    prominent. Improving existing wire conveying capacity would be one of the directions\
    \ of power grids. \nImproving the wire conveying capacity, can not only solve\
    \ the problem of peak or fault short conveying \ncapacity shortage, but also can\
    \ reduce the new line investment, reduce the number of new lines, and \nensure\
    \ the development of regional economy, which have important social and economic\
    \ benefits [1-3].  \nIn process of power transmission, wire ampacity is the essence\
    \ of limiting the transmission capacity of \ntransmission line. In order to prevent\
    \ overload, the design for the rating capacity of the transmission line, \nconstruction\
    \ is a static, conservative values, which is often based on the most adverse weather\
    \ conditions. \nBut in fact, such bad weather conditions rarely occurred, so transmission\
    \ potential of the wire cannot be \nused efficiently in the vast majority of cases.\
    \ \nAs there is a definite relationship between the transmission line sag and\
    \ transmission power, by \nmeasuring the line sag, the transmission power limit\
    \ could be determined reasonably and accurately, then \na more direct judgment,\
    \ whether transmission power beyond the limit of thermal stability or not, could\
    \ be \nachieved. In addition, the sag could vary with the temperature of the line,\
    \ when the distance of the line \nsag to the ground vertically or crossing reduced,\
    \ the safe running of the grid would be affected [2][4]. \nTherefore, in process\
    \ of power transmission, by monitoring the transmission wire sag data in real\
    \ time \nstability and accurately, energy could be delivered more effectively\
    \ and reasonably, thus ensuring the \nsecurity of the power system. \n \n * Manuscript\

    \ Tilt Measurement \n7 \n2. Sag Detection Principle Based on the Tilt Measurement\
    \ \n2.1. Method of sag measurement \nSag measurement basic methods include: 1)\
    \ observation method (commonly using a theodolite or \nother method); 2) monitoring\
    \ with GPS; 3) through measuring conductor temperature and stress to \ndetermine\
    \ sag; 4) using projection technique to measure sag; 5) by measuring the tilt\
    \ of the line to \ndetermine sag. A variety of features of sag detection methods\
    \ are shown in Table 1 [5]-[8].  \nTable 1. A variety features of sag detection\
    \ methods \nSag measurement methods \nFeatures \nObservation method \nSimple,\
    \ high degree of accuracy, the need of staff on-site operation is not \nconductive\
    \ to real-time monitoring \nGPS \nAccuracy, implement difficult and complex algorithms,\
    \ expensive \nConductor temperature and stress \nRelatively cheap, too many measurement\
    \ parameters, the algorithm complexity, the \nerror is larger \nProjection technique\
    \ \nSimple operation, the need for specialized photographers, image processing\
    \ \nproblems, larger error \nTilt of line \nThe method is relatively simple, cheap,\
    \ and the algorithm is simple, less error \n \nThrough above comparison, the sag\
    \ detection method based on tilt measurement has more advantages.  \nOverhead\
    \ transmission wire hangs between two transmission wire towers. As the distance\
    \ between the \ntwo towers is large, the rigidity of the overhead wire has less\
    \ effect on the overhanging state. So during \nengineering calculation of transmission\
    \ wires, the rigidity of the overhead wire is often ignored, while as \na flexible\
    \ cable. The flexible cable is sufficiently soft, which can only withstand tension\
    \ but not resist \nbending. The direction of the tension at any point is consistent\
    \ with the overhead wires in the axial \ndirection. Theoretically, there are two\
    \ ways to calculate the sag tension of the overhead wires: catenary \nand parabola.\
    \ \nIn general, in the plain and hilly region, the actual length of the overhead\
    \ line between two towers is \nabout 5% larger than the span’s. In engineering\
    \ calculations, often considering that the gravity per unit \nlength of the overhead\
    \ wire itself is uniform distribution at two suspension points direction, according\
    \ to \nthis principle, the overhead wire overhanging function is parabolic. While,\
    \ the gravity of the actual \ntransmission wires are distributed uniformly along\
    \ their own lines, so during calculation, considering the \ngravity per unit length\
    \ of the overhead wire itself being the uniform distribution along their own wires\
    \ is \nthe most practical way. According to this principle, the overhead wire\
    \ overhanging function is catenary. \n2.2. Sag measuring catenary modeling \n\
    As shown in Fig.1, A and B are the transmission wire towers, \n1h and \n2h are\
    \ the heights of towers A and \nB, respectively, h  is the height difference,\
    \ l  is the span between the tower A and B , \n1y  is the line \nsegment between\
    \ the two suspension points, \n2y  is the overhead wire, φ  is the angle between\
    \ \n1y  and the \nhorizontal plane, θ  is the tilt of the line at the suspension\
    \ point of the tower A, and f  is the sag at any \npoint. \nФ\nP\nθ\nA\nB\nh1\n\

    From the formulas (1), (2) and (3), known the tilt α  of the suspension point,\
    \ the sag at any point could \nbe achieved. \nBecause of wind or icing, the overhead\
    \ wires will swing along the connection of the two suspension \npoints as the\
    \ central axis. At this time, the tilt of the wire will change, the sag derived\
    \ will differ from the \nactual sag. The wire catenary model with swinging is\
    \ shown in Fig. 2. \n \nFig. 2. Wire catenary model with swinging. \nIn Fig. 2,\
    \ the overhead wire hangs between the towers A and B, and it’s assumed that the\
    \ location \nparameters are same as Fig. 1. When the wire swings, the tracks of\
    \ the wire tangent is located on the side \nof the cone which the central axis\
    \ is the connection between the two suspension points. Let the point \nwhere the\
    \ tangents of wire cuts, and the conical bottom surface be called P, the lowest\
    \ point of the cone \nunderside be called N, the center of the cone underside\
    \ be called M, the projection of point P to the line \nsegment MN be called Q.\
    \ And the tilt of the wire with swinging is the angle α  between the tangent of\
    \ \nthe wire and the ground plane, the swing angle of the wire is the angle β\
    \  between the tangent PR on the \ncone underside and the ground plane. Let the\
    \ tilt of the wire without swinging be θ , the angle between \nthe connection\
    \ of the two suspension points and the ground plane be φ . \nIn the coordinate\
    \ system ( , , )\nx y z , the coordinate of the point M is (0,1,tan )\nφ , the\

    \ if the \nactual tilt and the swing angle of the wire are measured by sensor,\
    \ and the angle between the connection \nof the two suspension points and the\
    \ ground plane could be acquired from engineering parameters, the tilt \nof the\
    \ wire without swinging could be deduced conveniently. Then the sag of the wire\
    \ could be achieved \naccording to the model of the wire without swinging. \n\
    3. Sag Measurement System \nCombining wire construction parameters, the sag online\
    \ monitoring system based on the angle \nmeasuring principle could obtain the\
    \ sag value at the lowest point of the wire and the maximum sag, and \nthe dual-axis\
    \ tilt sensor is used to measure the tilt of the wire to the ground and swing\
    \ angle \nsimultaneously. The sag online monitoring system diagram as shown in\
    \ Fig. 3, tilt sensor would be \nmounted coaxially with the overhead wires, obliquity\
    \ sensor output data is transmitted to the monitoring \ncenter by the wireless\
    \ data transmission system. \n \nFig. 3. Sag online monitoring system diagram.\
    \ \n10 \nInternational Journal of Smart Grid and Clean Energy, vol. 2, no. 1,\
    \ January 2013 \nThe selected dual-axis tilt sensor is a acceleration measurement\
    \ principle sensor, whose measurement \nrange is  ± 60°, which owns both analogue\
    \ and digital output, whose analogy output resolution is 0.0025°, \nwhose digital\
    \ output resolution of 0.035°. And the sensor has a built-in temperature sensor,\
    \ which could \ncompensate the sensor’s temperature dependency by the environment\
    \ temperature. The anti-seismic \nstrength is 20000g, the width of -3 dB is 8~28\
    \ Hz. \nThe output data of the sensor through a signal processing circuit is transmitted\
    \ to the monitoring center \nthrough the GPRS wireless network. At the monitoring\
    \ center, data are collected, arranged, analyzed and \nstored. And at the same\
    \ time, when the sag data is found abnormal, the command for collecting sag data\
    \ \nintensively will be sent to the field unit, and then a warming will be send\
    \ out. \n \nFig. 4. Sag test system in lab. \n4. Test Result \nThe limitations\
    \ of the experimental conditions, the test program uses a thick rope instead of\
    \ overhead \nwires, thick rope is hanging in the space of 3m width, and there\
    \ are height differences between the two \nsuspension points, the tilt sensor\
    \ with signal processing circuit is bound with the rope coaxially, as shown \n\
    in Fig. 4. Sag measurement results are transmitted to the monitoring center by\
    \ wireless remote data \ntransmission module. Changing the sag of the thick rope,\
    \ the sag is measured at the thick rope actually \nsag value of 0.069 m, 0.124\
    \ m, 0.096 m respectively, the test results form the monitoring center are \n\

    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is playing an increasingly important role in\
    \ the control of\ncrop diseases, pests, and weeds. However, the aerial spraying\
    \ quality and droplet drift are affected by\nmany factors, some of which are controllable\
    \ (e.g., ﬂight and spraying parameters) and some of which\nare not (e.g., environmental\
    \ parameters). In order to study the inﬂuence of spraying parameters on the\n\
    UAV-based spraying performance, we propose a UAV-compatible spraying system and\
    \ a customized\nexperimental platform in this work. Through single-factor test\
    \ and Box–Behnken response surface\nmethods, four inﬂuencing factors, namely spraying\
    \ height, ﬂow rate, distance between nozzles, and\npulse width modulation (PWM)\

    Over the past few decades, traditional agriculture has been evolving towards precision\n\
    agriculture (PA), which is characterized by applying the right treatment in the\
    \ right place\nat the right time [1,2]. Throughout the whole growth circle of\
    \ crops, labor-intensive and\nhigh-risk agrochemical spraying is one of the most\
    \ indispensable operations to control the\nemergence and spread of pests, diseases,\
    \ or weeds. However, the abuse of agrochemicals,\nespecially pesticides, has caused\
    \ great damage to the agricultural ecosystem. Determining\nhow to suppress the\
    \ increase in pesticide usage by improving the application efﬁciency\nand then\
    \ promoting the sustainable development of agriculture is a worldwide challenge\n\
    in this century [3]. Although terrestrial agricultural machinery plays the main\
    \ role in ﬁeld\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 131. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12020131\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 131\n2 of 14\n\
    spraying, its accessibility in unstructured farmland, especially with late-stage\
    \ high-stem\ncrops, limits its efﬁciency in curbing disease, pest, or weed outbreaks.\n\
    With the advance of robotics and sensing technologies, agricultural robots (Agri-\n\
    robots) have shown great potential in closing the crop yield gap and promoting\
    \ sustainable\nagricultural development [4,5]. With the unique characteristics\
    \ of high ﬂexibility and\nmaneuverability, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) stand\
    \ out among various Agri-robots\nand have proven to be a powerful platform to\
    \ conduct ﬁeld surveys and aerial manage-\nment [6–8]. For example, UAVs have\
    \ been widely used in different agricultural applications,\nsuch as soil mapping,\
    \ crop identiﬁcation, and biotic/abiotic monitoring [9–13]. Speciﬁ-\ncally, UAV-based\
    \ agrochemical spraying has drawn extensive attention in the agricultural\ncommunity\
    \ [14,15]. Generally, there are two strategies for UAV-based spraying, namely\n\
    uniform spraying and spot spraying. Uniform spraying aims to cover the entire\
    \ area with\nthe same dosage of agrochemicals. Most of the previous research work\
    \ can be classiﬁed into\nthis category. For instance, to achieve the highest droplet\
    \ deposition volume and droplet\nuniformity, Guo et al. [16] conducted an orthogonal\
    \ experiment to ﬁnd the optimal combi-\nnation of ﬂight parameter, drop size,\
    \ and crop phenotype. Furthermore, some researchers\nhave focused on applying\
    \ adaptive methods to aerial pesticide spraying. Faiçal et al. [17]\nintroduced\
    \ a series of optimization algorithms, such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm\n\
    algorithm, and hill-climbing algorithm, to optimize the UAV’s ﬂight route according\
    \ to the\ndynamically changing weather conditions. Variable-rate application is\
    \ another adaptive\napproach to achieve area-even spraying [18–20]. Wang et al.\
    \ [21] realized the dynamic\nadjustment of ﬂow rate following the real-time change\
    \ of ﬂight speed and improved the\nuniformity of the deposition distribution.\
    \ With the development of agricultural informa-\ntion technology, spatial and\
    \ temporal variabilities of farmland are becoming more and\nmore accessible. Spot\
    \ spraying takes the spatiotemporal variabilities into account and\nonly performs\
    \ appropriate treatment on speciﬁc sites. Richardson et al. [22] developed a\n\
    UAV spot spraying system for applying pesticides to individual plants and proposed\
    \ a\nmethod for quantifying and analyzing the 2D pattern of droplet deposition.\
    \ Compared to\nuniform spraying, spot spraying is more conducive to improving\
    \ agrochemical utilization\nand reducing dosage. For both uniform spraying and\
    \ spot spraying, it is necessary to study\nthe inﬂuence of operating parameters\
    \ on spraying quality.\nSpraying width, size of droplets, volume of deposition,\
    \ droplet coverage density,\ndroplet distribution uniformity, and droplet coverage\
    \ rate are among the main metrics\nused to evaluate the UAV-based spraying quality.\
    \ However, they can be affected by many\nfactors, which can be roughly divided\
    \ into three aspects: environmental parameters, ﬂight\nparameters, and spraying\
    \ parameters. Among them, in-situ environmental parameters,\nincluding crosswind\
    \ speed and direction, are usually uncontrollable and have a direct\nimpact on\
    \ droplet deposition and drift [23,24]. Flight parameters, such as ﬂight speed,\n\
    ﬂight height, and downwash, determine the deposition and distribution of droplets\
    \ [25–27].\nAdditionally, some spraying parameters, such as spraying ﬂow and nozzle\
    \ speciﬁcations,\ndirectly inﬂuence the characteristics of droplets and spraying\
    \ efﬁciency [28–30].\nAgricultural scientists have carried out many studies to\
    \ investigate the impact of\ndifferent operating parameters on the quality of\
    \ UAV spraying. Chen, et al. [24] studied\nthe impact mechanism of the wind ﬁeld\
    \ in X-, Y-, and Z-directions on the distribution\ncharacteristics of aerial spraying\
    \ droplet deposition on a rice canopy. Field experimental\nresults demonstrated\
    \ that the wind ﬁeld in the Z-direction has the most signiﬁcant effect on\ndroplet\
    \ deposition, followed by the Y-direction and then the X-direction. Ahmad et al.\
    \ [25]\nand Tang et al. [26] investigated the inﬂuences of ﬂight parameters, such\
    \ as ﬂight speed and\nﬂight height, on the droplet deposition and off-target drift.\
    \ At present, most of the studies\nwith ﬁeld experiments only focused on a few\
    \ inﬂuencing factors, such as ﬂight speed, ﬂight\nheight, and spraying ﬂow [31,32].\
    \ The main reason is that many factors cannot be precisely\ncontrolled in a real\
    \ ﬁeld environment. Additionally, it has been proven that the interactions\nof\
    \ various factors also have a signiﬁcant impact on UAV-based spraying quality.\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 131\n3 of 14\nAnother limitation of previous studies is\
    \ that most of the relevant works are based\non speciﬁc spraying systems with\
    \ ﬁxed spraying parameters to study the impact of ﬂight\nparameters and environmental\
    \ parameters on spraying quality, while ignoring the opti-\nmization of spraying\
    \ system parameters. However, the optimization of the spraying system\nis fundamental\
    \ and critical for UAV spraying.\nThis work speciﬁcally focused on the analysis\
    \ of the inﬂuence of parameters of a\nspraying system designed for UAV spraying\
    \ application on the spraying quality based\non Box–Behnken response surface method.\
    \ A customized platform was constructed for\nsimulating the ﬂight of UAVs. Four-factor–three-level\
    \ factorial tests were conducted to\ninvestigate the interaction of four spraying\
    \ parameters, namely spraying height, ﬂow rate,\ndistance between nozzles, and\
    \ pulse width modulation (PWM) duty cycle, on spraying\nquality. This study aims\
    \ to provide a reference for the design and optimization of UAV\nspraying systems.\n\
    2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Design and Control Methods of Spraying System\n\
    In order to study the inﬂuence of different operating parameters on spraying quality,\n\
    a spraying system for UAV spraying application was designed as shown in Figure\
    \ 1. The\nspraying system is mainly composed of a tank, a micro diaphragm pump\
    \ (MDP) (PLD-1206,\nmax pressure: 1 MPa, max ﬂow: 4 L/min), a pressure sensor\
    \ (KY-3, measure range: 0–1 MPa,\nprecision: ±0.25%), a ﬂow sensor (MJ-HW41C,\
    \ measure range: 0.25–2.5 L/min, precision:\n±5%), two electric centrifugal nozzles\
    \ (ECNs) (LXPT-03, nominal voltage: 12 V, max speed:\n16,000 r/min), and the spraying\
    \ controller (STM32F407, STMicroelectronics). The MDP\nis responsible for transporting\
    \ the spray material from the tank to the ECNs. The ECN\natomizes the spraying\
    \ material into droplets with a minimum diameter of less than 100 µm\nthrough\
    \ the centrifugal force generated by the high-speed rotation of the embedded motor.\n\
    The main reason for choosing this type of nozzle is that the size of the droplet\
    \ diameter can\nbe controlled by adjusting the duty cycle of the PWM control signal.\
    \ Additionally, droplets\nwith 100–150 µm diameter are generally required for\
    \ ultra-low-volume UAV spraying\naccording to [33] other related works.\nFigure\
    \ 1. Schematic view of the spraying system designed for UAV spraying application.\n\
    For the spraying system we designed, the spraying height, ﬂow rate, distance between\n\
    nozzles, and rotation speed of ECNs are the four controllable parameters. The\
    \ spraying\nheight and ﬂow rate are set with reference to the values commonly\
    \ used in other works.\nThe selection of installing space between the two ECNs\
    \ is mainly based on common UAV\nsizes. Motor speed inside ECN directly determines\
    \ the centrifugal force and indirectly\naffects the droplet diameter and spraying\
    \ width. It can be controlled by conﬁguring the\nduty cycle of the PWM signal.\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 131\n4 of 14\nThe control method of spraying system is shown\
    \ in Figure 2. A microcontroller unit\n(MCU) with ARM Cortex-M4 kernel is used\
    \ as the spraying controller. Two Ultra battery\nelimination circuit (UBEC) modules\
    \ are deployed to stabilize the output voltage of the 6S\nlithium battery into\
    \ constant 5 and 12 V, respectively. The 5 V powers the MCU, wireless\ndata transmission\
    \ module, pressure sensor, and ﬂow sensor; the 12 V powers ECNs and\nMDP. The\
    \ inputs of the MCU are connected to the ﬂow sensor, pressure sensor and wireless\n\
    data transmission module, and the outputs are connected to the MDP and ECN through\n\
    three electronic speed controllers (ESCs). The MCU can output three independent\
    \ PWM\nwaves with adjustable duty cycle to control the rotational speed of the\
    \ internal motors\nof the MDP and ECNs. The wireless data transmission module\
    \ is used to build a direct\ncommunication bridge between the spray controller\
    \ and the host computer. Based on\nLabVIEW, a control software running (as shown\
    \ in Figure 3) on the host computer was\ndeveloped to monitor the entire system\
    \ and send control commands.\nFigure 2. Schematic of spraying control system.\n\
    Figure 3. The control software running on the host computer.\n2.2. Design of Test\
    \ Platform\nAs shown in Figure 4, an indoor test platform was designed and constructed\
    \ to study\nthe effects of spraying height, ﬂow rate, distance between nozzles,\
    \ and PWM duty cycle\non spraying performance of the proposed spraying system.\
    \ The test platform is 4 m long,\n5 m wide, and 3 m high. It is mainly composed\
    \ of a gantry with nozzles, sliding carrier,\nliner slide, servo motor, motor\
    \ controller, and pulleys. The servo motor drives the sliding\ncarrier with water-sensitive\
    \ paper (WSP) through the wire rope and pulleys to pass through\nthe spraying\
    \ ﬁeld at 2.0 m/s. To avoid contamination of the WSP by droplets before the\n\
    spraying ﬁeld reaches a steady state, plastic ﬁlm is used on both ends of the\
    \ test platform\nto shield the sliding carrier.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 131\n5\
    \ of 14\nFigure 4. Schematic diagram of the structure of the spraying platform.\n\
    2.3. Test Methods\nThe multifactor and multilevel orthogonal experiment was the\
    \ core test method in\nthis work. The spraying height, ﬂow rate, distance between\
    \ nozzles, and PWM duty cycle\nof ECNs were the four factors, and the effective\
    \ spraying width, droplet coverage density,\ncoefﬁcient of variation, and droplet\
    \ coverage rate were considered as response values.\nThe indoor test is shown\
    \ in Figure 5. For each test, the spraying height and the distance\nbetween nozzles\
    \ were manually adjusted according to the experimental schedules. The\ntarget\
    \ ﬂow and PWM duty cycle of the nozzles were set by remote control software. The\n\
    servo motor controller communicated with the spraying controller through the RS232\n\
    communication protocol and received the control instruction from the host computer\
    \ to\nexecute start, accelerate, brake, and stop.\nTo ensure the safety of indoor\
    \ tests, all experiments were carried out with water instead\nof agrochemicals.\
    \ Pieces of water-sensitive paper (26 × 76 mm, Syngenta, Switzerland)\nwere used\
    \ to collect the droplets and calculate their coverage density and coverage rate.\n\
    Twenty-four sampling points were evenly arranged at 20 cm intervals on the sliding\
    \ carrier,\nand a single piece of WSP was ﬁxed at each sampling point. After each\
    \ test, all 24 pieces of\nWSP were collected, labeled, and sealed separately for\
    \ subsequent analysis.\nFigure 5. On-site picture of indoor test.\nIn view of\
    \ the immaturity of UAV-based spraying technology, there is currently no\ninternationally\
    \ recognized method for evaluating the quality of UAV spraying. According\nto\
    \ the deﬁnitions in the China civil aviation standard “Agricultural Aviation Operation\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 131\n6 of 14\nQuality and Technical Indicators Part I: Spraying\
    \ Operations-MH/T1002.1-2016”, low-\nvolume and ultra-low-volume spraying means\
    \ that the usage of agrochemical is 5–30 L/ha\nand 0–5 L/ha, respectively. Droplet\
    \ coverage density in ultra-low-volume pesticide spray-\ning is 15–40/cm2, and\
    \ the droplet distribution uniformity is less than 70%. Combining\nour research\
    \ experience and methods in related works, in this study, when the droplet\ncoverage\
    \ density at the sampling point is greater than 15/cm2, it is considered an effective\n\
    sampling point. A WSP sample with sedimentary droplets is shown in Figure 6a,\
    \ and\nthe corresponding processed image is shown in Figure 6b. The individual\
    \ droplet size,\nthe droplet distribution, the total number of droplets, the droplet\
    \ coverage density, and\nthe droplet coverage rate can be extracted by DepositScan,\
    \ a publicly available scanning\nprogram that can quickly evaluate deposit distribution\
    \ on images of WSP [34].\nDroplet coverage density (CD) is the total number of\
    \ deposited droplets per cm2.\nThe droplet distribution uniformity is expressed\
    \ by the coefﬁcient of variation (CV) of the\ndroplet coverage density. The smaller\
    \ the CV, the more uniform the droplet distribution is.\nThe calculation formula\
    \ is as follows:\nCV =\nS\nCDavg\n× 100%\n(1)\nS =\nv\nu\nu\nt∑\nn\ni=1\n\0CDi\
    \ − CDavg\n\x012\n,\n(n − 1)\n(2)\nwhere CV is the coefﬁcient of variation, S\
    \ is the standard deviation of the droplet coverage\ndensity, CD is the droplet\
    \ coverage density of a single sample, and CDavg is the average\ndroplet coverage\
    \ density of all samples within a single test.\nDroplet coverage rate (CR) is\
    \ the ratio of total area that droplets covered per cm2; it\ncan be computed by\
    \ (3):\nCR = ∑n\n1(a1)\nA\n× 100%\n(3)\nwhere CR is the droplet coverage rate,\
    \ ai represents the area of a single droplet, and A\nstands for the entire area\
    \ of the selected region.\nThe effective spraying width represents the total spraying\
    \ width of both left and right\nECNs and can be obtained by counting the number\
    \ of effective sampling points:\nSW = 0.2 ×\n\0∑ num.sample − 1\n\x01\n(4)\nwhere\
    \ SW is the effective spraying width, ∑num.sample represents the total number\
    \ of\nsamples between the leftmost and rightmost effective samples, and 0.2 refers\
    \ to the interval\nbetween WSP samples with the unit of m. The width of WSP is\
    \ ignored.\nFigure 6. Image processing for WSP samples. (a) Raw and (b) processed\
    \ images of a WSP with\ndroplets. Note: Blue areas in raw image and black points\
    \ in processed image are the traces after the\ndroplets were deposited on WSP.\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 131\n7 of 14\n2.4. Analysis Method\nThe main purpose of\
    \ this work is to ﬁnd the optimal combination of four inﬂuencing\nfactors which\
    \ can yield the best spraying quality. This is a typical multifactor, multilevel\n\
    factorial study. The use of overall experimental methods to solve multifactor\
    \ and multilevel\noptimization problems usually results in too many total trials\
    \ that are unpractical to\nconduct. Orthogonal experimental design (OED), central\
    \ composite design (CCD), and\nBox–Behnken design (BBD) are the three most used\
    \ factorial experimental design methods.\nAccording to the orthogonality, OED\
    \ selects some representative points from the overall\nexperiments to ﬁnd the\
    \ best combination of factors and levels. It pays attention to how\nto arrange\
    \ the experiment scientiﬁcally and reasonably. However, it cannot ﬁnd a clear\n\
    functional expression between the factor and the response value, so it cannot\
    \ ﬁnd the\noptimal combination of factors and the optimal value of the response\
    \ value in the entire\ninterval. CCD and BBD are the two most important response\
    \ surface design methods, both\nof which can construct regression equations between\
    \ factors and response values. CCD is\nparticularly useful in sequential experiments\
    \ because it is possible to add pivot points and\ncenter points to previous factor\
    \ experiments to build a new work. BBD usually has fewer\ndesign points, so its\
    \ operating cost is lower than that of CCD with the same number factor.\nIn this\
    \ work, there was no order requirement for 4-factor and 3-level experiments, and\
    \ we\nhoped to establish an accurate regression equation of the four spraying\
    \ parameters and\nspraying quality through as few experiments as possible. Therefore,\
    \ Box–Behnken response\nsurface analysis method was the best option for this study.\
    \ In addition, Design-Expert\n8.0.5B (Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) was\
    \ introduced to schedule BBD tests and\nanalyze experimental results.\nTaking\
    \ effective spraying width SW, average droplet coverage density CDavg, coef-\n\
    ﬁcient of variation CV, and droplet coverage rate CR as reference values, the\
    \ effects of\nspraying height X1, ﬂow rate X2, distance between nozzles (the distance\
    \ between left and\nright ECNs) X3, and PWM duty cycle of ECN X4 on spraying performance\
    \ of the spraying\nsystem were investigated. In this work, the PWM duty cycle\
    \ of the left ECN and right\nECN is always conﬁgured to the same value. Firstly,\
    \ single-factor tests were designed and\nconducted to ﬁnd the maximum and minimum\
    \ levels of each factor (detailed in Section 3.1).\nSecondly, BBD was deployed\
    \ to design the 4-factors and 3-levels test (detailed in Section 3.2).\nThirdly,\
    \ based on the test results, quadratic polynomial mathematical models were obtained\n\
    with the help of analysis of variance (ANOVA). Then, through Z-score standardization,\
    \ a\nmathematical model of comprehensive score that integrates the four response\
    \ values was\nestablished and the optimal operating parameters were solved. The\
    \ Z-score standardization\nfor the positive correlation response value data can\
    \ be described as Formula (5), where x∗ is\nthe standardized data, x is the average\
    \ of raw data x, and σ means the standard deviation.\nThe standardized treatment\
    \ formula for the negative correlation response value data can\nbe described as\
    \ Formula (6).\nx∗ = x − x\nσ\n(5)\nx∗ = x − x\nσ\n(6)\nFinally, a set of optimal\
    \ values of the four factors and the corresponding comprehensive\nscore could\
    \ be solved. The spraying quality with the predicted values was evaluated by\n\
    the veriﬁcation tests. The deviation between the predicted comprehensive score\
    \ and the\nactual value was used to estimate the prediction accuracy of the model.\n\
    3. Results\n3.1. Results of Single-Factor Test\nWe carried out a series of single-factor\
    \ tests to determine the level scope of each\nfactor. The test results in Table\
    \ 1 show the following: (a) Taking X1 as the investigating\nfactor, when X1 increases\
    \ from 1.0 to 1.8 m, SW is basically stable at 2.6 m, and CDavg,\nCR, and the\
    \ droplet distribution uniformity are improved. When X1 reaches 2 m, CDavg\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 131\n8 of 14\nand CR begin to decrease, and the uniformity of droplet\
    \ distribution begins to deteriorate.\n(b) Taking the ﬂow rate X2 as the investigating\
    \ factor, as X2 increases, the CR gradually\nincreases. However, the maximum value\
    \ of SW appears when X2 reaches 1.7 L/min, and\nthe minimum value of the CV occurs\
    \ when X2 reaches 1.4 L/min. (c) Taking the distance\nbetween nozzles X3 as the\
    \ investigating factor, as X3 increases, SW gradually increases,\nwhile CV ﬁrst\
    \ decreases and then increases, and the minimum value is taken at 1.6 m.\n(d)\
    \ Taking PWM duty cycle X4 as the investigating factor, with the increase in X4,\
    \ SW\nchanges in a small range, and the CDavg and the uniformity of droplet coverage\
    \ distribution\nare improved.\nTable 1. Design and results of single-factor tests.\n\

    \ the spraying technology based on UAVs is still in the preliminary research\n\
    stage. Although some achievements have been made so far, there are still many\
    \ problems\nthat need to be solved. Firstly, some of the UAVs used in related\
    \ research are commercial-\nized, and some are privately customized. These UAVs\
    \ have a variety of shapes, sizes, and\ndriving methods, which increases the difﬁculty\
    \ of studying the inﬂuence of the UAVs’ ﬂight\nparameters on the spraying quality.\
    \ Secondly, except for some commercial agricultural\nUAVs, such as DJI MG-P and\
    \ T series, other agricultural UAVs used for scientiﬁc research\nare usually equipped\
    \ with customized nonstandardized spraying systems. This means that\nthe optimal\
    \ spraying parameters vary in different studies. Thirdly, UAV-based spraying\n\
    quality is affected by many factors, and there are no uniform standards that are\
    \ recognized\nby the global agricultural community that can be used to evaluate\
    \ it.\nSpraying height, ﬂight speed, ﬂow rate, and drop size are controllable\
    \ in indoor or\noutdoor experiments. Their inﬂuence on spraying quality is the\
    \ research focus of most\npublished papers [15,25,26,28,31,32]. For example, in\
    \ 2016, Xue et al. [15] developed an\nautomatic aerial spraying system for an\
    \ N-3-type unmanned helicopter. They investigated\nthe performance of UAV spraying\
    \ through a series of outdoor experiments, in which the\nmain test parameters\
    \ were set as follows: ﬂight speed 3–6 m/s, ﬂight height 3–7 m, and\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 131\n12 of 14\nspraying ﬂow of each centrifugal rotary atomizer (total\
    \ 2) 0.6–1 L/min. Test results re-\nvealed that the CV of UAV-based spraying performance\
    \ is lower than 60%. However, the\nspraying quality is sensitive to experimental\
    \ conﬁgurations, and the optimal combination\nof operating parameters in this\
    \ study may not be applicable to other UAV-based spray-\ning systems. In addition,\
    \ downwash and crosswinds also have a signiﬁcant impact on\ndeposition patterns\
    \ and off-target drift [23,24,35]. What makes this area of study more\ncomplicated\
    \ is that UAV spraying quality is usually affected by the interaction of multiple\n\
    factors, and it is unrealistic to accurately reveal the interaction mechanism\
    \ by conducting\nreal ﬁeld experiments, especially given the uncertainty of environmental\
    \ parameters and\nthe instability of ﬂight attitude. For example, the dynamically\
    \ changing downwash airﬂow\nis determined by various factors such as ambient wind,\
    \ crop canopy, ﬂight speed, ﬂight\naltitude, ﬂight attitude, and drone modalities.\
    \ Sometimes, it is necessary or even inevitable\nto study the inﬂuence of some\
    \ factors in certain speciﬁc ideal environments. Although such\nresearch results\
    \ are different from the real situation, they can provide a certain reference\
    \ for\nthe optimization of system parameters.\nZhang et al. [36] developed an\
    \ indoor spraying platform to simulate UAV aerial\nspraying. The system was tested\
    \ at three different moving speeds, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 m/s,\nduring which the wind\
    \ speed and ﬂow rate remained constant at 5.7 m/s and 1.16 L/min,\nrespectively.\
    \ Although they introduced the downwash airﬂow by installing a propeller\nabove\
    \ each nozzle, the wind speed could not adapt to the change of the moving speed,\n\
    which would reduce the interpretability of the experimental results.\nThis work\
    \ mainly studies the effect of spraying parameters on spraying quality and\nproposes\
    \ a spraying parameter optimization method. The inﬂuences of other factors, such\n\
    as downwash and crosswind, are not in the scope of this research. Spraying height,\
    \ ﬂow\nrate, distance between nozzles, and PWM duty cycle of ECNs are the four\
    \ investigating\nfactors, and the effective spraying width, coefﬁcient of variation,\
    \ droplet coverage density,\nand droplet coverage rate are the main metrics used\
    \ to evaluate the spraying quality.\nAnalysis results in Table 5 demonstrate that\
    \ the optimal parameters are as follows: spraying\nheight, 1.60 m; ﬂow rate, 1.74\
    \ L/min; distance between nozzles, 1.0 m; PWM duty cycle of\nECN, 98.65%. With\
    \ these conﬁgurations, the effective spraying width SW, average droplet\ncoverage\
    \ density CDavg, coefﬁcient of variation CV, and droplet coverage rate CR are\
    \ 2.9 m,\n68.4 No./cm2, 32.65%, and 21.77%, respectively. Once the spraying system\
    \ is mounted on\nthe UAV, the 1.6 m spraying height can not only ensure ﬂight\
    \ safety, but also help reduce\nthe drift of the droplets. Taking the 2.0 m/s\
    \ moving speed of the gantry in our designed\nplatform and the 2.9 m effective\
    \ spraying width (Table 5) into account, the ﬂow rate of\n1.74 L/min results in\
    \ the dosage of agrochemical at 50 L/ha, which is inconsistent with the\n15–20\
    \ L/ha commonly used for low-volume UAV spraying. However, our research results\n\
    still can provide a reference for real-ﬁeld UAV-based spraying, and the ﬂow rate\
    \ can be\nfurther reduced with the increase in ﬂight speed and the involvement\
    \ of downwash. The\n1.0 m nozzle spacing, on the one hand, is compatible with\
    \ most agricultural UAVs; on the\nother hand, it can maintain the adjacent overlap\
    \ of the left and right nozzles. The 98.65%\nPWM duty cycle means the ECN almost\
    \ works at the full speed, and the minimum droplet\ndiameter can reach 100 µm\
    \ or less. This is beneﬁcial to improve the droplet coverage\ndensity and coverage\
    \ uniformity.\nThere are a few limitations in this work. The ﬁrst one is that\
    \ we studied the cross-\neffects of four spray parameters on spraying quality\
    \ through simulation experiments in\nan indoor environment. However, ﬁeld trials\
    \ are needed to verify the results because the\nreal farmland environment is more\
    \ complicated, and many parameters cannot be precisely\ncontrolled. Another one\
    \ is that we did not consider the impact of the downwash airﬂow.\nThe main reason\
    \ is that the intensity and distribution characteristics of the downwash\nairﬂow\
    \ are affected by many factors and cannot be accurately simulated.\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 131\n13 of 14\n5. Conclusions\nIn this work, a specially customized\
    \ platform and a spraying system designed for\nUAV spraying applications were\
    \ proposed. Under indoor environmental conditions, the\ninﬂuence of operating\
    \ parameters of the spraying system on the spraying quality was stud-\nied by\
    \ combining the single-factor test and Box–Behnken response surface methodology.\n\
    Test data were standardized by Z-score, and a comprehensive score was used to\
    \ evaluate\nthe spraying performance. Variance analysis and multiple quadratic\
    \ regression ﬁtting were\nperformed on the test data by using Design-Expert 8.0.5B\
    \ software. The mathematical\nmodel of the comprehensive score with four factors\
    \ was established to predict the optimal\noperating parameters, which can be listed\
    \ as follows: spraying height, 1.60 m; ﬂow rate,\n1.74 L/min; distance between\
    \ nozzles, 1.0 m; duty cycle of PWM in nozzle, 98.65%. Veriﬁca-\ntion test results\
    \ showed that the deviation between the predicted comprehensive score and\nthe\
    \ actual value was less than 6%, which indicated that the response surface method\
    \ for the\nworking parameters of the application system was reasonable and feasible.\
    \ Overall, this\nwork will contribute to the design and optimization of spraying\
    \ systems for UAV spraying\napplications. In the following research, we will equip\
    \ this spraying system on a UAV to\ncarry out real ﬁeld spraying experiments and\
    \ verify the real spraying performance under\nthis set of optimized parameters.\n\

    Fabian Meder,\n*a Alessio Mondini,\na Francesco Visentin,a Giorgio Zini,b\nMarco\
    \ Crepaldib and Barbara Mazzolai*a\nLiving plants\nhave recently been\nexploited\
    \ for\nunusual tasks such\nas\nenergy\nconversion\nand\nenvironmental sensing.\
    \ Yet, using plants as small-scale autonomous energy sources is often impeded\
    \ by\nmulticable and -electrode installations on the plants. Moreover, insuﬃcient\
    \ power outputs for steadily\ndriving even low-power electronics made a realization\
    \ challenging. Here, we show that plants, by a\nmodification of the leaf epicuticular\
    \ region can be transformed into cable-free, fully plant-enabled\nintegrated devices\
    \ for multisource energy conversion. In detail, leaf contact electrification caused\
    \ by\nwind-induced inter-leaf tangency is magnified by a transparent elastomeric\
    \ coating on one of two\ninteracting leaves. This enables converting wind energy\
    \ into harvestable electricity. Further, the same\nplant is used as an unmatched\
    \ Marconi-antenna for multi-band radio frequency (RF) energy conversion.\nThis\
    \ enables the use of the same plant as a complementary multi-energy system with\
    \ augmented power\noutput if both sources are used simultaneously. In combination,\
    \ we observed over 1000% enhanced\nenergy accumulation respective to single source\
    \ harvesting in the specific application case and common\nplants like ivy could\
    \ power a commercial sensing platform wirelessly transmitting environmental data.\n\

    \ in the understanding of material properties, bio-\nchemical mechanisms, and\
    \ physical processes in artificial and\nbiological matter have shown that living\
    \ organisms and espe-\ncially living plants can be exploited for energy conversion1–6\
    \ and\nenvironmental sensing7–14 by interfacing and modifying the\nplants with\
    \ engineered materials and electronics that enable to\nturn them into ‘‘devices’’.15–18\n\
    Plant-integrated solutions like light-emitting plants,19 plant-\nhybrid\nsensing\n\
    platforms,7–14\nplant-internal\nelectronic\ncircuits,20,21 and plant-hybrid robotics,22\
    \ as well as living plant-\ndriven energy harvesting1–3 using wind,5,23 rain drops,4\
    \ the root/\nsoil\nmicrobiome,24–27\nsap\ncomponents,28–30\ntemperature\ngradients,31\
    \ and potential differences between soil and plant32\nendow great prospects for\
    \ connecting plants to man-made\ntechnology and for sustainable concepts to derive\
    \ novel energy-\nautonomous devices, for example for environmental monitoring,\
    \ in\nagriculture, climate change surveillance, ecosystem investigations\netc.\
    \ Table S1 (ESI†) gives an extended overview of approaches and\nprinciples of\
    \ energy harvesting and sensing by plants and compares\nthe output power of such\
    \ devices.\nUsing plants as small-scale energy sources1–5 is often\nimpeded not\
    \ only by insufficient power outputs for steadily\ndriving even low-power electronics\
    \ but also by installations on the\nplants that makes a realization challenging.\
    \ Often, substantial\nmodification of the plants is required such as by integrated\n\
    systems like artificial leaves and multiple cables and specific\nspecies or maintaining\
    \ certain conditions (e.g., high soil humidity\nfor plant microbial fuel cells,\
    \ assuring catalytic activity for glucose\nfuel cells etc.). Plants continuously\
    \ change their morphology by\ngrowing at their apical regions and by exchanging\
    \ leaves. Hence,\npreserving complex artificial components in plants is a challen-\n\
    ging issue and environmentally questionable on a larger scale.\nConsequently,\
    \ approaches that augment the overall power\noutput not only relying on a single\
    \ energy conversion mechanism\nas well as approaches that require minimal alteration\
    \ of the plants\nby further integration and elimination of external components\
    \ as\nbest as possible are required to fully derive the potential to use\nliving\
    \ plants in hybrid energy harvesting.\nHere, we show for the first time that life\
    \ plants can convert\nmultiple energy sources into electricity that is wind energy\
    \ and\nRF energy. The energy thereby harvested can autonomously\npower a commercial\
    \ sensing platform even outdoor. The\ncombination of several independent energy\
    \ sources not only\ngives the opportunity to augment the power output but leads\n\
    also to the possibility of a complementary multi-energy system,\nthat remains\
    \ operable also when a single source, e.g., wind is\nmomentarily not available.\n\
    We modify plant leaves with a micro-scale epicuticular\ncoating consisting of\
    \ a transparent elastomeric layer applied\non the upper leaf side that can be\
    \ easily administered by\ncoating or potentially by spraying (similar to, e.g.,\
    \ pesticide\napplication or by newer technologies like drones33).\nThe coating\
    \ does not harm the plant or inhibit intrinsic\nprocesses like photosynthesis.\
    \ After coating, the leaves capability\nof producing high charge imbalances on\
    \ their surfaces by\ncontact electrification is strongly increased. This occurs\
    \ for\nexample when the coated leaf touches another uncoated leaf\ndriven by wind.\
    \ The charges can be harvested by a single\nelectrode in the plant stem.\nDiﬀerent\
    \ from previous prototypes,5 in which we installed\nan artificial leaf containing\
    \ a silicone-coated electrode on top of\nthe natural leaf, here, the silicone\
    \ layer is integrated on the leaf\nand the tissue of two interacting plants act\
    \ as electrodes. The\nleaf coatings are simple to apply and more complex electrodes,\n\
    installations in the tissue, in the soil, or the trunk as needed by\nmany methods\
    \ described in Table S1 (ESI†) are not required.\nMoreover, we show for the first\
    \ time that multi-frequency\nband RF energy conversion can be coupled using the\
    \ plant as an\nunmatched Marconi-antenna and the same single harvesting elec-\n\
    trode as for wind energy conversion can be used to harvest the\nelectricity. The\
    \ data shows that the unique combinatory use of wind\nand RF energy by the same\
    \ living plant strongly enhances the energy\naccumulation respective to single\
    \ source harvesting. We interfaced a\ncommercial sensing platform with the plants\
    \ and power it outdoor\nusing existing plants in an urban environment to drive\
    \ the sensor\nplatform and wirelessly transmitting environmental data.\nThis shows\
    \ that living plants could autonomously supply\napplication-oriented electronics\
    \ while maintaining their own posi-\ntive environmental impact34 by their intrinsic\
    \ benefits such as O2\nproduction, CO2 fixation, self-repair, and many more extremely\n\
    diﬃcult (if at all possible) to realize in artificial harvesters.\nExperiments\
    \ and methods\nPlant species\nF. microcarpa (height h = 25 cm), large H. helix\
    \ (h = 120 cm),\nsmall H. helix (h = 35 cm) were purchased at a local plant\n\
    nursery. The plants were kept in a phytochamber controlled at\n50–60% relative\
    \ humidity (RH), a temperature of 25 1C, and a\nlight exposure of a 16 hours day\
    \ and 8 hours night cycle,\nwatered twice per week, and fertilized once per month\
    \ with a\ngreen plant fertilizer. Outdoor experiments with common\nurban vegetation,\
    \ i.e., H. helix, P. pinea, Y. elephantipes, and\nP. peltatum were performed during\
    \ the period of May 2020 to\nFebruary 2021 in the front yard of a multifamily\
    \ residence in a\nsuburb of Pisa, Italy. H. helix (h = B8 m) grew naturally on\n\
    the stem of a B15 m high P. pinea tree and Y. elephantipes\n(h = 2.5 m) grew in\
    \ a distance of about 4 m from the P. pinea.\nP. peltatum (h = 25 cm) was potted\
    \ in isolated PVC pottery fixed\non the balcony balustrade of the residence in\
    \ a height of 7 m.\nMaterials and procedure for epicuticular coating\nThe adaxial\
    \ surface of leaves attached to the plants was coated\nwith a low viscous, translucent\
    \ silicone elastomer prepolymer\n(Ecoflex 0030, Smooth-On Inc., USA) using a brush\
    \ leading to a\nthin layer on the leaves. Excess precursors were left to drop\
    \ oﬀ\nthe leaf. The coatings were cured at 25 1C, 60% RH for 24 hours\nresulting\
    \ in epicuticular coatings of B10 mg cm\x022 polymer per\nleaf area and a typical\
    \ thickness of B100 mm.\nPaper\nEnergy & Environmental Science\nOpen Access Article.\

    \ analysis\nWhole plant transpiration analysis pre- and post-coating was\nperformed\
    \ during a three-day period in a transparent, gas tight\nchamber equipped with\
    \ internal CO2 and humidity sensors\n(SCD30, Sensirion AG, Switzerland, sampling\
    \ rate 2 s) which\nwas placed in a grow room with a 16 hours day and 8 hours night\n\
    lighting cycle. External CO2 and humidity sensors (SCD30,\nSensirion AG, Switzerland,\
    \ sampling rate 2 s) served as reference.\nSetup for controlled mechanical and\
    \ air-flow stimulation of c–u\nand u–u leaf pairs\nTo apply controlled mechanical\
    \ stimuli between c–u (coated–\nuncoated) and u–u (uncoated–uncoated) leaf pairs,\
    \ a previously\ndescribed setup consisting of a linear actuator (4O HiFi full-\n\
    range driver, diameter 8 cm, model FRS, Visaton, Germany)\ndriven by a monolithic\
    \ power amplifier (OPA549T, Burr-Brown,\nUSA) controlled by a function generator\
    \ (GFG-8217A, GW\nInstek, Taiwan) was used to create a vertical motion used to\n\
    stimulate the leaves selecting waveform, frequency, amplitude,\nand offset.1 A\
    \ load cell (LRF400, FUTEK Advanced Sensor\nTechnology, Inc., USA) was used to\
    \ record the impact force\nduring the multicycle contact-release stimuli. Different\
    \ impact\nforces were adjusted by lowering or increasing the distance between\n\
    the leaf pairs during stimulation using a motorized stage in steps of\n10 mm (DC-3K,\
    \ Controller MS 314, Ma¨rzha¨user GmbH & Co. KG,\nGermany). The measurements were\
    \ conducted in a Faraday cage\nunder ambient conditions (temperature typically\
    \ 22 1C and 50%\nRH). To simulate wind, an air flow was created by a brushless\n\
    cooling fan with an outlet diameter of 4 cm in a distance of about\n40 cm from\
    \ the leaf pairs under investigation. Air flow was\ncontrolled by adjusting the\
    \ fan’s supply voltage and resulting wind\nspeeds were measured using a hot wire\
    \ anemometer (405i, Testo SE\n& Co. KGaA, Germany) at a distance of B2 cm in front\
    \ of the leaf.\nRF sources and controlled exposure\nDuring in- and outdoor experiments,\
    \ the plants were exposed to\nambient RF radiation emitted from, e.g., radio stations,\
    \ building\nsupplies, telecommunication etc.\nFor in depth analysis of RF harvesting,\
    \ the plants were exposed\nto a controllable, on/oﬀ-switchable RF source constituted\
    \ by the\nfluorescent lighting system in the plant grow room consisting of 128\n\
    fluorescent lamps (MASTER TL5 HO 54W/840, Philips, The Nether-\nlands) that generated\
    \ a B390 kHz centre frequency RF signal\nreceived by the plants during the experiments\
    \ when turned on.\nThe generated electric field was analysed in detail in terms\n\
    of field strength and radiated power as function of distance\nfrom the source\
    \ (Fig. S9, ESI†). Faraday caging made of plain\nsquare weave copper mesh with\
    \ a density of 6.3 strands per cm\n(PSY406, Thorlabs, Germany) was used to shield\
    \ RF radiation.\nVoltage and current measurements\nGold coated metal pin electrodes\
    \ (0.2 mm) were inserted into\nthe plant tissue for electrical measurements (at\
    \ the petiole for\nsingle leaves and in the stem for whole plants).\nShort circuit\
    \ currents were measured using a high input\nimpedance electrometer (6517B, Keithley,\
    \ USA) and voltages\nwith an oscilloscope (MSO7014A, Agilent Technologies, USA)\n\
    with a passive 100 MO input impedance probe (TT-HV 150,\nTestec GmbH, Germany).\n\
    Voltages over capacitors were recorded either by a data\nacquisition hardware\
    \ (USB-6216, National Instruments, USA)\nor the electrometer (6517B, Keithley,\
    \ USA). The plants were\nconnected using coaxial cables (SMA RG142U, RS PRO, UK)\
    \ to\navoid interference of the cables on data acquisition.\nSpectrum analysis\n\
    Spectrum analysis was performed using a spectrum and net-\nwork analyser with\
    \ a frequency range from 9 kHz to 3.2 GHz\n(SVA1032X, Siglent Technologies, Germany).\
    \ The plants were\nconnected using coaxial cables (SMA RG142U, RS PRO, UK) by\n\
    connecting the central pin to the pin electrode penetrating the\nplant tissue\
    \ at the base of the stem.\nElectric field analysis\nElectric field strength and\
    \ power was measured using a laser-\npowered, high-speed, low-noise 3D electric\
    \ field probe operating\nin a frequency range from 10 Hz–8.2 GHz (LS Probe 1.2,\n\
    LUMILOOP, GmbH, Germany).\nImpedance spectroscopy\nImpedance spectroscopy was\
    \ performed in freshly cut branches\nof H. helix applying a 1 V bias between two\
    \ pin electrodes\ninserted in the inner tissue at the indicated distances and\n\
    frequencies using the precision LCR Meter (E4980A, Keysight\nTechnologies, USA).\n\
    Energy harvesting circuits, sensing, and wireless data\ntransmission\nThe components\
    \ for assembling the energy harvesting, sensing\nand data transmission circuits\
    \ were low leakage diodes\n(BAS416, Nexperia, The Netherlands), ceramic capacitors\
    \ (Taiyo\nYuden Co. LTD, Japan) with indicated capacitances, and the\ntemperature\
    \ and humidity sensing and 868 MHz RF transmitter\nmodule (STM 330 & HSM100, EnOcean\

    \ and\nreplaced with a 136 mF capacitor connected to the plants using\nthe indicated\
    \ circuits for energy harvesting, sensing, and data\ntransmission. The plants\
    \ were connected using coaxial cables\n(SMA RG142U, RS PRO, UK) by connecting\
    \ the central pin to the\npin electrode penetrating the plant tissue at the base\

    \ (Version 2019b).\nResults and discussion\nConcept of plant-enabled multisource\
    \ energy harvesting by\nepicuticular coatings\nOur approach consists in modifying\
    \ plants with the least\npossible, mm-scale variation rendering them capable of\
    \ producing\nsignificant electrical outputs from wind-induced leaf movements\n\
    and plant-antenna-based RF energy conversion. Fig. 1a gives an\noverview of the\
    \ plant’s simplified electrical structure exploited: the\ndielectric and purely\
    \ polymeric cuticular membrane on the leaf\nsurface and the ion-conductive inner\
    \ cellular tissue and vascular\nsystem. Mechanical contact between the cuticle\
    \ and another\nmaterial generates charges on the cuticle by contact electrification\n\
    which are electrostatically induced into the tissue acting as\nelectrode as detailed\
    \ in our previous investigation.1\nHere, for the first time, the contacts of two\
    \ leaves of two\nplants standing side-by-side is exploited to realize wind energy\n\
    conversion. However, given by the well-recognized rules of\ncontact electrification,37–39\
    \ two similar materials (M1 = M2)\nsuch as two cuticles of unmodified leaves would\
    \ generate\ninsufficient charges for energy harvesting. The naturally similar\n\
    lipids and waxes40 in the plant cuticle form a material pair that\ndoes not enhance\
    \ contact electrification. However, by tuning\nthe materials (M1, M2) of the interacting\
    \ cuticles, higher\ncharging can be achieved. Hence, our approach consists of\n\
    integrating a thin epicuticular dielectric layer on the leaf\ncuticle.\nSilicone\
    \ elastomers were tested previously to be one of the best\ncounter materials for\
    \ contact electrification of plant leaves leading\nto highest voltage signals\
    \ generated.1,3 Moreover, silicones have\nfurther advantages like their transparency,\
    \ softness, and ease of\napplication as a coating not aﬀecting the living leaf\
    \ and its\nphysiology like transpiration as detailed below.\nFig. 1b illustrates\
    \ a simplified circuit used to predict the\nbehaviour of a coated leaf when transiently\
    \ touching an\nuncoated leaf such as during wind fluttering (circuit model\nused\
    \ for this simulation is given in Fig. S1, ESI†).\nDuring transient mechanical\
    \ contact, the two leaves generate\na corresponding alternating current (AC) of\
    \ opposite polarity\n(Fig. 1c). Yet, when RSoil is low, charge separation is not\
    \ possible as\nthe internal plant-soil-plant circuit would inhibit charge separa-\n\
    tion and the signals compensate each other. The equivalent\noccurs, when two leaves\
    \ on the same plant touch each other as\nthe intrinsic tissue resistance does\
    \ not provide suﬃcient isolation\nof the two leaf electrodes (Fig. 1d). However,\
    \ when RSoil is high\nenough to electrically isolate the two leaf electrodes (the\
    \ model\nsuggests 4108–109 O), the charges generated can be separated\nand effectively\
    \ harvested from both leaves (Fig. 1c).\nHigh RSoil were here simply achieved\
    \ by potting plants in\nisolated pots (common plastic-based pottery) and this\
    \ can\npossibly also be obtained in dry soil, or for example by placing\nharvesting\
    \ electrodes closer to the leaves and maintaining long\ndistances between leaves\
    \ and roots/soil.\nEﬀect of epicuticular coatings on plant transpiration, growth,\n\
    and its enhancement of mechanical energy conversion\nWe then selectively deposited\
    \ thin epicuticular silicone coatings\n(B10 mg cm\x022, on average 94 \x03 16\
    \ mm thick) on the model\nspecies Ficus microcarpa (Fig. 2a), small plants with\
    \ mechanically\nrobust leaves that can be used in a laboratory setup. The coatings\n\
    were applied on the adaxial surface of leaves with less stomata\ncompared to the\
    \ abaxial surface (Fig. 2b).\nWe analyzed the plant’s transpiration and viability\
    \ after the\nentire foliage was coated observing its growth in a 1 year-period\n\
    and by measuring whole-plant level CO2 and H2O transpiration\nrates during several\
    \ day-night cycles (Fig. 2c–e). The results\nreveal that even coating the entire\
    \ foliage, did not obstruct\ntranspiration and growth capabilities. Moreover,\
    \ the foliage did\nnot fall off or change color and growth of new leaves and\n\
    branches was observed. Thus, the coating did not affect plant’s\nviability and\
    \ normal development (see new leaf and branch\ndevelopment in 1 year-growth-period\
    \ Fig. 2c). This is also\nsupported by the fact that the thin, soft, adaptive,\
    \ and semi-\npermeable coatings allow high light transmission at wave-\nlength\
    \ regimes essential for leaf photosynthesis (Fig. 2e).\nFig. 1\nOverview and model\

    \ of\nthe system (Fig. 4e) reveals a peak power at 17 mW per cm2\neffective contact\
    \ area between the two leaves (determined at 1N\nstimulus considering peak voltage\
    \ and peak current measured\nwhen matching load impedance and internal impedance\
    \ of the\ngenerator at 200 MO). These values are similar to those achieved\nwith\
    \ plant-hybrid systems1,5 and many common triboelectric and\npiezoelectric generators43–45\
    \ in particular at low impact forces.\nThis shows that the combination of the\
    \ epicuticular coatings and\nthe whole plant as a circuit is competitive with\
    \ minimal fabrica-\ntion effort and can even convert low forces r1 N into harvestable\n\
    electricity.\nThe mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion eﬃciency of\na c–u\
    \ pair is even higher at lower forces reaching values of\n0.14%\ndepending\non\n\
    the\nmechanical\nenergy\nintroduced\n(see energy conversion efficiencies of c–u\
    \ pair at different\nconditions in Fig. S5, ESI†).\nIndeed, the energy harvested\
    \ from a single c–u pair is\nsufficient to supply a commercial temperature sensor\
    \ with\nwireless transceiver connected to the plant using the circuit\nin Fig.\
    \ 4f. The charging curve of the 136 mF capacitor driving the\nsensor during c–u\
    \ pair excitation (1 N, 30 Hz) is depicted in\nFig. 4g along with the wirelessly\
    \ transmitted data and received\nsignal strength.\nThe whole-plant H. helix (Fig.\
    \ 4h) is also capable of converting\nwind energy into electricity. Fig. 4i shows\
    \ the correlation of the\nvoltage signal with the distance variation Dd between\
    \ two leaves\nin a c–u leaf pair fluttering at a wind speed of B8 m s\x021 (Video\
    \ 1\nshows the fluttering motions of c–u pairs leading to signal\ngeneration in\
    \ H. helix and F. microcarpa). The data confirms\nthat the transient contact-and-release\
    \ events caused by the leaf\noscillations lead to the corresponding voltage signals.\
    \ As the\nanalysis showed that the output is also force- and contact area-\ndependent,\
    \ the system is likely more effective, the more leaves\nare used and the higher\
    \ the kinetic energy transferred to the leaf\nsurface. Thus, a supporting rigid\
    \ substrate such as a wall on\nwhich the plant climbs (a typical support for H.\
    \ helix, Fig. S6a,\nESI†) may facilitate that more kinetic energy translates into\n\
    contact electrification (and not elastic deformation of the leaves\npetiole).\
    \ We analyzed thus the wind-speed-dependent voltage\nand current signals using\
    \ a supporting panel (overview and\ncharacteristics\nof\ndifferent\npanel\nmaterials\n\
    are\ngiven\nin\nFig. S6b and S6c, ESI†). The panel (Fig. 4k) holds eight c–u pairs\n\
    of two H. helix plants. Fig. 4j shows that the voltage and current\nsignals and\
    \ the average power scale with the windspeed reaching\namplitudes up to B10 V\
    \ and B1 mA (10 mW power peaks and the\nmean power is 0.26 mW at highest wind\
    \ speed).\nAlthough harvesting by a few leaves is suﬃcient to drive low-\npower\
    \ electronics, the power output of solely mechanical\nenergy conversion could\
    \ be further upscaled using (a) more\nleaf-pairs (a simulation of the behavior\
    \ of signals from up to\n1000 leaves in Fig. S7 (ESI†) suggests the scalability\
    \ using\nmultiple leaves of the same plant to increase the energy output);\n(b)\
    \ using higher contact areas as suggested by Fig. 4d; and (c) by\nachieving a\
    \ more eﬀective c–u contact as function of leaf\norientations and support.\nThus,\
    \ also without rectifying the single signals such as by\ninstalling a diode bridge\
    \ at each leaf (which was done in our\nprevious prototypes5,23), here, energy\
    \ harvesting with positive power\nbalance was possible. The model in Fig. S7 (ESI†)\
    \ that estimates\nhow multiple signals generated in the same plant (and our experi-\n\
    ments) suggests that the more leaves generate electricity, the higher\nis the\
    \ final energy harvested also when signals generated on the\nsame plant partially\
    \ compensate if a positive spike should occur\nsimultaneously with a negative\
    \ spike of another leaf.\nHowever, at still air and very low wind speeds, the\
    \ system\nwould not provide the same energy. Other eﬀects occurring\noutdoor like\
    \ wetting of the leaf surface (during rain periods)\nwill aﬀect the signal transiently\
    \ even if it recovers after leaf-\ndrying (see eﬀect of leaf-wetting on mechanical\
    \ energy conver-\nsion, Fig. S8, ESI†). The limitations of a single energy source\n\
    could be overcome by realizing multiple independent and\ncomplementary energy\
    \ conversion modes in plants.\nPlant-enabled RF energy harvesting and receiving\

    \ (50 Hz) to higher frequencies such as here a peak at\n657 kHz related to a MW\
    \ radio emitter in 8 km distance. A high\ncontribution of the energy harvested\
    \ in the urban scenario is\ndue to 50 Hz mains radiation (99.9% of energy accumulated\n\
    and about 0.1% was related to other ambient RF pollution,\nFig. S11j. ESI†) rendering\

    that\nboth\nenergy\nconversion\nmodes\n(mechanical and RF) can be complementary\

    exploited that enables to selectively switch between RF expo-\nsure and mechanical\
    \ excitation. A c–u leaf pair realized in\ntwo small H. helix plants (30 cm height)\
    \ was mechanically\nstimulated at controlled frequency (10 Hz) by a linear actuator\n\
    in a Faraday cage. Ambient RF exposure was controlled by\nadding/removing the\

    \ applied, the signals\nadd up leading to faster capacitor charging using the\
    \ same\nrectifying circuit and tissue electrode.\nThe overall enhancement in the\

    \ accumulation can be enhanced at least up\nto 1000% compared to single RF energy\
    \ harvesting.\nUnder outdoor conditions, not only the wind speed but also\nother\
    \ weather conditions, for example humidity will further\naﬀect the energy output\
    \ (as suggested by the eﬀects of humidity\non mechanical energy conversion of\
    \ a c–u pair given in Fig. S8,\nESI†). RF energy harvesting may be less affected\
    \ by weather\nwhich is, next to signal augmentation, another benefit of\nmultisource\
    \ energy harvesting.\nTable S1 (ESI†) puts the harvesting approach presented here\n\
    in the context of other plant-hybrid devices. Whereas the power\nmetrics are in\
    \ the range of the other methods, they could be\nfurther upscaled and this paper\
    \ describes the only multisource\napproach so far. Our system already powers commercial\
    \ sensor\nnodes using single plants.\nAdditionally, the plant-based energy conversion\
    \ could be\nfurther combined with other existing plant energy harvesting\nand\
    \ sensing approaches reported in Table S1 (ESI†) to extend\nmultimodal capabilities\
    \ enabled by interfacing engineered\nmaterials and electronics with living plants.\
    \ To further validate\nsuch technologies, additional application-relevant and\
    \ in par-\nticular outdoor investigations are crucial.\nConclusions\nLiving plants\
    \ provide structures and materials that enable to\nconvert diﬀerent environmental\
    \ energy sources into electricity.\nHere, we have presented the first complementary\
    \ multi-energy\nharvesting systems exploiting the intrinsic properties of the\n\
    same plant to convert wind and RF energy.\nUsing the leaf as energy converter,\
    \ electrode, and cable at the\nsame time reduces modifications required for energy\
    \ harvesting. A\nsingle electrode in the tissue and an epicuticular coating, harmless\n\
    for the plant, are the only required modifications of the plants.\nCombining wind\
    \ and RF energy harvesting led to up to 1040%\nenhancements in the overall energy\
    \ accumulation. The electricity\ngenerated by plants from single or combined sources\
    \ could power\na wireless sensor node, also using vegetation outdoor.\nOur results\
    \ suggest that upscaling of wind energy harvesting is\nplausible using more leaves\
    \ and increasing the eﬀective contact\narea. While the application of the coating\
    \ which enhanced wind\nenergy harvesting is simple, how modifying plants outdoor\
    \ in\nunstructured environments, and how, e.g., weather conditions\naﬀect the\
    \ performance will require further investigations.\nDespite that, already few\
    \ leaves and single plants may\nprovide suﬃcient power for IoT devices like wireless\
    \ sensors\nand the plant-hybrids presented here could lead to new power\nsources\
    \ especially suitable for application scenarios where low-\npower but eco-friendly\
    \ complementary energy sources are\nrequired such as in environmental and agricultural\
    \ sensing.\nAuthor contributions\nF. M. developed the idea, performed the experiments,\

    Wireless sensor network (WSN) can play an important role during precision agriculture
    production to promote the growth of the

    agricultural economy. Te application of WSN in agricultural production can achieve
    precision agriculture. WSN has the biggest

    challenge of energy eﬃciency. Tis paper proposes a model to eﬃciently utilize
    the energy of sensor nodes in precision agriculture

    production. Te proposed model provides a comprehensive analysis of the precision
    agriculture. Te model focuses on the

    characteristics of WSN and expands its application in precision agriculture. In
    addition, this paper also puts forward some

    technical prospects to provide a good reference for comprehensively and eﬀectively
    improving the overall development level of

    precision agriculture. Te paper analyzes the applicability and limitations of
    the existing sensor networks used for agricultural

    production technology. Te ZigBee and Lora wireless protocols are utilized to have
    the best power consumption and com-

    munication in short distance and long distance. Our proposed model also suggests
    improvement measures for the shortcomings

    of existing WSN in the context of energy eﬃciency to provide an information platform
    for WSN to play a better role in

    agricultural production.

    1. Introduction

    Agriculture has always been an important pillar industry in

    the process of China’s economic construction. Because of the

    existence of excessive fertilization in agricultural production

    activities, some phenomena such as farmland pollution,

    environmental deterioration, and biodiversity destruction

    have been brought into consideration [1]. Tese factors

    seriously aﬀect the production, growth, and economic

    construction of the agriculture ﬁeld. To promote the sus-

    tainable development of modern agriculture, the advanced

    scientiﬁc production technology is required to be considered

    along with good management of agricultural production

    activities. In the process of precision agriculture, the use of

    WSN can play a signiﬁcant role in the context of energy

    eﬃciency. Precision agriculture is a management strategy in

    the process of agricultural production. It uses information

    technology reasonably and continuously improves the

    output and quality of agricultural production [2]. It also

    reduces the degree of environmental pollution and waste of

    energy and resources. Te resources include energy and

    water. It improves the accuracy and modernization of ag-

    ricultural production.

    In China, the development of precision agriculture is still

    in the exploratory stage and faces many key technical

    problems. It is necessary to scientiﬁcally adopt modern

    monitoring means and fully control the use of pesticides and

    fertilizers. Moreover, proper monitoring and control are also

    required [3, 4]. At present, precision agriculture is still in the

    early stage of exploration and faces many key technical

    problems to be solved. For instance, the use of chemical

    fertilizers and pesticides can greatly improve food pro-

    duction. It is observed that the lack of scientiﬁc monitoring

    for soil fertility, plant diseases, and insect pests can aﬀect the

    plants badly. In addition, the lack of fast and eﬀective

    perception technology and equipment can also lead to the

    poor food production process. Moreover, the blind use of

    chemical fertilizers and pesticides may not only cause a lot of

    Hindawi

    waste of resources but also bring serious soil and envi-

    ronmental pollution. Due to the variety and high cost of

    applied sensors needed in precision agriculture to overcome

    these challenges, the product has not yet achieved market

    scale due to the lack of standardization research. At present,

    there are many restrictive factors in the use of agricultural

    sensors, such as diversiﬁed conditions, bad working envi-

    ronment, insuﬃcient power supply, and short service life.

    Moreover, the agricultural production base is far away from

    the city due to which the public information and commu-

    nication infrastructure are poor and the cost of special

    communication means is high. Tere are spectrum com-

    patibility and interference problems as well.

    WSNs are utilized for the measurement of temperature,

    monitoring the environment, measurement of irrigation sys-

    tem, and measurement of water supply in agricultural appli-

    cations. WSNs support the farmers to generate high quantity

    crops. However, they require a battery power supply to provide

    energy to sensor nodes. Tese networks increase the quality

    and production of the crops which directly aﬀect the economy.

    Recent studies have found that many problems in the

    implementation of precision agriculture will be gradually

    solved with the application and development of these networks.

    Te application of wireless sensor network in agriculture is one

    of the most favorable methods to achieve precision agriculture,

    improve the yield of food crops, and reduce the burden of

    farmers. Te use of WSN is signiﬁcant for ensuring the healthy

    growth of crops to achieve precision agriculture [5, 6]. It can

    minimize the use of pesticides, eﬀectively control weeds and

    pests, and achieve eﬃcient green precision agriculture. WSN

    can sense and collect real-time data of various information

    changes in the process of agricultural production and provide

    timely feedback to the users. Te data analysis and processing

    results are forwarded to users to realize the eﬃcient man-

    agement of precision agriculture.

    Tis paper discusses the development potential of WSN

    in agricultural production from the communication pro-

    tocol perspective. Te paper focuses on the characteristics of

    WSN and expands its application in precision agriculture. In

    addition, the paper also puts forward some technical

    prospects to provide a good reference for comprehensively

    and eﬀectively improving the overall development level of

    precision agriculture. Te paper further analyzes the ap-

    plicability and limitations of the existing sensor networks

    used in agricultural production technology.

    Te rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section

    2, the background studies in the context of our work are

    presented. In Section 3, our proposed design for moisture

    monitoring and automatic water-saving irrigation system is

    discussed. In Section 4, we discuss our monitoring and early

    warning of diseases and insect pests. In Section 5, simulation

    results are provided followed by concluding remarks in

    Section 6.

    2. Background and Related Work

    During the rapid deployment of WSN technology, the

    battery power supply with sensor nodes is mainly used as an

    energy supply [7, 8]. Te WSN is a collection of detached and

    devoted sensors that observe and record the semantic state of

    the surroundings and transfer the recorded information to a

    principal site. WSN architecture and the detailed structure

    are shown in Figure 1. Battery-powered WSN consists of

    sensor nodes, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.

    Te sensor node can communicate wirelessly through the

    communication link and forward its data to the base station

    or coordinator node through the gateway communication. A

    node is used to collect, compute, and communicate the data

    and information with its associate nodes in a particular

    network. Te communication can collect information from

    various sensors in sensor nodes from simple (i.e., humidity,

    pressure, and temperature) to complex (i.e., positioning,

    tracking, microradar, and image) and then combine and

    transmit it to the wireless sensor network to realize real-time

    monitoring of WSN. Terefore, the sensor nodes have the

    function of monitoring, storing, and processing information

    in the whole monitoring process [9]. Te communication

    will send the information to the WSN to implement the real-

    time monitoring function. WSN has a wide range of ap-

    plication eﬀects to obtain suﬃcient and accurate environ-

    mental information in the process of precision agriculture.

    WSN includes three major components: base station, sensor

    node, and sink node [10–12].

    Te sensor node has the ability to communicate and

    compute. Te connection process adopts the form of short-

    range wireless, which can form a multihop wireless network.

    Te introduction of wireless sensor network into precision

    agriculture can fully monitor the growth data of crops, com-

    prehensively obtain the agricultural environment information,

    and support the steady development of precision agriculture

    activities [13, 14]. WSN itself has low power consumption,

    simple use, and low cost. It can adapt to the agricultural

    production environment and has long-term stable perfor-

    mance. It can design some data acquisition algorithms with

    modern agricultural characteristics to signiﬁcantly improve the

    speed of data acquisition and support the smooth development

    of precision agriculture activities. Currently, WSN is exten-

    sively utilized in monitoring the agriculture ﬁeld to advance the

    quality of service (QoS) and enhance the production of

    farming. In this agriculture ﬁeld, the sensors collect diverse

    kinds of information (e.g., CO2 level, humidity, and temper-

    ature) in instantaneous situations.

    Te WSN can not only realize precision agriculture and

    improve agricultural yield but also be used in other agri-

    cultural applications. It can be utilized for soil nutrient data

    to predict the health status of crops and the quality of ag-

    ricultural products [15, 16]. In addition, it can also be

    utilized for predicting irrigation planning by observing

    weather conditions (such as temperature and humidity) and

    soil moisture. Relevant sensor nodes can be added to the

    existing WSN to improve the parameter agricultural

    monitoring system and expand the network. However, there

    are some problems in the application of WSN in agriculture,

    such as determining the best deployment scheme, mea-

    surement cycle, routing protocol, communication range,

    scalability, and fault tolerance [17]. Te decentralized de-

    ployment of sensor nodes requires a long time of data

    collection, and the communication link may be weakened or

    2

    Scientiﬁc Programming

    lost due to signal attenuation. Te sensor nodes in wireless

    sensor networks are powered by battery, which is limited to

    the limited battery power, so there are some problems in

    WSN, such as power consumption and battery life extension.

    Although the application of WSN has been increasing for

    many years, the application of WSN is limited due to the

    slow development of the battery manufacturing industry

    [18]. UAV or UAV can be connected with the base station to

    establish mobile data connection service to meet the re-

    quirements of the battery power ampliﬁer and solve the

    problem of the long distance between farm and base station.

    Tis connection allows sensor nodes to relay their data to the

    base station in the farmland area, which can buﬀer the limit

    of the wireless sensor battery.

    Te Internet of Tings (IoT) is the revolution of the In-

    ternet, which connects all things that can be connected. Te

    development of mobile cellular network technology plays a

    vital role in the ﬁeld of IoT. Narrowband Internet of Tings

    (NB IoT) is a new IoT system based on the current devel-

    opment of cellular network LTE function [19]. Narrowband

    IoT can share the LTE spectrum without interference and can

    use the same device to connect to LTE main network seam-

    lessly, supporting all network facilities, such as security,

    tracking, policy, billing, and authentication [20]. NB IoT has

    very low power consumption, which can extend the battery life

    for 10years. Te design goal of narrowband IoT has the

    characteristics of low power consumption, wide coverage,

    many connection points, low cost, and so forth. In the near

    future, NB IoT technologies such as long-distance radio Lora

    and SIG fox will play an increasingly important role in agri-

    cultural IoTdue to their advantages of low power consumption

    and long-distance transmission. Te WSN has a wide range of

    applications including the agriculture production where it is

    extensively utilized in monitoring the agriculture ﬁeld to ad-

    vance the quality of production of farming. However, the

    battery power supply with sensor nodes is mainly used and

    eﬃcient utilization of the energy is one of the big challenges

    during the rapid development of WSN technology.

    3. Design of Moisture Monitoring and

    Automatic Water-Saving Irrigation System

    Tis section provides the proposed design for moisture

    monitoring and water-saving irrigation system. Te pro-

    posed system is designed taking into consideration the fact

    that Xi’an city is rainy in summer and dry in winter and has

    abundant sunshine that is prone to drought and ﬂood. Te

    average water resources per capita of the city are less than

    500 cubic meters that is lower than the national average level.

    Based on this, a water-saving irrigation control system based

    on WSN is designed, and the system is mainly composed of

    low-power wireless sensor network nodes through ZigBee ad

    hoc network [21, 22]. Te soil moisture information pa-

    rameters to be monitored include soil water potential, soil

    moisture content, air temperature, relative humidity, and

    groundwater level. Te sensor used is a four-channel tem-

    perature and humidity transmitter. Trough the signal value

    measured by the sensor, the information parameters can be

    calculated by the empirical formula. A detailed description

    of the proposed design is provided in the upcoming

    subsections.

    3.1. Design of Automatic Water-Saving Irrigation System for

    Farmland. Te agricultural irrigation system based on WSN

    consists of four parts that are sensor node group, receiving

    node, irrigation controller, and irrigation pipe network as

    shown in Figure 2. Te sensor nodes carrying soil moisture

    are deployed according to the planting status and irrigation

    status of farmland to form an irrigation node group. Each

    node is responsible for monitoring the soil moisture in a

    small area. Te irrigation area node group and the receiving

    node constitute a typical WSN, using ZigBee wireless data

    transmission technology. Te sensor data are uploaded to

    the receiving node in the form of wireless multihop. Te

    automatic water-saving irrigation system is to lay an irri-

    gation pipe network on the farmland in the irrigation area

    and install an electric control valve on the pipe. Te overall

    system would be more ﬂexible if the water-saving irrigation

    control is ﬂexible. Te automatic water-saving irrigation can

    be transformed on the basis of the original irrigation pipe

    network. Te original irrigation pipe network can be in-

    stalled with an electric control valve to make better use of the

    original irrigation pipe network and reduce investment. In

    the area covered by WSN, the irrigation controller can spray

    irrigation in speciﬁc areas according to the sensor infor-

    mation. Te proposed system includes a particular module

    that is responsible for the supervision of the entire network.

    Te proposed Automatic Water-Saving Irrigation System is

    basically based on sensor-free network.

    3.2. System Function Module. Te hardware structure of the

    sensor node realized in the proposed design is discussed in

    this section and shown in Figure 3. Te hardware structure is

    mainly composed of controller module, sensor module,

    ZigBee protocol communication module, and solar self-

    powered module.

    3.3. Design of Irrigation Controller. S3c2410arm9 develop-

    ment board of embedded system is used as the mainboard to

    constitute the irrigation controller. Te receiving node

    transmits information through a serial port and processes

    the control information. An electric control valve is con-

    trolled by an I/O port. S3C2410 has 117 multifunction I/O

    ports. Te system has high scalability. Te WSN periodically

    detects the humidity (the period is 10 s) and uploads it to the

    irrigation controller. When the irrigation controller ﬁnds

    that the humidity detected by the WSN nodes in a certain

    area is lower than the speciﬁed value, it turns on the electric

    control valve of the pipe network in the area for sprinkling

    irrigation. When the soil humidity in the area rises to a

    certain value, the system will start sprinkling irrigation and

    close the electric control valve of the pipe network in this

    area to stop sprinkling.

    4. Monitoring and Early Warning of Diseases

    and Insect Pests

    Te Huainan City environment is taken into consideration to

    issue the early warning. Te warning is concerned with diseases

    and insects pests. Te planting patterns of Huainan City are

    basically one rice, one wheat (water and drought mixed

    cropping pattern), or one bean. Wheat and rice sheath blight

    are the main common diseases of grain crops in Huainan City.

    Tere is an information chain of data collection to data sub-

    mission and management, then data processing and fore-

    casting, and ﬁnally the pest forecasting information release in

    the content of pest monitoring and early warning. Te in-

    formation chain is also shown as follows:

    Data collection⟶data submission and management

    Data submission and management⟶data processing

    and forecasting

    Data processing and forecasting⟶pest forecasting

    information release

    Each link of the information chain is corresponding to

    the technology of data acquisition, data transmission, data

    processing, and data application in information technology.

    4.1. Associated Technologies. Te technologies related to

    monitoring and early warning are discussed in this section.

    Each link of the pest monitoring and early warning infor-

    mation chain involves sensor technology, database technology,

    expert system technology, artiﬁcial neural network technology,

    global positioning technology (GPS), geographic information

    system technology (GIS), network technologies, and com-

    munication technology. Among them, the automatic counting

    of microinsects mainly uses computer image processing

    technology to solve the problems of diﬃcult investigation and

    data acquisition. Te automatic recording device of insect

    trapping is to count the number of insects through scanning

    grating by using the attraction of sex attractant. Pad and GPS

    data acquisition and recording technology are mainly used for

    manual investigation of conventional diseases and insect pests.

    It is used to record the data and GPS positioning information at

    the same time. Te ﬁeld microclimate data are also recorded at

    the same time that is closely related to the occurrence of

    diseases and various pests. Te ﬁeld microclimate data mon-

    itoring technology mainly uses sensor technology and GPRS

    network communication technology to automatically obtain

    real-time microclimate data. Te data are relevant to diseases

    and various pests and transmit them to the database for

    standby.

    4.2. Technical Assembly and Matching. Te data collection

    technologies (the main data sources of the proposed system)

    are assembled with data transmission technology. It can

    provide real-time and reliable monitoring data of diseases

    and pests and microclimate for the data management sys-

    tem. Insect pests and environmental factors in the data

    management system are considered as the input of the expert

    system. Te inference engine of the expert system is driven to

    forecast the diseases and insect pests, and the forecast in-

    formation is released through the forecast information re-

    lease system to guide the plant protection work.

    5. Simulation Analysis of Precision

    Agriculture Effect

    Te simulation analysis is performed in this section for the

    precision agriculture eﬀect. In order to master the growth

    status of animals and plants and improve the scientiﬁc

    management level, it is necessary to monitor the speciﬁc

    physiological and ecological indicators of animals and

    plants. In the past, the monitoring methods were relatively

    backward, which aﬀected the growth control activities of

    animals and plants. At this stage, WSN is actively in-

    troduced in the process of precision agriculture pro-

    duction, which can automatically sense the state of crop

    growth link at a lower cost. In addition, an intelligent

    system is used to accurately monitor, analyze, and record

    the physiological and ecological parameters of animals

    and plants that provide a good premise for eﬀectively

    improving the eﬃciency of monitoring work as shown in

    Figures 4 and 5.

    Te lack of water resources is an important factor for

    restricting the current economic growth, but there is a se-

    rious waste of agricultural water. It is necessary to strengthen

    the research work of water-saving irrigation. Te good

    application of WNA (Wireless Network Agriculture) is the

    monitoring of water during the process of crop growth and

    comprehensively monitoring of the actual water and soil

    moisture in the irrigation area. Te WNA is basically a

    simple WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) that is utilized for

    agriculture applications and production. It also formulates a

    scientiﬁc and eﬀective irrigation scheme combined with the

    development of these crops. However, it should be noted

    that the application of WSN in agricultural production is not

    widespread, mostly in a small-scale production environment

    such as tea garden, orchard, and greenhouse, and further

    research. Te development is needed in large-scale farmland

    production.

    It is evident from Figure 4 that agricultural irrigation

    based on wireless sensor network has played a very good role

    in water saving with the increase of time. It is necessary to

    monitor the speciﬁc physiological and ecological indicators

    of animals and plants for mastering the growth status of

    animals and plants to improve the scientiﬁc management

    level. In the past, the monitoring methods were relatively

    backward, which aﬀected the growth control activities of

    animals and plants. At this stage, WSN is actively introduced

    in the process of precision agriculture production, which can

    automatically sense the state of crop growth link at a lower

    cost. In addition, an intelligent system is used to accurately

    monitor, analyze, and record the physiological and eco-

    logical parameters of animals and plants that provide a good

    premise for eﬀectively improving the eﬃciency of moni-

    toring work.

    Figure 5 reveals that the energy eﬃciency of precision

    agriculture based on WSN is far lower than that of tradi-

    tional agriculture according to the data from January 2020 to

    May 2021.

    6. Conclusion

    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have the biggest chal-

    lenge of energy eﬃciency. Tis paper suggests a scheme to

    eﬃciently utilize the energy of WSN in precision agriculture

    production. Te proposed model aims to bring improve-

    ment measures for the shortcomings of existing WSN in the

    context of energy eﬃciency to provide an information

    platform for WSN to play a better role in agricultural

    production. WSN can play an important role in the growth

    of the agricultural economy. It is evident from the results

    that WSN can achieve precision agriculture by improving

    accuracy and eﬃciency and reducing the cost of wireless

    protocol systems. Precision agriculture can use the agri-

    cultural automation system to improve the management

    mode and improve the production eﬃciency.

    1.1. Impact and Treatment of Aquatic Weeds\nWhile native aquatic plants are essential\
    \ components of aquatic ecosystems, non-native invasive\nspecies can expand rapidly\
    \ throughout water bodies and cause severe economic and ecological\nimpacts (Figure\
    \ 1) [1,2]. Adverse economic impacts include: impairing recreational activities\
    \ (ﬁshing,\nswimming, and boating); ﬂooding caused by reduced drainage; hindering\
    \ boat navigation; blocking\nwater intakes for hydroelectric turbines, drinking\
    \ water, and irrigation; and reducing the potability\nof fresh water due to foul\
    \ taste and odor [1,3–5]. Indirect economic eﬀects include reduced property\n\
    values and reduced revenue from impacted businesses [2,6]. Aquatic ﬂora consume\
    \ oxygen at night;\nthus, excessive weed growth can deprive ﬁsh and other aquatic\
    \ animals of this vital resource, leading\nto their death. Other ecological eﬀects\
    \ include overpopulation of small ﬁsh, which ﬁnd shelter in the\nplants, and the\
    \ creation of breeding habitats for some mosquito species [3]. Of the many invasive\n\
    aquatic plant species, Hydrilla verticillata, commonly known by its genus Hydrilla,\
    \ likely causes the\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 2410; doi:10.3390/app9122410\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\

    \ In Florida alone, state and federal entities spend\nmillions of dollars annually\
    \ towards Hydrilla management ($14.5 million in 1997 [1] and $66 million\ntotal\
    \ from 2008 to 2015 [7]). The economic impact on a single water body is signiﬁcant;\
    \ a detailed study\non a single Florida lake estimated potential Hydrilla-related\
    \ losses of $40 million per year (property\nvalues, agricultural support, ﬂood\
    \ control, recreation, etc.) [6].\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n2 of\

    \ vegetation is of utmost concern. \nWhile mechanical control (plucking or raking\
    \ the plants) is the most direct approach, it can be time-\nconsuming and costly\
    \ (estimated cost of $1000 per acre in 1996) [8,9]. Biological control methods\
    \ (e.g., \nfish which consume large quantities of aquatic weeds) are routinely\
    \ employed but can be counter-\nproductive. One example is the grass carp, which\
    \ can consume and control vegetation [9]; however, \ntheir body waste compromises\
    \ water quality, killing sensitive plants and animal species, and \nfertilizing\
    \ additional weed growth [3,10]. Biological approaches also introduce the risk\
    \ of invasive \nanimal species [11]. Seven species of carp native to Asia, introduced\
    \ to control invasive plant species, \nhave recently spread up the Mississippi\
    \ River system and have crowded out native fish populations. \nWhile not without\
    \ its drawbacks, chemical control (the application of herbicides) is considered\
    \ the \nmost attractive aquatic weed management method in terms of minimizing\
    \ cost, time, and collateral \ndamage [5]. \nEfficient chemical-based vegetation\
    \ control in aquatic bodies requires proper identification and \nquantification\
    \ of the extent to which vegetation is present, both for optimal chemical selection\
    \ and \ntreatment strategies [3,4]. The approach of manually identifying weed-infested\
    \ regions within a water \nbody and applying herbicides at the target location(s)\
    \ is labor intensive, time-consuming, and \ninvolves risk of herbicide exposure\
    \ to personnel [12]. Spraying herbicide throughout the water body \nleads to much\
    \ higher usage, resulting in economic loss, longer decomposition times, and subsequent\
    \ \nenvironmental hazards.  \nTwo unmanned watercraft, the TORMADA (Lake Restoration\
    \ Inc., Rogers, MN) and WATER \nSTRIDER (Yamaha Motor Company, Iwata, Shizuoka,\
    \ Japan) are commercially available for \nherbicide dispersal in water bodies.\
    \ These boats offer remote control by a human operator but have \nlimited tank\

    \ V-shaped design was selected for each vehicle to provide optimal stability and\
    \ drag\ncharacteristics in the low-speed operating range (0.5–1.5 m/s) best suited\
    \ to hydroacoustic mapping.\nWith the use of hydrostatic analysis, pontoon dimensions\

    \ (batteries, electronics, herbicide tank ﬁlled to 15 gallon\ncapacity, electronics,\
    \ propulsion system, etc.) with 50% or less pontoon submersion [23]. The resulting\n\
    geometry of each pontoon was 244 × 26 × 30 cm (96.0 × 10.2 × 11.9 in), not including\
    \ keel dimensions.\nProduction of ﬁberglass pontoons was a multi-step process\
    \ involving the fabrication of polystyrene\nplugs (Figure 6a,b) and ﬁberglass\
    \ molds (Figure 6c) for the left and right halves of each pontoon,\nbolting the\
    \ mold halves together (Figure 6d), and forming each pontoon within the mold (Figure\
    \ 6e).\nPontoon caps were fabricated using a separate mold (Figure 6f). A keel\
    \ was integrated into the base of\nthe pontoons for improved tracking performance.\

    For design of the herbicide dispersal system, Hydrilla was chosen as the targeted\
    \ aquatic weed\nand Aquathol-K, a liquid-based chemical eﬀective in the treatment\
    \ of Hydrilla and other aquatic weeds,\nwas selected as the treatment herbicide.\
    \ A downstream chemical dilution system, with a drop hose\noutlet and an RC-controlled\
    \ (via electronic speed controller, ESC) variable-speed pump, was utilized\nfor\
    \ dispersal. With this design, herbicide concentrate is stored within an onboard\
    \ tank, diluted with\nwater drawn from the lake, and dispersed through a hose\
    \ submerged below the water surface. Dilution\noccurs at an injector downstream\
    \ the pump, which passively combines the concentrate with lake water\nvia the\
    \ Venturi eﬀect. Fluid analysis of the dispersal system and a series of tests\
    \ were conducted for\npump selection (8000 series SHURﬂow industrial pump, 100\
    \ psi rating) and to characterize chemical\ndispersal rates as a function of RC\
    \ input (Figure 17b). These relationships allowed optimal RC pump\ncontrol inputs\
    \ to be determined as a function of transect spacing, boat velocity, desired application\n\
    rate, and lake depth. Dispersal system design and analysis is further detailed\
    \ in [23].\nDesign optimization methodologies, incorporating Stevin’s law of ﬂuid\
    \ statics, were used to\noptimize the placement of onboard components (batteries,\
    \ electronics bin, chemical tank, propulsion\nsystem, dispersal pump, etc.). The\
    \ objective of the algorithm, implemented with Excel Solver, was\nto minimize\
    \ the pitch angle of the boat throughout all levels of tank payload (empty to\
    \ full); a key\nconstraint was avoidance of forward pitching (bow pitched downward).\
    \ The methods and results,\nas detailed in [23], were adapted for later prototype\
    \ generations as component dimensions, weights,\nand placement options (e.g.,\
    \ component storage within the pontoons), were altered.\n2.1.5. Hydroacoustic\
    \ Imaging\nAn oﬀ-the-shelf hydroacoustic imaging system (Lowrance Elite 4 Chirp,\
    \ Lowrance Electronics,\nTulsa, OK) was purchased and integrated within each boat.\
    \ Its transducer was silicone-mounted within\nthe base of a plastic container\
    \ at the fore region of the boat. The unit allowed geo-tagged transducer\ndata\
    \ to be stored on a micro secure digital (microSD) card in .sl2 ﬁle format.\n\
    2.2. Machine Learning for Aquatic Vegetation Classiﬁcation\nThe second phase of\
    \ the project involved the development of automated methods for classifying\n\
    and quantifying aquatic weeds, and successively utilizing this data to determine\

    \ with no manufacturer-provided tools or guidelines\nfor opening and reading the\

    \ To convert this .sl2 data into a series of standard digital images (.jpg format)\
    \ with\ngeotagging, a two-step approach was used. First, the .sl2 ﬁle was opened\
    \ using the Reefmaster Sonar\nViewer (ReefMaster Software Ltd., West Sussex, U.K.),\
    \ a software program that enables the display of\nsonar data (hydroacoustic imagery\
    \ and corresponding geographical location) in a continuous video\nform. Figure\

    \ along with a\nmap indicating the scanning location. Both images show the ground\

    \ since it provides a relatively clearer view of\nthe ground and vegetation, compared\
    \ to Primary scan. Imagery display options, including contrast\nand brightness,\
    \ horizontal scaling, and color scheme, were selected within Reefmaster for maximum\n\

    \ and Software Conﬁguration\nAs noted earlier, DNNs, being computationally-intensive,\
    \ require powerful processing units for\ntraining in a reasonable timeframe. DNNs\
    \ have millions of learnable parameters which undergo\nhundreds or thousands of\
    \ optimization cycles during training. This precludes the usage of standard\n\
    CPUs, which have a limited number of cores (eight in typical desktop computers),\
    \ for DNN training.\nHowever, modern graphics processing units (GPUs), developed\
    \ for gaming purposes, have thousands\nof cores which facilitate parallel computation\
    \ via the Nvidia CUDA platform. For this research,\na single Dell Precision T7500\
    \ workstation was conﬁgured with the following hardware: Intel Xeon CPU\n(2.13\
    \ GHz, 2 processors), 12GB RAM, and Nvidia GTX 1070 Ti GPU with 8 GB memory. The\
    \ Nvidia\nCUDA deep neural network (cuDNN) library and other supporting software\
    \ was installed to enable\nMATLAB, Python, and Google Colab to take advantage\
    \ of the GPU.\n2.2.3. DNN Training\n“Alexnet,” an advanced CNN supported by MATLAB’s\
    \ neural network toolbox, was used in the\nalgorithm for plant species classiﬁcation.\
    \ Figure 13 shows the layer-wise structure of Alexnet. Due to a\nlimited availability\
    \ of preliminary data, transfer learning was implemented on the pretrained CNN.\n\
    Initial algorithm training focused on only two training classes: the target species\
    \ (Hydrilla: 466 images;\nFigure 14a) and non-target species (other: 1751 images\
    \ including some with no vegetation; Figure 14b).\nImages of each class were randomly\
    \ divided into training and validation sets (with 420 and 46 images,\nrespectively).\
    \ The DNN achieved 100% training accuracy, indicating suﬃcient network complexity.\n\
    However, signiﬁcant diﬀerences between training and validation accuracies indicated\
    \ overﬁtting.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 2410\n12 of 21\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, x FOR PEER\

    \ image classification based on two classes (Hydrilla and Other) achieved satisfactory\
    \ \naccuracy, classification across multiple plant species or classes was pursued\
    \ to produce even better \nresults with increased utility. To enable treatment\

    \ of Cabomba (Figure 14c) and Coontail (Figure 14d, \nCeratophyllum demersum),\
    \ two common aquatic plant varieties, was collected and the DNN was \ntrained\
    \ on four classes. The data set was divided into training, validation, and test\
    \ sets with 657, 80, \nand 80 images, respectively, of each class. Equal numbers\
    \ of images in each class during training \nensured prevention of sample bias;\

    \ being a very invasive weed \nspecies with severe impacts, was chosen as the\
    \ targeted aquatic weed. The deep learning model was \nlater extended to multiple\
    \ species, namely Hydrilla, Cabomba, and Coontail (four classes in total, \nincluding\
    \ “Other”). High classification accuracy of 99.06% on both the validation and\
    \ test sets \nindicate excellent generalization. Training on four classes with\

    \ 2410\n20 of 21\nThe integrated process would involve automated weed classiﬁcation\
    \ during hydroacoustic scanning,\nwhich could be accomplished through one of several\
    \ methods. The ﬁrst option involves performing all\nclassiﬁcation and location\
    \ extraction tasks on a central computer, located with the operator. In this\n\
    option, the hydroacoustic data could be transferred to the central computer using\
    \ existing hydroacoustic\nwireless technology (e.g., the “Navico gofree wiﬁ1”),\
    \ a wireless module (Navico Marine Electronics,\nEgersund, Norway), or a Wi-Fi\
    \ enabled SD card. To overcome limited transmission range, transects\ncould be\
    \ conﬁgured to periodically direct boats close to the operator for wireless data\
    \ transmission.\nFollowing weed classiﬁcation and target location identiﬁcation\
    \ by the computer, an operator could\ngenerate transects covering these locations\
    \ and transmit them to the vehicles for herbicide application.\nMultiple boats\
    \ could be employed simultaneously for weed detection and treatment with a single\n\
    operator (based on the shore or in another watercraft, (e.g., canoe or motorized\
    \ craft)).\nThe second option involves the use of onboard computer processing\
    \ systems (e.g., Raspberry Pi\nunits or tablets), for real-time image classiﬁcation.\
    \ Live data could be transferred from the terminals of\nthe ﬁsh ﬁnder to the processor\
    \ using Wireshark software [32]. The herbicide application system could be\ntriggered\
    \ immediately upon detection of targeted weed species. Applying this methodology,\
    \ scanning\nand treatment could be completed in a single completion of the transects.\
    \ In spite of its beneﬁts,\nthis method would require extensive research to successfully\
    \ conﬁgure real-time communication\nbetween software (Wireshark, Reefmaster, MATLAB,\
    \ Mission Planner) and hardware components\n(hydroacoustic scanner, autopilot\
    \ module, etc.).\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.B., S.F. and R.R.;\

    \ The decision tree method was \nused, which allowed to determine, among other\
    \ aspects, which PM indicator should \nbe measured and which altitude plays a\
    \ greater role in the optimization of air pollu-\ntion measurements by means of\

    \ Matter (PM) is a key issue affecting personal pollution \nexposure levels (Cao\
    \ et al. 2020). In Poland the tradition of burning candles and \nlamps at cemeteries\
    \ is very cultivated and candles are burned basically all year \n * Stanisław\
    \ Anweiler \n \ns.anweiler@po.edu.pl\nExtended author information available on\
    \ the last page of the article\n 1784\nS. Pochwała et al.\n1 3\nround, and especially\
    \ around Catholic holidays the number of burned candles can \nbe measured in many\
    \ millions. Ground level air quality studies using bio-indicators \nsuch as moss\
    \ show a significant problem in this regard (Ciesielczuk et al. 2012). \nTherefore,\
    \ an attempt has been made to conduct air quality studies at higher alti-\ntudes\
    \ using UAVs. Air quality monitoring has traditionally been conducted using \n\
    sporadically distributed, costly reference monitors (Tanzer et al. 2019). To increase\
    \ \nthe resolution of air pollution measurements the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,\
    \ \nas a platform for air pollution surveys, can be applied for a wide range of\
    \ research \nscenarios (Chilinski et  al. 2016). Especially light weight gas sensor\
    \ systems are \nsuitable for airborne applications (Ahlawat et al. 2019). Current\
    \ developments in \nminiaturization of chemical equipment and in low-cost small\
    \ drones are catalyzing \nexponential growth in the use of such platforms for\
    \ environmental chemical sensing \napplications (Javier and Marc 2020; Johnson\
    \ et al. 2020). The evolution of low-cost \nsensors (LCSs), whose prices currently\
    \ range from a few to several EUR, has made \nthe spatio-temporal mapping of the\
    \ indoor and outdoor air pollution possible but the \ndiversity of them for various\
    \ applications make their optimum selection challenging \n(Omidvarborna et al.\
    \ 2021). Generally, the approaches to investigating the fine-scale \nspatiotemporal\
    \ distribution of air pollutants can be classified into three categories: \nair\
    \ pollution dispersion models, fixed-site measurements, and mobile measurements\
    \ \n(Cao et al. 2020). Tracing of atmospheric pollutants release of and validation\
    \ of the \nmeasurements using unmanned aerial vehicles is still difficult task\
    \ from a mathe-\nmatical point of view (Šmídl and Hofman 2013; Yungaicela-Naula\
    \ et al. 2019; Villa \net al. 2016).\nWith the rapid development of a new branch\
    \ of distributed measurement using \nlow-cost sensors and multiple UAV platforms,\
    \ there has been a huge increase in air \nquality data. In order to reduce the\
    \ amount of data and increase the significance \nof measurements, it will be necessary\
    \ to introduce decision-making rules into this \nprocess. Increasing amount of\
    \ data requires management optimization. Various \nmethods for information classification\
    \ and decision support are available in the \nliterature (Deptuła and Partyka\
    \ 2017; Beshah Tesema et al. 2005). The theory of \napproximate sets with high\
    \ data classification efficiency methods is presented in the \npaper (Nowicki\
    \ et al. 1992a, b). One helpful tool for determining strategy is a deci-\nsion\
    \ tree. The decision tree mechanism can be used to optimize the flight parameters\
    \ \nby taking into account the environmental data. It is not the operator who\
    \ should \nthink at what height and at what speed should he perform the measurement\
    \ flight \nbut the software itself should suggest optimal flight parameters in\
    \ order to minimize \nthe influence of the sensor movement on the measured values.\
    \ Decision tree the-\nory is one of the basic methods of inductive knowledge acquisition\
    \ and exploration, \nwhich can be used for classification and prediction process.\
    \ The method allows to \ndetermine the association of a given object to homogeneous\
    \ classes in relation to the \ndependent variable on the basis of measurements\
    \ of one or more predictor variables. \nAs a consequence, it is possible to classify\
    \ objects on the basis of which the tree was \nbuilt, as well as to use the created\
    \ classification rules for subsequent predictions. \nIn the case of applied decision\
    \ trees, knowledge acquisition is based on the analy-\nsis of samples, with each\
    \ such sample being described by a set of attributes on the \nbasis of which classification\
    \ rules are built. The novelty here is the approach to air \n1785\n1 3\nOptimization\
    \ of air pollution measurements with unmanned…\npollution measurements during\
    \ motion. In the beginning of the research the impact \nof environmental data\
    \ has not been clearly characterized. In this paper an attempt to \napply known\
    \ and generally accepted methods, as a tool selection for gathering data \noptimization\
    \ has been done.\nIn recent years, researchers have been exploring the interdependencies\
    \ between \ndifferent areas of knowledge. With this interdisciplinary approach,\
    \ a certain point \nhas been reached that requires the integration and systematization\
    \ of accumulated \nknowledge. The evolution of management and design support systems\
    \ has resulted \nin the application of this knowledge to solutions based on artificial\
    \ intelligence and \nmachine learning. Such efforts have allowed the automation\
    \ of management accu-\nracy assessment based on design principles using knowledge\
    \ transformation, and \nconsequently to the emergence of Intelligent Decision\
    \ Systems and Expert Systems. \nAll the time the decision making process must\
    \ use the latest available information \ntechnologies. In the decision support\
    \ systems for design and management method-\nology the decision-making process\
    \ has a specification of the framework process, \nwhich is often simplified and\
    \ modified, depending on the importance and subject \nmatter of the decision or\
    \ design task. By building an appropriate decision model, \neven random problems\
    \ can be solved and the results obtained are satisfactory in \nmost cases of technical\
    \ problems.\nThere is a wide range of research into the development of methodologies\
    \ support-\ning decision-making processes and management control, design methodologies\
    \ and \nsystems of varying scale of complexity including artificial intelligence.\
    \ Statistical \nclassifiers as applied to UAVs are a very broad concept and can\
    \ address areas such \nas image recognition in various spaces (Pi et al. 2020),\
    \ also applied in logistics (Raj \nand Sah 2019), building engineering (Omar and\
    \ Nehdi 2017), agriculture (Moysi-\nadis et al. 2021), and detection of physical\
    \ and chemical particles. A special direc-\ntion of development that strengthens\
    \ the role of classification systems is the combi-\nnation of various processing\
    \ methods, inference and seeking knowledge developed \nseparately under artificial\
    \ intelligence into one coherent hybrid consulting system. In \nparticular, there\
    \ are two general approaches to creating hybrid decision support sys-\ntems: CI—Computational\
    \ Intelligence and SC—Soft Computing (Liu et al. 2010).\nAt the same time, the\
    \ state of the art in machine learning is constantly increas-\ning. It covers\
    \ the problems of constructing systems whose operation increases with \nthe experience\
    \ represented by the set of teaching examples. In this area, particular \nattention\
    \ should be paid to the methods of trees and graphs (Rutkowski et al. 2012; \n\
    Liu et al. 2016; Pijls and Bruin 2001; Iordanov 2010). In the technical problems\
    \ \nunder consideration, one of the methods of classification of information and\
    \ deci-\nsion support is the method of inductive rule generation using decision\
    \ trees. In the \ncase under review, entropy is used to determine the most relevant\
    \ attribute. Inductive \ndecision trees can be compared in the process of classification,\
    \ prediction and deter-\nmining the importance of decision variables with multivalued\
    \ logical trees. There \nare many works presenting the use of inductive decision\

    \ support tools in discrete optimi-\nzation and determining decision variables\
    \ (Deptuła and Partyka 2017,2011; Deptula \nand Partyka 2018). Classification\
    \ methods found wide application in the analysis \nand diagnostics of internal\
    \ combustion, electric and hybrid engines. For example, in \n 1786\nS. Pochwała\
    \ et al.\n1 3\nWu and Liu (2009), a system for diagnosing damage to internal combustion\
    \ engines \nusing wavelet packet transformation (WPT) and artificial neural network\
    \ (ANN) \ntechniques has been proposed (Staszewski et al. 1997; Specht 1991).\
    \ Currently, most \nof the research focuses on data mining algorithms, although\
    \ other stages are equally \nimportant for the successful implementation of the\
    \ whole process (Correia et  al. \n2003; Jayamalini and Ponnavaikko 2017; Chen\
    \ 2015; Linoff and Berry 2011). There \nare many different descriptions in the\
    \ literature of both individual steps and entire \ndesign and decision support\
    \ processes (Pijls and Bruin 2001; Horzyk 2012). Induc-\ntive decision trees play\
    \ an important role in practical applications. Inductive deci-\nsion trees can\
    \ be compared with multivalued logic trees in the process of classifica-\ntion,\
    \ prediction and rank determination of decision variables. Such studies exist,\
    \ but \nso far they have not been applied to the analysis of drone measurements.\
    \ In this case, \ncommon objective functions include the so-called Gini index\
    \ (Dixon et al. 1987). \nWhich can be helpful in hierarchizing quantities for\
    \ air quality measurements using \nUAVs.\nThe main objective of the conducted\
    \ research was to develop a decision model \nbased on inductive classification\
    \ rules. A drone flight data record was analyzed, then \nknowledge was extracted\
    \ from the measurements and finally induction trees were \ngenerated. The induction\
    \ tree was then used to generate decision rules. These steps \nwere used to build\
    \ an expert system that would ultimately make the flight altitude \ndecisions.\
    \ Eventually, the system itself should make these decisions. Although at \nthis\
    \ stage of research, the system is designed to assist the drone pilot in making\
    \ \ndecisions about optimal flight parameters.. Unlike classical computer programs,\
    \ the \nknowledge contained in the tree describes the problem domain without providing\
    \ a \ndetailed way to solve the problem (algorithm). This is important for the\
    \ research that \nwas analyzed in this paper. Finally, the generated induction\
    \ trees made it possible to \ncreate and save a knowledge base. Then, an expert\
    \ system was built based on this \nknowledge base to inform the user what action\
    \ to take.\n2  Materials and methods\nIn the following sections of the paper,\
    \ two issues are raised. The first is a description \nof an unmanned aircraft\
    \ system with a low-cost sensor to measure air quality. The \nsecond is a characterization\
    \ of the expert system applied later to optimize the flight \nparameters of the\
    \ unmanned system. The combination of these two issues is a nov-\nelty and the\
    \ authors’ contribution to the development of the scientific field.\nA study was\
    \ carried out on the concentration of PM1, PM2,5 and PM10 particles \nover the\
    \ municipal burial site of the deceased in a medium-sized suburban town in \n\
    Poland. Figure 1 shows the measurement site. An attempt was made to determine\
    \ the \ninfluence of this specific holiday on the air quality, when families of\
    \ the deceased \nvisit the graves of their loved ones en masse and light candles\
    \ to their memory. The \nhuge number of candles lit introduces a great number\
    \ of chemical compounds into \nthe atmosphere. This location was chosen because\
    \ of the considerable distance from \nbusy roads and the lack of influence of\
    \ additional sources of air pollution, which \ncould affect the results of the\
    \ measurements.\n1787\n1 3\nOptimization of air pollution measurements with unmanned…\n\
    2.1  Description of the UAV system\nFigure  2 shows a diagram of the air quality\
    \ measurement system necessary to \nachieve the assumed objectives for use on\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (drone). Fig-\nure 2 shows a simplified scheme of the\
    \ device and is split into three basic mod-\nules: measurement, data and receiver.\
    \ The measurement and data module are \nattached to the UAV and the receiver enables\
    \ to receive data on-line.\nIn Fig.  2 the BARO refers to the baromether, UART,\
    \ IIC and SPI are data \nbuses connected to the MCU – Microcontroller Unit, TRX\
    \ refers to wireless con-\nnection to the data receiver, PMS refers to PMS7003\
    \ sensor (for measurements of \nPM1, PM2.5, PM10) which was used for air sample\
    \ acquisition, and GPS is the \nFig. 1  Location of the object on which air quality\
    \ measurements were made\nFig. 2  Low-cost sensor system \ndiagram\n 1788\nS. Pochwała\
    \ et al.\n1 3\nglobal positioning system sensor. Table  1 provides detailed information\
    \ on the \nsensor used in low-cost multisensor systems.\nWhen the device measures\
    \ the concentration of particulate matter (PM), it can \noperate up to 12 h on\
    \ battery power. The sensors are linked to on-board voltage \ndividers, which\
    \ allocate the voltage to a 10-bit analog-to-digital converter. This is \nprovided\
    \ by built-in ATmega 328 microcontroller (MCU). The spatial position of \nthe\
    \ sensing array is acquired from the built-in NMEA protocol provided by the GPS\
    \ \nreceiver mounted on the universal asynchronous receiver-relay (UART) port\
    \ and \nprocessed by the MCU. The geo-localization can also be obtained by the\
    \ drone’s \nonboard GPS system, but the sensor’s built-in system allows to make\
    \ 3D maps \ndirectly from the sensor readings. Sampling frequency is 1 Hz; every\
    \ second the \nlocation and pollution data are saved on a secure digital card\
    \ (SD card) in comma \nseparated values file format (CSV file). At the same time\
    \ the data is transferred in \nthe ultra high frequency (UHF) band (433 MHz).\
    \ The transmitter uses simple on/off \n(OOK) modulation. A small power of about\
    \ 50 mW is sufficient to provide a stable \nconnection in line of sight (LOS)\
    \ flight mode. The data rate of the STX882 trans-\nmitter is between 0.1 and 9.6\
    \ kbps. The data rate has been set to 1.8 kbps because a \nlower speed has better\
    \ anti-interference parameters and is sufficient to hold all data \nat an interval\
    \ of one second. The transmitter acts as a bridge between the computer/\nsmartphone\
    \ and the sensor module. It receives data from the system on the drone \nand retransmits\
    \ this data via Bluetooth. This is useful when plotting data on the \nscreen in\
    \ real time. It is also possible to connect the receiver module directly to the\
    \ \ncomputer using a USB cable. The total cost of the developed device is below\
    \ 30 €. \nFigure 4 shows the original design of the printed circuit board (PCB)\
    \ used for the \nlow-cost installation of the PM sensor and the measurements that\
    \ are presented in \nthis work. This is the next prototype. The first PCB prototypes\
    \ were presented in \nPochwała et al. (2020). The PCB has a very simple design\
    \ and is based mainly on \nexternal modules such as external GPS module. Individual\
    \ modules of the system \nare as follows: MCU;GPS; barometric altimeter; voltage\
    \ converter and regulator cir-\ncuit; FSK transmitter—wireless data transmission—does\
    \ not write to SD; PMS dust \nsensor adapter; connectors. The board used in the\
    \ research described in this paper \nwas an improved version presented in Pochwała\
    \ et al. (2020). The improvement con-\ncerned primarily the layout and, consequently,\
    \ further reduction of dimensions. As \na consequence, smaller and cheaper UAVs\
    \ can be used to carry the sensor. For the \npresented prototypes the whole software\
    \ of the ATmega328 microcontroller was \nwritten in Arduino IDE using the programming\
    \ language C++.\nThe designed mass of the constructed device is limited, because\
    \ the drone can \nonly lift a specified load. The sensors are packed into a small\
    \ chamber with forced \nTable 1  Summary of basic technical data of the low-cost\

    \ can fly at wind speeds up to 10 m/s and at temperatures \ndown to − 20 °C and\
    \ allows to fly up to 38 min at speeds up to 83 km/h. The mass \nof the used drone\
    \ varies between 3.8 and 4.5 kg and can lift from 1.6 up to 2.3 kg \nof cargo,\
    \ depending on the battery used. The drone’s construction meets the IP43 \nstandard.\
    \ It is able to fly in very harsh environmental conditions, such as heavy rain\
    \ \nor strong dust. It has sensors installed at the front, top and bottom, which\
    \ allows to \nplan autonomous flights. During the flight it uses GPS and GLONASS\
    \ networks.\nThe measurements were taken in the following order: 2 autonomous\
    \ flight plans \nwere made using Litchi software. The first route had 9 waypoints\
    \ with a total length \nof 358 m. A flight was made on the designated route at\
    \ five altitudes. The flight alti-\ntude was h = 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 m, respectively.\
    \ The second route consisted of 8 way-\npoints with a total length of 420 m and\
    \ the same altitudes as the first route. Figure 3 \nshows the respective routes\
    \ of autonomous flights.\n2.2  Application of decision‑making rules\nGenerally,\
    \ decision rules are induced from data sets representing information about \n\
    a set of objects called learning examples, described by a set of attributes. Most\
    \ algo-\nrithms look for such rules through inductive generalization of the description\
    \ of the \nexamples of learners—see discussions in Beshah Tesema et al. (2005),\
    \ Swe and Sett \n(2019), Estivill-Castro and Murray (1998).\nA decision tree is\
    \ a structure which has ordinary properties of trees in the mean-\ning assigned\
    \ to the tree in the information technology, so it is a structure composed \n\
    of nodes from which branches come to other nodes or leaves. It is convenient to\
    \ \nFig. 3  A sample query “query-by-example” to the decision-making system\n\
    \ 1790\nS. Pochwała et al.\n1 3\ndefine tree structures in a recursive way. Assuming\
    \ that a given branch X on which \nattributes a1, a2,…, an and the set of notions\
    \ in the category C are determined:\n1. The leaf containing any category label\
    \ d ∈ C is a decision tree.\n2. If t: X → Rt is a test data made from the example\
    \ values of attributes with a set \nof possible results Rt = { r1, r2, … rm},\
    \ then the node containing the test t, from \nwhich m branches come out, given\
    \ that for i =  = 1, 2, …, m branch i corresponds \nto the result ri and leads\
    \ to the tree Ti, is a decision tree.\n3. For any node of n decision tree tn is\
    \ a test data connected with it, and for each of \nits possible results r ∈ Rt\
    \ by n[r] node or child leaf, to which the n branch related \nto the r result\
    \ leads from the node. The notation described above is presented in \nFig. 4\n\
    Information included in the set of training examples is equal to (see also Fig. 9):\n\
    where E–the set of training examples, |Ei|–the number of examples which describe\
    \ i \nobject, |E|–the number of examples in the training set E.\nThe expected\
    \ value of information after the division of the set of examples E into \nsubsets\
    \ E(m), m = 1, … , ||Va|| , for which the attribute a has the value Vm , determined\
    \ \nas Quinlan (1986) and Mitchell (2006):\nwhere |E(m)|—the number of examples\
    \ after the division of the set E in relation to \nthe value m of a given attribute,\
    \ |E|—the number of examples in the training set E.\nThe decision tree was used\
    \ to generate the knowledge base. The expert system \ncreated using PCShell tool\
    \ consists of the following components shown in Fig. 5\nAt this stage of research,\
    \ the system is designed to assist the drone pilot in \nmaking decisions about\
    \ optimal flight parameters like altitude and velocity. In \nthis case, the optimal\
    \ flight parameters are GPS coordinates as shown in the \nresulting section of\

    \ the most important \npart of the program is the Control block, which provides\
    \ the user with the opti-\nmal parameters for which he should perform measurement\
    \ flights. Figure 6 shows \nthe detailed diagram of the developed decision support\
    \ system with an expert \nprogram.\nFig. 5  Horizontal PM2.5 concentration profile\n\

    1 3\nThe entire expert system consists of three main components. The first one\
    \ marked \nwith a red frame is related to the UAV system and measurement data\
    \ collection. \nThe second one marked with a green frame concerns the decision\
    \ tree. The third \none, surrounded by a blue frame, connects both of the above\
    \ elements and creates \na complete expert system informing the user about the\
    \ optimal flight parameters. \nThe expert system, using the measurement data and\
    \ decision tree methodology \nthrough feedback, is constantly evolving increasing\
    \ its efficiency through continuous \nimprovement of the decision making quality.\
    \ From the knowledge engineering point \nof view, it is important that the dynamic\
    \ change of certain knowledge base param-\neters can be done automatically, without\
    \ direct user intervention in the knowledge \nbase source. The use of an inductive\
    \ decision tree allows for quick classification of \nexamples and maximum characterization\
    \ descriptions, giving a full description of \nthe phenomenon.\nBecause this type\
    \ of expert systems can be classified according to many different \nfactors, such\
    \ as the design, the method of deduction or the type of data processed. \nIn addition,\
    \ expert systems are also divided into deterministic, which process certain \n\
    knowledge, and non-deterministic or probabilistic, which operate on approximate,\
    \ \nuncertain knowledge. For these reasons, it is difficult to compare each expert\
    \ system \nwith each other. However, a brief comparison of the advantages and\
    \ disadvantages \nof the developed original expert system based on PCShell tool\
    \ with the widely used \nCLIPS system, written in the C programming language at\
    \ NASA laboratories in \n1984, can be found in Table 2 (CLIPS 2021).\n3  Results\
    \ and discussion\nAs a result of the conducted tests, air pollution with particulate\
    \ matter in a specific \narea was measured and air pollution profiles were visualized\
    \ for specific altitudes. \nThe sensor was calibrated. The calibration was carried\
    \ out on the basis of compar-\ning the minimum and maximum readings from the reference\
    \ pollution measurement \nstation with the measurement results from the developed\
    \ sensor. The calibration sta-\ntion is a part of the Polish national environmental\
    \ monitoring system, whose meas-\nurement data are commonly available. The results\
    \ of calibration measurements are \nshown in Fig. 7.\nTable 2  Basic properties\

    \ of measurements made with the developed \nlow-cost system against the background\
    \ of measurements from the reference mete-\norological station. It can be seen\
    \ that in the examined two-week period the results \nfrom the cheap sensor are\
    \ within the scattering of readings from accredited sensors \nin the reference\
    \ weather and air pollution measurement station. Sampling time for \nthe low-cost\
    \ setting is 15 s, while the reference station gives 15-min averages. So, to \n\
    show the trend for the reference station the measurement data were averaged. We\
    \ did \nthis to show the trend because in some cases low-cost sensors may tend\
    \ to overesti-\nmate the measured values. This averaging is very important to\
    \ check if the low-cost \nlaser sensor does not get dirty over time, which can\
    \ lead to a measurement dete-\nrioration. More accurate calibration analyses are\
    \ in line with other authors (Nguyen \n2019).\nMeasurements using a cheap UAV\
    \ mounted particulate matter sensor were made \non October 28, 2020. Figures 8,\
    \ 9, 10 show the concentration of contaminants over \nthe studied area in the\
    \ form of horizontal concentration profiles for PM1, PM2.5 and \nPM10 at altitudes\
    \ of 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 m respectively, made according to the \nroutes shown\
    \ in Fig. 3.\nIn the presented drawings you can clearly see the layered nature\
    \ of the profile. \nAdditionally, it is possible to notice a shift in the concentration\
    \ of pollutants accord-\ning to the direction of the wind, as shown, for example,\
    \ in Fig. 11.\nNext the use of inductive decision-making systems in the classification\
    \ of the \nstate of pollution was made. The set of analyzed data (learning files)\
    \ is represented \nin the form of a decision board as a record in first order\
    \ logic. Formally, an informa-\ntion board is a pair according to Eq. (3).\nwhere\
    \ U is a non-empty and finite set of objects, A is a non-empty and finite set\

    \ of GPS altitude and specific PM measurements (i.e. what is the most \nimportant\
    \ altitude and GPS measurement for a given PM1, PM2,5 and PM10 for \nboth routes).\n\
    Analysis I: The analysis was made for two routes: Track_1 Track_2, for each \n\
    route 5 heights were taken into account: Track_1:  h1 = 20,  h2 = 25,  h3 = 30,\
    \  h4 = 40, \n h5 = 50 and Track_2:  h1 = 20,  h2 = 25,  h3 = 30,  h4 = 40,  h5\
    \ = 50.\nIn the analysis we assume that: (1) input attributes are measurements\
    \ of PM1, \nPM2,5, PM10 for altitude data h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 for both Track 1\
    \ and Track 2; (2) the \noutput attributes are the GPS(hi)t reading values for\
    \ the given hi altitude and for the \ngiven t route (Table 3).\nFor the analysis\
    \ DeTreex software was used, which enables induction of decision \ntrees. In order\
    \ to prepare the data, the teaching (.lrn) and testing (.tst) files were \nFig.\

    \ A total of 10 data files were received during the measurement (Track 1—for \n\
    h20, h25, h30, h40, h50, Track 2—for h20, h25, h30, h40, h50).\nBased on the above,\
    \ appropriate learning tables were obtained for all combina-\ntions. For tables\
    \ that are learning files, decision rules and then induction trees were \ngenerated\
    \ in the first step. The problem of finding a minimum set of rules that cov-\n\
    ers the set of examples and classifies them correctly is NP- complete. Evidence\
    \ uses \nthe transformation of this problem to the problem of minimum rulebook\
    \ coverage \n(Andersen and Martinez 1995; Stefanowski and Vanderpooten 2001).\
    \ In Mitchell \n(1999) a general scheme of such algorithms are given.\nIn the\
    \ next stage, induction trees are generated. Figure 12 shows an example of an\
    \ \ninductive decision tree for Track 1(h20).\nThe other input trees for Track\
    \ 1(h25), Track 1(h30), Track 1(h40), Track 1(h50), \nTrack 2 (h20), Track 2 (h25),\
    \ Track 2 (h30), Track 2 (h40), Track 2 (h50) are not \nincluded in the article\
    \ due to their volume. The results of their analysis are discussed \nbelow.\n\
    The conclusions of the inductive decision making systems concern two routes. \n\
    For the first route (Track 1) the value measured PM1 plays the most important\
    \ role. \nTherefore, because it occurs in the inductive roots of the tree at the\
    \ height of 20 m, \n40 m, and 50 m.\nPM10 plays a further role because it occurs\
    \ in the roots of trees at heights 25 m \nand 30 m. Additionally, inductive decision\
    \ trees showed the most important values \nof these measurements. This means for:\n\
    • PM1- for height 20 m—value 11, for height 40 m—value 10, for height 50 m—\n\
    value 11.\n• PM10- for height 25 m—value 17, for height 50 m—value 17.\nIn the\
    \ meaning of the hierarchical classification means that these values played \n\
    the most important role in determining the values of pollutants at given altitudes\
    \ on \nTable 3  Structural model of analysis I\n1797\n1 3\nOptimization of air\
    \ pollution measurements with unmanned…\nthe route (Track 1). In addition, the\
    \ optimal GPS measurement values are given in \nthe leaves of induction trees.\
    \ This means the right place on the route.\nFor the second route (Track 2), the\
    \ PM2,5 measured value plays the most impor-\ntant role this time. The first route\
    \ was not taken into account at all in the classifica-\ntion analysis. It occurs\
    \ in the roots of induction trees at heights 30 m, 40 m and \n50  m. For the other\
    \ heights there is PM1. Additionally, inductive decision trees \nshowed the most\
    \ important values of these measurements. This means for\n• PM25 for height 30 m—value\
    \ 14, for height 40 m—value 18, for height 50 m—\nvalue 18.\n• For PM10 for height\
    \ 25 m—value 13, for height 50 m—value 13.\nAs with route 1, the GPS values for\
    \ route 2 (Track 2) are listed.\nAnalysis II was made also for two routes: Track_1\
    \ Track_2, for each route \n5 heights were taken into account: Track_1: h1 = 20 \
    \ m, h2 = 25  m, h3 = 30  m, \nh4 = 40 m, h5 = 50 m and Track_2: h1 = 20 m, h2\
    \ = 25 m, h3 = 30 m, h4 = 40 m, \nh5 = 50 m.\nIn the analysis we assume that (1)\
    \ input attributes are two types of Track 1 and \nTrack 2, altitudes h1, h2, h3,\
    \ h4, h5, and GPS(hi)t reading values; (2) output attrib-\nutes are values of\
    \ PM1, PM2,5, PM10 for height data h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 for both \nroutes (Table 4).\n\
    A total of 6 data files were received (Track 1—PM1, PM2,5, PM10 and for Track\
    \ \n2—PM1, PM2,5, PM10).\nAs in analysis I, for each case we have obtained the\
    \ tables of learning files, data-\nbase file and induction tree.\nFig. 12  Inductive\
    \ decision tree for Track 1(h20)\n 1798\nS. Pochwała et al.\n1 3\nThe conclusions\
    \ of the inductive decision making systems concern two routes. In \ncase of the\
    \ analysis answering the question how the height influences the values of \nPM1,\
    \ PM2,5 and PM10 contamination, the parts of the induction tree (twigs) which\
    \ \nare minimal on the given tree should be considered. The most important height\
    \ \nvalue for the measurements is then generated.\nFor route 1 (Track 1), the\
    \ optimal height for PM1 is 40 m and 50 m. (Fig. 13, side \nshortest twigs on\
    \ the tree).\nIn the leaves, on the other hand, optimal values of these measurements\
    \ are gener-\nated (for PM1 to 9 and 10).\nThey analyse the remaining induction\
    \ trees, then for Track 1\n•  The optimum height for PM2.5 is also 40 m and 50 m\
    \ (Fig. 14) with optimum \nvalues of 12,\n•  For PM10 the optimum height is 25 m\
    \ and 30 m (Fig. 15) with values 13 and 15.\nFor Track 2, the optimal height for\n\
    • PM1 is 20 m, 40 m and 50 m with values 14, 19, 14 (Fig. 16). This influence\
    \ is \nnot so visible here,\n• PM2,5 is 40 m and 50 m and even more 50 m (Fig. 17),\n\
    • PM10 is 30 m (Fig. 18).\nAn additional conclusion for analysis II is that for\
    \ route I (Track 1), it is easier to \nestablish a \"clear\" relationship between\
    \ altitudes h20, h25, h30, h40, h50 and values \nPM1, PM2,5 and PM10 than for\
    \ route 2 (Track 2).\nTable 4  Structural model of analysis II\n1799\n1 3\nOptimization\
    \ of air pollution measurements with unmanned…\nFrom the trees, an expert system\
    \ is created. So, in the authors’ opinion, there is \nno need to consider additional\
    \ computations at this stage. When generating induc-\ntive trees, recursive computations\
    \ are used at each split until the maximum depth \nis reached. The choice of the\
    \ maximum depth is very important and significantly \naffects how the model may\
    \ underfit the data.\nFigure 19 shows the data fit for the tree shown in Fig. 12\
    \ (Fig. 12—Inductive \ndecision tree for Track 1(h20)).\nFig. 13  Inductive decision\
    \ tree for Track 1 with designated shortest branches of the tree indicating the\
    \ \noptimal altitude\nFig. 14  A fragment of the \nlearning file (table) for Track\
    \ \n1(PM2,5)\n 1800\nS. Pochwała et al.\n1 3\nThe graphs in Fig. 19 show the translation\
    \ of classification trees into regres-\nsion tree notation. For regression trees,\
    \ typical objective functions include mean \nsquare error, mean absolute error,\
    \ or standard deviation. When classifying (learn-\ning) a tree, a function is\
    \ needed in the program. To represent the performance \nof the tree in another\
    \ way, the standard deviation reduction function can be used \nto build a regression\
    \ model. This function gives results equivalent to the mean \nsquare error. Then,\
    \ instead of entropy, these graphs are used to create a cost \nFig. 15  A fragment\
    \ of the \nlearning file (table) for Track \n1(PM10)\nFig. 16  A fragment of the\
    \ \nlearning file (table) for Track \n2(PM10)\nFig. 17  A fragment of the \nlearning\

    \ measurements with unmanned…\nfunction that is minimized when learning the expert\
    \ system. The decision tree \nalgorithm used to perform the splits is called the\
    \ classification and regression tree \nalgorithm.\nThis is applied recursively\
    \ at each entry to the next level of the tree until the \nmaximum depth is reached.\
    \ Our tree model will be recursively invoked multiple \ntimes from each tree model\
    \ produced. Each node in the tree performs a binary divi-\nsion (unless it is\
    \ a leaf), which means that each node creates two divisions (left and \nright).\
    \ Each split creates a new decision tree, and each new tree performs successive\
    \ \nleft and right splits. This process repeats until the decision tree is deep\
    \ enough.\nIn summary, the graphs in Fig. 19 show the accuracy of classification\
    \ with test-\ning depth. The tree previously shown in Fig. 12 (Fig. 12 Inductive\
    \ decision tree for \nFig. 18  A fragment of the \nlearning file (table) for Track\
    \ \n2(PM10)\nFig. 19  Effects of changing the maximum tree depth\n 1802\nS. Pochwała\
    \ et al.\n1 3\nTrack 1(h20)) ended up fitting at R = 0.95. The red dots in the\
    \ graphs are the meas-\nured data. Depth is the search step.\nFinally, after applying\
    \ the proposed expert system, the number of measurement \npoints (GPS coordinates)\
    \ is limited to the most relevant ones. This determines the \noptimal route on\
    \ which to take the measurements to get the same results which also \nreduces\
    \ the execution time. This is shown in Fig. 20.\n4  Conclusions\nThe air pollution\
    \ spreads unevenly across the earth’s atmosphere depending on the \nmany factors,\
    \ such as height and season of the year and time of the day, weather \nconditions\
    \ (wind in particular). The horizontal profile of pollutant distribution \nshould\
    \ be monitored due to the possibility of accumulation in different layers of the\
    \ \natmosphere.\nDeveloped air pollution multisensory arrangement is an easy to\
    \ create and user-\nfriendly, low-cost device (approx. 30 €) with high measurement\
    \ potential. The inves-\ntigation has shown that inexpensive sensors can be a\
    \ good basis of information on \nthe atmospheric condition at a range of altitudes.\
    \ This statement has been proven \nby paralleling readings from designed sensor\
    \ setup with the accredited instruments \nused by governmental air pollution monitoring\
    \ system. It has also been confirmed \nthat low-cost sensors are unaffected by\
    \ contamination and can operate over extended \nperiods without maintenance. Created\
    \ small and lightweight, cheap, devices can be \nsuccessfully used for continuous\
    \ and repeated measurements by creating atmosphere \nquality inspections, especially\
    \ in cities and heavily urbanized regions. It is not diffi-\ncult to imagine a\
    \ swarm of such devices performing coordinated examination flights \nto check\
    \ the condition of the atmosphere. This is far more significant than depend-\n\
    ing on one or two ground-based measuring points, which are currently used in cities\
    \ \nFig. 20  Optimized PM measurement route (violet color)\n1803\n1 3\nOptimization\
    \ of air pollution measurements with unmanned…\nin Poland. The final result of\
    \ the optimization of the environmental data collection \nwith the use of low-cost\
    \ sensor UAVs was the determination of the measurement \nflight altitude. For\
    \ particles with larger sizes (PM10), the optimum measurement \nflight altitude\
    \ is 30 m. For particles with smaller sizes (PM1 and PM2.5) the optimal \nsampling\
    \ altitude is the range of 40–50 m. These results are confirmed for all test \n\

    \ photovoltaic systems in the world and in Poland is mainly\nrelated to the drop\
    \ in prices of installation components. Currently, electricity from photovoltaics\
    \ is\none of the cheapest renewable energy sources. The basis for effective energy\
    \ generation is, ﬁrst of all,\nfailure-free operation of the photovoltaic system\
    \ over a long period of operation, up to 30 years. The\npaper presents the results\
    \ of a study of a low-cost distributed system for monitoring and diagnosis\nof\
    \ photovoltaic installations (SmartPV), capable of assessing the operating parameters\
    \ of individ-\nual photovoltaic panels. The devices were tested by connecting\
    \ them to an existing photovoltaic\ninstallation, allowing the measurement of\
    \ operational parameters of individual photovoltaic panels\nas well as operating\
    \ conditions such as illuminance and panel surface temperature. The data were\n\
    recorded on a server using wireless Wi-Fi transmission. Interesting data were\
    \ collected during the\ntests, conﬁrming the usefulness of the suggested device\
    \ for monitoring the photovoltaic installations.\nDifferences in performance of\
    \ the photovoltaic panel depending on solar radiation and surface\ntemperature\
    \ were recorded. The temperature coefﬁcient of power was determined, allowing\
    \ for\nincreased accuracy in the prediction of generated power. The correct recording\
    \ in different situation,\ni.e., shading, sensor damage or weather anomalies,\
    \ was veriﬁed. Based on the collected data, rules\nwill be deﬁned for an expert\
    \ application which, in combination with SmartPV devices, will ensure a\nquick\
    \ response to any malfunctions of the photovoltaic system, both related to failures\
    \ and those\nresulting from natural degradation during operation.\nKeywords: photovoltaic\
    \ panel; wireless diagnostic system; prediction; malfunctions\n1. Introduction\n\
    1.1. Photovoltaics in the World and in Poland\nSolar radiation reaching the Earth’s\
    \ surface is the largest potential source of available\nenergy. The annual ﬂux\
    \ of solar radiation exceeds the global energy demand by 30,000\ntimes (Figure\
    \ 1). The photovoltaic (PV) leader in Europe is not Spain or Italy, as it may\n\
    seem, but Germany. Against common belief, the hot weather in southern Europe is\
    \ not\ngood for photovoltaic panels or the power grid. High temperatures cause\
    \ warming up of\nthe cells, which signiﬁcantly reduces their efﬁciency. Therefore,\
    \ the photovoltaic panels\nproduce less energy. Poland and the United Kingdom\
    \ are also at the forefront of countries\nusing the energy from the sun, which\
    \ has up to 25% less sunshine than Germany, but they\nare still good enough for\
    \ photovoltaics to bring real beneﬁts.\nEnergies 2021, 14, 1770. https://doi.org/10.3390/en14061770\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/energies\nEnergies 2021, 14, 1770\n2 of 16\nThe performance\
    \ of photovoltaic panels in Poland is so good that the share of photo-\nvoltaics\
    \ in the Polish energy mix should keep growing. Due to its geographical location,\n\
    Poland is a very good place to invest in the photovoltaic sector.\nFigure 1. Global\
    \ annual energy consumption in relation to resources [1].\nBy the end 2020, photovoltaic\
    \ installations in the Polish power system reached a\ncapacity close to 4 GW.\
    \ This means an annual increase of over 250% [2]. The photovoltaic\nindustry in\
    \ Poland is developing dynamically. It can be considered ironic that the coal\n\
    industry—a producer of the main fuel for the Polish energy sector—is becoming\
    \ increas-\ningly interested in investing in renewable energy. Waste dumps are\
    \ an integral part of\nthe landscape of the regions with post-mining areas. To\
    \ a large extent, they are areas that\ndisﬁgure the environment and should be\
    \ revitalised. In connection with the huge increase\nin interest in photovoltaics\
    \ in Poland, the mining industry is gaining proﬁtable ways of\nmanaging unexploited\
    \ mining areas. For example, in 2020, one of the Polish mining com-\npanies launched\
    \ a new 3 MWp (peak) photovoltaic power plant. They have announced\nthat it is\
    \ also preparing other PV projects, including much larger ones, with capacities\
    \ of 66\nand 30 MW, respectively [3]. The power of photovoltaic panels installed\
    \ in Poland is being\nincreased mainly by company investors, but the state support\
    \ system, including subsidies\nfrom the “My current” program, also plays a very\
    \ important role [4]. This has resulted\nin new photovoltaic installations of\
    \ around 730 MW, and this program could potentially\nfund up to 1.2 GW of photovoltaic\
    \ capacity. Taking into account the subsidies, the period\nof return on private\
    \ investment is currently 6 to 7 years, assuming that the installation will\n\
    operate without any failures.\n1.2. Monitoring of PV Installations\nThe basis\
    \ for the efﬁcient generation of electricity in photovoltaic systems is their\n\
    failure-free operation over the long lifetime of the system (up to 30 years) and\
    \ a fast return\non investment. The long-term operation of photovoltaic installations\
    \ is mainly inﬂuenced\nby conditions changes (including weather) and the quality\
    \ of the components used. In\norder to guarantee high reliability of the installed\
    \ PV modules, a fast, simple and reliable\nmethod of checking their efﬁciency\
    \ is required, both at the production stage and during\nnormal operation. Attempts\
    \ have already been made to develop monitoring systems\nfor photovoltaic panels,\
    \ based on data from climate services [5] or on thermographic\nanalysis [6]. The\
    \ possibility of monitoring the electrical parameters of both whole strings\n\
    (arrays) [7] and single photovoltaic panels [8] was analysed.\nIf one of the PV\
    \ panels is damaged during operation, the efﬁciency of the installation\nwill\
    \ be reduced in relation to the project assumptions [9], and the owner will face\
    \ a\nEnergies 2021, 14, 1770\n3 of 16\nsigniﬁcantly extended payback period. It\
    \ is not always possible to quickly detect cell\ndamage in PV panels caused by\
    \ a “hot-spot”, i.e., thermal damage to the cell, which can be\ncaused, e.g.,\
    \ by its partial shading. Such a situation results from the fact that the shaded\n\
    cell does not process solar energy and does not produce electricity, but the current\
    \ ﬂowing\nthrough it from the remaining, efﬁcient PV modules causes overheating\
    \ and damage to the\ncell [10,11]. Experience shows that the weather conditions\
    \ in which the photovoltaic panels\nwork have an impact on their aging and damage\
    \ occurrence [12]. If this type of damage\nis to be detected earlier, it would\
    \ be possible to automatically use bypass systems, which\nwould shut down or limit\
    \ the ﬂow of current through the non-functioning cell.\nThe quality assessment\
    \ of the photovoltaic system in Poland should be based on doc-\numented data collected\
    \ in accordance with the recommendations of the standard: PN-EN\n61724:2002—Monitoring\
    \ of photovoltaic system performance—Guidelines for measure-\nments, data exchange\
    \ and analysis. This requires mandatory monitoring of solar radiation\nintensity,\
    \ ambient temperature, temperature of PV modules and electrical parameters of\
    \ PV\nsystem operation. Standard PN-EN 61724:2002 contains general guidelines\
    \ for monitoring\nthe properties of photovoltaic systems. It also regulates energy\
    \ monitoring procedures\nbased on the characteristics of a photovoltaic (PV) system\
    \ [13].\n1.3. Pollution of PV Installations\nDuring the operation of a photovoltaic\
    \ power plant, breakdowns may occur due to\ndamage to the inverter, cables, photovoltaic\
    \ panels or their manufacturing defects. How-\never, these are random situations\
    \ which are beyond the user’s control, but it is certain that\nthe panels will\
    \ get dirty [14,15]. For many years, manufacturers of photovoltaic modules\nhave\
    \ ensured that if the modules are operated under normal atmospheric conditions,\
    \ and\nthey do not need to be washed due to the self-cleaning of the surface.\
    \ It has been argued\nthat cleaning the modules will cause mechanical failures.\
    \ However, practice proves other-\nwise. In rural areas, a big problem is caused\
    \ by the air polluted in the result of agricultural\nwork, which becomes rich\
    \ in organic substances, and these easily stick to the surface of\nthe modules.\
    \ This type of dirt will not be removed by rain, but on the contrary, it will\n\
    accumulate over time and require considerable maintenance. In the relatively short\
    \ term,\nthis will lead to a 10% or more loss of module performance. Design errors\
    \ in the installation\nof PV systems also increase the level of residual soiling\
    \ of the modules, e.g., modules that\nare horizontal are quickly polluted, and\
    \ their performance drops signiﬁcantly. The ability\nto partially self-clean the\
    \ modules only appears when the inclination exceeds 15 degrees.\nAccording to\
    \ one of the Polish manufacturers of photovoltaic panels, the average\nannual\
    \ decrease in power, under normal operating conditions, with typical rainfall\
    \ and\nlack of spot pollution is about 4.4%, but with the lack of rainfall, in\
    \ industrialised areas,\nwith the aerosols and spot pollution as much as 20%.\
    \ The frequency of cleaning is a matter\nof dispute. It is recommended to remove\
    \ dirt on average 2–4 times a year (preferably after\na period of grass and tree\
    \ pollination), but this operation should be approached rationally.\nExperimental\
    \ studies on the inﬂuence of cleaning on the efﬁciency of the installation were\n\
    carried out in Iraq [16], but the economic aspects were not presented. In Poland,\
    \ the cost of\npanel cleaning is from 1–2.5 EUR per m2 (for installations with\
    \ areas larger than 100 m2).\nFor example, in the case of 50 kWp installations,\
    \ with an area of about 375 m2, the annual\nrevenue from electricity generation\
    \ is 6250 EUR. In case of a 15% drop in panel pollution,\nthe revenue is reduced\
    \ by about 900 EUR. The cost of cleaning photovoltaic panels is about\n730 EUR.\
    \ As it can be seen from the example above, the efﬁciency is low. It would be\n\
    unproﬁtable to clean the panels twice a year, so it is important to monitor the\
    \ installation\nand obtain reliable information on the degree of pollution of\
    \ panel surfaces.\n1.4. SmartPV—PV Monitoring System at a Fair Price\nAn analysis\
    \ of the photovoltaic market, in the context of changing legal aspects, has\n\
    conﬁrmed the increased demand for continuous monitoring systems for PV systems.\
    \ There\nare IOT (Internet of Things)-based monitoring systems for photovoltaic\
    \ installations, but\nEnergies 2021, 14, 1770\n4 of 16\nthey focus on a higher\
    \ level of installation—inverter data collection and management (data\nfrom a\
    \ whole array of PV panels, without the possibility to identify them) [17]. There\
    \ are\nalso solutions to collect data from each PV panel (such as microinverters),\
    \ but these are\nnot popular, mainly due to the price of such a system. In addition,\
    \ microinverters monitor\nelectrical data without reference to the panel temperature\
    \ and illumination.\nThe electrical performance of a loaded PV module depends\
    \ on the resistance of the\nload, the insolation and its temperature. The surface\
    \ temperature of the module increases\ndue to a number of factors, which include:\n\
    •\nAbsorption of solar radiation (absorption of photons, which does not generate\
    \ charge\npairs);\n•\nAmbient temperature;\n•\nHeat generated as a result of current\
    \ ﬂow through the p-n junction.\nThe most common method currently used to monitor\
    \ the surface temperature of\nphotovoltaic panels is the use of thermal imaging\
    \ cameras. This is a very effective method\nof detecting anomalies in photovoltaic\
    \ installations, but it is difﬁcult to imagine continuous\nthermographic monitoring,\
    \ especially on large installations. The suggested SmartPV\nsystem is a cost-effective\
    \ solution that can be used in both new and existing photovoltaic\ninstallations.\
    \ The use of widely available and popular solutions makes it possible to build\n\
    the device at a reasonable price. In series production, the manufacturing cost\
    \ is estimated\nat around 40 EUR. Figure 2 presents a 3D model of the target version\
    \ of the device, which\nwill be launched on the market. The casing is equipped\
    \ with a dedicated bracket, which\nsimpliﬁes mounting the device to the supporting\
    \ structure of photovoltaic panels.\nFigure 2. 3D model of SmartPV device.\nThe\
    \ main advantages of the SmartPV system, are the following:\n•\nContinuous measurement\
    \ of photovoltaic system operation parameters (voltage and\ncurrent, panel temperature\
    \ and solar radiation intensity, ambient temperature and\nhumidity);\n•\nTransparency\
    \ of the system and effective maintenance,\n•\nAccurate information on panel performance;\n\
    •\nAutomatic data analysis;\n•\nReduction of operating costs (service planning,\
    \ cleaning, etc.) and minimisation of the\nreturn period;\nEnergies 2021, 14,\
    \ 1770\n5 of 16\n•\nQuick installation, using MC4 (Multi Contact 4 mm), connectors,\
    \ which are standard\nin photovoltaics;\nVeriﬁcation of the developed device operation\
    \ for its suitability for monitoring the\nperformance of a photovoltaic installation\
    \ was the tests’ main objective. The following\nchapters present a description\
    \ of the operation of the developed SmarPV device and\ndiscuss the testing methods.\
    \ The results recorded during the tests are presented, with\na classiﬁcation into\
    \ different aspects of measurement. The conclusions and possibilities\noffered\
    \ by SmartPV are presented.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Description of SmartPV\
    \ Functionality\nThe idea of the developed solution is to monitor parameters of\
    \ photovoltaic modules,\nsuch as voltage and current, module surface temperature,\
    \ illumination and ambient tem-\nperature (optional humidity). The proposed SmartPV\
    \ system is based on an individual\ninterface designed to diagnose each PV module,\
    \ connected to a database system via a\nwireless data transmission medium, in\
    \ line with the Internet of Things (IOT) concept [18].\nThe solution is based\
    \ on known measurement methods, but applied in an original way,\ncombining the\
    \ measurement of electrical and environmental parameters [19,20]. The device\n\
    consists of several key modules, shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. SmartPV block diagram.\n\
    The current ﬂowing through the photovoltaic panel is continuously monitored by\n\
    a current sensor (Hall sensor). The voltage is recorded by a converter adjusting\
    \ it to\nthe microcontroller input (0 ÷ 5 V). Due to the fact that the SmartPV\
    \ device is intended\nto operate in outdoor conditions, there is a possibility\
    \ of electrostatic overvoltages and\novervoltages caused by lightning. The SmartPV\
    \ power supply system is equipped with\na three-stage protection system—a polymer\
    \ fuse of a spark gap of 90 V tripping voltage,\na transistor and a diode with\
    \ a coil, protecting the module against reverse polarity of\nthe power supply\
    \ and a diode limiting transient overvoltages of the voltage stabiliser.\nA miniature\
    \ Wi-Fi wireless radio communication module was installed in the SmartPV\ncircuit,\
    \ which enables the recorded data to be sent to a server (Figure 4). Thermoelectric\n\
    sensors were used to monitor temperature changes. The temperature sensor suggested\
    \ in\nSmartPV is a popular digital thermometer, equipped with 1-wire communication\
    \ interface,\nwhich is a type of electronic interface as well as communication\
    \ protocol between two\n(or more) devices. A sensor, converting light intensity\
    \ within a wavelength the range\n320 ÷ 1050 nm into a measurable, proportional\
    \ to insolation frequency, was applied for\nillumination measurement. The sensor’s\
    \ measuring range is between 1 and 65,535 lx.\nIn photovoltaics, solar radiation\
    \ is mainly given in W/m2, but our observations show\nEnergies 2021, 14, 1770\n\
    6 of 16\nthat illumination measured in lux represents the real solar radiation\
    \ as well. As with\ntemperature measurements, it is important in SmartPV to measure\
    \ and compare the solar\nradiation on the panels at different locations in the\
    \ installation, to make reference of the\npower generated.\nFigure 4. Method of\
    \ data acquisition from PV panels.\nFor the purpose of testing, a special application\
    \ was developed to collect data from\nSmartPV devices to a server. Data collected\
    \ during the tests and the rules that can be deﬁned\nbased on them will be used\
    \ to develop an expert application based on machine learning\nprocess. As shown\
    \ in publications [21,22], neural networks and machine learning can be\nsuccessfully\
    \ used in monitoring and diagnostics of the systems in photovoltaic installations.\n\
    Machine learning algorithms create an analytical model based on training data\
    \ to predict\noperational parameters or to make direct decisions without a human\
    \ intervention. Machine\nlearning is a consequence of the development of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence methods and their\nimplementation, especially in innovative technologies\
    \ and industry [23]. It ensures that the\nprocess of data acquisition and analysis\
    \ is automated to improve and develop the system\nand to increase efﬁciency, performance\
    \ and reliability.\n2.2. Test Methods\nThe SmartPV device is connected individually\
    \ to the photovoltaic panel, using the\noriginal MC4 connectors, and the SmartPV\
    \ outputs are connected in series as planned by\nthe photovoltaic installation\
    \ designer. The device is powered directly from the PV panels.\nThe suggested\
    \ SmartPV solution measures temperature of the selected point on the surface\n\
    of each photovoltaic panel by gluing the sensor on the inside (Figure 5). The\
    \ suggested\nmounting location is in the centre of the PV panel surface, but it\
    \ is most important that the\nsensors are applied to all panels in the same place.\
    \ Temperature of the entire panel surface\ncannot be monitored in this way, but\
    \ the undesired states can be detected. As the panel\ntemperature also depends\
    \ on the sunlight intensity, the SmartPV device is equipped with\na solar illuminance\
    \ sensor glued to the frame from the top of the photovoltaic panel. In\naddition,\
    \ the sensor will give information about the local illumination of the photovoltaic\n\
    panel, which is particularly important for installations oriented at different\
    \ angles to the\nground and with different azimuth. It is then possible to directly\
    \ determine the expected\nEnergies 2021, 14, 1770\n7 of 16\nperformance of the\
    \ PV panels in relation to the local access to the solar radiation. In the\ncase\
    \ of large installations, solar conditions can be different in different parts\
    \ of the plant\n(e.g., inﬂuence of local cloud cover, growth of vegetation causing\
    \ shading, etc.). SmartPV,\nby using separate temperature and illumination sensors,\
    \ is a high-resolution monitoring\nsystem that gives complete information about\
    \ each panel in a PV power plant.\nFigure 5. How to connect SmartPV to a PV panel.\n\
    The devices were connected to a real photovoltaic installation, on the roof of\
    \ the\nKOMAG building in Gliwice (Poland). Data were recorded over 19 months to\
    \ identify\nreliability of the modules, which were continuously improved. The\
    \ analyses presented in\nthe publication are based on data from the last 6 months\
    \ of this period. Due to the fact that\nall photovoltaic panels in the installation\
    \ were working properly during the tests, shading\n(or damage) of one of them\
    \ was simulated.\nDuring the test, data from the shaded panel and the neighbouring\
    \ panel were continu-\nously recorded. First, one vertical column of PV cells\
    \ was shaded (Figure 6a), which should\ntrigger the ﬁrst bypass diode. The next\
    \ step was to obscure the three vertical columns of\ncells, further limiting the\
    \ output of the PV panel, by activating 2 diodes. In the next step,\nthe PV panel\
    \ was uncovered, and its output returned to its nominal level. The response\n\
    of SmartPV to the obscuring of one horizontal row of cells was also checked (Figure\
    \ 6b),\nduring which all 3 bypass diodes should be activated.\nFigure 6. How to\
    \ simulate panel shading: (a) vertical shading, (b) horizontal shading.\nEnergies\
    \ 2021, 14, 1770\n8 of 16\n3. Results and Discussion\nFigure 7 shows a graph of\
    \ the energy generated by the photovoltaic panel. The\ntemperature is also plotted\
    \ as a monthly average of the maximum daily temperature\nrecorded each day of\
    \ the month.\nFigure 7. Power output and panel temperature.\n3.1. Detection of\
    \ the Installation Pollution\nThe analysis of the graphs presented in Figures\
    \ 8 and 9 shows that despite nearly 2%\nmore energy given by the sun in August\
    \ 2020, the photovoltaic panel generated 8% less\nelectric energy. This was related\
    \ to the dirtiness of the panel surface. The scale of pollution\nwas not large,\
    \ but this could already be observed in the recorded results. The average\ncoefﬁcient\
    \ expressed by the ratio of power to solar radiation intensity was 0.0028 in August\n\
    2019 and 0.0025 in August 2020, respectively.\nThe panels were not cleaned during\
    \ the tests. Further tests are planned, during which\npower will be recorded from\
    \ panels that are dirtier than at present. The plant will then be\ncleaned, and\
    \ the effect of cleaning will be tested.\nFigure 8. Power graph and illuminance\
    \ in August 2019.\nEnergies 2021, 14, 1770\n9 of 16\nFigure 9. Power graph and\
    \ illuminance in August 2020.\n3.2. Impact of Temperature and Illuminance on Panel\
    \ Performance\nObviously, in the summer months, the high intensity of solar radiation\
    \ translates\ninto beneﬁcial results of the photovoltaic installation despite\
    \ less favourable temperature\nconditions (Figure 10).\nFigure 10. A graph of\
    \ the power and intensity of solar radiation recorded between June and Novem-\n\
    ber 2019.\nVarious attempts are made worldwide to increase the efﬁciency of photovoltaic\
    \ instal-\nlations by cooling their surfaces. In [24], the efﬁciency of panel\
    \ cooling by air-water mixture\nstream was assessed. The test results showed that\
    \ despite an increase in the efﬁciency of\nthe installation by up to 20%, cooling\
    \ was not justiﬁed economically. Tests on the efﬁciency\nof hybrid photovoltaic\
    \ PVT (Photovoltaic Thermal) panels were also conducted. In [25],\nthe efﬁciency\
    \ of a regular PV panel with a PTV hybrid panel was compared. An increase in\n\
    the efﬁciency of a photovoltaic system by more than 2% was observed, but obtaining\
    \ the\nenergy in a form of useful heat was an additional advantage.\nIn the autumn\
    \ months, when the intensity of solar radiation decreases from four\nto ﬁve times,\
    \ the photovoltaic system also works with lower efﬁciency, but the decrease\n\
    in efﬁciency is not proportional to the decrease in the intensity of solar radiation—the\n\
    generated power decreases by half in this case due to improving temperature conditions.\
    \ A\nstrong reduction in power generation, associated with the drop in solar radiation,\
    \ resulted\nin drop in ambient temperature and thus the drop in surface temperature\
    \ of photovoltaic\npanels.\nEnergies 2021, 14, 1770\n10 of 16\n3.3. PV Panel Shading\
    \ (or Damage)\nThe diagram (Figure 11) shows the power from two photovoltaic panels—the\
    \ shaded\none and the one next to it, which was not shaded. Based on the data\
    \ from the illuminance\nsensor, and from adjacent PV modules, the software will\
    \ be able to identify similar events\nand notify the operator about failure of\
    \ the speciﬁc panel.\nFigure 11. Graph of power generated by two neighbouring\
    \ PV panels.\nPanel shading started at approximately 7:30 a.m. The 33% decrease\
    \ in efﬁciency\nrecorded (blue colour) was caused by covering one row of PV cells.\
    \ Another drop in the\nphotovoltaic panel efﬁciency (by 66%), which appeared after\
    \ about half an hour, was caused\nby the activation of another bypass diode (covering\
    \ another row of cells). The complete\nuncovering of the panel represents the\
    \ return to maximum panel efﬁciency under given\nweather conditions. Around 12\
    \ o’clock, the photovoltaic panel was switched off. This is\ndue to covering only\
    \ one horizontal row of cells in the vertically aligned PV panel. The\ntests conﬁrmed\
    \ the known principle of operation of shunt diodes in PV panels, but their\nmain\
    \ purpose was to prove that SmartPV devices correctly identify shading, or damage\n\
    to the panel. For comparison, the power generated by an unshaded photovoltaic\
    \ panel is\nmarked green in the graph.\nShading is one of the primary issues to\
    \ be taken into account when designing a\nphotovoltaic installation. Shaded areas\
    \ should then be skipped, or power optimizers\nshould be used. However, during\
    \ the long-term operation of a PV plant, periodic shading\nsuch as snow will occur.\
    \ Modules arranged vertically and covered with snow even in\na small area will\
    \ not produce energy until the snow has completely melted. In the case\nof horizontal\

    \ collected data, power reference coefﬁcients, regarding each month\nof the measuring\
    \ period, were determined (Table 1), and the dependence of this coefﬁcient\non\
    \ temperature is presented (Figure 12).\nEnergies 2021, 14, 1770\n11 of 16\nTable\

    \ ◦C, the expected values\nof the power output can be adjusted in relation to\
    \ the current intensity of solar radiation.\nFigure 13 shows the percentage distribution\
    \ of power and intensity of solar radiation from\nthe selected month (September\
    \ 2019). The maximum recorded value is assumed as 100%.\nFigure 13. Percentage\
    \ monthly distribution of light intensity and power.\nPower calculated from the\
    \ relationship (1), expected at 25 ◦C, is marked in green.\nPobl(W) = Pm(W) +\

    12 of 16\nwhere:\n•\nPobl—calculated power (W);\n•\nPm—measured power (W);\n•\n\
    Tm—measured temperature (◦C).\nIn this way, half of the percentage deviation between\
    \ power and illuminance were\ncorrected. On the basis of further analyses, it\
    \ is possible to reduce the error range and thus\nto increase the diagnostics\
    \ accuracy of the photovoltaic system operation.\n3.5. Sensor Failure\nFigure\
    \ 14 shows an illuminance graph from one of the SmartPV devices, recorded\nby\
    \ the application. The graph shows discontinuities in the illuminance curve. It\
    \ was\nfound that in the following days, the SmarPV module did not send illuminance\
    \ values to\nthe database. The remaining devices recorded correct values of the\
    \ sunlight intensity, so\nthe sensor was suspected to be damaged. It was found\
    \ that moisture entered the sensor,\nand it was not operated properly. The system,\
    \ by analysing data from SmartPV devices,\ncan evaluate the operation of the whole\
    \ installation as well as conduct self-diagnosis, by\ncomparing values between\
    \ the measured modules. In this way, it is possible to detect\ndamage to photovoltaic\
    \ panels and also to the SmartPV devices themselves or the sensors\nconnected\
    \ to them.\nFigure 14. Illuminance graph (panel 3) of 3 June 2019.\n3.6. Wheather\
    \ Anomalies\nAn interesting phenomenon, recorded on 21.07.2019, is presented in\
    \ Figure 15. By\nanalysing the data from SmartPV, at ﬁrst it seems that there\
    \ was a few-hour break in\ncommunication with the network.\nFigure 15. Power graph\
    \ of 21 July 2019 (SmartPV—left side, inverter—right side).\nEnergies 2021, 14,\
    \ 1770\n13 of 16\nTo verify the data, the power graph from the inverter was checked,\
    \ and it was found\nthat the inverter recorded the same pattern, which suggests\
    \ that the whole installation\nstopped generating electricity for some time. The\
    \ weather conditions on 21 July 2019 gave\nexplanation to the recorded graphs.\
    \ On that day, a heavy hailstorm was reported in Gliwice.\nHeavy clouds and hail\
    \ covering the surface of the panels were the reason for a periodic\ninterruption\
    \ in the operation of photovoltaic installation. It is very important that the\n\
    software is able to record and identify such events.\n3.7. Results in Relation\
    \ to International Literature\nThe tests of photovoltaic installations and the\
    \ analysis of the methods of improving\ntheir efﬁciency were the subject of many\
    \ scientiﬁc publications, e.g., [5–7,10,14,15,20,23–25].\nDue to the fact that\
    \ the solar energy resources in different countries of the world are mainly\n\
    related to their geographical location and the local meteorological conditions,\
    \ the results\nobtained from the tests of photovoltaic installations in different\
    \ climatic zones may be\nvery different. Moreover, the climate of Poland is characterized\
    \ by a large variability\nof weather conditions and signiﬁcant differences regarding\
    \ the seasons in the following\nyears. This is due to signiﬁcant changes in the\
    \ angle of incidence of solar radiation in\nthe annual cycle and to the clashing\
    \ of two atmospheric fronts—Atlantic and continental.\nThe frequent cloudiness,\
    \ as well as high precipitation in autumn and spring and low air\ntemperatures\
    \ in winter, affects the uneven distribution of solar radiation in the annual\n\
    cycle [26,27]. In view of the above, it is extremely difﬁcult to compare the results\
    \ of\ntests conducted under different atmospheric conditions. However, the measured\
    \ data of\nthe authors conﬁrm the thesis of temperature impact on efﬁciency of\
    \ photovoltaic cells\nassumed in other publications. The higher temperature of\
    \ PV cells causes a decrease in\nthe voltage generated by the cell, which in turn\
    \ causes a decrease in generated power and\nthus photovoltaic conversion [9–11,24–26].\
    \ As a result of tests, it was also conﬁrmed that\nmaintaining the cleanliness\
    \ of the panels is an important factor affecting the efﬁciency of\na photovoltaic\
    \ installation [14–16]. It is also reasonable to build intelligent systems for\n\
    detecting malfunctions and cell damage, which may destroy the panel causing a\
    \ signiﬁcant\nloss in power in the circuit to which the damaged panel is connected\
    \ [7,8].\n4. Conclusions\nPhotovoltaic farms require constant supervision and\
    \ rapid response to any irregulari-\nties and failures to operate efﬁciently.\
    \ Monitoring systems of photovoltaic power plants,\navailable on the market, are\
    \ largely based on data from inverters, which allow for the\ninstallations diagnostics\
    \ at the level of strings. With this approach, a local pollution or\nfailure of\
    \ each photovoltaic panel cannot be noticed. Available monitoring systems for\n\
    photovoltaic panels focus mainly on electrical parameters, which only allow for\
    \ a diagnosis\nof the panels from a technical point of view, not allowing to forecast\
    \ energy production,\ndepending on the weather conditions.\nThe ﬁrst period of\
    \ trials and tests of the suggested SmartPV solution in real-life\nconditions\
    \ conﬁrmed wide possibilities of using the system for data acquisition and analysis\n\
    of technical conditions of photovoltaic installations. The modiﬁcations introduced\
    \ after\nthe initial testing stage allowed to conﬁgure the devices to increase\
    \ their communication\nreliability\nInteresting data were collected during the\
    \ tests, conﬁrming the usefulness of the\nsuggested device for monitoring the\
    \ photovoltaic installations. Differences in performance\nof the photovoltaic\
    \ panel depending on solar radiation and surface temperature were\nrecorded. The\
    \ temperature coefﬁcient of power, allowing for increased accuracy in the\nprediction\
    \ of generated power, was determined. Correctness of data recording in different\n\
    cases, i.e., shading, sensor damage or weather anomalies, was veriﬁed. The collected\
    \ data is\nthe base for the construction of an expert application, based on machine\
    \ learning, enabling\nongoing analysis of the recorded data and rapid response\
    \ to irregularities in the operation\nof the photovoltaic system. Data were recorded\
    \ on a server at 10 s intervals. It turned\nEnergies 2021, 14, 1770\n14 of 16\n\
    out that a large amount of data was accumulated from several months of testing,\
    \ which\nmade the analyses time-consuming and required computer hardware with\
    \ high computing\npower.\nThe sampling rate can be reduced, deﬁnitely reducing\
    \ the volume of recorded data\nwithout losing its quality. The reliability of\
    \ the recorded data was checked at the stage of\nlaboratory tests, during which\
    \ no distortions of the recorded values were found. In the\nSmartPV device software,\
    \ additional ﬁlters were implemented, which prevented sending\nto the server random,\
    \ erroneous values, which were due to communication problems with\nthe sensors,\
    \ mainly during module start-up (in the morning) and shutdown after sunset.\n\
    The tests also showed some discrepancies in the readings of the measuring sensors\n\
    between the different SmartPV devices. The differences in readings are due to\
    \ both the\ntolerances of the sensors themselves and the tolerances of the electronic\
    \ components used\nin the measuring system. Therefore, SmartPV modules should\
    \ be calibrated under identical\noperating conditions before their ﬁnal use.\n\
    The correct working of the photovoltaic installation during the whole testing\
    \ period\nrequired simulating the shading or cell damage by shadowing successive\
    \ rows of cells. The\ntests conﬁrmed the operation of the bypass diodes and the\
    \ correct response of SmartPV to\na sudden drop in PV panel efﬁciency.\nIn the\
    \ photovoltaic installation on which the SmartPV devices were tested, the panels\n\
    were connected in 20 pc strings. Due to the limitation of the number of SmartPV\
    \ devices\ntested to 10 pc, it was not possible to compare directly the data recorded\
    \ by us with those\ncollected by the photovoltaic inverter.\nSmartPV estimates\
    \ the expected current output of the photovoltaic installation, in\nrelation to\
    \ the solar irradiance at the level of each panel, and deduces the causes of\n\
    possible power drops, allowing corrective action to be targeted effectively. The\
    \ following\nconclusions can be drawn from the tests:\n•\nSmartPV modules closely\
    \ monitor the panel operation (whose parameters depend\non the intensity of solar\
    \ radiation), recording the voltage and current generated\nindividually by each\
    \ panel.\n•\nA strong dependence of the generated electrical power on the intensity\
    \ of solar radia-\ntion was conﬁrmed, including a signiﬁcant adverse effect of\
    \ temperature. Excessive\nheating of the panels causes a decrease in efﬁciency\
    \ of 0.5% for each 1 ◦C.\n•\nCoefﬁcients were determined to allow estimation of\
    \ the expected electric power,\ndepending on the period and weather conditions.\
    \ The coefﬁcients make it possible to\nincrease the accuracy of the prediction\
    \ of the expected power at a given period and\nweather conditions.\n•\nThe SmartPV\
    \ system can detect the degree of pollution on the surface of the photo-\nvoltaic\
    \ panels (pollution of the panels can cause up to 20% decrease in the efﬁciency\
    \ of\nthe installation) by comparing the currently generated power of the whole\
    \ installation\n(or string) with the calculated theoretical value (based on current\
    \ sensor data and\narchive data). In economically justiﬁed cases (when the loss\
    \ due to pollution reaches\nthe value of the installation cleaning costs), the\
    \ system can inform the user about the\nneed to clean the installation.\n•\nBy\
    \ analysing data from each panel, it is possible to detect their damage (e.g.,\
    \ mechani-\ncal, e.g., caused by hail, delamination, hot spots, etc.) Damage to\
    \ a single panel affects\nthe operation of the entire installation, causing a\
    \ signiﬁcant loss of power in the string\nto which it is connected.\n•\nBased\
    \ on the analysis of sensor data, historical data and a comparison of the current\n\
    panel output with the nominal output, it is possible to track the panel’s ageing\
    \ trend\nand inform the user about the need for replacement.\n•\nA horizontal\
    \ arrangement of the photovoltaic panels is deﬁnitely more beneﬁcial,\nmainly\
    \ due to the effect of snowfall on the efﬁciency of the installation. Snow accumu-\n\
    lated on the operating system melts slowly (under the inﬂuence of the higher surface\n\
    temperature of the panels), slowly sliding off the panels, exposing successive\
    \ rows\nEnergies 2021, 14, 1770\n15 of 16\nof cells. In a horizontal arrangement,\
    \ a PV panel starts operating at 33% efﬁciency\nwhen the top 2 rows of cells are\
    \ uncovered and will gradually increase in efﬁciency.\nVertically stacked panels\
    \ will start operating after the snow has completely melted or\nslid off.\n•\n\
    The system can locally detect panel shading that was not considered or did not\
    \ exist\nat the installation designing stage (e.g., trees, new buildings).\n•\n\
    In several cases, breaks in communication were detected, manifesting as missing\
    \ data\nin the database. The target solution will use external Wi-Fi aerials,\
    \ thus increasing the\nreliability of wireless communication.\n•\nA self-diagnostics\
    \ algorithm, built into the system software, enables real-time self-\nmonitoring\
    \ to detect erroneous values from the sensors or damage.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ strengths in agriculture, but \nin the current period, along with the narrowing\
    \ of arable land, the quality of \nsoil and the increasingly harsh climate have\
    \ caused difficulties for activities. \nAlong with the strong development of the\
    \ industrial revolution 4.0, the ap-\nplication of Internet of Things (IoT) technology\
    \ in agriculture is increasingly \npopular. However, for the application to be\

    \ sector, it is necessary to \nhave a policy orientation on science and application\
    \ from the government. \nThis article will address the outstanding issues of IoT\

    \ is “tagged” to distinguish that object from the \nthings around it, we can completely\
    \ manage it through computers. Tagging can \nbe done through many technologies,\
    \ such as RFID, NFC, barcode, QR code, dig-\nital watermark. Put simply, IoT is\
    \ all connected devices and the connection can \nbe made via Wi-Fi, broadband\
    \ telecommunications networks (3G, 4G, 5G), Blu-\netooth, ZigBee, infrared, etc.\
    \ With more than 7 billion connected IoT devices \ntoday, experts expect this\
    \ number to grow to 22 billion by 2025. \nIn the past ten years, the world has\
    \ made many advances in technology such \nas manufacturing sensors, Internet protocols\
    \ to connect many devices, wireless \ndata transmission technology and data processing\
    \ and analysis technology, etc. \nThese advancements give us many opportunities\
    \ to collect and process large vo-\nlumes of data efficiently. \nIoT is a set\
    \ of technologies that allow us to collect large volumes of data orga-\nnized\
    \ through intelligent devices connected via the Internet and wireless net-\nworks\
    \ and process that data effectively to serve the management, administration, \n\
    and business activities. \nThe world is entering an era when people are searching\
    \ for new resources, and \nIoT allows us to exploit available resources, that\
    \ is, information resources, to \ncreate a competitive advantage. IoT is considered\
    \ a potential technology trend \nthat can bring significant benefits. IoT has\
    \ several characteristics that can be \nseen as follows (Gillis, 2021; What Is\
    \ the Internet of Things? Configuring IoT \nTechnology and Applications in Implementation,\
    \ 2021, April 28): \n- Intelligence: In recent times, the combination of IoT with\
    \ autonomous con-\ntrol creates a network of intelligent entities capable of acting\
    \ individually de-\npending on specific situations. At the same time, they can\
    \ exchange information \nwith each other. The inclusion of AI technology in data\
    \ processing analysis will \nmake IoT systems more and more intelligent; \n- Complex\
    \ systems: In an open world, IoT will be complex because it in-\ncludes a large\
    \ number of links between devices, machines, and services and the \nability to\
    \ scale with new elements; \n- Size: An IoT network can contain up to 50 to 100\
    \ trillion connected objects, \nand the network can track the movement of each\
    \ object; \n- Data: The collected IoT data is extensive; besides important data\
    \ informa-\ntion, there is also data about time, place, space, etc. Therefore,\
    \ it is necessary to \nconsider what types of data to collect and how often to\
    \ sample data as well as \ncollecting event-based data to optimize network resources;\
    \ \n- Enormous potential: Currently, IoT has reached a stage, and the cost of\
    \ \ndeployment is getting cheaper. Many ARM embedded devices can collect and \n\
    transmit data on the network but cost less than 40 USD per product. Currently,\
    \ \nwe can see 32-bit ARM-based microcontrollers for less than 1 USD. With this\
    \ \nmicrocontroller, it is possible to do many things on it, such as collecting\
    \ and \ntransmitting data much cheaper: only about 50 cents for a 32-bit ARM micro-\n\
    controller. In the next 5 years, products will become more abundant and afford-\n\
    able. Ongoing challenges are data management and migration to IPv6 (IPv6 is \n\
    D. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/jss.2022.101015 \n172 \nOpen Journal\
    \ of Social Sciences \n \nnow available and running with allocated addresses).\
    \ With IPv6, we will have an \nabundance of addresses, and this will open up the\
    \ possibility of assigning ad-\ndresses to each device (gadget) and chip. Solutions\
    \ will be easier and more \nstraightforward, clearer, recoverable to individual\
    \ address entries, and the scope \nfor growth is immense; \nIn Vietnam, according\
    \ to the policy of integration into the international \neconomy of the Party and\
    \ the State, the Vietnamese IT industry cannot stand \naside from this trend.\
    \ In the coming time, at the state level, the exploitation of \ndata as a resource\
    \ for forecasting and management will be promoted more \nstrongly. On the part\
    \ of information technology, businesses need to take advan-\ntage of this opportunity\
    \ to launch a new application layer that allows exploiting \nthe business’s hidden\
    \ potential through the analysis of relevant data. IoT has the \npotential to\
    \ be applied in a variety of fields that are of interest to society, such as \n\
    transportation, health care, agriculture, education, etc., to help lower costs\
    \ and \nimprove service quality. In particular, agriculture is one of the fields\
    \ attached to \nthe country for thousands of years, but its potential has not\
    \ been effectively ex-\nploited. \n2. IoT Application in High-Tech Agricultural\
    \ Development \nA report by the McKinsey global economic research institute (USA)\
    \ estimates \nthat by 2025, the Internet of Things could bring in more than 11\
    \ trillion USD \nper year. The report summarizes that the potential of IoT is\
    \ being underesti-\nmated because IoT is not only present in all areas of life,\
    \ but it also creates many \nnew concepts and areas in Life and Business. \nThe\
    \ world population will reach 9.8 billion people by 2050. Therefore, to serve\
    \ \nthis population well, agriculture must accept IoT. To combat challenges such\
    \ as \nextreme weather conditions, increased climate change, and the impact on\
    \ the \nenvironment caused by intensive farming practices, more food needs to\
    \ be met. \nApplications of IoT-based smart agriculture target large-scale livestock\
    \ opera-\ntions and provide new levers to enhance other development trends in\
    \ agriculture \nsuch as organic farming, family livestock, and intensification\
    \ of agriculture \n(Ayaz, Ammad-Uddin, Sharif, Mansour, & Aggoune, 2019). \n2.1.\
    \ The Concept of IoT Application in High-Tech Agriculture \nHigh-tech agriculture\
    \ is a system that relies heavily on investment capital and \nhigh-tech techniques\
    \ to grow crops. In high-tech (smart) agriculture, we have \nsuccessfully applied\
    \ IoT to create a system built to monitor crop fields. The \npurpose of most agricultural\
    \ IoT models is to allow businesses and farmers to \npre-plan operations around\
    \ planting, watering, harvesting, etc. Specifically, the \napplication of IoT\
    \ in agriculture will be (What Is the Internet of Things? Confi-\nguring IoT Technology\
    \ and Applications in Implementation, 2021, April 28): \n- Applying science and\
    \ technology to the whole process in agriculture (the \nclosed process): Particularly,\
    \ applying information technology, electronics, and \nD. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van\

    \ \n \ntelecommunications to processes from seed preparation, soil, etc. -> cultivation\
    \ \n– breeding -> harvesting -> processing -> preservation -> distribution ->\
    \ to the \ntable; \n- Apply new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI)\
    \ to process the \ncollected big data. Collected data must form a large-scale\
    \ database to automate \nthe whole process gradually (i.e., eliminate progressively\
    \ human “experience” \nproactively recognizing problems and proposing solutions);\
    \ \n- Application of new and modern equipment such as drones in planting, \nhealth\
    \ monitoring, crop care, pesticide spraying, irrigation, etc.; \n- Greenhouses:\
    \ Greenhouses are now commonly used in our country, espe-\ncially in Da Lat—where\
    \ has the advantage of climate and weather. Greenhouses \nwere initially born\
    \ to help isolate plants from outside weather conditions. Grad-\nually, additional\
    \ climate control systems inside greenhouses (temperature, hu-\nmidity, light,\
    \ etc.) and irrigation control systems were added. Greenhouses con-\ntain two\
    \ central systems as follows: \n+ Irrigation control systems: The system includes\
    \ devices: A drip irrigation \nhead or a mist/rain sprinkler, a fertilizer injector,\
    \ an irrigation controller, etc. \nThe systems help to water/fertilize in an economical,\
    \ efficient, and high-yield \nway, helping farmers reduce production costs; \n\
    + Microclimate control systems: The system includes sensors to detect tem-\nperature\
    \ and humidity inside and outside the greenhouses, the ventilation fan \nsystem\
    \ for the air convection, the lighting system to be able to increase the light\
    \ \nwhen needed; the weather station measures the following parameters: solar\
    \ radi-\nation intensity, rain warning, wind speed, rain volume, etc. The goal\
    \ is to help \nthe greenhouses stay in the desired conditions. \nAll these applications\
    \ of IoT technology in agriculture contribute to reducing \nlabour costs, input\
    \ costs through the rational use of fertilizers, water sources, etc. \nand improving\
    \ the quality of the plants; bringing the country’s agriculture to a \nnew height,\
    \ gaining a position in the international agricultural product market. \n2.2.\
    \ Benefits of IoT Application in Agriculture \nIoT applications in agriculture\
    \ play a vital role in the current technology era. We \nneed more support to promote\
    \ IoT technology adoption in agriculture and bring \nabout greater efficiency.\
    \ The above is considered a successful step for many ma-\njor agricultural brands\
    \ with benefits such as: \n- Agricultural coverage: Combining many types of farming\
    \ including green-\nhouse growing methods, hydroponics, some farm models can be\
    \ located in ci-\nties; \n- Resources reduction: Optimizing the use of resources\
    \ such as water, land, \nenergy, etc. This resource-saving is significant, and\
    \ productivity is improved; \n- Clean processes: Applying IoT to the production\
    \ process helps to minimize \nthe use of pesticides, chemical fertilizers, etc.\
    \ Therefore, agricultural products \nwill ensure better quality and can be exported\
    \ to many more countries; \nD. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/jss.2022.101015\
    \ \n174 \nOpen Journal of Social Sciences \n \n- Fast: With the support from the\
    \ IoT system, the living and growing envi-\nronment of the plants are at ideal\
    \ levels. Plants are monitored and cared for right \nfrom the time of sowing to\
    \ harvesting, helping the plants to grow very quickly \nand soon to harvest; \n\
    - Improving the quality of agricultural products: With the 24/7 continuous \n\
    operation of the IoT system in particular and smart agriculture in general, agri-\n\
    cultural products will be developed in quality (and quantity), thereby increasing\
    \ \nthe value of products; \n- Risk control: Estimating production in advance\
    \ when businesses, farmers \nplan product distribution and accurately predict\
    \ how many crops you will harv-\nest; as a result, ensuring to have products that\
    \ will make sales more convenient. \nThe application of IoT in high-tech agriculture\
    \ in Vietnam will create great \nopportunities for farmers to become businesses\
    \ with outstanding productivity \nand value and an increasingly better quality\
    \ of life. Thereby helping farmers save \nresources, operating costs, improve\
    \ production, crop quality, labor optimization, \nmanagement time, etc. Currently,\
    \ IoT applications are widely applied by farmers \nto reduce labour and accelerate\
    \ the development of crops, helping farmers in-\ncrease their income. \nAgricultural\
    \ IoT applications are helping farmers collect meaningful data. \nSmall landowners\
    \ and farmers must understand the potential of the IoT market \nfor agriculture\
    \ by installing innovative technologies to increase the competitive-\nness and\
    \ sustainability of their production. Increasing population demand can \nbe achieved\
    \ if ranchers and smallholder farmers implement IoT agricultural so-\nlutions\
    \ successfully. \n3. Advantages, Disadvantages, and Directions of IoT  \nApplications\
    \ for Agriculture in Vietnam \n3.1. Advantages and Disadvantages \nVietnam is\
    \ a country with a long history of agriculture through which farmers \nhave gained\
    \ a lot of experience in farming and animal husbandry. Farmers have \nbeen used\
    \ to farming for generations; since then, they are willing to stick with \nthe\
    \ land where they were born and pursue this work for the rest of their lives.\
    \ In \nrecent years, the policies of the Communist Party and the Vietnamese State\
    \ on \nland accumulation have facilitated the implementation of IoT application\
    \ for \nagriculture more favorable. \nVietnam has many advantages when it comes\
    \ to emerging as a dynamic \ncountry, with many tech startups and this community\
    \ being supported by the \nGovernment. Technological human resources in Vietnam\
    \ are huge, young, intel-\nligent, passionate, and hard-working to learn new things.\
    \  \nBesides the advantages, Vietnam also faces difficulties and challenges to\
    \ pro-\nmote IoT development: \n- Firstly, we lack businesses that provide technologies,\
    \ solutions, and data \nanalysis and processing services. To have strong companies\
    \ in data analysis and \nD. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/jss.2022.101015\
    \ \n175 \nOpen Journal of Social Sciences \n \ncreate competitive advantages,\
    \ Vietnam needs to have policies to attract talent, \ndevelop appropriate training\
    \ and research programs in this field; \n- Secondly, there is a gap between the\
    \ research sectors and enterprises, which \nleads to the low application of research\
    \ results into practice; \n- Thirdly, the issue of funding, when applying new\
    \ technology, the first diffi-\nculty often mentioned is the issue of the financing.\
    \ The actual cost is not high, \nbut the price is mainly on the design stage.\
    \ Therefore, farmers can connect to \ntheir farms through smartphones. And since\
    \ then, farmers have been communi-\ncating with the farm through intelligent devices,\
    \ unfamiliar with changing tradi-\ntional farming methods; \n- Fourthly, the issue\
    \ of farmers’ awareness: The main factor in Vietnamese \nagriculture is farmers\
    \ and cooperatives, but the reality shows that they are still \nconfused with\
    \ the application of technology in agriculture. Therefore, it is ne-\ncessary\
    \ to have a companion, buy agricultural products, apply flexible processes \n\
    and technologies to make agricultural products effective, valuable, and of high\
    \ \nquality; \n- Fifthly, there is a lack of ideas when applying IoT in agriculture\
    \ in Vietnam; \ncurrently, mainly uses sensors, programming for irrigation, automatic\
    \ indoor \nhydroponics and is only applied to large-scale enterprises. \nVietnam’s\
    \ agriculture has many advantages, but mainly small-scale produc-\ntion based\
    \ on household economy, labour productivity is still low. Therefore, the \napplication\
    \ of IoT in agriculture will create significant opportunities for farmers \nto\
    \ become businesses with outstanding productivity and value that bring a better\
    \ \nquality of life. \n3.2. Some Directions for IoT Application in Agricultural\
    \  \nDevelopment in Vietnam \nOne of that premises is resolution No. 36-NQ/TW\
    \ of the Politburo (XI term) on \npromoting IT application and development to\
    \ meet the requirements of sus-\ntainable development and international integration,\
    \ issued on 1st July 2014. The \nresolution mentioned building industry and IT\
    \ services ecosystem to meet ex-\nport and domestic markets, supporting the development\
    \ of Vietnamese brand \ntechnology products and services with high intellectual\
    \ content, investing in \nsoftware products research, etc. \nIt is necessary to\
    \ propagate to businesses and cooperatives that understand the \nimportance and\
    \ trends of IoT application in agriculture in the long run. Pro-\nmote the trend\
    \ of IoT and innovation (DDI) for businesses to develop in this di-\nrection.\
    \ The development of the IoT ecosystem is necessary to create a commu-\nnity of\
    \ companies to participate, promote creativity and competition. IoT appli-\ncations\
    \ can only be effectively deployed if the right infrastructure is in place. The\
    \ \nIoT infrastructure has many layers: the transport layer, the underlying IT\
    \ service \nlayer, the data providers and data analytics service providers, and\
    \ finally, the \ncommunity of businesses that develop data mining tools to service\
    \ agencies, or-\nD. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/jss.2022.101015\
    \ \n176 \nOpen Journal of Social Sciences \n \nganizations, and companies. \n\
    In this model, the State plays the role of providing supportive policies and de-\n\
    veloping primary infrastructure layers. The State makes appropriate policies to\
    \ \nencourage businesses and agricultural households to apply IoT technology in\
    \ \nagriculture. It is expected that the State will support the infrastructure\
    \ and initial \npromotion. In addition, there should also be solutions for new\
    \ ideas to be kept \nto express; demonstrate novelty, creativity, and feasibility.\
    \ Another important \nissue is that it is necessary to have a mechanism to ensure\
    \ the rights of inventors \nin the future, especially a strict management mechanism\
    \ for intellectual property. \nOn the side of businesses, farmers with dynamism\
    \ will play an active role in \npromoting IoT development. Moreover, startups\
    \ and innovative companies \nmust prove that their ideas are good, realistic,\
    \ technologically advanced, and \nhighly feasible to receive support from the\
    \ community according to the market \neconomy model. IoT allows us to collect\
    \ a lot of data, but this will become mea-\nningless if we cannot exploit the\
    \ data to make decisions that serve a specific \npurpose. Therefore, we need new\
    \ technology to analyze and process data ac-\ncording to creating innovation based\
    \ on data potential (Data-Driven Innovation \nor DDI). Thus, in the coming time\
    \ and focusing on hardware and software in-\nformation technology services, it\
    \ is necessary to invest in data analysis technol-\nogy, turning data into a resource\
    \ to create a competitive advantage. \nIn recent times, policies to support IoT\
    \ applications in agriculture have been \nincreasingly encouraged and developed\
    \ by agencies and ministries, including the \nMinistry of Information and Communications,\
    \ which has enabled businesses to \npropose IoT initiatives proactively and discuss\
    \ with functional units of the Min-\nistry to be able to come up with specific\
    \ and reasonable policies. The connection \nbetween government agencies, businesses,\
    \ and scientific research is an essential \nfactor in promoting the development\
    \ of information technology. The application \nof IoT in agriculture is more and\
    \ more widespread. \n4. Potential IoT Applications Applied to Agriculture in \
    \ \nVietnam \n4.1. Using IoT for Precision Farming \nPrecision farming is a process\
    \ that makes the farming process more controlled \nand precise for raising livestock\
    \ and growing crops. The key components are the \nuse of IT and feature such as\
    \ sensors, autonomous vehicles, autonomous hard-\nware, control systems, robots,\
    \ etc., in this approach (Figure 1). \nPrecision agriculture in recent years has\
    \ become one of the most well-known \napplications of IoT in the agricultural\
    \ sector, and a lot of organizations have \nstarted using this technique around\
    \ the world. \nThe products and services provided by the IoT system include soil\
    \ moisture \nsensors, VRI optimization (Variable Rate Irrigation), PRO virtual\
    \ optimizer, etc. \nVRI optimization is a process of maximizing profits in crop\
    \ fields irrigated with \nsoil change, thus improving yield and increasing water\
    \ use efficiency. \nD. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/jss.2022.101015\
    \ \n177 \nOpen Journal of Social Sciences \n \n \nFigure 1. The precision agriculture\
    \ model (Image: Internet). \n \nVariable Rate Technology (VRT)—VRT refers to technologies\
    \ that allow in-\nput changes and help farmers control the number of inputs in\
    \ a particular area. \nThe essential components of this technology include a computer,\
    \ software, a \ncontroller, and a differential global positioning system (DGPS).\
    \ There are three \nbasic approaches to using VRT—map-based, sensor-based, and\
    \ manual-based \n(The Future of Manufacturing Is Digital—Predictive Maintenance,\
    \ 2021, De-\ncember 9). \nGPS Soil Sampling—Check the soil properties of an area\
    \ to determine availa-\nble nutrients, pH, and many other types of data necessary\
    \ for making informed \ndecisions and profitability. In essence, soil sampling\
    \ allows farmers to look at \nyield differences in a field and develop a plan\
    \ to consider these differences. Sam-\npling and analysis services are essential,\
    \ allowing data to be used for input with \nvariable factors to optimize seeding\
    \ and fertilization. \nComputer applications—Computer applications can be used\
    \ to create farm \nplans, farming area maps, and yield maps. This allows for more\
    \ precise use of \ninputs such as pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, reducing\
    \ costs, giving high \nyields, and being environmentally friendly. The challenge\
    \ with these software \nsystems is that they sometimes provide only modest value,\
    \ not allowing the data \nto be used to make large-scale agricultural decisions.\
    \ Another concern with \nmany software applications is their poor user interface\
    \ and inability to integrate \nthe information they provide with other data sources\
    \ to give farmers more valu-\nable information. \nIt uses remote sensing technology\
    \ to monitor and manage land, water, and \nother resources. It can help identify\
    \ everything from factors that can strongly af-\nfect a crop at a particular point\
    \ to estimate soil moisture. This data supports de-\ncision-making on the farm\
    \ and can come from various sources, including air-\ncraft and satellites. \n\
    D. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/jss.2022.101015 \n178 \nOpen Journal\
    \ of Social Sciences \n \nThe primary goal of precision agriculture and precision\
    \ agronomy is to ensure \nprofitability, efficiency, and sustainability while\
    \ protecting the environment. \nThis is achieved by using the big data gathered\
    \ from this technology to help \nmake immediate or future decisions on everything\
    \ from different rates for dif-\nferent areas until the best results are achieved:\
    \ chemicals, fertilizers, or seeds. \nToday, with the strong development of technology,\
    \ artificial intelligence in \ndata analysis will effectively support farmers\
    \ in making decisions. Farmers now \nhave access to a lot of data. There’s so\
    \ much data they don’t know what to do \nwith it. AI is capable of analyzing large\
    \ amounts of data in a short time and us-\ning it to recommend the best course\
    \ of action. This information can then be \nused to predict the best time to plant,\
    \ predict pest and disease outbreaks before \nthey happen, and make yield predictions\
    \ before harvest. While AI will never be \nable to replace the kinds of complex\
    \ decisions farmers have to make regularly, it \ncan be used to make those decisions\
    \ easier. \nVietnam is a country with long-standing agriculture but farming in\
    \ individual \nhouseholds. In recent years, the State has had policies on land\
    \ accumulation; \nthere have been large cooperatives and companies engaged in\
    \ high-tech agricul-\nture such as Hoa Phat, Hoang Anh Gia Lai, Vinamilk, and\
    \ TH group, etc. With \ntraditional farming, the efficiency decreases due to climate\
    \ change, bad soil, and \nmany diseases. Since then, the above-listed IoT technologies\
    \ have been applied \nmore and more and have proven their effectiveness. \n4.2.\
    \ Smart Greenhouses (DroneLife, 2020) \nGreenhouse farming is a technique to improve\
    \ the yield of crops, vegetables, tu-\nbers, and fruits (Figure 2). Greenhouses\
    \ control environmental parameters in \ntwo ways: through manual intervention\
    \ or a rate control mechanism. However, \nbecause manual intervention methods\
    \ have disadvantages such as production \ncosts, energy consumption, and labour\
    \ costs, these methods are less effective. An \nintelligent greenhouse through\
    \ IoT embedded systems intelligently monitors \nand controls the climate eliminating\
    \ all need for human intervention. \nVarious sensors that measure the environmental\
    \ parameters required by the \nplant are used to control the environment in the\
    \ innovative greenhouse. A cloud \nserver is then created for remote access to\
    \ the system when it connects using \nIoT. Inside the greenhouse, a cloud server\
    \ helps process data and apply control \nactions. This design provides optimal\
    \ and cost-effective solutions for farmers \nwith minimal manual intervention.\
    \ \nAn example of this is Illumin Greenhouses, an Agriculture Technology green-\n\
    house organization that uses technology and IoT to provide services. It builds\
    \ \nmodern and affordable greenhouses using solar-powered IoT sensors. Green-\n\
    house status and water consumption can be monitored with these sensors by \nsending\
    \ SMS alerts to farmers using an online portal. \nSensors in the IoT system in\
    \ the greenhouse provide information about tem-\nperature, pressure, humidity,\
    \ and light levels. \nD. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/jss.2022.101015\
    \ \n179 \nOpen Journal of Social Sciences \n \n \nFigure 2. Greenhouse covered\
    \ with glass material (Image: internet). \n \nCovering material is one of the\
    \ essential components that cannot be missed \nwhen constructing and installing\
    \ agricultural greenhouses, whether you are just \nmaking a small home rooftop\
    \ model or a large-scale production model. Cur-\nrently, we can use many different\
    \ types of covering materials: plastic film, poly-\ncarbonate, glass or fiberglass.\
    \ The choice of material depends on the investment \nbudget, climate zone, and\
    \ what kind of crops you plan to grow in the green-\nhouse. Each material has\
    \ different advantages and disadvantages. \n- Greenhouses covered with plastic\
    \ film: Plastic film is usually produced \nfrom PE plastic (polyethylene), which\
    \ is considered the most commonly used \nmaterial globally because of its relatively\
    \ low investment cost. Another advan-\ntage of this material is its high light\
    \ diffusion ability, allowing more sunlight to \npass through, helping to promote\
    \ photosynthesis and increase crop yields. This \nmaterial also casts less shade\
    \ because of the limited use of reinforcing materials \n(Agricultural Weight IoT\
    \ Application—4 Best Benefits of Agriculture IoT White \nIoT, 2020, November 30).\
    \ The disadvantage is that the life cycle is short, usually \nabout 4 to 5 years.\
    \ \n- Greenhouses covered with Polycarbonate: Polycarbonate is the newest \ngreenhouse\
    \ material on the market with the characteristic of flat, 2 layers or a \ncorrugated\
    \ layer. It is a stronger material than nylon, the 2-layer type has quite \ngood\
    \ insulation properties, suitable for temperature-sensitive crops. Polycarbo-\n\
    nate has high durability, can withstand adverse weather conditions such as hail\
    \ \nbetter than glass materials. And this material is not affected by UV, air\
    \ pollution \nor agricultural chemicals like PE plastic film can be used for up\
    \ to 10 years \nwithout needing to be replaced. The disadvantage is that the cost\
    \ for this type is \noften higher than glass or polyethylene, and over time this\
    \ type of greenhouse \ncan turn yellow or grow moss affecting the illumination\
    \ of the plants. \n- Greenhouses covered with glass materials: Glass is the most\
    \ ideal material \nfor covering greenhouses due to its significantly better light\
    \ transmission prop-\nD. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/jss.2022.101015\

    \ is also highly durable, fire resistant and unaf-\nfected by air pollution, UV\
    \ rays or agrochemicals. The disadvantage of green-\nhouses is the high cost of\
    \ construction and materials and often broken due to \nsubstantial impacts such\
    \ as hail, complex objects falling. \n- Greenhouses covered with glass fibres:\
    \ glass fibres are also another ma-\nterial frequently used to build agricultural\
    \ greenhouses. This material is cheaper \nthan glass and polycarbonate, and often\
    \ more expensive than polyethylene. \nThanks to its hard nature, this material\
    \ does not need a strong supporting \nstructure like glass, which helps to reduce\
    \ construction costs significantly. The \ndisadvantage of using glass fibre is\
    \ that this material is easily damaged by sun-\nlight, reducing light transmission;\
    \ the material is also flammable and has a short \nlife cycle of about five years.\
    \ \n4.3. Application of Drones in Agriculture \nAgricultural drones are an excellent\
    \ example of IoT applications in agriculture \n(Figure 3). The application of\
    \ drones in agriculture is increasingly popular \nthanks to its relatively low\
    \ cost and ease of application. Today, precision agri-\nculture allows farmers\
    \ to use drones to measure and observe the variety of crops. \nSowing seeds, automated\
    \ crop care, and close monitoring of crop health also \nhelp increase yield and\
    \ profitability (DroneLife, 2020). \nThe benefits of using drones include ease\
    \ of use, time savings, crop health \nimaging, integrated GIS mapping, and increased\
    \ productivity. Drone technology \nwill bring high-tech change to the agriculture\
    \ industry using strategy and plan-\nning based on real-time data collection and\
    \ processing. \nFarmers using drones can enter details of the fields they want\
    \ to survey. Select \nelevation or ground resolution to get data on the areas.\
    \ From the data collected \nby the drones, it is possible to derive valuable and\
    \ detailed information about \nvarious factors such as plant counting, yield prediction,\
    \ plant health index, \nheight trees measurement, coverage mapping, nitrogen content\
    \ in wheat, drai-\nnage mapping, etc. The areas where drones are used are detailed\
    \ below: \n \n \nFigure 3. Using drones in agriculture (Image: Internet). \nD.\
    \ M. Quan, T. T. H. Van \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/jss.2022.101015 \n181 \nOpen Journal\
    \ of Social Sciences \n \n- Planting and Irrigation: Today’s modern planting systems\
    \ can perform si-\nmultaneous seeding and fertilization. The speed and efficiency\
    \ of this method \nare assessed to bring absorption rates up to 75% and cost reductions\
    \ up to 85%. \nThanks to the types of sensors on drones such as heat, spectrum,\
    \ etc., helping \nfarmers quickly identify crops that lack water. Moreover, thanks\
    \ to other tech-\nnology, it can calculate the density and health of plants provide\
    \ heat charts, alert \nfarmers when crops need more or less water. This efficient\
    \ water use is a huge \ncost-saving measure as water costs rise and drought hits\
    \ many areas. Careful ir-\nrigation also reduces other risks such as fertilizers\
    \ flowing into rivers and \nstreams, preventing affecting plant life, etc. \n\
    - Monitoring and assessing crop health: Frequent weather conditions com-\nbined\
    \ with large cultivated areas make it difficult to monitor crops. Using satel-\n\
    lite images gives us low quality and limited use. Today, drones can provide \n\
    low-cost time-series videos, helping us realize production inefficiencies and\
    \ the \nreal-time growth of crops. Using multi-spectral images captured from the\
    \ drone \nsystem, it is possible to monitor the changes of crops and make specific\
    \ recom-\nmendations. This allows farmers to take timely handling measures, especially\
    \ to \nwarn of disease abnormalities that may affect crop yields, etc. \n- Soil\
    \ analysis and weed removal: Thanks to drones, it is possible to build 3D \nmaps\
    \ to help farmers analyze the soil. Once the seeding model is complete, the \n\
    drones can monitor soil quality and provide data on nitrogen levels and irriga-\n\
    tion requirements. Thanks to intelligent AI cameras that can detect weeds to \n\
    adjust the appropriate amount of spray, the effect will be better, and the cost\
    \ of \nuse will be reduced. \n- Spraying: Using drones to spray drugs is increasingly\
    \ popular thanks to its \nsuperior effects on safety, fast and evenly spreading\
    \ impact. A new study shows \nthat drones spray pesticides five times faster than\
    \ traditional methods. Thanks to \nlaser distance measurement technology that\
    \ helps them adjust their altitude on \nall terrains, prevent accidents while\
    \ spraying, etc. Most pesticides are harmful to \nhuman and animal health, leaving\
    \ a severe, even irreversible impact on the en-\nvironment, eventually causing\
    \ significant pollution to the entire ecosystem. \nTherefore, the use of drones\
    \ helps significantly reduce the number of pesticides, \nthereby reducing the\
    \ impact on the environment. \n5. Conclusion \nThe article presents the concept,\
    \ characteristics, need, and trends of IoT applica-\ntions for high-tech agriculture\
    \ today. We offer the remaining problems and dif-\nficulties for IoT applications\
    \ in agriculture in Vietnam and suggest solutions to \npromote the development\
    \ of IoT applications to be more popular and effective. \nThe research has also\
    \ presented several specific and practical IoT applications \nin agriculture in\
    \ the current period, thereby helping managers better orient \nagricultural enterprises\
    \ and cooperatives to use more effectively and complete \nthe proposed solutions.\

    \ \n \nAbstract \nWith the rapid advancement of technology and decline in human\
    \ ability, technology has \nbecome a part of every aspect of our lives. Agriculture\
    \ and irrigation are two domains in \nwhich man's potential may be exploited to\
    \ its fullest. To commercialise in the industry, a \nvariety of sensors and electronics\
    \ devices are employed to keep prices down in a few \ndomains. In order to save\
    \ money and enhance the abilities of agricultural experts, UAVs \n(unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles) can be used for reconnaissance, pesticide and insecticide \napplication,\
    \ and bioprocessing mistake detection. When it comes to this application, both\
    \ \nsingle-mode and multi-mode UAV systems will work just fine. On the other hand,\
    \ this \nchapter identifies the challenges and limitations of IoT and UAVs connection\
    \ in remote \nlocations, demonstrating several use cases of smart agriculture\
    \ and the advantages and \napplications of using IoT and UAVs in agriculture.\
    \ \nX1. Background \nAn increase in the population has enormously augmented the\
    \ burden on the agriculture \nsector. With the beginning of technology, this era\
    \ is observing a shift from conventional \nmethods to the most innovative ones.\
    \ Regardless of the perception people may have about the \nagricultural development,\
    \ the truth is that today's agriculture industry is data-cantered, \naccurate,\
    \ and smarter than ever. The quick development of the Internet-of-Things (IoT)\
    \ based \ntechnologies reformed almost every industry including “smart agriculture”\
    \ which \ntransformed the industry from statistical to quantitative approaches.\
    \ Such radical changes are \ntrembling the present agriculture approaches and\
    \ generating new chances along a variety of \nchallenges. Researchers, research\
    \ institutions, academicians, and most nations across the \nglobe are poignant\
    \ towards the preparation and implementation of collaborative projects to \nexplore\
    \ the horizon of this field for helping manhood. The tech industry is competing\
    \ to \nafford more optimum solutions. Inclusion of IoT, along with cloud computing,\
    \ big data \nanalytics, and wireless sensor networks can offer sufficient possibility\
    \ to predict, process, and \nexamine the circumstances and recover the activities\
    \ in the real-time scenario. The perception \nof heterogeneity and interoperability\
    \ of the devices by providing flexible, ascendable, and \nstrong methods models\
    \ are also maiden new areas in this field.  \nIoT can be used in every mode of\
    \ life: smart cities, smart homes, smart retail and \nmany more. Using IoT in\
    \ agriculture repetitions is the essential of the period, as the global \npopulation\
    \ will knockout a peak of 9.6 billion by 2050, to chance that kind of demand the\
    \ \nagriculture industry desires to supply at an even faster rate. This is completed\
    \ by using \nmodern technology and mainly IoT. IoT makes labour free farms a possibility.\
    \ In not only \nmajor farming practices but also it can also be used in maintaining\
    \ livestock, greenhouse \nfarming, managing farms etc. The most significant apparatus\
    \ used for IoT is Sensors. Sensors \nare devices that collect important data,\
    \ which is taken to get the anticipated analysis. For \nagriculture, sensors are\
    \ mainly used to acquire readings, determine NPK values, and detect \ndiseases\
    \ & moisture content in the soil. Study nad investigation of IOT discovers its\
    \ \napplication in the agricultural sectors. Smart agriculture is called precision\
    \ agriculture as it \npractices exact data to reach conclusions. It displays the\
    \ various sensors, which help IoT and \nagriculture, their applications, challenges,\
    \ advantages and disadvantages. \nTherefore, technology is being involved in every\
    \ stage of our life with the speedy \ntechnological enhancement and decrease in\
    \ human capacity. Agriculture and irrigation are \ntwo fields where man's ability\
    \ can be realized. Various sensors and electronics devices are \nused to commercialize\
    \ in the industry while keeping costs down in a few realms. UAVs \n(unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles) can be used for reconnaissance, pesticide and insecticide \napplication,\
    \ and bioprocessing error detection to save money and improve the skills of \n\
    agricultural professionals. Both single-mode and multi-mode UAV systems are suitable\
    \ for \nuse in this application. The expertise of a single UAV system can be surpassed\
    \ by the right \ncooperation and synchronization of a network of UAV clusters\
    \ attached to ground \ninfrastructures, GCS or satellites. Therefore, the major\
    \ contribution is that the mobility model \nand specifications are the most effective\
    \ routing protocol for each specific agricultural \napplication. \nX2. Introduction\
    \ \nThe word `Agriculture' is contingent from the Latin words `Ager' means `Land'\
    \ and `Culture' \nmeans `Cultivation'. It is the landmark of human development\
    \ and is one of the benchmark \nareas. To progress the agricultural production\
    \ with fewer properties and efforts, extensive \nrevolutions have been prepared\
    \ through human history. Yet, the high population level never \nlet the demand\
    \ and supply match throughout all these times. More than 60% of the human \npopulation\
    \ depends on agriculture for existence and around 12% of the total land area is\
    \ \nunder agricultural production as per consideration of the Food and Agricultural\
    \ Organization \nof the United Nations (FAO) [1]. According to the forecasted\
    \ scenario, in 2050, the world \npopulation is predictable to touch 9.8 billion,\
    \ an upturn of approximately 25% from the \ncurrent situation [2]. Almost the\
    \ whole declared rise of population is predicted to occur \namong the emergent\
    \ countries [3]. Moreover, on the other side, the trend of development in \nurban\
    \ areas is predicted to stay at an accelerated pace, with about 70% of the world's\
    \ \npopulations forecast to be built-up until 2050 [4]. In India, approx. 50%\
    \ of the population is \ndependent on the agriculture region for occupation and\
    \ approx... 61.5 % of the Indian \npopulation is predominantly dependent on the\
    \ agriculture region for its livelihood [5-6].  \nHowever, throughout the last\
    \ few decades, agriculture is experiencing a fourth \nrevolution by assimilating\
    \ Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) in \ntraditional farming [7].\
    \ Technologies, like Big Data Analytics (BDA) and Machine Learning \n(ML), Remote\
    \ Sensing, Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are \nmostly\
    \ auspicious and they can bounce an innovation in agricultural systems [8-9].\
    \ In smart \nfarming, a extensive range of agricultural constraints can be observed\
    \ to expand crop yields, \nto ease costs and improve process inputs, such as environmental\
    \ circumstances, development \nstatus, soil status, irrigation water, pest and\
    \ fertilizers, weed management, and greenhouse \nproduction environment [10].\
    \ Smart farming is a green technology methodology, since it \ndecreases the environmental\
    \ footmark of traditional farming [9]. In precision agriculture, \nsmart irrigation\
    \ and the negligible usage of fertilizers and insecticides in agricultural crops\
    \ \ncan further diminish leaching difficulties and productions, as well as the\
    \ impact of climate \nchange [9], [11]. IoT is one of the most radical technologies\
    \ in contemporary wireless \ncommunications [12]. The basic idea is the communication\
    \ between a variety of physical \nbelongings or objects using specific addressing\
    \ patterns to being connected to the Internet. \nIoT technology can be realistic\
    \ in various vertical markets including transportation, \nhealthcare, industry,\
    \ vehicles, smart home, and agriculture [13]. In an agricultural system, \nIoT\
    \ devices offer useful information on a wide range of physical constraints to\
    \ improve \ncultivation process [10]. The part of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\
    \ in IoT technology is \nof ultimate reputation since the huge majority of IoT\
    \ applications in numerous marketplaces \nis based on wireless data transmission.\
    \  \nThe ubiquitous use of the Internet in the last two decades has provided organisations\
    \ \nand people around the world with unrestricted benefits. The main advantage\
    \ of this \nbreakthrough was the potential to provide real-time production and\
    \ customer services. The \nInternet of Things (IoT) has recently promised to provide\
    \ the same benefits with its \nrevolutionary innovations and to increase customer\
    \ awareness and capabilities by changing \nthe operating environment. In the areas\
    \ of health, shopping, traffic, Défense, intelligent \nhomes, Smart Cities and\
    \ agriculture, IoT offers a number of solutions. In agriculture, IoT \nimplementation\
    \ is seen as the optimal solution, since continuous monitoring and control is\
    \ \nessential in this sector. IoT is seen on a variety of occasions within the\
    \ manufacturing chain \nof agriculture [14]. The framework built is even more\
    \ interesting in dealing with node faults \nand rearranging the weak connectivity\
    \ ties on the network on their own. In [15] an IoT \nmanagement is proposed that\
    \ tracks wind, soil, atmosphere and water elements across a wide \nrange of areas.\
    \ In addition, IoT-based solutions for agricultural surveillance have been \n\
    established based on their subdomains. Sub-domains listed include soil tracking,\
    \ air \nsurveillance, temperature monitoring, water monitoring, disease monitoring,\
    \ location \nsurveillance, environmental monitoring, insect monitoring, and fertilization\
    \ surveillance [16-\n17]. Precision farming, livestock and greenhouses, which\
    \ are clustered under various \nsurveillance areas, are the major applications\
    \ of IoT in agriculture. The wireless sensor \nnetwork (WSN), which helps farmers\
    \ collect relevant data via detectors, is used to track all \nthese applications\
    \ with different IoT-based sensors/devices. Certain IoT-based settings \nanalyse\
    \ and process remote data through cloud providers, helping scientists and farmers\
    \ to \ndecide better. Today, environmental control systems provide additional\
    \ management and \ndecision-making facilities through the development of current\
    \ technologies. A custom \nlandslide Risk Management System has been designed\
    \ to enable fast deployments without \nuser interference in hostile environments\
    \ [18]. Data from various environmental parameters \nare furthermore conveyed\
    \ to the user by warnings or by message to the authorities [19].  \nThe aim of\
    \ smart agriculture is to increase production, yields and profitability and \n\
    minimize the environmental performance through the use of various methods such\
    \ as \neffective irrigation, targeted and accurate use of pesticides and fertilizers\
    \ on crops, etc. The \nevolving internet of objects (IoT) and unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles (UAVs) have made \nsustainable smart farming possible. IoT brings value\
    \ to its data by automated collection, \ninterpretation and access as a major\
    \ technology for intelligent agriculture by ensuring that \ndata flows between\
    \ various devices such as sensors, relays and gateways. This makes \nproduction\
    \ and management processes in smart farms more cost-effective and timely [20].\
    \ \n      In addition, IoT decreases the effects of inherent environment by allowing\
    \ for \nreactions in real time to infestations such as weeds, pest or disease\
    \ identification, weather \ntracking and prevention, soil conditions etc. As a\
    \ result, UAV and IoT technology make it \neasier to adequately exploit commodities\
    \ like water, nutrients or agro-chemicals. Moreover, \nthe qualities of crop yield\
    \ and environmental impacts from agriculture have been improved \nwith these intelligent\
    \ technologies. Since some of the main characteristics of IoT and UAV-\nbased\
    \ smart farming are [21-23]: \na. Field monitoring: Smart agriculture aims to\
    \ reduce crop waste by improved \nsurveillance, precise data collection and data\
    \ analysis. \nb. Smart farming aims to detect the place of animals that graze\
    \ in open areas in large \nstables. Views and tracking: Technology also helps\
    \ assess the air quality and \nventilation condition of farms and identifies toxic\
    \ excrement gasses. \nc.  Greenhouse applications: Smart agriculture monitors\
    \ micro-climate conditions with \nthe goal of improving fruit and vegetables production\
    \ and quality in green houses. \nd. Biomass management: Smart farming helps to\
    \ regulate humidity and temperature in \ncrops like straw, grass, etc. as a measure\
    \ for avoiding fungus and other microbial \npollutants. \ne. Biomass management:\
    \ Smart farming helps to regulate humidity and temperature in \ncrops like straw,\
    \ grass, etc. as a measure for avoiding fungus and other microbial \npollutants.\
    \ \nf. Offspring Care: Intelligent breeding regulates the raising conditions and\
    \ wellbeing of \noffspring in animal farms. \n      Moreover, the applications\
    \ of UAVs are varied, including areas related to inhabitant, \nmilitary, commercial,\
    \ and governmental sectors [13-18]. Examples contain environmental \nmonitoring\
    \ (e.g., pollution, health of plants, and industrial accidents) in the civilian\
    \ sector. In \nmilitary and governmental zones, the UAVs are used for surveillance\
    \ and delivery \napplications pointing to obtain information at locations after\
    \ a disaster or outbreak, and to \ndistribute medicine or other essential items.\
    \ Commercial applications are absorbed on \ntransporting products and goods both\
    \ in urban and rural areas. UAVs, subsequently they are \ndependent on sensors,\
    \ antennas, and embedded software, are considered as part of the IoT, \nobtaining\
    \ a two-way communication for applications associated to remote control and \n\
    monitoring [19]. The  IoT creates a quickly emergent cutting-edge environment\
    \ in which the \nprincipal concept lies in the orchestration of a large range\
    \ of smart objects in such a way that \nthese can be exploited and activated globally,\
    \ either directly by users or by special software \nthat captures behaviour and\
    \ ideas. IoT allows objects to develop active participants of \neveryday activities,\
    \ with abundant promising applications through various communication \ntechnologies\
    \ in the background of the “smart-city” vision [20]. It is projected that around\
    \ 30 \nbillion uniquely recognizable objects are expected to be part of this global\
    \ community by \n2022. These forecasts are expected to significantly rise with\
    \ the introduction of 5G \ntechnologies with UAVs. \nThe goal of UAVs, on the\
    \ other hand, is to provide more perspectives such as imaging \nanalysis and agricultural\
    \ surveillance in intelligent farming [24]. UAVs not only promote \nimage analysis\
    \ and agricultural field processing, but also enable a thorough awareness of the\
    \ \nsituation by patrolling a field of interest [25]. In addition, UAVs can be\
    \ used to provide the \ngrounded tracking stations with valuable information through\
    \ data transmission. In several \nagricultural areas the uses of UAV are extended,\
    \ including the prospecting and spraying of \ninsecticides and fertilizers, seed\
    \ planting, weakening identification, fertility evaluation, \nmapping and planting.\
    \ These recent advances in intelligent IoT and UAV-based agriculture \nhelp the\
    \ world achieve the '2030 Sustainable Development Agenda' priorities, where United\
    \ \nNations (UN) and international communities are setting the goal of eliminating\
    \ hunger by \n2030 [26]. \nX.3. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) \nUnmanned Aerial\
    \ Vehicle is a low-cost substitute element in sensing technology and data \nanalysis\
    \ method in the latest years. Fundamentally, remote sensing by electromagnetic\
    \ energy \nmeasures the belongings of targeted object from a distance and has\
    \ the advantages of \ncomprehensiveness, non-invasiveness, timeliness, and flexibility.\
    \ However, remote sensing \ndetermine soil properties in the farmhouse is far\
    \ away from actual data for the complex \nnatures of remote sensing, agricultural\
    \ production and soils [27-29]. According to \nresearchers, UAV can be a choice\
    \ to gather accurate data in the field. It had been recognized \nas a possible\
    \ technology that can produce high spatial resolution imagery (< 1m) and at \n\
    temporal frequency suitable for timely responses in the creation of actionable\
    \ information \nabout crop and field status [30]. The small UAV fits to Low Altitude\
    \ Remote Sensing \n(LARS), which is less as expensive compared to conventionally\
    \ manned aircraft is possibly \none of the main reason why the UAV production\
    \ had been exceeding the market demand \n[31]. \nAlthough, an Unmanned Aerial\
    \ Vehicle (UAV) is a kind of aircraft that works \nwithout a human pilot on-board.\
    \ There are dissimilar types of UAVs engaged for different \npurposes. Originally,\
    \ the technology was engaged by the military for anti-aircraft target \npractice,\
    \ intelligence congregation and surveillance of some enemy territories. The \n\
    technology has though grown beyond its primary purpose and in recent years has\
    \ increased \nimportance in different spheres of human effort. A progression in\
    \ technology has permitted \nfor the augmented adaptation of unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ for several purposes. Without an \non-board pilot, UAVs are organized either\
    \ remotely by a pilot at a ground station or \nseparately, steered by a pre-programmed\
    \ flight plan. There is a enormous potential for the \napplication of UAVs in\
    \ Agriculture [32]. One such application is in accurate and evidence-\nbased forecasting\
    \ of farm produce using spatial data collected by the UAV. UAVs also \npermit\
    \ farmers to detect their fields from the sky. This sky-view can expose many problems\
    \ \non the farm, common among which is irrigation related problems, soil variations,\
    \ fungal and \npest infestations. Moreover, information connecting to water access,\
    \ varying climate, wind, \nsoil feature, the occurrence of weeds and insects,\
    \ flexible growing seasons, and more can all \nbe observed with UAVs. From a livestock\
    \ perspective, UAVs are being used to accomplish \nhead counts, observing animals\
    \ and reviewing eating habits and health related patterns. \nUtilizing the information\
    \ gathered, farmers can provide fast and efficient solutions for \ndetecting problems\
    \ and issues, make better administration decisions, recover farm \nproductivity,\
    \ and ultimately produce higher revenue [33-34]. \nThe advantages of UAV are,\
    \ it can detention the pictures of the farmer’s crop with a \nvariation of camera\
    \ filters that can offer the farmers with multiple spectral imaging, sanction\
    \ \nthe image processing and investigation, which gives better information regarding\
    \ their crop’s \nhealth and at the same time recognising areas of the crops that\
    \ involve specific forms of \nattention. The small UAV can be easily hovered and\
    \ preserved with little training, production \nit a great choice for farmers watching\
    \ to development their farming by merging agriculture by \nthe knowledge of remote\
    \ sensing [33-35].  \nX.4. Types of UAV \nMultiple principles can be used to achieve\
    \ an unmanned aerial vehicles classification [8], \nsuch as size, Maximum Take-off\
    \ Weight (MTOW), range etc. Moreover, these will be \nconsidered where UAV flight\
    \ regulation is examined. The classification has been prepared \nwith the wing\
    \ type and autonomy level that could be the most appropriate standards in \nagricultural\
    \ missions [36-39]. \nAccording to the category of wing, two main sets can be\
    \ observed: rotary and fix \nwings. The first group is prepared up of helicopters\
    \ and multi-rotor (usually known as \ndrones). The airflow is formed by numerous\
    \ rotors that produce the suitable trust for lifting. \nTheir main advantage is\
    \ the capacity to achieve hovering flights, which is applicable to aerial \nphotography\
    \ since it permits increasing the capture time for the cameras and therefore \n\
    reimburse poor light situations. Moreover, the airflow demonstrations great performance\
    \ at \nlow speeds and agree low altitude flights with minimum risk. Multi-rotors\
    \ have converted to \nmore popular owing to their mechanical ease in contrast\
    \ to helicopters, which rely on a much \nmore refined plate control mechanism.\
    \ Therefore, the multi-rotor flight is observed just by \nchangeable the velocity\
    \ of several direct current (DC) motors, without any mechanical \nmoving machinery,\
    \ in difference to helicopters. Moreover, the reduction in price of brushless\
    \ \nmotors, which need no maintenance, as well as their electronic supervisors,\
    \ has made them an \ninexpensive resolution for multiple responsibilities in civil\
    \ applications. Owing to this, a \nsignificant number of drone producers have\
    \ appeared in the market for providing a wide \nrange of systems. The main inadequacy\
    \ of commercial drones is their inferior payload \ncapability in comparison with\
    \ helicopters. But, drone manufacturers have augmented the \nnumber of rotors\
    \ from 4 to 6 or 8 consequently as to decrease this gap and presently drones \n\
    with a maximum payload proficiency of 22 kg [40-43] are presented on the market.\
    \ Not only \ndoes payload capacity rise with the number of rotors, but there is\
    \ similarly an development in \nsafety, subsequently the aircraft typically is\
    \ capable to fly in depreciate mode when one or \neven more rotors is under failure,\
    \ permitting for arrival in a safe method. Alternatively, fixed \nwing aircraft,\
    \ like planes, require generating airflow to boost by moving their aerodynamic\
    \ \nsurfaces (wings and ailerons) at high velocity. Consequently, the aircrafts\
    \ are not able to \nexecute static flights. Subsequently the velocity cannot be\
    \ decreased in the same way as \nrotary wings, they usually involve higher altitude\
    \ to achieve safe flights. Further, the \nmanoeuvrability exposed by rotary wings\
    \ (e.g., instant rotations on vertical axis) is a \nabundant advantage over those\
    \ with fixed wings. The maximum range for a secure wing \naircraft can stretch\
    \ is higher than rotary wings, owing to legal guidelines for flying UAVs, it \n\
    does not develop a real benefit in most of the circumstances, and even nevertheless\
    \ for the \nmost part, the aircrafts exhibit a advanced payload capacity. Therefore,\
    \ the analysis agreed \nthat rotary wings aircrafts are mostly favoured for agricultural\
    \ responsibilities than those with \nfixed wings. \nX.5. IoT for smart agriculture\
    \ \nSmart agriculture is a contemporary farming concept with IoT technology to\
    \ rise the \nproductivity in agriculture. Using smart farming, farmers can successfully\
    \ use fertilizers and \nother resources to escalation the quality and quantity\
    \ of their crops. Farmers cannot be \ncontemporary on the field 24 hours a day.\
    \ Moreover, the farmers could not have the \ninformation to usage different apparatuses\
    \ to measure the ideal ecological conditions for their \ncrops. IoT offers them\
    \ with the automatic system, which can function deprived of any human \ndirection\
    \ and can inform them to make proper conclusion to deal with different kind of\
    \ \ndifficulties they might face during farming. It has the ability to spread\
    \ and inform the farmer \neven if farmer is not on the ground, which can allow\
    \ farmer to achieve more farmland, thus \ncultivating their production. it was\
    \ estimated that the universal population will extent 9 \nbillion mark by 2050\
    \ [1-5]. Therefore, IoT applications are must for farming to nourish such \nlarge\
    \ population and efficiently use the farmland and other possessions, as they are\
    \ scarcely \navailable in some places. For Global warming, random weather situations\
    \ is affecting the \ncrops and farmers are facing losses thus the IoT Smart Farming\
    \ application will allow them \nto take quick actions to avoid that from happening\
    \ [44-51].  \nHowever, There are some significant constituents of Agricultural\
    \ IoT (AIoT), such as \nsensor equipped devices, internet connectivity, wireless\
    \ communication technology, sensed \nand transmitted data, etc. The wireless communication\
    \ technology shows an essential role in \nthe effective arrangement of IoT systems,\
    \ which can be characterized based on transmission \ndistance, spectrum, and application\
    \ scenarios. As shown in Fig X.1, the construction of IoT is \nmainly based on\
    \ three layers; namely, the Physical layer where the sensing is done, the \nnetwork\
    \ layer which contracts with data transfer, and the application layer where storage\
    \ of \ndata and data manipulation are observed [46]. \n \nFig X.1. IoT architecture\
    \ \nX.5.1. Physical Layer \nThe physical layer comprises of several terminal devices,\
    \ camera, sensors, Wireless Sensor \nNetworks (WSN), Radio Frequency Identification\
    \ (RFID) labels and readers, Near Field \nCommunications (NFC) devices, etc. [52].\
    \ For this layer, sensors are used to assemble \ninformation about wind speed,\
    \ temperature, humidity, nutrient level, plant diseases, insect \npests, etc.\
    \ The composed information is being managed by the embedded devices and is \n\
    uploaded to a higher layer for additional processing and investigation. This terminal\
    \ devices \nand sensors are recycled to monitor, control, and recognize agricultural\
    \ and livestock goods. \nFor example, WSNs are regularly used for controlling\
    \ and monitoring of storage and logistics \nservices [52]. Further, on the other\
    \ side, RFID technologies are the most vital pattern for \ninterconnected devices.\
    \ RFID tags are used to store data by Electronic Product Code (EPC), \nwhich are\
    \ then read, activated and operated by RFID Readers. Therefore, by contribution\
    \ the \nobject identification, tracking, monitor, control, and data storage on\
    \ active or passive devices; \nWSN, RFID and NFC technologies are used to play\
    \ a significant role in the agricultural \ndomain.  \nX.5.2. Network Layer \n\
    In the network layer, the sensors and devices are essential for connection with\
    \ the adjacent \nnodes and a gateway in order to construct a network. At this\
    \ layer, the sensor nodes co-\noperate and interconnect with other nodes and gateways\
    \ within a network for forwarding data \ntowards a remote structure; where the\
    \ data are kept, further investigated, handled and \ndispersed for useful information\
    \ [53].   \nX.5.3. Application Layer \nThe uppermost level of the IoT architecture\
    \ is the application layer, where the assistances and \nadvantages of IoT are\
    \ outward. There are heaps of bright stages or systems in this layer to \ncontrol\
    \ and observe the soil condition, water and nutrition level, plants and animals.\
    \ These \nlayers also used to support the initial warning and organisation of\
    \ diseases and insect pests, \ninfestation and agricultural creation safety controllability;\
    \ as an outcome, manufacturing \nefficiency can be enhanced \nX.6. Communication\
    \ technologies used in IOT based smart agriculture \nWireless protocols and standards\
    \ fixed the procedure for wireless communication. For \nexample, IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ is a wireless standard, which is used to allow the connection \nbetween internet-enabled\
    \ gateways and end-nodes. Further, the other examples are ZigBee, \nSigfox, EC-GSM,\
    \ ONE-NET, Wireless HART, ISA100.11a, LoRaWAN, Bluetooth Low \nEnergy (BLE), DASH7,\
    \ etc. [54]. These standards are classified in terms of transmission \nranges,\
    \ which are shown in figure [55]: \n \nFig. X. 2.: Classification of Communication\
    \ Technologies for IOT based smart agriculture \nFor short-distance wireless communication\
    \ applications, IEEE 802.15.4-based protocols are \nthe ideal choice [53], which\
    \ is projected for Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs). It \nuses a data rate\
    \ between 20 kbps to 250 kbps, works on different frequency bands like 433 \n\
    MHz, 868 MHz, 915 MHZ and 2.4 GHz; and helps a maximum outdoor Line of Sight (LoS)\
    \ \nrange of 100 m [56]. On the conflicting, IEEE 802.11 standard are appropriate\
    \ for \napplications, which are essential for medium range connectivity. Further,\
    \ IEEE 802.11p is \nanother choice for incorporate situations with a high mobility\
    \ condition. This specific issue \nseems to be of large attention in agriculture\
    \ circumstances because of its large \ncommunication range, maximum legal transmission\
    \ power of 1W, and the less interfered \nband of 5.9 GHz ISM frequency [50]. When\
    \ coverage is concerned, long- distance \ncommunication technologies are the only\
    \ dependable and anticipated solutions. Cellular \ncommunication technologies\
    \ such as 3G, 4G, LTE, and 5G are most appropriate and a \ndependable standard\
    \ for precision agriculture, where a big quantity real-time data \nrequirements\
    \ for transmission and processing [57]. Further, the 5G communication \ntechnology\
    \ is predictable for providing real-time Device to Device (D2D) communication,\
    \ \nwhich will allow vehicle location. Moreover, a enormous amount of devices\
    \ can be \nmaintained per square kilometer [58]. In contrast to LTE, 5G can activate\
    \ on advanced \nfrequency bands, and therefore can work on wider channel bandwidths.\
    \ Mainly in rural areas, \n5G communication technology may allow new abilities\
    \ on farm apparatus by contribution of \nhigher data rates and larger transmission\
    \ range under the model of real-time connectivity. \nHowever, the obtainability\
    \ of the cellular network and the economic possibility of 5G \ntechnology in rural\
    \ areas is a questionable distress.  \nIEEE 802.11ah and LoRa/ LoRaWAN are the\
    \ most consistent among long distance \ncommunication technologies of IoT. Moreover,\
    \ the first one is an alteration of the IEEE \n802.11 family, which was available\
    \ in 2017 to help IoT setups such as smart monitoring [50]. \nIt uses 900 MHz\
    \ bands, and delivers wider coverage distance and uses lower energy as \ncompared\
    \ to IEEE 802.15.4. It delivers connectivity to thousands of strategies with a\
    \ single \naccess point up for a radius of one-kilometer. On the conflicting,\
    \ LoRaWAN is another most \nauspicious LPWAN specifications projected for a system\
    \ of battery-operated wireless nodes.  \n \nFig X.3. End to end communication\
    \ for smart farming [44] \nCellular communication approaches from 2G to 4G can\
    \ be appropriate, dependent on \nthe purpose and bandwidth necessity; however,\
    \ the dependability, and even accessibility, of a \ncellular network in rural\
    \ areas is a main apprehension. To overcome this, data transmission \nthrough\
    \ satellite is another choice, but, here, the price of this communication method\
    \ is very \nhigh, which creates it not appropriate for small- and medium-sized\
    \ farms. The superior of \ncommunication mode also be contingent on application\
    \ requirements, like some farms require \nsensors that can activate with low data\
    \ rate but necessity to work for long periods therefore \nrequires long battery\
    \ life. For such situations, a new choice of Low Power Wide Area \nNetwork (LPWAN)\
    \ is selected as a better resolution for cellular connectivity, not only in \n\
    positions of long battery life but also in positions of a larger connectivity\
    \ choice with \nreasonable rates [59]. Presently, crop and pasture management\
    \ are the key applications where \nLPWAN networks are highly appropriate, where\
    \ it can be exploited in many other farming-\nrelated usages. \nFurther, for farming\
    \ UAVs, the Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink) is a shared \ncommunication etiquette\
    \ permitting UAVs to communicate with Ground Control Station \n(GCS). It interconnects\
    \ between calculating platform, monitoring platform of UAV and \napplications\
    \ platform of GCS [60]. MAVLink is used to transmit directions, location of \n\
    global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and velocity of the UAV. The communication\
    \ \nspace between the UAV and the GCS depends on conditions of the UAV. Conversely,\
    \ it can \nconnect up to 2 km when the UAV is inside LOS [61]. Presently, UAVs\
    \ are planned to work \nat return-to-launch mode, which allows the UAVs to return\
    \ automatically to its first position \nwhen communication is disturbed. This\
    \ method is triggered to stop unwanted accidents or \nloss of UAVs [47,62-63].\
    \ Few additional types of communication systems are also accessible \nfor communicating\
    \ between GCS and UAVs like ZigBee, radio-frequency modules, and \nother communicating\
    \ devices. The communication range can be improved with use of \nadditional technologies,\
    \ including phone apps. Furthermore, the appearance of 5G cellular \ntechnology\
    \ abilities to greatly recover infrastructures and data-processing speeds, which\
    \ will \nbe valuable for high-definition plotting [64-65].  \nX.7. UAV for smart\
    \ agriculture \nNow a day, the IoT system has prepared remarkable progress in\
    \ many industries, comprising \nfarming regions. but when taking on agriculture,\
    \ the communication amenities like base \nstations or Wi-Fi are very inadequate,\
    \ which inhibits the development of the IoT in this \nsector. Such communication\
    \ arrangement and associated amenities are even worst in \nemerging counties and\
    \ rural areas, which is one of the main steeplechases when presenting \nthe IoT\
    \ in the agriculture industry. The data developed by the wireless sensors cannot\
    \ be \ncommunicated in the absence of reliable communication arrangement. In such\
    \ a situation, \nUAVs make an alternate way for this purpose. The UAV system connects\
    \ with the wireless \nsensors range over large extents in order to produce data\
    \ for advance processing and \ninvestigation. One of the best valuable revolutions\
    \ of smart agriculture are the robots, among \nwhich, UAV, also entitled drones,\
    \ have been broadly applied [48, 66]. Drones or UAVs are \nbeing extensively used\
    \ by agriculturalists for farm development observing and controlling. \nSome of\
    \ UAVs are being cast-off to spray water, other insecticides powerfully in the\
    \ rough \nlands were human movement is not easy, and the crops retain dissimilar\
    \ heights.  \nAdditionally, UAVs, better acknowledged as drones, fixed with high-resolution\
    \ \ncameras and exact sensors, can be hovered over thousands of hectares of farms.\
    \ The role of \ninvestigation in all agriculture applications is extremely serious,\
    \ particularly in forestry and \ncrop observing for necessary to cover large zones\
    \ [67]. Consequently, a fast, low-cost, actual, \nand extensive surveillance maintained\
    \ with an exact data attainment and broadcast facility is \nvital for agriculture\
    \ manufacture. Presently, mostly two choices are used to find aerial images \n\
    of a field or farm zone: satellite and airplanes. Both of the choices are decent\
    \ for a macro \nview of scenery, but the choices face severe problems related\
    \ to their quality when it comes \nto PC views. These images are not decent in\
    \ resolution and cannot provide quality of the \nimage, which is mandatory throughout\
    \ the investigation. Furthermore, the visiting frequency \nalso face problems\
    \ and it is not easy to collect images frequently. Moreover, another severe \n\
    problem is that these control beyond the cloud level where there is a solid probability\
    \ that \nboth are congested in bad climate. \n \nFig X.4. Different types of agricultural\
    \ UAVs [47] \nHowever, UAVs is a platform which provides an ``eye in sky'', that\
    \ overcome or \nremove the above stated problems related to the micro views. The\
    \ value of images occupied \nthrough UAVs depends on the involved cameras resolution\
    \ usually many times improved \nthan satellite pictures and, most significantly,\
    \ regulates according to application desires. More \nspecifically, UAVs maintenances\
    \ faster and better NDVI to assess crop circumstances like \nweed mapping, leaf\
    \ assessments, etc., and offer instant response to the farmers for timely \nmovements.\
    \ Correspondingly, UAVs are enhanced in terms of frequency, even if desires \n\
    multiple times in a single day, and affects by weather conditions, unless it is\
    \ raining. Owing \nto the stated advantages, UAVs are chosen as the future of\
    \ precision agriculture. \nNot only incalculability, but in certain applications\
    \ of insecticide and fertilizer, UAVs \nrequirement to transport heavy payloads.\
    \ Therefore, in such situations, optimum battery \nconsumption becomes vital to\
    \ spread the flight time. For this resolution, many parameters can \nbe measured\
    \ to enhance the drone efficiency. Initially, when flying, select right conditions\
    \ \ne.g. climate or air direction. Succeeding, attempt to comprise optimum payload\
    \ and place it \nproperly. For this condition, it can be supportive to attribute\
    \ the payload near the field, \nimproved in smaller numbers and refilling again\
    \ in its place for putting heavy quantities. \nMoreover, depending on area size\
    \ and visiting frequency, optimum path choice shows a \nserious role. For this\
    \ resolution, many routing arrangements like [259], [260] are projected \nparticularly\
    \ for the UAVs so selecting and realizing the right arrangement can deliver clear\
    \ \nmodification. As the application of pesticide and UAV based agriculture where\
    \ drone \nessential to fly with weighty payloads then new actions like tethering\
    \ system can be \nsupportive. In UAV tethering, a assembly that offer power through\
    \ the long cable, is \ndelivered so that it can wing as long as the farmers have\
    \ power backup on the field, most \nsignificantly it doesn't need to lift heavy\
    \ batteries. Presently, agriculture is actuality \nconsidered one of the most\
    \ approving fields where UAVs can propose many solutions to \nresolution many\
    \ leading and long-lasting problems. Some of important applications in which \n\
    drones are already playing important roles to support farmers through the system\
    \ model are \nhighlighted below. \nX.8. Applications of IoT and UAV in Smart Agriculture\
    \ through system model \nIoT and UAVs can be employed in many application areas\
    \ of smart agriculture. This section \ndeliberates some applications of IOT and\
    \ UAV in smart agriculture through system model.  \nI. \nSmart crop monitoring\
    \ \nCrop monitoring states the appropriate sensing of different constraints of\
    \ a farm. Automatic \nobserving is one of the introductory features of smart agriculture.\
    \ Advantageously positioned \nsensors can spontaneously sense and convey data\
    \ to a gateway for supplementary \ninvestigation and controlling. Sensors are\
    \ used to control crop constraints such as leaf area \nindex [68], plant height,\
    \ colour, shape, size of leaves [69] etc. IOT and UAV are also \nconvenient in\
    \ controlling soil moisture [70-71]; agriculture water constraints like pH level\
    \ \n[72]; and also climate parameters like wind speed, wind direction, rainfall,\
    \ radiation, air \npressure, temperature, relative humidity, , etc. [73-74]. Additionally,\
    \ remote sensing is also \npresence very efficiently. Owing to the trivial of\
    \ sensors, remote sensors are connected in \nlower altitude UAVs and therefore\
    \ can control crops efficiently and cost-effectively. Thus, \nhigh-resolution\
    \ records are being achieved by removing different types of unnatural condition\
    \ \nlike weather condition.  \nII. Smart pest management \nUsually, the pest management\
    \ depends on three features: sensing, evaluating, and treatment. \nThe advanced\
    \ infection and pest appreciation methods are established on image processing\
    \ in \nwhich raw pictures are developed through the crop zone using UAVs, or remote\
    \ sensing \nsatellites. Typically, remote sensor protections large extents and,\
    \ henceforth, provide higher \nproductivity with lower cost. On the other pointer,\
    \ UAV IOT sensors are accomplished to \nmaintenance more functions in assembling\
    \ data, like environment sampling, plant health, and \npest situations, in each\
    \ angle through the crop series. For illustration, IoT-based computerised \ntraps\
    \ can capture, count, and illustrate insect types, additional uploading statistics\
    \ to the \nCloud for comprehensive investigation, which is not possible through\
    \ remote sensing. \nIII. Smart irrigation \nAgricultural UAVs fixed with cameras\
    \ have the ability to providing wonderful perceptions \ninto exact concerned zones\
    \ in the field. Using the cameras, the farmers are capable to regulate \nthe areas\
    \ of low soil moisture, dehydrated crops, and waterlogged zones and in overall\
    \ have a \nintellect of the overall health eminence of crops in the farm. Such\
    \ exact observing were either \nnot likely with traditional farming, inadequately\
    \ completed or enormously expensive as \nspecialists have to be contracted to\
    \ convey the task and obtain satisfactory solutions. \nHowever, presently UAVs\
    \ contribute the farmers for provide extra benefit to organize these \nthemselves.\
    \ \nIV. Livestock monitoring (Animal Husbandry) \n \nLivestock monitoring is nowadays\
    \ very tough part of agriculture, which engage a very large \nnumber of labor\
    \ efficiency, which cause drawback of cost effectiveness. In this IOT enable \n\
    5g drone it is possible to take remotely surveillance on livestock monitoring.\
    \ Unmanned \nAerial Vehicle (UAV) as a tool of farming has attracted the interests\
    \ of an increasing number \nof researchers. In this paper, we study the problem\
    \ of deploying a group of UAVs to track \nand monitor the livestock such as cattle\
    \ and sheep in a pasture. We assume all targeted \nanimals have been fitted with\
    \ GPS collars, and the mobility of each targeted animal cannot be \nignored. We\
    \ further assume the number of UAVs is sufficient for covering the entire pasture,\
    \ \nand we aim to find the optimal UAVs’ deployment for minimizing the average\
    \ UAV- animal \ndistance. We first introduce a procedure of performing sweep coverage\
    \ by UAVs. By \ndeploying UAVs to achieving sweep coverage for the entire pasture,\
    \ the initial locations of \nall targeted animals can be acquired. Then, determine\
    \ and update the UAVs’ deployment by \nstreaming k-means clustering based on the\
    \ initial locations and received updated locations \nfrom the GPS collars. \n\
    V. Forecasting \nForecasting is the main features of smart agriculture that provide\
    \ real-time data and historical \ndata to estimate and calculate some important\
    \ parameters. Scientific demonstrating and \nmachine learning are samples of apparatuses,\
    \ which are working for forecasting. UAV \nprovides different machine learning\
    \ models like the regression model for approximating \nphosphorus amount in the\
    \ soil [75], forecasting moisture of soil or detection of plant disease \n[76],\
    \ Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting temperatures of the filed [77]; etc.\
    \ \nX.8.1. System model \nInternet of Things is the emerging cutting-edge technology,\
    \ which is dealing with different \nmultidisciplinary Engineering framework for\
    \ domestic or commercial Automation library. If \nwe consider 3 Gateways as such\
    \ gateway1, gateway2, gateway3… If we follow OSI model \nover here network layers\
    \ are to be more concentrated. Three gateways are enough to optimize \nthe network\
    \ traffic for user to UAV band and vice versa. After sensing data transmitted\
    \ \nthrough gateway to online cloud server and from the client machine (mobile,\
    \ tablet, \ncomputer) it may be accessed through different portal with real-time\
    \ readings. \n \nFig X.5. System model \nX.9. Conclusion \nThis chapter demonstrate\
    \ different use cases of smart agriculture, the advantages and \napplication of\
    \ employing IoT and UAVs in agriculture, the numerous communication \ntechnologies\
    \ and recognizes the problems and restrictions of connectivity of IoT and UAVs\
    \ \nin remote areas. The chapter outlined the connectivity restrictions in terms\
    \ of communication \ntechnology and transmission range. Moreover, the chapter\
    \ demonstrate the application of IOT \nand UAV for  smart agriculture through\
    \ system model. \nReferences \n1. Zavatta G (2014) Agriculture Remains Central\

    The scientiﬁc ﬁeld of urban climatology has long investigated the two-way interactions

    between cities and their overlying atmosphere through in-situ observations and
    climate

    simulations at various scales. Novel research directions now emerge through recent

    advancements in sensing and communication technologies, algorithms, and data

    sources. Coupled with rapid growth in computing power, those advancements augment

    traditional urban climate methods and provide unprecedented insights into urban

    atmospheric states and dynamics. The emerging ﬁeld introduced and discussed here
    as

    Urban Climate Informatics (UCI) takes on a multidisciplinary approach to urban
    climate

    analyses by synthesizing two established domains: urban climate and climate informatics.

    UCI is a rapidly evolving ﬁeld that takes advantage of four technological trends
    to answer

    contemporary climate challenges in cities: advances in sensors, improved digital

    infrastructure (e.g., cloud computing), novel data sources (e.g., crowdsourced
    or big

    data), and leading-edge analytical algorithms and platforms (e.g., machine learning,
    deep

    learning). This paper outlines the history and development of UCI, reviews recent

    technological and methodological advances, and highlights various applications
    that

    beneﬁt from novel UCI methods and datasets.

    1 INTRODUCTION

    From Thermometers to Big Data: The Rise of Urban Climate

    Informatics

    Rapid urbanization is one of the deﬁning features of the 21st century with substantial
    global

    environmental impact compounded by climate change (Georgescu et al., 2013; Krayenhoff

    et al., 2018; Masson et al., 2020b; Zhao et al., 2021). In cities, the combined
    effects of

    population growth and climatic changes threaten urban livability through urban
    overheating

    (Nazarian et al., under review), hazardous air quality (Chapman S. et al., 2017;
    Broadbent

    et al., 2020), increased energy consumption, and extreme weather (Willems et al.,
    2012) (Li

    et al., 2020b) with widespread health, socioeconomic, and ecological impacts.
    In response to

    these challenges, numerous subﬁelds of urban climatology have evolved over the
    last century

    to carefully document, examine, and model urban climate at various scales.

    PERSPECTIVE

    published: 02 May 2022

    doi: 10.3389/fenvs.2022.867434

    Sensors and observational methods have traditionally been

    developed to assess built environment impacts on local air

    temperature (Stewart, 2019) and quantify intra- and inter-

    urban variability in the urban canopy layer (Núñez-Peiró

    et al., 2021; Potgieter et al., 2021). Early weather and climate

    observations were motivated by pragmatic needs, e.g., to support

    agriculture or shipping, while the invention of the thermometer

    and the barometer in the early 17th century enabled systematic

    recording of weather conditions. In the late 18th century, the

    Societas Meteorologica Palatina established an observational

    network of calibrated instruments and an observation protocol

    (“Mannheimer Stunden”), which enabled scientiﬁc climatic

    studies. The approach aimed to encourage collaborative data

    collection by providing calibrated sensors at no cost (Neves

    et al., 2017). Although participation was limited to academic

    institutions and companies, the philosophy resonates with

    modern crowdsourcing and citizen science projects. Synoptic

    weather analysis required real-time data exchange, which

    became possible 50 years later with the invention of the

    telegraph. The ﬁrst weather map with data from 22 stations

    was displayed at the World Exhibition in London in 1851.

    Temperature maps became widely available with advances in

    thermal remote sensing, which provides high-resolution surface

    temperature distributions (Voogt and Oke, 2003; Zhan et al.,

    2013; Stewart et al., 2021). In the 20th century, advancements in

    aviation permitted unprecedented atmospheric 3D observations,

    and in 1960, the launch of the ﬁrst weather satellite TIROS

    (Television and InfraRed Observation Satellite) opened a new

    age of meteorology.

    Technological progress has also impacted the ﬁeld of urban

    climatology.

    While

    research

    in

    the

    early

    20th

    century

    concentrated on Europe and was mostly descriptive, rapidly

    increasing computational power in the late 20th and early 21st

    century signiﬁcantly advanced quantitative and systematic

    scientiﬁc approaches in the Anglo-American realm (Mills,

    2014). Numerical and climate modeling at building to regional

    scales produced urban climate parameters at high spatial and

    temporal resolution/coverage and facilitated what-if analyses

    (Hamdi et al., 2020). At the same time, model outputs and

    their availability to the research community increased with

    computing and storage capacity.

    Most certainly, big and ﬁne-resolution urban datasets have

    rapidly evolved with transmission rates exceeding 0.1 Petabyte

    per day (Reichstein et al., 2019). This trend was driven by

    increased availability, accuracy, and resolution of sensors and

    datasets as well as changes in data policy. In remote sensing, for

    instance, NASA and ESA granted free access to data archives,

    which enabled new techniques such as time series analysis and

    multi-sensor data fusion (Wulder et al., 2012).

    Despite tremendous technological progress in research, the

    application of traditional micrometeorological theory to urban

    areas is still limited by the complexity and heterogeneity of the

    built environment (Mills, 2014). Conventional observation

    methods often fall short in providing ﬁne-resolution spatial

    and temporal urban data, which highlights the need for denser

    observation networks and novel data sources. Additionally, urban

    climate studies have traditionally ignored “human factors” that

    lead to personal exposures to environmental stressors (Kuras

    et al., 2017; Okokon et al., 2017; Nazarian and Lee, 2021). Lastly,

    the risks for people and infrastructure are arguably more

    important than the geographic extent and magnitude of the

    hazard for planning and emergency response purposes, thus

    requiring direct access to highly localized information on

    human mobility (Moore and Obradovich, 2020).

    The Cornerstones of Urban Climate

    Informatics

    Urban Climate Informatics (UCI) is an evolving research ﬁeld

    that originates from two established domains: Urban Climate

    (concerned with interactions between a city and the atmosphere)

    and Climate Informatics (research combining climate science

    with approaches from statistics, machine learning, and data

    mining) (Monteleoni et al., 2016). While Climate Informatics

    focuses on computational approaches in climate science, UCI

    takes a broader, multidisciplinary approach. UCI aims to explore

    and understand complex urban climate systems and human-

    environment

    interactions

    through

    new

    technological,

    methodological,

    and

    systems

    thinking

    approaches.

    It

    embraces more integrated and human-centric methods to

    address urban climate challenges that are enabled by novel

    sensing, non-traditional datasets, crowdsourcing, big data,

    digital

    infrastructure,

    advanced

    analytics,

    and

    artiﬁcial

    intelligence.

    Four emerging technologies and methods can be noted as the

    cornerstones of UCI (Figure 1). First, recent advancements in

    environmental sensing have resulted in lower sensor size and

    power consumption at reduced sensor costs. More importantly,

    improvements in wireless data transmission (using various

    methods such as Wiﬁ, 5G, and LoRaWAN) and location

    awareness of devices have enabled Internet-of-Things (IoT)

    sensing,

    contributing

    to

    real-time

    and

    ubiquitous

    data

    collection. Second, in addition to environmental datasets that

    are actively collected by sensors, new urban datasets from various

    sources

    emerge.

    These

    novel

    datasets

    include

    detailed

    information on three-dimensional and heterogeneous urban

    conﬁgurations as well as incidental and public domain data

    that can be extracted from social media or the web. The

    availability of organic datasets, such as mobility patterns in

    cities, further contributed to understanding the population

    exposure and impact of urban climate challenges (Li and

    Wang, 2021). At the same time, a stronger emphasis on

    citizen engagement and technology-use in daily activities has

    evolved over the last decade. Driven by commercial trends (e.g.,

    home

    automation

    sensors,

    smartwatches,

    wearables)

    and

    solutions that are non-expert friendly, citizen science data

    collection has become mainstream and is implemented in

    education, entertainment, and social activities (Caluwaerts

    et al., 2021). This contributes to ubiquitous and crowdsourced

    data collection beyond the academic community (Irwin, 2018),

    further enabling more realistic and human-centric solutions to

    urban climate challenges. Third, state-of-the-art analytical

    algorithms and computer systems have entered urban climate

    analytics, providing an opportunity for more sophisticated data

    analyses, computational methods, and modeling approaches.

    Artiﬁcial

    Intelligence

    (AI,

    including

    Machine

    and

    Deep

    Learning) has been instrumental in characterizing urban areas

    into local climate zones or climatic maps (Bechtel and Daneke,

    2012; Xu et al., 2019; Demuzere et al., 2021; Demuzere et al.,

    2022), which are paramount for observational and modeling

    efforts in urban climatology. Lastly, the accessibility of digital

    infrastructures for storage, analytics, and communication of

    results have transformed various approaches, enabling global-

    scale analyses of urban climate parameters such as surface and air

    temperatures (Peng et al., 2012; Chakraborty and Lee, 2019;

    Venter et al., 2021).

    Collectively, novel data sources, sensors, and computing

    methods have led to a paradigm shift in urban climate

    analyses, signiﬁcantly changing “how” we do science and

    expanding

    research

    questions

    directed

    at

    the

    urban

    atmosphere and its residents. This shift includes moving

    beyond the traditional focus on city-atmosphere interactions

    and tackling challenges of the Anthropocene, including climate

    change, urban overheating, poor air quality, and climate injustice.

    Most notably, four trends can be observed: 1) urban climate

    research has moved towards comprehensive analyses of the

    dynamics

    of

    urban

    climate

    and

    human-environment

    interactions at ﬁne temporal and spatial scales; 2) the research

    focus has shifted from an assessment of local atmospheric

    conditions in a city vs its rural surroundings (traditional UHI

    deﬁnition) towards intra-urban hazard distribution and human

    thermal exposure assessments; 3) highly accurate, expensive,

    high-maintenance weather stations and air quality sensors

    operated by experts are complemented by educational or

    operational, lower-cost tools and data that were acquired for

    non-urban climate purposes; 4) urban climate research teams

    have become interdisciplinary spanning a wide range of expertise,

    from architects and engineers to urban planners, computer

    scientists, and local government representatives, which allows

    more complex, solutions-oriented analyses from health sciences

    to social justice and equity; and 5) research results are better

    communicated to non-experts through new platforms and

    visualizations (e.g., websites, social media, dashboards) to

    maximize broader societal impact.

    UCI has the potential to overcome current gaps and challenges

    in urban climatology, which include but are not limited to 1) a

    lack of human processes (e.g., anthropogenic heat, people’s

    movement) in urban modeling; 2) observations that are not

    across space and time (e.g., for long-term climate studies or

    canopy parameters, urban morphology) and computing power

    for urban climate modeling (Masson et al., 2020a; González et al.,

    2021). This paper outlines the key trends in the development of

    UCI,

    and

    methodological

    advances

    that

    enable

    research. The following sections provide a general overview of

    the UCI ﬁeld as well as examples and discussions of novel sensing

    and data sources (Section 2) as well as advancement in data

    processing (Section 3).

    2 NOVEL SENSORS AND DATA SOURCES

    One of the key catalysts for the UCI ﬁeld is the emergence of novel

    and

    more

    expansive

    datasets

    resulting

    from

    several

    interconnected developments, most importantly advances in

    sensor

    solutions,

    communication

    technologies,

    and

    data

    acquisition methods. Here, we detail how advancements in

    sensors (Section 2.1), ensuing novel acquisition methods

    (Section 2.2), and datasets (Section 2.3) have been used to

    understand and address urban climate challenges.

    2.1 Advancement in Sensors and

    Communication Technologies

    Advances in environmental sensing have greatly increased the

    availability, resolution, and quality of observational data for

    urban climate research. In the last decade, a major shift was

    seen from research-grade sensors operated by experts to low-cost

    devices, e.g., for citizen-scientists. New technologies not only

    allowed sensing units to record a more comprehensive set of

    parameters (such as standard meteorology, air quality, UV, and

    noise), but also removed limiting factors in continuously

    monitoring the built environment, such as power supply

    (source

    and

    consumption)

    and

    sensor

    size.

    The

    sensor

    technology revolution resulted in smaller sensors that could

    easily be mounted to existing structures, required less energy

    (or were sustained through solar panels), and eventually, were

    cheaper. This process is similarly seen in satellite/remote sensing,

    where the emergence of CubeSats has led to miniaturized

    satellites for space research that have high potential to

    enhance observations for urban climate applications (González

    et al., 2021).

    Such advances are further complemented with novel wireless

    and ubiquitous communication technologies, such as WiFi, 3G/

    4G/5G, and LoRaWan. While previous data-loggers required a

    technician to connect to the sensor and (often manually) transfer

    the data for further processing, wireless communication enables

    automatic and seamless transitions of data from multiple devices

    to servers. Removing the communication and scaling barrier has

    led to the emergence of Internet-of-Things (IoT), where physical

    sensors are connected to digital infrastructure and real-time

    analytics (Sections 2.1 and 2.2); Web-of-Things (WoT), where

    sensors and everyday objects are fully integrated into the web; and

    Internet of Everything (IoE), with all-round connectivity,

    intelligence, and cognition beyond computers, tablets and

    smartphones.

    Advances in sensors and communication methods greatly

    contribute to observational studies in UCI. Low-cost sensors

    with

    seamless

    data

    communication

    allow

    scientists,

    practitioners, and citizens to utilize numerous sensors in a

    variety of urban spaces with different user behaviors. Instead

    of using sparsely-placed outdoor sensors to determine heat,

    weather, or air quality, ﬁne-grained and multi-parameter IoT

    sensor networks have been successful in depicting the spatial and

    temporal heterogeneity of environmental quality in educational,

    commercial,

    and

    residential

    buildings

    and

    their

    outdoor

    surroundings (Palacios Temprano et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2021;

    Ulpiani et al., 2021). In addition to covering a larger spatial area

    and determining hotspots of environmental stressors (Schneider

    et al., 2017), IoT sensor networks contribute to predictive models

    for weather (Chavan and Momin, 2017), energy consumptions

    (Cheng et al., 2021) and air pollution exposures (Xiaojun et al.,

    2015; Zhang and Woo, 2020); assist in determining the impact of

    surface cover and urban design on microclimate (Pfautsch and

    Tjoelker, 2020); and further raise citizen awareness on urban

    environmental

    challenges.

    Lastly,

    advancement

    in

    sensor

    solutions and communication methods lead to novel data

    acquisition methods in cities.

    2.2 Data Acquisition Methods

    As existing sensing technologies improve over time, urban

    climate science further beneﬁts from emerging data acquisition

    techniques. Novel observation methods take advantage of new

    sensors and digital literacy of urban residents. Observations range

    from mobile sensors mounted on various devices and humans to

    crowdsourcing and volunteered geographic information (VGI),

    where citizens and distributed private sensors provide a source of

    geographic and environmental data (See et al., 2016). These

    methods have long been neglected in atmospheric sciences,

    mostly due to knowledge gaps and justiﬁed concerns in data

    quality and standardization (Muller et al., 2015). However, these

    novel data sources are predestined for urban analyses because

    they are typically collected in the most populated places: cities.

    Mobile Sensing and “Humans as Sensors”

    Traditional urban climate research uses observational datasets

    that determine inter- and intra-urban variabilities of climatic

    parameters. As sensors have become smaller, wireless, and more

    power-efﬁcient, it is more feasible to gather such data through

    mobile sensing, where the primary goal is increased coverage at

    reduced costs. This has led to four measurement categories: 1)

    portable

    weather

    stations,

    2)

    vehicle-based

    sensors,

    3)

    smartphones, and 4) wearable and nearable devices.

    Portable

    weather

    stations

    are

    moved

    through

    urban

    environments using garden carts (Middel and Krayenhoff,

    2019; Middel et al., 2021), golf carts (Häb et al., 2015), or

    cargo bikes (Heusinkveld et al., 2014; Rajkovich and Larsen,

    2016). Measurement campaigns often utilize research-grade

    weather

    stations

    and

    monitor

    a

    comprehensive

    set

    of

    parameters, providing valuable spatial data particularly in the

    Urban Climate Informatics

    face of extreme heat events. However, mobile sensors lack the

    medium- or long- term temporal resolution of ﬁxed sensors and,

    more importantly, need post-processing methods to address

    prolonged sensor response time in common weather stations

    (Häb et al., 2015). Additionally, data outputs of mobile

    measurements are often in time-series format, while the

    sensors

    are

    non-stationary.

    The

    changing

    atmospheric

    conditions

    impact

    observations

    that

    should

    be

    corrected

    through time-detrending (Parlow and Foken, 2021). Lastly,

    mobile sensors are subject to anthropogenic inﬂuences such as

    heat

    from

    trafﬁc

    and

    space

    heating/cooling

    equipment.

    Accordingly, mobile data should be enriched with detailed

    metadata to comprehensively interpret the observations.

    Similar to portable weather stations, sensors mounted on

    vehicles such as buses (Kang et al., 2016; Seidel et al., 2016),

    trash trucks (deSouza et al., 2020), and cars (Ferwati et al., 2018)

    have been used to traverse cities. Vehicle-based data are prone to

    the same challenges as portable weather stations. Low-cost (and

    therefore less accurate) sensors are frequently deployed due to

    size and communication limits, yet they allow to assess behavioral

    patterns and human-centric exposure to environmental stressors

    such as air quality and heat (Fugiglando et al., 2018).

    Mobile phones have become an attractive data source for

    human-scale urban climate information, as there are currently

    6.64 billion smartphone users in the world today. Various studies

    have used phone battery temperature as a proxy for air

    temperature to map thermal conditions in cities (Overeem

    et al., 2013; Droste et al., 2017b). Data uncertainty increases

    with solar radiation exposure (Cabrera et al., 2021), more extreme

    weather, and precipitation, because the smartphone is most likely

    enclosed.

    Although

    smartphone

    data

    for

    environmental

    modeling are yet to be validated and scaled beyond academic

    assessments, the importance of gathering continuous, real-time

    feedback from urban dwellers should not be underestimated.

    Assessing urban climate impact requires more in-depth focus on

    humans

    exposed

    to

    environmental

    stressors

    in

    cities.

    Accordingly, smartphone applications collecting data on the

    human experience (e.g., thermal comfort vote and noise/

    pollution

    discomfort)

    can

    obtain

    critical

    data

    points

    to

    augment environmental parameters (Lassen et al., 2021).

    Recent urban climate studies have used wearables and nearable

    sensors for data collection. Here, we deﬁne wearables as smart

    devices (e.g., smart watches, sensor patches, smart clothing) that

    are worn by participants to obtain environmental parameters (e.g.,

    air temperature and humidity) and physiological responses or

    behavioral patterns and activities. Nearables refer to (low-cost)

    sensors carried by individuals or placed in the immediate

    environment of people. The National Science Experiment in

    Singapore (low-cost wireless SENSg devices (Wilhelm et al., 2016)

    is probably the largest deployments of wearables, with 50,000 sensors

    carried by students for assessment of thermal comfort among other

    objectives (Monnot et al., 2016; Happle et al., 2017). Wearable

    sensors have been used to combine all three (environmental,

    physiological, and behavioral) factors and have shown promising

    results in predicting heat stress (Nazarian et al., 2021) and obtaining

    non-obtrusive, real-time feedback (Jayathissa et al., 2019). As sensors

    are frequently moved between indoor and outdoor settings, pocket

    and palms, and are also inﬂuenced by the device CPU load,

    interpretation of the data requires more in-depth investigations.

    Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science

    Crowdsourcing, i.e., collection of atmospheric data from non-

    traditional distributed sources, has evolved as a cost-efﬁcient

    alternative for monitoring urban climates. While the use of

    crowdsourced data in atmospheric sciences was in its infancy

    half a decade ago (Muller et al., 2015), it has reached adolescence

    quickly. Since 2015, a growing body of crowdsourcing literature

    has focused on citizen weather station (CWS) data from

    privately-owned, non-professional, low-cost stations connected

    to the Internet. Early studies focused on network air temperature

    (Bell et al., 2015; Chapman L. et al., 2017; Fenner et al., 2017;

    Meier et al., 2017), but more recent analyses added other

    atmospheric parameters including precipitation (De Vos et al.,

    2017; Bardossy et al., 2021), air pressure (de Vos et al., 2020), and

    wind speed (Droste et al., 2020). While the data quality of

    individual stations remains low, many insights have been

    gained

    on

    error

    sources,

    quality

    control,

    and

    ﬁltering

    algorithms (Meier et al., 2017; Hammerberg et al., 2018;

    Napoly et al., 2018; de Vos et al., 2019; Mandement and

    Caumont, 2020; Fenner et al., 2021). This development is

    dynamic, and the uncertainty in crowdsourced CWS data

    much depends on the parameter of interest and the network

    density, but conﬁdence increases that robust parameter estimates

    can be derived for spatial averages or climatology. Other

    crowdsourcing sensors of high interest are cars (Bröring et al.,

    2015; Bonczak and Kontokosta, 2019) and smartphones, which

    have been used to observe air pressure (Mass and Madaus, 2014;

    de Vos et al., 2020) and air temperature (Overeem et al., 2013;

    Droste et al., 2017a), amongst others (see previous section).

    A major driver of advancements in crowdsourcing is the growing

    number of applications. CWS have been used to analyze urban heat

    islands (Meier et al., 2017; Varentsov et al., 2021; Venter et al., 2021),

    hailstorms (Clark et al., 2018), and deep convection (Mandement

    and

    Caumont,

    2020);

    for

    high-resolution

    mapping

    of

    air

    temperature (Venter et al., 2020; Vulova et al., 2020; Zumwald

    et al., 2021); to derive boundary conditions for urban-climate models

    (Jin et al., 2021); and for operational weather forecasts (Nipen et al.,

    2020). Furthermore, CWS data have been combined with novel

    datasets emerging in UCI (Section 2.3) such as high-resolution 3D

    urban models, such that we better understand the role of urban

    design and land cover on urban microclimate (Potgieter et al., 2021).

    Since crowdsourced data allow new types of analyses and improve

    the accuracy of short-term forecasts, they have slowly gained

    acceptance in the climatology community, but concerns about

    data quality remain. For centuries, climatologists have developed

    and advanced standards and protocols to make observations

    comparable between places and decades; in the future, much of

    this rigor must be applied to the quality control and ﬁltering

    algorithms of crowdsourced data.

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

    Observations from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are at the

    smallest scale of remote sensing for monitoring land surface

    dynamics. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) produce high

    Middel et al.

    Urban Climate Informatics

    spatial resolution data, sufﬁciently detailed to make ﬁeld-level

    decisions, and ﬁll the gap between satellite and in-situ, near-

    ground observations (Emilien et al., 2021). The genesis of UAS

    dates back to 1849 and was, for a long time, driven by military

    needs (Rakha and Gorodetsky, 2018). In the early 1970s, Konrad

    et al. (1970) pioneered the use of UAVs in meteorology to study

    the dynamics of the convective process, which requires ﬁne-scale

    data on the temporal and spatial structure of the atmosphere. To

    overcome limitations of available platforms at that time (e.g.,

    balloons, towers, and full-sized aircraft), the authors developed

    and tested a small, radio-controlled aircraft with meteorological

    sensing instrumentation as a versatile measurement platform.

    Over the next decades, technical developments facilitated more

    frequent uses of UAVs in atmospheric research. For example,

    Leuenberger et al. (2020) evaluated the assimilation of boundary

    layer observations gathered by “Meteodrones” into the numerical

    weather prediction system at Meteoswiss and found that the

    drone observations improved fog prediction. Chilson et al. (2019)

    proposed an automated 3D mesonet based on autonomous UAS

    stations to observe atmospheric proﬁles similar to standard

    “mesonets”, which consist of surface-based, in-situ stations.

    Although this work is in its infancy, a 3D network could

    signiﬁcantly

    enhance

    our

    monitoring

    capacity

    of

    environmental variables in the lower atmosphere, improve our

    understanding of atmospheric boundary layer processes, and

    improve high-impact numerical weather prediction. Despite

    the low cost and resolution advantages, drones still have

    limited use in climatology, because they require additional

    sensors beyond RGB imagery, and ﬂight durations are short

    (Yavaşlı, 2020).

    Yet, UAVs have proven to be useful in an urban climate

    context, as shown by Rakha and Gorodetsky (2018). Their

    comprehensive review of thermal drones for energy audits

    highlights that the increased accessibility, efﬁciency, and safety

    of drones expedites the improvement and retroﬁtting of aging

    and energy-inefﬁcient building stock and infrastructure. This

    ﬁnding is corroborated by Bayomi et al. (2021), who collected

    thermal drone data to calibrate a building energy model for

    improved

    performance

    and

    to

    assess

    building

    material

    degradation, thermal bridging, and insulation failures. In

    recent

    years,

    UAVs

    have

    been

    increasingly

    deployed

    to

    measure 3D urban form (Gevaert et al., 2017) and to monitor

    in-situ air quality (Kuuluvainen et al., 2018), but limitations such

    as ﬂight duration, payload capacity, and sensor dimensions,

    accuracy, and sensitivity remain (Villa et al., 2016).

    2.3 Datasets

    New emerging datasets are key for representing realistic,

    heterogeneous urban environments while driving insight into

    the exposure of urban residents to climate challenges. These

    datasets are obtained through planned processes gathering

    information on deﬁned research questions (purposeful data)

    such as LiDAR point clouds, or secondary outcomes of

    technological processes and platforms used in urban areas

    (organic

    data)

    such

    as

    social

    media

    data.

    The

    source,

    intention, and method of data collection further dominate

    whether the dataset is structured, or more importantly, can be

    activated for use in climate analyses (i.e., used to develop insights

    or devise action). While the unprecedented volume of data is

    offering exciting opportunities for better understanding and

    quantifying urban climate challenges, the velocity (rate at

    which the data are generated), veracity (truthfulness, accuracy,

    and quality of data), and ownership (access to, possession of, and

    responsibility for data) creates signiﬁcant challenges for data use

    in climate research and application. For instance, while data

    policies of authorities have become considerably more open

    over the past decade, data generated by citizens are often

    legally “owned” by private companies, thus their long-term

    availability depends on business interests and success. The

    challenges of data ownership are manifested in access to 3D

    urban models, where the development of Data as a Service (DaaS)

    prohibits their dissemination for modeling or observational

    studies. Lastly, new datasets raise novel challenges with respect

    to privacy, most seen in human-scale data collection. Here, we

    detail three novel data types that have been successfully collected

    and used for urban climate analyses and discuss limitations in

    research and application.

    Big Data

    Detailed, accurate 3D information on a city’s composition,

    conﬁguration, and morphology is key for urban climate

    analyses and applications. The wide variety of building types,

    architectural

    features,

    construction

    materials,

    and

    the

    distribution of vegetation govern the interactions between the

    city and its surrounding atmosphere (Middel et al., 2014; Oke

    et al., 2017; Ching et al., 2018). Traditionally, 3D city models and

    urban

    form

    parameters

    have

    been

    established

    using

    photogrammetry (processing optical stereo imagery) or high-

    resolution satellite images (Masson et al., 2020a). More recent

    approaches use large point clouds (next section) or procedural

    modeling (Nishida et al., 2018) to automatically generate

    cityscapes (Ching et al., 2019a). In the advent of big data,

    researchers started to repurpose large datasets that were

    originally collected for non-urban-climate purposes, such as

    street level photography. Street View image repositories from

    Google, Baidu, Mapillary, Tencent have increasingly become

    available and been used to characterize the built environment

    using

    machine

    learning

    (feature

    detection

    and

    image

    segmentation)

    (Keralis

    et

    al.,

    2020).

    A

    street

    canyon

    perspective is more human-centric than bird’s eye view

    imagery, which is particularly important for human thermal

    comfort, health, and behavioral studies (Middel et al., 2019).

    Past research has used Street View images to quantify street

    greenery (Li et al., 2017; Lu, 2019), building age (Li et al., 2018),

    building ﬂoor count (Iannelli and Dell’Acqua, 2017), sidewalks

    and crosswalks (Hara et al., 2013; Berriel et al., 2017), urban land

    use (Zhang et al., 2017), and sky view factors (Middel et al., 2018;

    Zeng et al., 2018; Nice et al., 2020). Street level images have also

    been used to conduct virtual neighborhood audits to assess

    walkability (Yin and Wang, 2016), bikeability (Arellana et al.,

    2020), trafﬁc safety (Mooney et al., 2016), physical activity (Griew

    et al., 2013), and human health (Keralis et al., 2020). Lastly, Street

    View images have been linked to urban climate parameters such

    as surface temperature (Zhang et al., 2019) and air quality (Apte

    Middel et al.

    Urban Climate Informatics

    et al., 2017). While street level imagery offers remote access to

    urban form, design, and function, many providers have recently

    restricted free image downloads. Other known constraints

    include limited spatial and temporal availability (i.e., the user

    does not have control over image acquisition season, date, time,

    and location), images are usually taken in the center of the road,

    not on the sidewalk, and they do not provide insight into

    backyards. Yet, with more and more users volunteering

    geographic information, uploading crowdsourced photography,

    and more companies entering the mapping market, Street View

    products will remain a valuable big data source for urban climates

    studies.

    LiDAR Point Clouds

    Urban areas affect the atmosphere via their built materials,

    distinct surface cover and urban structure. The latter refers to

    the 3D urban morphology, or urban form, that determines albedo

    and aerodynamic roughness, and controls radiative exchange and

    airﬂow (Oke et al., 2017). With advances in remote sensing,

    LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) systems have become a

    well-established

    alternative

    to

    stereo

    photogrammetry

    for

    generating digital urban models. Point clouds from airborne,

    mobile,

    or

    terrestrial

    LiDAR

    yield

    3D

    urban

    form

    at

    unprecedented spatial resolution (Yan et al., 2015; Bonczak

    and Kontokosta, 2019). Wang et al. (2018) reviewed urban

    reconstruction algorithms for point cloud data, evaluated their

    performance in modeling architectural elements (e.g., buildings,

    roads, bridges, power lines, trees), and highlighted the generation

    of 3D city models with multiple levels of detail (LoDs). In this

    context, CityGML by the Open Geospatial Consortium has

    emerged as a widely accepted standard for describing the

    representation, storage, and exchange of digital 3D city and

    landscape models (Gröger and Plümer, 2012). Higher levels of

    detail require more data storage, and as such, pathways are

    currently explored on how to represent multiple levels of

    detail (LoDs) while optimizing storage. This relates to the

    urban-scale space exploration (Lafarge, 2015) and the concept

    of “ﬁt-for-purpose” urban data as advertised by the World Urban

    Database and Access Portal Tools project (WUDAPT, Ching

    et al., 2018, 2019; Bechtel et al., 2019) that aims to ﬁnd an optimal

    solution across scales as a tradeoff between data complexity and

    model accuracy.

    Point clouds have myriad urban climate applications. Urech

    et al. (2020) used LiDAR to reconstruct digital 3D landscapes and

    devised a framework to generate future landscape scenarios by

    manipulating the point cloud. This information was subsequently

    used to inform the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer

    (DART) model that estimates the 3D radiative budget of

    urban and natural landscapes, and to assess changes in

    thermal comfort in a neighborhood in Singapore. Dissegna

    et al. (2019) calculated the leaf area density (LAD) of urban

    trees from terrestrial LiDAR scans to quantify the contribution of

    vegetation to the radiative budget of a city, which can mitigate the

    urban heat island (UHI) effect and ultimately contribute to the

    development of climate resilient urban spaces. Other studies used

    airborne LiDAR data to map urban vegetation and LAD in

    Vienna, Austria (Höﬂe et al., 2012) and Gothenburg, Sweden

    (Klingberg et al., 2017), thereby indicating the important

    ecological characteristics of urban vegetation that inﬂuence

    urban climate through shading and transpiration cooling and

    air quality through air pollutant deposition. The Urban Multi-

    scale Environmental Predictor (UMEP), an urban climate service

    tool (Lindberg et al., 2018), combines models and approaches for

    ﬁne-scale climate simulations. The tool includes modules to

    derive digital surface models (DSM) and canopy digital surface

    models (CDSM) from airborne LiDAR and has recently been

    used in various heat exposure and mitigation studies across the

    globe (Aminipouri et al., 2019; Kong et al., 2022).

    Reviewing the latest advances of LiDAR-based mobile

    mapping systems, Wang et al. (2020) identiﬁed challenges

    related to reliable positioning, the need for more sophisticated

    deep-learning architectures to classify point clouds, and AI

    challenges

    to

    comprehensively

    understand

    semantics

    of

    complex urban streetscapes. Nevertheless, the authors envision

    that point clouds will give rise to a new category of geo-big data

    and will play an important role in future monitoring, detection,

    and modeling tasks.

    Social Media

    DataIn the era of information and communications technology,

    urban

    geolocated

    social

    (SMD)

    offer

    new

    opportunities to indirectly measure the impact of hazards on

    society, to advance understanding of complex urban dynamics,

    and

    to

    support

    decision-making

    for

    sustainability

    transformations (Ilieva and McPhearson, 2018; Creutzig et al.,

    2019).

    SMD from

    Flickr,

    Twitter,

    Foursquare,

    Facebook,

    Instagram, etc. have the potential to ﬁll important data gaps

    that prevent researchers and practitioners from understanding

    human-environment interactions. During the ﬁrst IPCC Cities

    and Climate Science Conference in Edmonton, Canada (Bai et al.,

    2018; Frantzeskaki et al., 2019), SMD indicators of social,

    ecological, and infrastructural change were highlighted in a

    series of synthesis statements on the role, potential, and

    research gaps of nature-based solutions for climate adaptation

    and mitigation. Grasso et al. (2017) argue that micro-blogging

    platforms such as Twitter may be used as a distributed network of

    mobile sensors that react to external events by exchanging

    messages. They found signiﬁcant associations between the

    daily increase in tweets and extreme temperatures during a

    2015 summer heat wave in Italy, indicating that the daily

    volume of Twitter messages can indicate local heatwave

    impacts, improve preparedness measures at the regional and

    local level, and thus reduce heat vulnerability. Young et al.

    (2021) came to a similar conclusion when studying Twitter

    data to detect different scales of response and varying attitudes

    towards heat waves in the United Kingdom (United Kingdom),

    the United States of America (US), and Australia. They

    performed a sentiment analysis, i.e., the ﬁeld of natural

    language processing that aims to extract the attitude conveyed

    in a body of text. The United Kingdom and US had similar levels

    of positivity during the heatwave, while Australians were more

    negative, with a signiﬁcant sentiment increase as temperature

    decreased. By quantitatively reviewing 169 studies that use data

    from social media and social networking sites to better

    understand human-environment interactions (Ghermandi and

    Sinclair,

    2019),

    suggest

    that

    SMD

    offers

    unprecedented

    opportunities in terms of data volume, scale of analysis, and

    real-time monitoring. At the same time, challenges remain,

    including the integration of different types of information in

    data matching, the development of quality assurance procedures

    and ethical codes, an improved integration with existing methods,

    and the assurance of long-term, free, and easy-to-access provision

    of public social media data (Ghermandi and Sinclair, 2019).

    3 ADVANCEMENTS IN DATA PROCESSING

    The emergence of new digital infrastructure and analytics

    algorithms and platforms is a major driver of UCI. Cloud

    storage and computing allow bigger data volumes to be stored

    outside of the sphere of physical storage and processed directly in

    the cloud. Furthermore, novel analysis methods (e.g., AI or edge

    computing) complement previous advancements and remove

    some privacy and security concerns of previous approaches

    that analyzed the impact of urban climate on residents.

    3.1 Algorithms

    Climate is increasingly becoming a data problem (Jones, 2017).

    For example, the compressed climate model output for the sixth

    Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) is estimated at

    18 Peta Bytes, which is ﬁve times the size of the CMIP5 archive

    (Balaji et al., 2018). The research ﬁeld “Climate Informatics”

    encourages

    collaborations

    between

    climate

    scientists

    and

    machine learning researchers to help bridge the gap between

    data and understanding and to accelerate discovery in climate

    science (Monteleoni et al., 2016; Huntingford et al., 2019).

    Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been used to ﬁnd

    complex patterns and networks in large data, insights that

    might otherwise depend on expert judgment or physical-based

    rules (Jones, 2017). ML also speeds up the development of

    parameterizations in weather and climate models (or their

    sub-components,

    e.g.,

    land

    surface

    models),

    either

    by

    completely replacing physically-based parameterizations by

    data-driven neural networks or by harnessing ML to calibrate

    or “tune” the many free parameters involved in their formulation

    (Couvreux et al., 2021; Hourdin et al., 2021; Pal and Sharma,

    2021). In urban climate studies, the use of ML or other artiﬁcial

    intelligence (AI) techniques such as deep learning has been

    primarily used to derive urban form and land cover from

    image datasets. Ma et al. (2019) reviewed 200 remote sensing

    studies and found that deep learning was predominantly used in

    urban applications. Xu et al. (2019) employed convolutional

    neural networks (CNNs) and ground-level images to classify

    urban areas into climate zones, while Zhou et al. (2021) and

    Yoo et al. (2019) used deep learning, CNN, and random forest to

    map LCZs from remotely sensed images. Deep learning has also

    been used to predict air pollution in urban areas using satellite

    data (Lee et al., 2021) and Street View images (Suel et al., under

    review). Venter et al. (2020) applied a random forest model to

    Sentinel, Landsat, LiDAR, and crowd-sourced air temperature

    measurements to model hyper-local urban air temperature

    distribution

    concluding

    that

    the

    resulting

    maps

    can

    complement and validate traditional urban canopy models.

    3.2 Digital Infrastructure and Platforms

    Platforms for Big Earth Observation Data

    As discussed in the introduction, many urban climate studies rely

    on remotely sensed Earth Observation (EO) data, which has

    become increasingly more available, accurate, and ﬁne-scaled. EO

    products are frequently used to assess the surface urban heat

    island (SUHI), perform land cover classiﬁcations, and provide

    input for models of urban surface-atmosphere exchange (Voogt

    and Oke, 2003). Many EO datasets are delivered on a daily basis,

    providing a massive amount of remotely sensed data that places

    us in an age of big EO data (Chi et al., 2016). Over the last decade,

    cutting-edge platforms have been developed to support a new

    generation of spatial data infrastructure based on cloud

    computing, distributed systems, MapReduce systems, and web

    services. These systems address challenges related to big EO data

    management

    heterogeneity,

    storage,

    processing,

    analytics,

    visualization, sharing, and applications (Li et al., 2020c)

    Importantly, the development of data infrastructure enables

    the application of data standards to data layers developed by

    diverse stakeholders and addresses challenges regarding data

    interoperability and integration. In their review, Gomes et al.

    (2020) deﬁne “platforms for big EO data management and

    analysis”

    as

    computational

    solutions

    that

    provide

    functionalities for data management, storage, and access; that

    allow processing on the server side without having to download

    large datasets; and that provide a certain level of data and

    processing

    abstractions

    for

    EO

    community

    users

    and

    researchers. Seven platforms currently match this deﬁnition:

    Google Earth Engine (GEE) (Gorelick et al., 2017), Sentinel

    Hub (Sinergise, 2018), Open Data Cube (Open Data Cube,

    2021), System for Earth Observation Data Access, Processing

    and Analysis for Land Monitoring (SEPAL, FAO, 2021), OpenEO

    (Pebesma et al., 2017), the JRC Earth Observation Data and

    Processing Platform (JEODPP, Soille et al., 2018), and pipsCloud

    (Wang L. et al., 2018; Gomes et al., 2020). GEE is probably the

    most widely used platform in urban climate studies.

    Amani et al. (2020) reviewed 450 GEE-related journal articles

    and found 40 papers on urban topics, including urban planning,

    development

    and

    extent;

    urban

    morphology;

    and

    urban

    temperature and heat island studies. For example, Cheng et al.

    (2018) and Zhang et al. (2020) used GEE to develop global maps

    of manmade impervious areas. Li M. et al. (2020) mapped urban

    3D building structure, i.e., building footprint, height, and volume,

    for Europe, the United States, and China using random forest

    models in GEE. Huang et al. (2018) and Duan et al. (2019) used

    GEE to map urban green spaces and urban forests in China using

    Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery, respectively. In a series of papers,

    Demuzere et al. (2019a, 2019b, 2020, 2021) converted the off-line

    single-city Local Climate Zone (LCZ) mapping strategy (Stewart

    and Oke, 2012; Bechtel et al., 2015) into a GEE-based procedure

    that allows for the creation of continental-scale LCZ maps,

    including

    a

    web-application

    (LCZ

    generator,

    https://lcz-

    generator.rub.de/) that makes LCZ mapping fast and easy.

    Bechtel et al. (2019b) assessed the SUHI from MODIS and

    Middel et al.

    Urban Climate Informatics

    Landsat against LCZ maps for 50 global cities, and Chakraborty

    and Lee (2019) computed the SUHI from MODIS for over 9500

    urban

    clusters

    and

    examined

    how

    vegetation

    controls

    spatiotemporal SUHI variability. Benz et al. (2017) analyzed

    global shallow groundwater temperatures by processing and

    integrating land surface temperatures, evapotranspiration data,

    and snow cover in GEE. The availability of LCZ mapping has also

    enabled a consistent comparison with three-dimensional urban

    data (Section 2.3) for different cities, providing detailed city-

    descriptive input parameters for climate models (Lipson et al.,

    under review).

    Big Earth data and related platforms introduced disruptive

    changes in EO data management and analysis (Sudmanns et al.,

    2019). Yet, despite their advancements, challenges remain. For

    example, Gomes et al. (2020) report that none of the investigated

    platforms offer all ten required EO capabilities presented by

    Camara et al. (2016) and Ariza-Porras et al. (2017). Besides

    technical challenges, organizational and political challenges

    exist that are partly unsolved or not discussed, such as security

    issues (e.g., storing datasets or algorithms on non-proprietary

    platforms) or increasing costs for developing and maintaining

    such platforms. These issues lead to the question whether Big EO

    data platforms will continue to provide reliable data and services

    in the future (Sudmanns et al., 2019).

    Cloud Computing

    In

    recent

    years,

    cloud

    computing

    services

    have

    become

    increasingly affordable. Third-party providers such as Amazon

    Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud host

    and maintain scalable computing infrastructure, i.e., customers

    are only charged for the infrastructure they use. Several recent

    urban climate studies have used cloud computing for modeling

    sky view factors (Dirksen et al., 2019), to run WRF (Goga et al.,

    2018), simulate microclimate with ENVI-met (Crank et al., under

    review), and predict neighborhood air pollution (Triscone et al.,

    2016). Cloud services also gain popularity in crowdsourcing and

    IoT applications. For example, Fauzandi et al. (2021) designed

    and implemented a low-cost sensor system for UHI observations

    using AWS, and Kulkarni et al. (under review) used an AWS

    database to store biometeorological observations and people

    counts from an IoT device in a public park. Similar to Big EO

    data platforms, cloud computing has limitations related to server

    availability (e.g., downtime during service outages), security, and

    privacy. Cloud computing also offers limited control and

    ﬂexibility because the infrastructure is managed by the service

    provider, not the urban climate researcher, and is often tied to a

    speciﬁc vendor (the service provider). Despite these limitations, it

    is expected that cloud computing will play a major role in UCI as

    simulations become more complex and datasets increase in size.

    4 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

    The

    ﬁeld

    of

    urban

    climate

    has

    greatly

    advanced

    our

    understanding of city-atmosphere interactions since the ﬁrst

    weather map was created in the mid-19th century. Driven by

    sensing and modeling physical phenomena, urban climate

    research in the past decade has integrated multidisciplinary

    methods and practices complementing the core principles in

    atmospheric

    science.

    UCI

    parallels

    this

    development,

    embracing various scientiﬁc disciplines such as data science,

    geospatial analyses, urban design, health, and policy. A clear

    paradigm shift can be seen from focusing on city-atmosphere

    interactions to tackling grand challenges of the Anthropocene,

    including climate change, urban overheating, poor air quality,

    and climate injustice. New advancements enabled by UCI offer

    unprecedented opportunities to understand these grave problems

    and support a variety of applications.

    strategies

    for

    urban

    climate

    challenges

    by

    pushing the boundaries of observational networks, model

    resolution, and domain size to yield unprecedented details

    on hazard distribution. High resolution 3D city data paired

    with detailed thermal properties of the urban fabric enable

    urban climatologists to answer questions about optimal tree

    placement, the amount of available shade, and heat retention

    in urban canyons. Digital twins–virtual city models integrating

    various datasets, real-time sensing, and predictive models of

    underlying atmospheric processes–are on the rise and will

    eventually

    allow

    analyses

    of

    complex

    city-atmosphere

    interactions at ﬁne temporal and spatial scales. Although

    still in their infancy, Digital Twins have already been used

    to support collaborative and participatory urban planning and

    aid in hyper-local air pollution mitigation (Dembski et al.,

    2020). The City of Zurich uses Digital Twins to simulate urban

    climate, noise, air pollution, and create future scenarios for

    decision-making (Schrotter and Hürzeler, 2020).

    Computational steering (interactively changing parameters

    during simulation) has the potential to transform how we

    parameterize and run urban climate models. The future of

    urban climate may even be in the cloud! In parallel, as sensing

    capabilities grow, cities will become smarter through sensors

    embedded in the urban fabric. These future directions in UCI

    research and application are instrumental in achieving the vision

    of climate-sensitive urban design and planning.

    In recent years, the focus of urban climate has shifted from

    UHI studies towards intra-urban hazard distribution and human

    thermal exposure assessments. Emerging research aims to

    combine climate analyses with various urban data layers to

    achieve

    more

    comprehensive

    vulnerability

    and

    inequity

    analyses. For example, Harlan et al. (2006) investigated heat-

    related health inequalities related to microclimate considering

    socioeconomic status, ethnicity data, and urban form and

    conﬁguration descriptors. Results showed that residents in

    hotter neighborhoods were more vulnerable because of fewer

    resources to cope with heat. Servadio et al. (2019) analyzed health

    outcomes and air pollution exposure in Atlanta using various

    data layers and found that areas with majority African-American

    populations exhibited signiﬁcantly higher exposure to poor air

    quality. Considering the social dimensions of atmospheric

    impacts in neighborhoods allows to further identify “hotspots”

    with vulnerable populations that are unproportionally affected by

    hazards. This is further enabled by novel digital communication

    platforms (such as public data dashboards) that use simpliﬁed

    data visualizations as well as easily comprehensible metrics and

    indicators to communicate the relevance of urban climate data for

    urban dwellers. The contributions of UCI to public engagement

    not only bridge the communication gap and inform residents

    about the extent of urban climate challenges, but also enable

    people to make individual decisions that can minimize exposure

    to environmental stressors in cities. Lastly, the emergence of

    “humans as sensors” and citizen science in UCI is key to not only

    inform urban dwellers, but also devise the most effective solutions

    for improving human health and wellbeing in the face of

    increased climate challenges.

    Novel approaches always entail barriers that need to be

    overcome, and UCI is no exception. With respect to novel

    sensors and data sources, guidelines and best practices must

    be

    established

    to

    guarantee

    standardized

    methods

    for

    crowdsourcing, IoT sensing, data curation, processing, storage,

    and metadata documentation. In addition, long-term availability

    of data must be secured. While public entities have recently

    adopted more open data policies, citizen-science generated

    data are often legally owned by private companies and

    dependent on short-term business interests. Another emerging

    concern is data privacy, which needs careful consideration at the

    design phase of any implementation.

    While

    big,

    unprecedented

    data

    sets

    offer

    exciting

    opportunities to better understand the Earth System, our data

    collection ability currently outweighs our usage and analysis

    capacity. Too often, available data are not activated, leaving

    behind unused potential. Moving forward, the focus should

    not

    only

    be

    on

    new

    data

    collection

    but

    also

    drawing

    meaningful insight from data sets already available. Also, with

    inﬂating raw data, processing chains require higher attention,

    highlighting the important role of open-source quality control

    packages.

    Finally, as human-centric data collection through mobile

    devices becomes more mainstream, the digital divide must be

    addressed. While smart technology enables wide-scale, human-

    centric data collection, more afﬂuent areas will have more access

    to those technologies, further contributing to urban climate

    inequity.

    Cities are living, breathing ecosystems that include physical,

    socio-economical, and behavioral processes. UCI seeks to

    understand and respond to such complex, dynamic human-

    environment

    interactions

    through

    novel

    technological,

    methodological, and systems thinking approaches, achieving

    more integrated and human-centric assessments of urban

    climate

    challenges

    in

    future

    research

    and

    application.

    Moving forward, UCI will undoubtedly shape the urban

    climate

    research

    agenda

    for

    upcoming

    decades

    and

    positively impact fundamental, applied, and policy-relevant

    research.

    \ moisture has an important impact on hydrological\nprocesses in mountainous areas.\
    \ Understanding such variability requires soil moisture datasets at\nmultiple\
    \ temporal and spatial scales. Remote sensing is a very eﬀective method to obtain\
    \ surface\n(~5 cm depth) soil moisture at the regional scale but cannot directly\
    \ measure soil moisture at deep\nsoil layers (>5 cm depth) currently. This study\
    \ chose the upstream of the Heihe River Watershed\nin the Qilian Mountain Ranges\
    \ in Northwest China as the study area to estimate the proﬁle soil\nmoisture (0–70\
    \ cm depth) at the regional scale using satellite Vegetation Index (NDVI) and\
    \ Land\nSurface Temperature (LST) products. The study area was divided into 31\
    \ zones according to the\ncombination of altitude, vegetation and soil type. Long-term\
    \ in situ soil moisture observation stations\nwere set up at each of the zones.\
    \ Soil moisture probe, ECH2O, was used to collect soil moisture at ﬁve\nlayers\
    \ (0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 30–50 and 50–70 cm) continuously. Multiple linear regression\
    \ equations of\ntime series MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)\
    \ NDVI, LST and soil moisture\nwere developed for each of the ﬁve soil layers\
    \ at the 31 zones to estimate the soil moisture (0–70 cm)\non a regional scale\
    \ with a spatial resolution of 1 km2 and a temporal resolution of 16-d from October,\n\
    2013 to September, 2016. The correlation coeﬃcient R of the regression equations\
    \ was between 0.47\nand 0.94, the RMSE was 0.03, indicating that the estimation\
    \ method based on the MODIS NDVI and\nLST data was suitable and could be applied\
    \ to alpine mountainous areas with complex topography,\nsoil and vegetation types.\
    \ The overall pattern of soil moisture spatial distribution indicated that soil\n\
    moisture was higher in the eastern region than in the western region, and the\
    \ soil moisture content in\nthe whole study area was 14.5%. The algorithm and\
    \ results provide novel applications of remote\nsensing to support soil moisture\
    \ data acquisition and hydrological research in mountainous areas.\nKeywords:\
    \ soil moisture estimation; in situ observations; MODIS NDVI and LST; soil moisture\n\
    variability; the Heihe River watershed\n1. Introduction\nSoil moisture is an essential\
    \ component of the terrestrial water cycle, and serves as a\ncritical link between\
    \ the precipitation, surface water, groundwater and vegetation water [1–6].\n\
    It plays an important role in hydrological processes and land surface–atmosphere\
    \ interactions\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2414; doi:10.3390/rs12152414\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\
    Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 2414\n2 of 20\nsuch as the Soil–Plant–Atmosphere Continuum\
    \ (SPAC) [7]. Mountains are water towers of rivers,\nand understanding the distribution\
    \ of soil moisture over the mountainous areas, is essential for\nhydrological\
    \ modeling and water resources management, especially in arid areas, such as Northwest\n\
    China [8]. Since its strong temporal and spatial variability, soil moisture has\
    \ an important eﬀect on the\ndistribution of regional water resources, and ecosystem\
    \ services [9–11]. Unfortunately, the impact of\nsoil moisture on both hydrological\
    \ processes and ecosystem services over the regional scale has been\npoorly understood\
    \ due to the lack of long-term, large-scale soil moisture datasets, particularly\
    \ in such\nmountainous areas [12].\nOver the past decades, acquisition of soil\
    \ moisture data has evolved from traditional gravimetric\nmethods to the applications\
    \ of semi-automatic and automatic monitoring of the neutron probe,\ntime-domain\
    \ reﬂectometry (TDR), frequency domain reﬂectometry (FDR). At the regional scale,\n\
    remote sensing, particularly satellites, provides soil moisture estimates over\
    \ large areas [13], which\nis mainly based on the measurement of electromagnetic\
    \ radiation energy reﬂected or emitted from\nthe land surface. Satellite soil\
    \ moisture products mainly include AMSR (Advanced Microwave\nScanning Radiometer)\
    \ [14], ERS (European Remote Sensing Satellite) [15], ASCAT (The Advanced\nScatterometer)\
    \ [16,17], SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) [18] and SMAP (Soil Moisture\
    \ Active\nPassive) [19]. In addition, soil moisture data at the regional scale\
    \ can also be obtained through model\nsimulation and data assimilation [20]. Common\
    \ weaknesses of these soil moisture products are that\nthe accuracy and resolution\
    \ in heterogeneous mountainous areas are still too coarse to meet the study\n\
    requirements [21,22]. Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) [23] and Apparent\
    \ Thermal Inertia\n(ATI) [24,25] are two common methods to estimate soil moisture\
    \ by using visible light and near-infrared\nwavebands. However, both the TVDI\
    \ and ATI methods mainly establish the correlation between\nthe measured soil\
    \ moisture on the ground and the TVDI or ATI indices to estimate the soil moisture\n\
    distribution in the region. For alpine and heterogeneous areas, the complexity\
    \ of the underlying\nsurface leads to a series of uncertainties, such as the inconsistent\
    \ linear relationship between soil\nmoisture and ATI, resulting in large estimation\
    \ errors. In addition to these deﬁciencies, current remote\nsensing methods mainly\
    \ concentrate on the relationship between the surface reﬂection value and the\n\
    in situ observations to estimate the surface soil moisture at the regional scale\
    \ [23]. Few studies have\nestimated the proﬁle soil moisture, particularly in\
    \ the alpine areas. Li et al. [26] used remotely sensed\nsurface soil moisture\
    \ to calculate deep soil moisture by a ﬂux model, and pointed out that remote\n\
    sensing surface soil moisture in wet areas was suitable for estimating proﬁle\
    \ soil moisture, while the\nresults in dry areas had large errors. Tobin et al.\
    \ [27] downscaled AMSR-E and ERS-CCI (European\nremote sensing satellite-climate\
    \ change initiative) soil moisture data using an exponential ﬁlter (ExpF)\nwith\
    \ soil moisture index derived from MODIS NDVI. Tian et al. [3] coupled the surface\
    \ soil moisture\nand proﬁle soil moisture, applied ExpF, artiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) and cumulative distribution\nfunction matching (CDF) methods in an alpine\
    \ region to estimate the deep proﬁle soil moisture at\nthe regional scale. Lu\
    \ et al. [28] investigated a nonlinear autoregressive neural network method with\n\
    exogenous input (NARXnn) to estimate time series soil moisture by multiple remote\
    \ sensing data.\nEstimation of 0–100 cm soil moisture by the principle of maximum\
    \ entropy achieved better results than\nthose obtained by the exponential decaying\
    \ function in the Southeastern USA, a subtropical humid\narea [29]. With the measurement\
    \ of the spectral characteristics of soil proﬁle, Balet et al. [30] inferred soil\n\
    moisture conditions based on the MARMIT (MultilAyer Radiative Transfer Model for\
    \ soIl reﬂecTance)\nmodel. Over the past decades, MODIS LST and NDVI products\
    \ have been widely used in agriculture,\necosystem and global change research\
    \ [31,32]. The NDVI is an index that shows the diﬀerence between\nvegetation reﬂectance\
    \ in the visible and near-infrared bands and the soil background [33]. Land Surface\n\
    Temperature (LST) is a key parameter for agricultural drought monitoring, hydrological\
    \ research and\nurban thermal environment [34,35]. Both MODIS LST and NDVI data\
    \ are widely used for soil moisture\nestimation based on the TVDI and ATI methods\
    \ (e.g., [21,36]). For example, Yang et al. [37] proposed a\ntrapezoidal space\
    \ deﬁned by remote sensed vegetation cover and LST to estimate surface soil moisture.\n\
    Compared with the aforementioned soil moisture products, both MODIS LST and NDVI\
    \ have higher\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2414\n3 of 20\nspatial resolutions in soil\
    \ moisture monitoring. In addition, both MODIS LST and NDVI are usually\nused\
    \ for downscaling the satellite soil moisture products [22,38].\nIn recent years,\
    \ many scale transformation studies for soil moisture retrieval have been done.\n\
    However, the accuracy of most of these works was poor in mountainous areas, and\
    \ the temporal\nand spatial resolutions of proﬁle soil moisture estimation were\
    \ still too coarse to meet the needs of\nhydrological research in heterogeneous\
    \ mountain areas. To improve the deﬁciency in estimating proﬁle\nsoil moisture\
    \ distribution over mountainous areas, this study proposed a novel approach to\
    \ estimate\nproﬁle soil moisture by integrating remote sensing LST and NDVI products\
    \ and in situ soil moisture\nobservations. The upstream of the Heihe River Watershed\
    \ in the Qilian Mountain Ranges in Northwest\nChina was chosen as the study area\
    \ to estimate the proﬁle soil moisture (0–70 cm depth) at the regional\nscale\
    \ by remote sensing. The study area was divided into 31 zones based on the combination\
    \ of altitude,\nvegetation and soil type. In situ soil moisture observation stations\
    \ were set up at each of the zones to\ncollect soil moisture at ﬁve layers (0–10,\
    \ 10–20, 20–30, 30–50 and 50–70 cm) continuously for the period\nof October, 2013\
    \ to September, 2016. Multiple time series MODIS NDVI, LST and soil moisture were\n\
    ﬁtted for each of the ﬁve soil layers at the 31 zones to estimate the proﬁle soil\
    \ moisture distribution\non a regional scale. The study aims to provide a novel\
    \ approach to estimate proﬁle soil moisture\ndistribution by remote sensing to\
    \ support hydrological research in mountainous areas.\n2. Study Area\nThe in situ\
    \ soil moisture data for this study were obtained from the Soil Hydrological Heterogeneity\n\
    Observation Network in the upstream of the Heihe River Watershed (97◦46′–101◦11′E,\
    \ 38◦12′–39◦22′N)\nNorthwest, China (Figure 1a), a 2.75 × 104 km2 study area with\
    \ 30 tributaries, elevation ranging from\n2000 m to 5580 m (above sea level, a.s.l)\
    \ on the northeast edge of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. The spatial\ndistribution\
    \ of annual mean temperature ranges from –3.1 ◦C to 3.6 ◦C, and annual precipitation\n\
    ranges from 200 mm to 700 mm [39]. Perennial snow cover and glaciers are present\
    \ above 4000 m\nwith permafrost extending down to 3700 m. Aﬀected by mountain\
    \ climate and terrain, there is a\nremarkable vertical zonal distribution of vegetation\
    \ and soils in the study area. In the upstream of the\nHeihe River Watershed,\
    \ the major vegetation types include coniferous forest (Picea crassifolia), shrub\n\
    (Potentilla fruticosa), steppe (Stipa purpurea Griseb), alpine meadow (Kobresia\
    \ pygmaea Clarke), alpine\nsparse vegetation (Saussurea medusa Maxim) and desert\
    \ (Sympegma regelii Bunge) [22]. The main soil\ntypes include aeolian sandy soil,\
    \ cold desert soil, alpine meadow soil and mountain swamp chestnut\nsoil [8].\n\

    \ Moisture Monitoring Network\n3.1.1. Soil Moisture Observation Network\nWe established\
    \ a Soil Hydrological Heterogeneity Observation Network comprising 31 stations\n\
    (Figure 1) in the upstream of the Heihe River Watershed based on the combination\
    \ of land use/land\ncover (LULC), soil type and elevation [39,40]. The distribution\
    \ of soil and vegetation types is shown\nin Table 1. We used GPS (Garmin Oregon\
    \ 550) to record latitude, longitude and altitude information\nfor each station,\
    \ the positional errors were within ±1 m and altitude error was in ±3–5 m. We\
    \ also\nrecorded soil proﬁle characteristics, vegetation status, root depth, aspect\
    \ and slope using a geological\ncompass, and took pictures of the sites every\
    \ summer since June, 2014.\n3.1.2. Soil Moisture Measurement\nECH2O 5TE soil moisture\
    \ probes (DECAGON Devices, USA) and EM50 datalogger were installed\nat each in\
    \ situ observation site. The 5TE probe measures the soil volumetric water content\
    \ by the\ndielectric constant of the soil, with a precision of ±3% and accuracy\
    \ of ±1–2% [3,41]. The 5TE probes\nwith a sensing depth of 2.5 cm were vertically\
    \ centered in each of the sampled layers (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm,\n20–30 cm, 30–50\
    \ cm and 50–70 cm) [42]. There is one probe in each layer for a total of ﬁve at\
    \ each\nstation. Datalogger EM50 was placed into a waterproof box sealed with\
    \ high-strength glass glue and\nwrapped in a thick waterproof bag buried at a\
    \ distance of at least 50 cm away from the 5TE probes.\nThe system collected soil\
    \ moisture content data at 30 min intervals. Regular site maintenance took\nplace\
    \ twice a year at the beginning of June and at the end of October [3].\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2020, 12, 2414\n6 of 20\nHowever, the mountainous study area is topographically\
    \ complex and hard to reach, and it is a\nreal challenge to maintain the soil\
    \ moisture in situ observation network in the study area. Wireless\ndata transmission\
    \ is not possible because there is no mobile communication network coverage in\
    \ the\nstudy area. As a result, there are some gaps in the measurement datasets\
    \ due to severe weather and\nunstable batteries or sensors and the sensor damage\
    \ by livestock and rats [3].\n3.2. Time Series Data of NDVI and LST\nNDVI was\
    \ used as the vegetation index for the upscaling of the in situ soil moisture\
    \ in this\nstudy. Speciﬁcally, we acquired the 16-day composite NDVI dataset MOD13A2\
    \ V6 (https://e4ftl01.\ncr.usgs.gov/MOLT/MOD13A2.006/) of the sixth edition of\
    \ terrestrial Level 3 standard data products\nfor the period of October, 2013\
    \ to September, 2016, with a total of 69 scenes at a spatial resolution\nof 1\
    \ km2 [43]. We used the 8-d composite Land Surface Temperature (LST) data MOD11A2\
    \ V6\n(https://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/MOLT/MOD11A2.006/) for the same period of October,\
    \ 2013 to September,\n2016, for a total of 138 scenes with a resolution of 1 km2\
    \ [44]. Since the LST data were of 8-d composite,\nwe used Maximum Value Composites\
    \ (MVC) to process the LST dataset into a 16-d temporal resolution\nto match the\
    \ temporal frequency of the NDVI dataset [45].\n4. Methodology\nThe remote sensing\
    \ vegetation index products contain a lot of noise caused by precipitation,\n\
    cloud cover, human inﬂuence and the sensor itself in the data acquisition and\
    \ process stages [46,47],\nand these factors can be collectively called random\
    \ factors or residual parts.\nThe MOD13A2 V5 NDVI product was divided into the\
    \ NDVI seasonal part and the NDVI residual\npart by using the Asymmetric Gaussian\
    \ ﬁtting method (AG) [48]. The multivariate linear regression\nﬁtting was used\
    \ to establish multiple linear regression equations between the time series soil\
    \ moisture\ndata and the MODIS LST and NDVI. Subsequently, soil moisture upscaling\
    \ equations were developed\nfor every proﬁle in the 31 vegetation–soil–elevation\
    \ zones.\nWe installed only three automatic weather stations in the study region\
    \ due to resource constraints.\nThe limited number of precipitation observation\
    \ stations cannot match the number of in situ soil\nmoisture observations. Our\
    \ in situ observations covered the three-year period (October, 2013 to\nSeptember,\
    \ 2016), and were able to represent the mean precipitation amount in the study\
    \ region.\nTherefore, we only used MODIS LST and NDVI remote sensing data to estimate\
    \ the spatial distribution\nof soil moisture in the study region.\n4.1. Asymmetric\
    \ Gaussian Function Fitting\nBased on the noise information, NDVI data products\
    \ can be divided into seasonal part, NDVIAG,\nand residual part, NDVIRES as shown\
    \ in Equation (1). It needs to be reconstructed to remove the\nresidual part [48].\n\
    NDVI = NDVIAG+NDVIRES\n(1)\nThe time series NDVI data curve reconstructed by the\
    \ AG algorithm, can well express the\ninterannual variation characteristics of\
    \ the vegetation, and identify all the abnormal values [31].\nThe AG algorithm\
    \ is a nonlinear least-squares ﬁtting algorithm based on the Asymmetric Gaussian\n\
    function. The original NDVI data and NDVIAG were used to obtain the residual part\
    \ of the time\nseries Vegetation Index (NDVIRES). The shallow soil moisture was\
    \ greatly aﬀected by the residual part\nwhich was likely to be related to short-term\
    \ weather. The deep soil moisture was mainly subject to the\nseasonal changes\
    \ in weather conditions and plant growth and environmental factors.\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2020, 12, 2414\n7 of 20\n4.2. Multiple Linear Regression Fittings\nIn this study,\
    \ a multiple linear regression method was used to estimate the soil moisture using\
    \ the\nin situ soil moisture observations, Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface\
    \ Temperature (LST) data.\nThe speciﬁc equation is as follows:\nSMC = a0+a1∗LST\
    \ + a2∗NDVIRES+a3∗NDVIAG\n(2)\nIn Equation (2), SMC is soil volumetric water content\
    \ (m3 m −3), LST is the Land Surface\nTemperature (K), NDVIRES and NDVIAG are\
    \ the residual part and seasonal part of the vegetation index,\nrespectively,\
    \ a0, a1, a2 and a3 are the coeﬃcients to be determined, a1 is in m3 m −3 K –1,\
    \ while a2 and\na3 are dimensionless.\nFollowing Zhang et al. [22], the regression\
    \ equations were evaluated by complex correlation\ncoeﬃcient (R), the F-test value,\
    \ the conﬁdence level P and the root mean square error (RMSE). R describes\nthe\
    \ linear correlation of the dependent variable (soil moisture) and multiple explanatory\
    \ variables in\nmultivariate linear regression. The F-test was used to test whether\
    \ the established regression equation\nis statistically signiﬁcant. The larger\
    \ the F-value, the better the ﬁtted regression equation. Conﬁdence\nlevel P indicated\
    \ the signiﬁcance level of the regression equation. The smaller the p-value, the\
    \ more\nsigniﬁcant the equation. RMSE was used to measure the deviation between\
    \ the predicted value and\nthe true value. The smaller the RMSE value, the closer\
    \ the simulated value to the observed value,\nthe higher the accuracy of the regression\
    \ equation. R and RMSE calculation formulas are as follows:\nR =\nPn\ni=1\n\x10\
    \nSMCobs,i − SMCobs\n\x11\x10\nSMCmod,i − SMCmod\n\x11\nqPn\ni=1\n\x10\nSMCobs,i\

    i=1(SMCobs,i−SMCmod,i)2\nn\n(4)\nwhere, SMCobs,i is the measured soil moisture\
    \ value, SMCmod,i is the multiple linear regression ﬁtted\nsoil moisture value,\
    \ n is the number of observations [22].\n5. Results and Discussions\n5.1. Time\
    \ Series NDVI and LST\nThe NDVI dataset was the MOD13A2 product from 16 October\
    \ 2013 to 29 September 2016.\nThe product was the 16-day composite with a total\
    \ of 69 images. NDVIAG (Figure 2b) was obtained by\nreconstructing the NDVI time\
    \ series data with the AG algorithm, and then the NDVIAG and the original\nNDVI\
    \ data (Figure 2a) were used to derive the residual NDVIRES (Figure 2c). The reconstructed\
    \ NDVI\ntime series data (NDVIAG) based on the AG algorithm and the trend of the\
    \ original NDVI time series\ndata were basically the same (Figure 2d), and the\
    \ reconstructed results were used to detect abnormally\nhigh and low values in\
    \ the time series data, to correct the low values, and to reﬂect seasonal changes\
    \ in\nthe vegetation index [49]. The seasonal NDVIAG and the residual NDVIRES\
    \ were consistent with the\ngrowth pattern of the vegetation [48].\nThe selected\
    \ LST dataset was the MOD11A2 product from 16 October 2013 to 29 September 2016,\n\
    which was an eight-day composite product with a total of 138 images. The eight-day\
    \ LST dataset was\nconverted to a 16-day LST images (Figure 3b) to match the NDVI\
    \ temporal resolution by the MVC\nmethod [45].\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 2414\n\

    \ of in Situ Soil Moisture \nThe soil moisture time series data in the 31 in situ\
    \ observation sites were processed to 16-day \nmean values corresponding to the\
    \ NDVI and LST’s temporal resolution. Subsequently, multiple \nlinear regressions\
    \ were established between the in situ soil moisture observations and the NDVI\

    \ coefficients of the 31 in situ \nobservation sites were shown in Table 2 and\
    \ Tables A1–A4. For the 0–10 cm layer of the site D8, the \nsoil moisture upscaling\
    \ equation was significant at a 95% confidence level, and all the other models\
    \ \nat the rest 31 in situ observation sites were significant at a 99% level.\
    \ Among them, the correlation \ncoefficient R of the 0–10 cm layer was 0.36–0.93,\
    \ the RMSE was 0.03 (Table 2); the R and RMSE of 10–\n20 cm layer were 0.65–0.90,\
    \ and 0.03 (Table A1), respectively; The R and RMSE of 20–30 cm layer were \n\
    0.51–0.95 and 0.03 (Table A2), respectively; the R and RMSE of 30–50 cm layer\
    \ were 0.47–0.93, and \n0.03 (Table A3), respectively; and the R and RMSE of 50–70\
    \ cm layer were 0.54–0.94, and 0.02, \nrespectively (Table A4). The accuracy of\
    \ scaling results was higher than that of Xu et al. [21]. In \ngeneral, the five-layer\
    \ RMSE mean values were close to the ECH2O data accuracy (0.03 cm3 cm−3), \nindicating\
    \ that the accuracy of the in situ soil moisture estimation models was reasonable.\

    \ N is the observations.\nComparing the validation results of soil moisture models\
    \ of the ﬁve layers, we found that the R’s\ndescending order was 20–30 cm > 10–20\
    \ cm > 0–10 cm > 30–50 cm > 50–70 cm, RMSE’s descending\norder was 0–10 cm > 10–20\
    \ cm > 30–50 cm > 50–70 cm > 20–30 cm. The trends of the two indices were\nnot\
    \ consistent, the main reason might be: 1) the variability of soil moisture with\
    \ time decreased from\nthe top to the bottom soil layer, and the 0–10 cm layer\
    \ had the largest soil water ﬂuctuation and the\nlargest error, 2) the LST was\
    \ mainly aﬀected by the 0–10 cm layer of soil and overlying vegetation,\n3) NDVI\
    \ was mainly aﬀected by the vegetation growth, and the root zone soil moisture\
    \ was very\nimportant for vegetation growth, the main vegetation types of the\
    \ three veriﬁcation sites were all\ngrassland, with their root system mainly distributed\
    \ in the 20–30 cm. Therefore, the accuracy of the\n20–30 cm soil moisture upscaling\
    \ model was the highest, and the lowest was the 50–70 cm layer.\nComparison of\
    \ the soil moisture upscaling results of the three veriﬁcation sites showed that\
    \ the\nRMSE values were getting smaller from the top to the deep soil layers,\
    \ Kangle appeared to have the best\nﬁt. Topographically, the Kangle site was located\
    \ at a plateau within 1 km2 pixels. The vegetation type\nwas mainly grass (Stipa\
    \ Steppe) with homogeneous distribution. The climate was dry, with smaller\nrainfall\
    \ (annual 338 mm for Kangle, 428 mm for Dayekou and 702 mm for Biandukou during\
    \ the\n2013–2016 period), the soil moisture was relatively low and stable. Under\
    \ these climate, topography\nand vegetation conditions, the LST and NDVI data\
    \ were of relatively high quality, and the accuracy\nof the upscaling was high.\
    \ The Biandukou and Dayekou sites were located on the mountain slope.\nThe terrain\
    \ was complex within 1 km2 pixels, and the vegetation types were diverse. In addition,\n\
    there was a reservoir near the Dayekou site. These factors were likely to have\
    \ aﬀected the LST and\nNDVI quality of remote sensing products, and the accuracy\
    \ of the upscaling model was not as good as\nthat of the Kangle site.\nRemote\

    \ > 50–70 cm. Among them, the 20–30 cm were the highest among all the layers of\
    \ the soil\nproﬁle. During the whole three years, the variation range of each\
    \ layer was 0–10 cm (coeﬃcient of\nvariation, CV. 12.44%), 10–20 cm (CV. 12.27%),\

    \ which was closely related to the eﬀects of precipitation and soil inﬁltration\
    \ on\nsoil moisture. Figure 4b shows that the 20–30 cm and 30–50 cm had a relatively\
    \ high and low but stable\nvariation. Among the four seasons, the precipitation\
    \ and temperature were low in winter, leading to\nthe decrease of liquid water\
    \ in the soil, thus the soil moisture was the lowest in the winter. Summer\nrainfall\
    \ was the highest and most frequent, therefore the soil moisture content was highest\
    \ and most\nvariable in the summer.\n \ntype was mainly grass (Stipa Steppe) with\
    \ homogeneous distribution. The climate was dry, with \nsmaller rainfall (annual\
    \ 338 mm for Kangle, 428 mm for Dayekou and 702 mm for Biandukou during \nthe\
    \ 2013–2016 period), the soil moisture was relatively low and stable. Under these\
    \ climate, \ntopography and vegetation conditions, the LST and NDVI data were\
    \ of relatively high quality, and \nthe accuracy of the upscaling was high. The\
    \ Biandukou and Dayekou sites were located on the \nmountain slope. The terrain\
    \ was complex within 1 km2 pixels, and the vegetation types were diverse. \nIn\
    \ addition, there was a reservoir near the Dayekou site. These factors were likely\
    \ to have affected \nthe LST and NDVI quality of remote sensing products, and\

    \ 20–30 cm > 50–70 cm> 10–20 cm > 30–50 cm > 0–10 cm. The \ndescending soil moisture\
    \ order in all the layers in July were 20–30 cm >10–20 cm > 0–10 cm > 30–50 \n\
    cm > 50–70 cm. Among them, the 20–30 cm were the highest among all the layers\
    \ of the soil profile. \nDuring the whole three years, the variation range of\
    \ each layer was 0–10 cm (coefficient of variation, \nCV. 12.44%), 10–20 cm (CV.\
    \ 12.27%), 20–30 cm (CV. 11.86%), 30–50 cm (CV. 10.40%), 50–70 cm (CV. \n8.38%),\
    \ respectively, which was closely related to the effects of precipitation and\
    \ soil infiltration on \nsoil moisture. Figure 4b shows that the 20–30 cm and\
    \ 30–50 cm had a relatively high and low but \nstable variation. Among the four\
    \ seasons, the precipitation and temperature were low in winter, \nleading to\
    \ the decrease of liquid water in the soil, thus the soil moisture was the lowest\

    data-scarce, and heterogeneous mountainous areas like the upstream of the Heihe\
    \ River Watershed in\nNorthwest China. We proposed a regression model based on\
    \ the MODIS NDVI and LST to estimate\nproﬁle soil moisture at the regional scale.\
    \ Subsequently, we analyzed the spatial and temporal variability\nof soil moisture\
    \ at the regional scale. Results showed that the multivariate linear regression\
    \ method\ncould be used to estimate high-resolution soil moisture products in\
    \ alpine and cold mountainous\nareas at both shallow and deep soil layers. The\
    \ soil moisture in the east of the upstream of the Heihe\nRiver Watershed was\
    \ signiﬁcantly higher than that in the west, and the average soil moisture in\
    \ the\nwhole region was 14.5% in the 0–70 cm depth. The soil moisture at the 30–50\
    \ cm soil layer could\nreasonably represent the 0–70 cm proﬁle soil moisture.\
    \ Soil moisture in the 0–10 cm layer had the\nhighest variability while the 20–30\
    \ cm layer showed the lowest soil moisture variability among all\nthe layers.\
    \ The contribution of this study was to estimate proﬁle soil moisture at the regional\
    \ scale by\nreadily available remote sensing products of NDVI and LST.\nHowever,\
    \ the microterrain features such as slope and aspect were not considered in the\n\
    soil-vegetation-elevation sampling zone, which might aﬀect the accuracy of soil\
    \ moisture upscaling\nmodels. Satellite products with high spatial-temporal resolutions\
    \ need to be integrated with in situ\nobservations and other soil and vegetation\
    \ datasets to improve the accuracy of estimating soil moisture\nat the regional\
    \ scale, especially in data-scarce and topographically complex mountainous regions.\n\

    \ agriculture is the development direction of future agriculture and a high -level\
    \ form of \nmodern agriculture [1]. With the advancement and development of technology,\
    \ biotechnology, \ninformation technology, computer technology and new energy\
    \ technology have been widely infiltrated \ninto the agricultural field. High\
    \ -tech such as agricultural Internet of Things, agricultural big data and \n\
    agricultural robots gradually applied to various fields of agricultural production\
    \ [2]. Smart agriculture \ntakes data, knowledge and intelligent equipment as\
    \ its core element. By integrating modern science and \nCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY. CONTROL\
    \ AND MANAGEMENT.                                                          №3\
    \ / 2023 \n \n6 \ntechnology with agriculture, smart agriculture realizes the\
    \ digital perception, intelligent decision-\nmaking, precise operation and intelligent\
    \ management of the entire process of agricultural production, \nshowing a strong\
    \ development momentum. Research and practice of various countries have shown\
    \ that \nimproving agricultural intelligence can greatly increase labor productivity,\
    \ resource utilization and land \nproduction rates [3].  \nGreenhouse is an important\
    \ application scenario of modern agriculture. With the improvement \nof people's\
    \ life quality, the demand for fruits and vegetables has also increased, and the\
    \ amount of \ngreenhouses has developed rapidly. Greenhouse adopts artificial\
    \ technical means to change natural light \nand temperature conditions, and to\
    \ create environmental factors to optimize the growth of animals and \nplants,\
    \ so that greenhouse crops can grow throughout the year and the weather. Compared\
    \ with \ntraditional planting methods, the greenhouse is more automated, intelligent,\
    \ and mechanized. Promoting \nmodern agricultural technology and equipment in\
    \ greenhouses is an important manifestation of precision \nagriculture, information\
    \ agriculture and intelligent agriculture [4]. Intelligent monitoring and control\
    \ of \ngreenhouse can effectively improve the production efficiency of greenhouses\
    \ and reduce labor \nconsumption which is a hot spot for research in recent years.\
    \ The key technologies involved in intelligent \nagriculture mainly include Internet\
    \ of Things technology , intelligent perception technology and smart \nmanagement\
    \ technology. \n \n2. Research status of key technologies of intelligent greenhouse\
    \ monitoring and control \nsystems \n2.1 Agricultural Internet of Things \nInternet\
    \ of Things technology is an important bridge to the development of smart agriculture\
    \ [5]. \nIn order to build an Internet of Things system, various information sensors,\
    \ infrared sensors, radio \nfrequency identification facilities and other equipment\
    \ in greenhouses need to be installed. The Internet \nof Things system connects\
    \ the agricultural environment with the network through a communication \nagreement,\
    \ and then analyzes and sorts out different information collected by sensors,\
    \ in the same time \npublishes the information gathered from the cloud server,\
    \ and eventually displays it in the software \nterminal to achieve real-time monitoring\
    \ of crop growth. Through the Internet of Things system, the \nextensive connection\
    \ between things to things, things to people, and people to people is realized\
    \ [6] [7]. \nAgricultural Internet of Things technology mainly involves wireless\
    \ network transmission technology, \nmulti -sensor network technology and RFID\
    \ technology [8]. \n2.1.1 Wireless network transmission technology \nThe current\
    \ mature wireless communication methods are mainly include LORA, ZigBee, WiFi,\
    \ \nNB-IoT, Bluetooth, etc. [9]. Yao Maoxuan et al. [10] designed a detection\
    \ system for the basic greenhouse \necological environment, and studied the wireless\
    \ data transmission system based on LORA. \nTPYBOARDV102 is used as the core board\
    \ to achieve automated detection and control of greenhouse. \nWu Xiaofeng et al.\
    \ [11] invented the smart greenhouse system based on LORA and the cloud platform\
    \ \nInternet of Things technology, and the data between farmers can be shared.\
    \ Luo Jialong et al. [12] designed \nan intelligent agricultural irrigation system\
    \ based on ZigBee Internet of Things technology. It uses ARM \nprocessors to complete\
    \ data processing and intelligent control, and  achieved the function of ZigBee\
    \ \nwireless data collection and intelligent irrigation. Liu Feifei et al. [13]\
    \ designed a ZigBee -based \nenvironmental monitoring system. A distributed sensor\
    \ network terminal through ZigBee technology is \nestablish for data collection.\
    \ The collected data is sent to the ONENet cloud platform through 4G \nmodules\
    \ for monitoring, and the real -time monitoring& display of environmental data\
    \ and recording of \nhistorical data are successfully realized. Zhao Jindao et\
    \ al. [14] designed WIFI -based farmland automatic \nirrigation systems. The LAN\
    \ control adopted AP and STA mode. It controls relay status and information \n\
    through serial ports to achieve the function of timing control and automatic collection\
    \ information of the \nirrigation system. The control of the LAN adopts the AP\
    \ and STA mode. The system controls the state \nof the relay and completes the\
    \ information upload through the serial port. The function of timing control \n\
    and automatic collection information of the irrigation system is implemented.\
    \ Jiang Shixuan et al. [15] \nCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY \n \n7 \ndesigned a smart vertical\
    \ agricultural system combining ZigBee and NB-IoT technology. The system \nuses\
    \ STM32 as the core controller, and uses a coordinator to set up the network.\
    \ In order to collect the \nenvironmental index in the greenhouse, terminal nodes\
    \ are connected to the multi -way sensor. In order \nto achieve data communication\
    \ between the bottom device and the cloud platform, NB-IoT technology \nis adopted.\
    \ The system uploads the entire wireless sensing network data to the Internet\
    \ of Things open \nplatform through Internet of Things base stations and core\
    \ networks, realizing real -time monitoring and \nremote regulation of environmental\
    \ parameters. \n2.1.2 Multi -sensor network technology \nIn the construction of\
    \ smart agricultural greenhouses, the construction of the sensor network is \n\
    essential. Multi -sensor data fusion technology integrates technologies such as\
    \ signal processing, \nestimation theory, uncertain theory, optimization theory\
    \ and pattern recognition. In the field of smart \nagriculture, the purpose of\
    \ reducing data redundancy and improving transmission efficiency and \naccuracy\
    \ can be achieved through data fusion processing [16]. Valente et al. [17] used\
    \ specific data fusion \nalgorithms to make multiple data fusion of upload data\
    \ base on the ZigBee sensor network. Viani et al. \n[18] designed an embedded\
    \ decision -making support system. Through artificial intelligence fusion of \n\
    multiple sensors, the system can provide irrigation decisions based on weather\
    \ conditions and actual \nwater demand, and as a result, improve the output of\
    \ crops. Liu Qian et al. [19] used data mining \ntechnology and fuzzy reasoning\
    \ theory to conduct data fusion and analysis of data collected by \nenvironmental\
    \ detection sensors, and formulated corresponding control strategies with an accuracy\
    \ rate \nof more than 80 %. \n2.1.3 RFID technology \nRFID (Radio Frequency Identification)\
    \ is a technology that automatically obtains target -related \ninformation through\
    \ radio frequency signals and space electromagnetic coupling to achieve non-contact\
    \ \nautomatic recognition of targets. This technology can be used in complex environments,\
    \ which has \nattracted attention due to its huge application prospects. Huang\
    \ Xiaoyan et al. [20] designed a new type \nof RFID sensor for soil moisture and\
    \ salinity detection, simulated soil theory models with different \nhumidity and\
    \ salinity levels, and measured changes in water and salinity in sandy soil. Ma\
    \ Shijun et al. \n[21] used RFID technology to establish an agricultural seed\
    \ quality tracking system. According to the \nRFID tag, the seed quality tracking\
    \ system can get an overall description. The system realizes the real-\ntime monitoring\
    \ of seeds detail information including breeding, transportation, sales, planting\
    \ and other \nprocesses. Ning Wei et al. [22] invented a system that uses RFID\
    \ labels to track greenhouse crops, which \ncan locate the growth area of the\
    \ crop and accurately obtain crop growth status. \n2.2 Intelligent perception\
    \ \nInformation such as crop growth environment, crop growth situation and crop\
    \ disease and pests \ninformation of the smart greenhouse are the basis for intelligent\
    \ monitoring and control system \noperations [23]. Many kinds of agricultural\
    \ information can be obtained through satellite images, aircrafts \nor unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicles and ground detection instruments. \n2.2.1 Crop environment information\
    \ monitoring \nThe rapid perception of crop growth environment information is\
    \ the most basic and critical issue \nin the implementation of precision agriculture\
    \ [24]. The growth environment of crops includes \ninformation such as soil temperature,\
    \ soil humidity, and soil nutrients. Liu Fei et al. [25] used the IRI1011 \ninfrared\
    \ thermal image meter to measure the temperature of the soil, and predict the\
    \ water content of the \nsoil through soil temperature. The system realizes remote\
    \ sensing monitoring of soil water within a small \narea. Xiao et al. [26] developed\
    \ a wireless measurement system that can measure the depth of the water \nlayer\
    \ when there is water on the paddy field surface, and also the soil water content\
    \ when the paddy field \nsurface is waterless. The system can remotely control\
    \ automatic irrigation and drainage according to the \nmeasurement results.  \n\
    Effective nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil are the most basic nutritional\
    \ elements \nof crop growth. At present, the real-time online quick measurement\
    \ of soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and \npotassium is still a world problem, and\
    \ substantial progress has not been achieved. Sun Jianying et al. \nCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY.\
    \ CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT.                                                    \
    \      №3 / 2023 \n \n8 \n[27] selected black land as the research object, and\
    \ used spectral measurement technology to analyze the \nsoil parameters and spectral\
    \ characteristics of black soil and tide soil. And through laboratory analysis,\
    \ \nthe distributed diagram of P H and nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and organic\
    \ matter content can be \ngiven. Wang Zhenglang et al. [28] used GPRS wireless\
    \ communication technology, sensor detection \ntechnology, and A/D conversion\
    \ technologies to achieve remote detection of soil nitrogen, phosphorus, \nand\
    \ potassium of farmland. DONG et al. [29] Try to use laser induction technology\
    \ to determine nitrogen \nin the soil. \n2.2.2 Crop growth information detection\
    \ \nThe growth of crops mainly includes the growth status and yield of crops.\
    \ The growth status \nincludes information such as plant height, inverted area,\
    \ biological content and other information. Pan \nBeito et al. [30] designed a\
    \ visual-based wheat breeding growth information detection system. Based on \n\
    CATIA software, wheat growth information collection robot and supporting handheld\
    \ equipment are \ndesigned and developed. The counting of plants is achieved by\
    \ the processing of wheat seedling images. \nDu Minghua et al. [31] discussed\
    \ the use of near -infrared high spectral imaging technology to conduct \nnon\
    \ -destructive testing of tomato leaves chlorophyll content, and established a\
    \ leaf chlorophyll \nprediction model, which provides a basis for tomato quality\
    \ online testing. Tang Dong et al. [32] used \nimage edge detection technology\
    \ to design the crop inverted area evaluation system. Compared with the \ntraditional\
    \ inverted area evaluation method, the image detection rate is more than 78% and\
    \ the overall \narea evaluation error rate can be controlled within 10 %. Jiang\
    \ et al. [33-34] developed remote sensors. \nCompared with professional level\
    \ high-spectrum instruments and multi-spectrum cameras, it has similar \nreflectivity\
    \ and radiation illumination measurement accuracy. At the same time, the production\
    \ rate of \nthe growth topic picture and the decision-making efficiency of the\
    \ variable fertilizer square diagram has \nbeen greatly improved. \n2.2.3 Crop\
    \ disease and pest information testing \nEarly information testing of crop diseases\
    \ and pests can effectively reduce the possibility and \nseverity of the occurrence\
    \ of pests, eliminating and reducing losses caused by pests and is the basis for\
    \ \nprecision spraying and fertilization. At present, the commonly used disease\
    \ and pest monitoring methods \ninclude spectral detection method, image recognition\
    \ method and electronic nasal detection method. \nZhou Xiaoli et al. [35] designed\
    \ automatic detection methods of forest diseases and pests based on \nspectral\
    \ images, set up deep learning networks and completed the monitoring of the forest\
    \ -staining area \nthrough unmanned aerial vehicle experiments. Zhou Zhankun et\
    \ al. [36] used the greenhouse tomato as \nthe research object, and used THZ-NIR\
    \ high-spectrum fusion technology to study the rapid monitoring \nmethods and\
    \ recognition methods of tomato leaf mold and tomato leaf miner. The improved\
    \ Bayesian \nnetwork's recognition rate of tomato moldy samples was 97.12%, and\
    \ the recognition rate of tomato leaf \nminer was 93.35%. Prasath B. et al. [37]\
    \ designed a new pest detection and classification model based on \noptimized\
    \ YOLOV3 models and deep learning algorithms. The accuracy and F1 scores of this\
    \ method \nreached 96 % and 84 %, respectively. Zeba Anwar et al. [38] effectively\
    \ completed the classification of \npests based on the CNN deep learning model,\
    \ with the model accuracy of 82.5 %. Wu Zhilu et al. [39] \ninvented a method\
    \ of detection of crop disease and pests. This method completes the training of\
    \ visible \noptical pest image samples through convolutional neural networks,\
    \ and then completes feature extraction \nand classification. Sun Yubing et al.\
    \ [40] used electronic nasal technology to analyze the tea trees harmed \nby different\
    \ types of pests. The damage time and quality loss of tea trees can be obtained,\
    \ and the best \ntime point for using electronic nose detection has also been\
    \ discussed. Rakesh Kumar Raigar et al. [41] \nused hybrid electronic nose and\
    \ fuzzy logic methods to evaluate and predict the storage time and rotten \nof\
    \ peanuts, and achieved non -destructive detection of peanut quality. \n2.3 Smart\
    \ Management \nThe management of smart greenhouses integrates cloud platform technology,\
    \ big data \ntechnology, mobile internet technology, and Internet of Things technology.\
    \ It is a cross -regional \noperation control system that integrates smart agricultural\
    \ equipment, cloud wisdom, and service \nplatforms [42]. The functions that the\
    \ intelligent management system needs to complete mainly includes \nCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY\
    \ \n \n9 \nremote monitoring and controlling of both various environmental parameters\
    \ and working status of work \nfacilities in the greenhouse, and conducting fault\
    \ warning and remote scheduling [43]. The greenhouse \nequipment mainly includes\
    \ fans, water curtains, irrigation systems, and shading curtains [44]. Smart \n\
    management system connects the cloud platform through network, and uploads the\
    \ data from main \ncontrol point to the cloud. Users can complete the remote control\
    \ of greenhouse equipment and remote \nmonitoring of the crop environment through\
    \ the PC or mobile phone side. Li Guoxin et al. [45] designed \na multi-node distributed\
    \ smart agricultural greenhouse monitoring system, setting a private cloud \n\
    platform through EMQTT and Node-Red, and can realize the automatic monitoring,\
    \ intelligent control \nand scientific management of agricultural greenhouse environment\
    \ information. Lee [46] invented a \nprecision control system for smart greenhouses\
    \ and can obtain environmental parameters of multiple \ngreenhouses. The greenhouse\
    \ control server completes remote regulation of multiple greenhouse \nenvironments.\
    \ Wu Yan et al. [47] built a smart management platform for small three-dimensional\
    \ GIS \nreservoirs for agricultural irrigation, organically coupling the needs\
    \ of agricultural irrigation, water \nconservancy scheduling and disaster prevention,\
    \ solved the problem of three -dimensional simulation \nand visual management\
    \ of irrigation districts. Francisco G. Montoya et al. [48] set up the cloud platform\
    \ \ndatabase, designed Android applications based on Linux and Python and achieved\
    \ the acquisition and \nprecise monitoring of agricultural environmental parameters.\
    \ Liu Jixi et al. [49] built a cloud -based \nservice model based on the cloud\
    \ service model, and introduced information push services. The push \nservice\
    \ terminal based on the XMPP protocol can automatically and intelligently recommend\
    \ decision -\nmaking information for users. Han Ruifeng [50] invented an agricultural\
    \ greenhouse environment control \nsystem based on big data technology, increased\
    \ the enters the greenhouse appointment module, timely \nadjust the air oxygen\
    \ content in the greenhouse, and ensure the safety of staff. The system has increased\
    \ \nthe reservation module for entering greenhouses, and can timely adjust the\
    \ air oxygen content to ensure \nthe safety of staff. \n \n3 Conclusion and prospect\
    \ \nAt present, the new generation of information technology represented by the\
    \ Internet, big data \nand artificial intelligence is booming, which has a profound\
    \ impact on economic development, social \nprogress, and people's lives and is\
    \ promoting the rapid development of smart agriculture. This article \nintroduces\
    \ the important position and research progress of key technologies such as Internet\
    \ of Things \ntechnology, intelligent perception technology and smart management\
    \ technology. At present, the \nconstruction of smart greenhouses has just begun,\
    \ and the problems that need to be solved for large -\nscale promotion and application\
    \ include: \n1) Study low -cost and efficient smart greenhouse monitoring and\
    \ control systems, and achieve \nrapid construction in application scenarios,\
    \ thereby improving the efficiency of the construction of smart \ngreenhouses\
    \ and reducing construction costs. \n2) Study the new principles and algorithms\

    \ of meteorological data has become a\nprerequisite for dealing with various aspects\
    \ of production and life, and also laid\na foundation for weather prediction.\
    \ For a long time, meteorological data acquisi-\ntion system combined with modern\

    \ monitoring and computer research. The\ncontinuous development of NB-IoT technology\

    \ platform\n1\nIntroduction\nDue to the changeable climate and environment of\
    \ the Earth, People’s Daily production\nand life are greatly affected. In order\
    \ to obtain meteorological data accurately and timely,\nmeteorological stations\
    \ are established all over the world for meteorological monitoring\n[1]. In order\
    \ to develop meteorological monitoring, our country has also made great\nefforts\
    \ to build meteorological stations, most of which are centralized and the system\n\
    used is relatively backward. Because there are many manufacturers of domestic\
    \ weather\nstations, their quality is mixed and their technology is uneven, so\
    \ there is no certain\nstandard for meteorological data. In addition, China has\
    \ introduced a variety of foreign\nweather stations for direct application. Due\
    \ to geographical and human factors [2], these\nweather stations are really not\
    \ suitable for China’s actual situation.\nThe rapid development of Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) technology has triggered more\nscholars to explore the application\
    \ of NB-IoT in industrial and commercial ﬁelds. The\ncurrent wireless data transmission\
    \ modes, such as WiFi and Bluetooth modes, have a\n© The Author(s) 2022\nZ. Qian\

    \ unstable data transmission\nefﬁciency [3, 4]. The existence of this phenomenon\
    \ makes it necessary for the Internet\nof Things to study a new wireless data\
    \ transmission technology to solve the above\ndisadvantages [5]. NB-IoT technology\
    \ is well suited for data transmission in IoT related\napplications. Driven by\
    \ operators and device manufacturers, it has developed rapidly,\nand in a very\
    \ short period of time [6], pilot projects have been opened in many cities.\n\
    It can be seen that NB-IoT technology has developed rapidly in a very short period\
    \ of\ntime, from project landing to pilot in a very short time. The biggest factor\
    \ is that NB-IoT\ntechnology has the advantages of low power consumption, low\
    \ cost and long distance.\nIn this paper, STM32L051C8T6 development board is used\
    \ as the master con-\ntroller to connect with the weather sensor, and NB-IoT technology\
    \ is used for wireless\ncommunication to optimize the traditional weather station.\
    \ The main work is as follows:\n(1) Design a low-consumption system scheme, so\
    \ that the system can keep running for\na long time, low power demand.\n(2) Solar\
    \ panels and ultracapacitors are used to construct energy capture and storage\n\
    of the system, and NB-IoT wireless communication module is built based on BC35\n\
    series chips, which has the characteristics of low cost and stable communication.\n\
    (3) The cloud platform for data upload to the Internet of Things is realized to\
    \ provide an\ninterface for real-time acquisition of meteorological data, with\
    \ the goal of building\nsmart weather.\n2\nRelated Work\nLiterature [7] proposes\
    \ a multi-functional integrated weather station, which is mainly\napplied to precision\
    \ agriculture and urban climate. Compared with the reference station,\nit is very\
    \ consistent in most standard weather variables, and has the characteristics of\n\
    low cost, low maintenance cost and low power demand. Literature [4] proposes portable\n\
    automatic weather station, which is mainly used to measure glaciers, and includes\
    \ three\nimportant components: The data recorder records wind direction, wind\
    \ speed, relative\nhumidity, atmospheric pressure, freezing temperature, temperature,\
    \ solar radiation mete-\norological elements. The power system consists of a 10\
    \ W, 20 × 30 cm solar panel. The\ntripod is made of carbon ﬁber and stainless\
    \ steel, a recyclable material. Literature [8]\nproposes the ZigBee-based intelligent\
    \ weather station, which is mainly used to provide\ndata for weather prediction.\
    \ It is composed of the measurement unit based on the SiLab\nC8051F020 microcontroller\
    \ to measure the data of temperature, relative humidity, atmo-\nspheric pressure\
    \ and solar radiation, which is sent to the base station by the XBee module.\n\
    Then the base station will store the data to the Access database. Literature [9]\
    \ based on\nInternet of things technology and automatic meteorological monitoring\
    \ system, embed-\nded system is mainly used in monitoring of air and weather conditions,\
    \ to collect the\nmeteorological data such as temperature, relative humidity and\
    \ atmospheric pressure,\nand then sends the data to the remote application or\
    \ database, ﬁnally the data, can be\nin the form of graphics and tables to visualize,\
    \ Provides remote access and mail alerts.\nLiterature [10] proposes wireless portable\
    \ meteorological monitoring station, which is\nmainly used to collect weather\
    \ data and provide shared data. The meteorological sen-\nsor is connected with\

    \ of Things Platform Using NB-IoT Communication\n635\ndirection, relative humidity,\
    \ atmospheric pressure, rainfall, solar radiation, ground and\nenvironmental temperature,\
    \ and the industrial standard Modbus communication proto-\ncol is realized. Upload\
    \ data to the online MYSQL data server for data sharing. Literature\n[11] is proposed\
    \ based on NB-IoT communication model and the Internet of things\ntechnology of\
    \ automatic meteorological station, is mainly used in intelligence, wis-\ndom,\
    \ meteorological city, based on the technology of digital sensors and independent\n\
    power supply, intelligent sensor run independently and wireless data transmission,\
    \ data\nthrough data platform for data analysis, data interface for networking\
    \ meteorological\ninformation.\nIn this paper, the NB-IoT wireless data transmission\
    \ technology is adopted to opti-\nmize the weather station and upload the acquired\
    \ data to the cloud platform for users to\nmonitor the meteorological data in\
    \ real time [12]. The research results solve the disad-\nvantages of traditional\
    \ weather stations to a certain extent, and have a certain research\nsigniﬁcance\
    \ for the development of weather stations and NB-IoT.\n3\nHardware Design\nThe\
    \ hardware design of intelligent weather station based on NB-IoT is BME680 sensor,\n\
    ZPH02 dust sensor, VEML6070 ultraviolet sensor used to collect data, and the main\n\
    controller module STM32L051C8T6 is used to ensure the stability of data transmission\n\
    [13], signal control order, and program implementation efﬁciency. The energy capture\n\
    module uses 3 W 9 V small solar panel to capture energy, and the NB-IoT wireless\n\
    communication module uses BC35G chip to transmit data to the Cloud platform of\
    \ the\nInternet of Things (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1. Overall hardware architecture\nThe\
    \ main controller module is the core of the whole hardware. It is connected\n\
    with the data acquisition module through the serial port to collect meteorological\
    \ data.\nThe main controller module is connected to the wireless data transmission\
    \ module to\nrealize data uploading to the cloud platform [7]. As for the main\
    \ controller module,\nSTM32L051C8T6 development board is selected, which can carry\
    \ out high-speed data\nprocessing under the condition of low power consumption\
    \ and is equipped with high-\nspeed embedded storage and memory protection unit\
    \ and rich input and output data\ninterfaces. In order to ensure the stable operation\
    \ of the hardware part of the system, it is\nnecessary to design the circuit,\
    \ and the stable voltage required by each device is different.\n636\nZ. Wang et\
    \ al.\nThe design of low-power system is carried out. The main controller of STM32L051C8T6\n\
    uses 1.8 V voltage. The working voltage of NB-IoT wireless communication module\
    \ is\n3.3 V; BME680 sensor and VEML6070 sensor in the data acquisition module\
    \ need 3.3 V\nworking voltage, while ZPH02 sensor needs 5 V power supply; The\
    \ MICROcontroller\nuses XC6206P182 ultra-low pressure difference 1.8 V LDO to\
    \ supply power; The sensor\nand wireless communication module use the automatic\
    \ pressure raising chip TPS63070,\nand the PM2.5 sensor needs 5 V power supply.\
    \ To sum up, the system circuits need to\nbe designed to allow each module to\
    \ operate at a normal operating voltage (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2. Circuit design of voltage\
    \ regulation scheme\nThe energy capture module uses a 3 W 9 V small solar panel\
    \ to capture energy, and\ntwo 2.8 V 3000 F supercapacitors in series to store\
    \ energy. The LM2596S stabilized\npower module can stabilize the output voltage\
    \ of the supercapacitor. The NB-IoT wire-\nless communication module selects BC35G\
    \ chip, which has the characteristics of wide\ncoverage, low power consumption,\
    \ low cost and large connection. It can transmit the\ndata in the data acquisition\
    \ module to the Cloud platform of the Internet of Things. In the\ndata acquisition\
    \ module, BME680 sensor was used to detect temperature and humidity,\nair pressure\
    \ and smoke resistance, ZPH02 dust sensor was used to collect PM2.5, and\nVEML6070\
    \ ultraviolet sensor was used to detect ultraviolet. The hardware PCB design\n\
    of the system adopts AD20, which ensures the normal working voltage of the whole\n\
    system module when the main control board is designed. In addition, the pins of\
    \ the\nmain controller are directly set out to facilitate the access of the data\
    \ acquisition module.\nIn order to ensure the small size of the intelligent weather\
    \ station, the SIM card slot is\nwelded on the back of the PCB board (Fig. 3).\n\
    Based on Internet of Things Platform Using NB-IoT Communication\n637\nFig. 3.\
    \ System PCB\n4\nSoftware Design\nIn the system software design stage, mainly\
    \ including: data acquisition module design,\nlow power design, NB-IoT wireless\
    \ communication module design. On the basis of\nlow-power design, the data acquisition\
    \ module collects temperature, relative humidity,\natmospheric pressure, smoke\
    \ resistance, PM2.5, ultraviolet data and transmits it to the\nCloud platform\
    \ of the Internet of Things through the NB-IoT wireless communication\nmodule\
    \ to realize data storage.\n4.1\nData Collection Module\nTemperature, relative\
    \ humidity, atmospheric pressure, smoke resistance collection: The\nSDA and SCL\
    \ of BME680 sensor in the data acquisition module communicate with\nthe IIC interface\
    \ of PB15 and PB13 of the master controller respectively. When PB15\nand PB13\
    \ are used as the IIC bus interface, the IIC working mode needs to be conﬁg-\n\
    ured for MCU. Turn on the GPIO Clock using the built-in ﬁrmware library function\n\
    RCC_APB2Periph Clock Cmd() and set PB15 and PB13 to IIC mode with GPIO_Init\n\
    struct.pin. At the same time, use GPIO_Init struct. Speed to set the transfer\
    \ Speed to\nGPIO_SPEED_FREQ_LOW, use gpio_initstruct. Mode to set the open output\
    \ Mode,\nand use HAL_GPIO_Init() to initialize the GPIO port. Collect environmental\
    \ parameters\nafter port conﬁguration (Fig. 4).\nCollection of PM2.5 concentration:\
    \ The COLLECTION of PM2.5 concentration is\nmainly connected to the PA2 pin of\
    \ the main controller module through the RX pin of\nthe ZPH02 dust sensor. The\
    \ pin outputs electrical signals in serial port mode, which\nis converted into\
    \ digital signals through the A/D of the main controller, and outputs\nthe CONCENTRATION\
    \ of PM2.5 after processing. PM2.5 detection procedures are as\nfollows:\n638\n\
    Z. Wang et al.\nFig. 4. Flow chart of BME680 sensor subsystem\nint Get_dust25(void)\n\
    { \nif(USART2_RX_BUF[0]==0xff&&USART2_RX_BUF[1]==0x18)\n \n{ \ndust25=(USART2_RX_BUF[3]*100)+USART2_RX_BUF[4];\n\
    return 1;\n} \nelse\nreturn 0;\n} \nUltraviolet parameter collection: In the design\
    \ of ultraviolet data acquisition pro-\ngram, the VEML6070 ultraviolet sensor\
    \ itself can directly convert the ultraviolet light\nsensitivity into digital\
    \ signal. VEML6070 UV sensor detection procedures are as follows:\nBased on Internet\
    \ of Things Platform Using NB-IoT Communication\n639\nu16 VEML6070_ReadValue(void)\n\
    { \nu8  value_h=0;\nu8  value_l=0;\nVEML6070_ReadData(VEML6070_ARA);\nvalue_h\
    \ = VEML6070_ReadData(VEML6070_READ_VALUE2);\nVEML6070_ReadData(VEML6070_ARA);\n\
    value_l = VEML6070_ReadData(VEML6070_READ_VALUE1);\nveml6070_val = (value_h<<8)\
    \ + value_l;\nVEML6070_ReadData(VEML6070_ARA);\nVEML6070_WriteCmd(VEML6070_SLAVE_ADDRESS,VEML6070_SET\n\
    _VALUE);\nreturn veml6070_val;\n} \n4.2\nLow Power Solution\nThe main function\
    \ module is the program design of the whole main controller module\nto control\
    \ other devices, which is mainly reﬂected in two aspects of system power\nconsumption\
    \ processing and data processing. The program design of the main controller\n\
    module mainly realizes the clock setting, the use of serial port initialization\
    \ and the\nprocess of data sending and receiving. After the system is powered\
    \ on, the clock and\nperipherals of the system are automatically initialized.\
    \ After that, the low-power mode\nof the system exits, and RTC is used for periodic\
    \ wake up. After wakeup, I/O and\nperipherals to be used are reconﬁgured to send\
    \ data. After the data acquisition module\nobtains the environmental data from\
    \ the area to be tested, data transmission is carried\nout through IIC communication\
    \ or UART communication.\nIn the design of low power consumption, wireless data\
    \ transmission is adopted. The\nsingle chip microcomputer turns off the power\
    \ of The ZIGBEE module, sets all IO except\nthe burning port to analog input mode,\
    \ and turns off the clock of all peripherals. Then\nthe single chip microcomputer\
    \ enters the STOP mode and uses RTC to wake up at a\ncertain time. Wake up and\
    \ reconﬁgure IO and peripherals to be used and send data.\n4.3\nNB-IoT Wireless\
    \ Communication Module\nThe NB-IoT module connects to the Cloud platform of the\
    \ Internet of Things. The\nimplementation code is as follows:\n640\nZ. Wang et\
    \ al.\nvoid NB_SetCDPServer(uint8_t *ncdpIP,uint8_t *port)\n{ \nmemset(cmdSend,0,sizeof(cmdSend));\n\
    strcat(cmdSend,\"AT+NCDP=\");\nstrcat(cmdSend,(const char *)ncdpIP);\nstrcat(cmdSend,\"\
    ,\");\nstrcat(cmdSend,(const char *)port);\nstrcat(cmdSend,\"\\r\\n\");\nNB_SendCmd((uint8_t*)cmdSend,(uint8_t*)\"\
    OK\",DefaultTimeout,1);\n} \nThe wireless data module needs the CoAP protocol\
    \ to transmit data to the cloud\nserver, and the BC35G device is designed to register\
    \ with the route T/R of the Cloud\nserver of the Internet of Things. The CDP server\
    \ subscribes to the T/D resources of the\nBC35G device and waits for the BC35G\
    \ device to send CoAP instructions to it. If the\nBC35G device receives the +NMGS\
    \ instruction, it transmits data to the CDP server\nthrough the CoAP instruction.\n\
    The CDP server serves as the CoAP client and the BC35G serves as the CoAP server.\n\
    The CDP server sends downlink data to the T/D resource of the BC35G device through\n\
    THE POST method.\n5\nTests and Results\nAfter the design and implementation of\
    \ the software and hardware of the system, the\ndesign of energy capture module,\
    \ data acquisition module, main controller module and\nwireless communication\
    \ module is completed. In order to verify the feasibility and\nstability of the\
    \ system in practical application, we need to test the data collection, NB-IoT\n\
    communication and power consumption of the system.\nComparing the temperature\
    \ data collected by the sensor with the readings of the\ntraditional thermometer,\
    \ it is found that the readings are basically the same, and the\nhumidity, pressure,\
    \ smoke resistance, PM2.5 and ULTRAVIOLET data are basically the\nsame as the\
    \ data obtained by the traditional weather station (Table 1).\nTable 1. Part of\

    \ the system data acquisition test, you need to use multimeter on every pin detection\n\
    circuit of the system, respectively, in order to conﬁrm whether can normal between\
    \ circuit\nelectricity, and need to check each device in the circuit board welding\
    \ in normal state,\nthe electricity, note that each sensor, the main controller\
    \ and wireless communication\nmodule if there is a fever more serious phenomenon,\
    \ To ensure the normal operation of\nthe hardware circuit, the data acquisition\
    \ function of each sensor is tested.\n5.2\nWireless Communication Module Data\
    \ Transmission Test\nAs the terminal software is programmed to upload data once\
    \ every minute (for the\nconvenience of testing, usually once an hour), after\
    \ testing, the data collected by the\ndata acquisition module can be normally\
    \ uploaded to the cloud platform within a certain\ncollection time through the\
    \ wireless communication module after being processed by\nthe primary controller.\n\
    5.3\nSystem Power Test\nThe solar energy capture module is connected to the data\
    \ acquisition module, and the\n3W9V solar panel is used to capture the electricity,\
    \ and two 2.8 V 3000 F supercapacitors\nare used to store the electricity, so\
    \ as to realize the long-term automatic power supply of\nthe system, which has\
    \ a very long battery life and low maintenance cost.\nThrough the current test\
    \ of the whole system, the electricity situation table of the\nsystem is obtained\
    \ (Table 2).\nTable 2. System power usage\nCurrent of the system in standby mode\n\

    \ al.\n6\nConclusion\nThrough the design and development of hardware and software,\
    \ the NB-IoT meteoro-\nlogical monitoring station is realized. The hardware is\
    \ composed of standard weather\nsensors and interfaces with the STM32L051C8T6\
    \ master controller to detect tempera-\nture, humidity, air pressure, smoke resistance,\
    \ PM2.5 and ULTRAVIOLET data in the\nenvironment, and upload the data to the cloud\
    \ platform of the Internet of Things through\nthe NB-IoT wireless transmission\
    \ module. In the design, solar panels and ultracapacitors\nare used to build the\
    \ energy capture module of the system [14], NB-IoT wireless com-\nmunication module\
    \ is built based on BC35 series chips, and a low-power system scheme\nis designed\
    \ with the characteristics of low cost, low power demand, low maintenance\ncost\
    \ and easy to use [15, 18]. Future research directions are as follows:\nSolar\
    \ energy capture method is adopted in this system design, and the volume of\n\
    ultracapacitors is large. In addition, solar energy capture is easily affected\
    \ by weather, so\na more environmentally friendly power generation method can\
    \ be adopted in subsequent\nstudies.\nAdd the NB-IoT wireless data transmission\
    \ module to the storage system to prevent\nthe failure of data uploading to the\
    \ cloud platform due to network connection failure.\nAcknowledgments. This work\

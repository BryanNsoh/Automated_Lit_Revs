  description: The agricultural industry has been transformed by the Internet of Things
    (IoT) revolution, which has brought about cutting-edge solutions to problems relating
    to crop monitoring and management. This article provides a thorough analysis of
    a smart agricultural IoT system created for effective crop monitoring of crop
    moisture and temperature. The objective of this research is to create a comprehensive
    system that can continuously track temperature and moisture levels in agricultural
    fields, giving farmers useful information for smarter crop management decisions.
    To continually monitor and analyse important environmental parameters impacting
    crop growth, the created system incorporates several IoT components, such as wireless
    sensors, actuators, and cloud-based data analytics. Temperature and moisture are
    the two main factors that determine the health, yield, and general quality of
    the crop. Real-time temperature and moisture data are gathered from various points
    inside the agricultural field by the use of wireless sensors. The information
    is subsequently processed and interpreted by sophisticated data analytics algorithms
    on a cloud-based platform. According to the study, the IoT-based system effectively
    regulated environmental temperature, resulting in an average decrease to 26.2°C,
    while concurrently maintaining or improving soil moisture content, evidenced by
    an increase to 45%. Farmers with this guidance can therefore improve their decision-making
    processes and ultimately increase agricultural yield, sustainability, and economic
    consequences by utilising IoT capabilities. Further research and development in
    this area could revolutionized global agriculture and help ensure food security
    in the face of shifting climatic circumstances and rising population demands as
    IoT continues to develop.

    The fifth generation (5G) systems have emerged in the past few years in order
    to support a plethora of multimedia and Internet of Things (IoT) applications
    ranging from high-speed mobile TV to smart agriculture and smart city services.
    Primary innovations of the fifth generation networks (5G) were along the lines
    of three key services: Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) to support high-speed
    wireless access, massive machine-type communications (mMTC) to support services
    that are characterized by a large number of connected devices, transmitting mostly
    non-delay-sensitive data (e.g., smart grid, smart buildings, smart cities, etc.)
    [1], and ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) to support a diverse
    set of IoT applications. However, these existing 5G technologies will still fall
    short in meeting the stringent demands of emerging applications such as extended
    reality (XR) and the metaverse, haptics, brain computer interactions, connected
    autonomy, driverless ground vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles [2] as well
    as large-scale critical infrastructures such as manufacturing systems, power generation
    and distribution, water and sewer systems, agriculture, healthcare, and defense
    and security [3]. In particular, these applications will impose extreme quality-of-service
    (QoS) and quality-of-experience (QoE) requirements that may require new services
    that span across eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC. For example, as shown in [4], XR services
    require a new breed of high rate, highly reliable low latency communication (HRLLC)
    services that combine the rate needs of eMBB with the stringent latency and reliability
    needs of URLLC. To respond to this rapid proliferation of these new applications,
    the Beyond 5G (B5G) – the sixth generation (6G) of wireless systems [5] efforts
    have started to shape up across academia, industry, and the government. 6G promises
    to deliver substantial gains in terms of rate (1 Tbps as opposed to 100 Gbps for
    5G), latency (sub-millisecond as opposed to few milliseconds for 5G), reliability
    (seven nines as opposed to five nines for 5G), and energy (zero-energy goal) while
    also operating as a self-sustaining system that can cater to the dynamics of its
    environment by merging artificial intelligence (AI) with data-driven protocols.
    The promises of 6G cannot be fully realized unless a range of multilevel and multimodal
    technologies are programmed together into the communications infrastructure. Among
    these multilevel and multimodal technologies, some key innovations support high-frequency
    (millimeter wave, sub-terahertz, and terahertz) communication for heterogeneous
    services, integration of sensing and communications, coordination of multi-connectivity,
    and AI-native protocols. In addition to the terrestrial wireless and fiber optic
    systems that will be integrated in 5G and 6G, non-terrestrial satellites constellations
    and drones will also support optimized connectivity of devices according to the
    specified QoS, and where satellites will be utilized to solve “the last mile”
    problem (e.g., in rural areas where cellular infrastructure is physically impossible
    or prohibitively expensive) [6]. The disaggregated, virtualized, self-driven,
    application-specific, and software-oriented network architecture in other related
    technologies such as radio access networks (RAN) services, and open RAN (O-RAN
    enable lower latency, agility, deployment flexibility, real-time responsiveness,
    and reduced operating costs. O-RAN will potentially facilitate the deployment
    and services provided by 5G and 6G. Architecting these different multilevel and
    multimodal technologies together into a communications infrastructure that can
    deliver the full promises of 6G is challenging. As discussed, in order to take
    full effect, enhanced 5G and 6G infrastructure nodes including end-devices, edge/cloud
    servers, base stations, and core network elements, should be equipped with a real-time
    data-driven decision support system enabling its self-sustainment for optimal
    management and adaptive resource management with minimum possible intervention
    from operators. This system should also be able to meet the stringent QoS needs
    in terms of rate, latency, and reliability, while operating in a sustainable,
    energy-efficient ways. Resilience against system anomalies and environmental dynamics
    further requires tomorrow’s wireless cellular systems to embody intelligent analytics,
    data and resource management and different forms of coupling and decoupling mechanisms
    depending on the priority and cost of the tasks assigned. Because deployment of
    a separate communication network for each application scenario is not practical,
    network slicing has been proposed to dynamically allocate the flexible network
    resources to logical network slices according to customized service requirements
    on demand while meeting its highly dynamic and extreme performance requirements
    on latency, data rate, reliability, and other user-defined metrics. While data
    analytics methods (i.e., machine learning) are commonly used to address various
    problems within a single system, the mere application of these methods fall short
    of solving problems at the systems-of-systems level (i.e., context-aware globally
    optimal control of wireless communication networks) due to the high complexity
    and heterogeneity, as well as the dynamically, time-varying inter-operational
    aspects involved. To this end, wireless communication networks can immensely benefit
    from Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS)-based methods, which can
    be used to optimize design features in network and communications infrastructures,
    such as to dynamically allocate the network resources to a given network slice,
    or support energy efficiencies in 5G and 6G network infrastructures as highlighted
    in IEEE/INGR reports [Darema in 7, 8, 9]. DDDAS based methods can be used to adaptively
    manage the associated heterogeneity, hierarchical, decentralized control and real-time
    monitoring of anomalies and dynamics, and adaptive multi-objective optimization
    needs for such environments, and address the “systems-analytics” needed, rather
    than simply “data analytics”. On the one hand, large-scale multi-objective optimization
    problems naturally arise in a plethora of 5G and 6G resource management and network
    slicing systems, and, on the other hand, DDDAS has been proven as an effective
    framework to solve such large-scale problems in the context of other domains such
    as the power grid. As such it is natural to ask for example: What can DDDAS provide
    for supporting energy-efficient and sustainable wireless cellular systems, including
    5G and 6G? The main contribution of this paper to expose how algorithmic, methodological,
    and instrumentation capabilities learned from DDDAS-based methodologies can be
    applied to enable i) optimized and resilient design, ii) self-sustaining resource
    management, iii) operational management, and delivery service quality of the complex
    and highly dynamic 5G/6G communication infrastructures for optimized connectivity
    of devices, low latency, reliability, and agility in extreme URLLC and HRLLC and
    deployment flexibility, real-time responsiveness, and reduced operating costs
    in eMBB and mMTC. Such smart DDDAS capabilities are unswervingly proven for more
    than two decades on adaptive real-time control of various systems, where multi-objective
    optimization and real-time decision-support with the accuracy of full-scale models
    is provided through DDDAS-based methods. Inherent in DDDAS-based methods is the
    integration of high-end and mid-range computing with the real-time, Edge Computing.
    Thus, in the context of 5G and 6G systems, DDDAS naturally encompasses edge computing
    (EC) architectures – a hallmark of tomorrow’s cellular systems – to further bring
    down the latency requirements and enable distributed computing of 5G/6G problems
    at the network edge; and, alleviating the need for central communications with
    a distant cloud over the core network. In this work, we present some preliminary
    results on an example of the DDDAS framework for adaptive and optimized 5G and
    6G services case-examples, to support a microgrid testbed over a 5G/6G communication
    network. 2 Background of 5G and 6G Technologies While communication networks have
    undergone significant improvements, there is still the prospect of increasing
    amounts of data traffic that exceeds the growth rates of new wireless communication
    technologies. This, together with other complexities of 5G and 6G networks calls
    for advanced methods for supporting such systems, and, to this end, DDDAS can
    provide the needed powerful and systematic approaches to further advance these
    emerging communication technologies. DDDAS refers to the concept of dynamically
    integrating computation and instrumentation into a feedback control loop in which
    collected real-time data can be dynamically incorporated into executing models
    of an application. Furthermore, in reverse, the instrumentation process can be
    controlled by the executing model [10]. DDDAS is highly effective for a wide range
    of application areas due to its ability to efficiently analyze and manage dynamic
    conditions in complex systems. Real-time monitoring and control of dynamic systems
    using the DDDAS paradigm and ensuing frameworks has shown promising results, in
    application areas such as semiconductor manufacturing facilities [11], self-aware
    drones [12], transportation systems [13], resilient cyber-space [14] and smart
    (power)grids [15,16,17]. 5G and 6G wireless cellular systems generate vast amounts
    of data about the network conditions that are generated through instrumentation
    of the network-infrastructure, making them a rich resource for network operators
    to exploit to achieve more efficient design and operational management. For 6G,
    leveraging data-driven, self-sustaining protocol that is capable of catering to
    dynamic and multiple functions to autonomously reconfigure the network itself
    is a major requirement [5]. Thus, despite the growing complexity of networks,
    the enormous data volumes generated through the instrumentation of the network-infrastructure
    become an important means of alleviating such complexity. In this regard, we envision
    that DDDAS-based frameworks play a significant role in the wireless communications
    field, since the core of DDDAS is dynamic data assimilation and taking proactive
    and more informed measures for optimum system resiliency and efficiency. In 5G/6G
    networks, resource management processes such as network slicing will play a fundamental
    role. In essence, resource management in a wireless cellular system is a large-scale
    multi-objective optimization problem that seeks to allocate network resources,
    either slices (for network slicing) or resource blocks (RBs) which are the smallest
    time-frequency units for physical resource allocation [5], as a way to balance
    QoS tradeoffs across metrics such as energy, rate, latency, and reliability, among
    others. Naturally, the resource management problem will have to deal with the
    dynamics of the environment, such as the changes in the application services (e.g.,
    mobility of users, change of traffic patterns, etc.) as well as the heterogeneity
    of the services. A major challenge here is to be able to provide a real-time decision
    support system that is able to handle data, and that can introduce minimal overhead
    to the system while solving such large-scale wireless-centric problems. This is
    where DDDAS can play an instrumental role. While DDDAS can be used to support
    the diverse set of services we discussed in Sect. 1, we present two use cases
    where i) DDDAS can be used to maintain QoS at the desired levels under dynamically
    changing networks and ii) a use case shown in Fig. 1 that uses the DDDAS framework
    for supporting the deployment of a micro-grid testbed over a 5G/6G communication
    network. Fig. 1. DDDAS for 5G networks handling microgrid operations Full size
    image 3 DDDAS for 5G Network Design and Optimization The DDDAS framework can support
    methods required to design and manage the operation for resilience in the complex,
    heterogeneous and multimodal 5G&6G communications infrastructures. Opportunities
    where DDDAS-based methods can be used for supporting 5G and 6G systems, are in
    addressing two key challenges presented as examples here and addressed in the
    subsequent case studies discussed in Sects. 3.1 and 3.2: 1) Efficient management
    of energy in wireless networks is very important, due to the much higher power
    of the higher frequency signals, and the need to support new applications with
    improved QoS. This becomes even more critical for 5G and more so 6G systems that
    must leverage high-frequency bands, while supporting energy needs of communication
    messages and signals. Prior work that focuses on energy often has overlooked the
    QoS needs of the users, particularly when it comes to services that require HRLLC-type
    requirements – a key feature for 6G. Communication efficiencies are also key,
    and DDDAS-based methods presented in Sect. 3.1 on transmission of multimedia content
    to mobile wireless users over 5G millimeter wave networks, can improve the QoS.
    2) Self-sustaining real-time decision making in a dynamic manner is central for
    solving resource management problems in 5G and 6G systems. Remarkably, most existing
    approaches, such as optimization-based and reinforcement learning-based solution,
    still require a major overhead in terms of latency and complexity. And, even more
    importantly, these approaches are often restricted to static environments, and
    they cannot scale to the faster, non-stationary dynamics envisioned for the emerging
    5G applications and more so for tomorrow’s 6G applications. Such latency and stationarity
    limitations render existing resource management techniques not suitable for latency
    and reliability-critical services, thus motivating the need for a novel DDDAS-based
    framework, as per the example case study presented in Sect. 3.2. Overall, in order
    to meet the needs of energy efficiencies in wireless networks and the QoS requirements
    of both the network operators and users, a systematic approach that allows for
    the real-time decision making in these dynamic environments and a multi-objective
    optimization is crucial. Thus, this paper focuses on applying the referenced DDDAS
    approaches to design, and manage these complex, multilevel and multimodal 5G&6G
    networking and communication infrastructures in a cognizant and dynamically optimized
    way. 3.1 Case Study I: Transmission of Multimedia Content to Mobile Wireless Users
    In [18], we consider the transmission of multimedia content to mobile wireless
    users over 5G millimeter wave networks. In particular, we focus on rapidly changing
    network dynamics due to user mobility and network topology changes as depicted
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Dynamic matching problem in 5G millimeter wave networks Full
    size image This will, in turn, demonstrate an early result for our ability to
    design intelligent, distributed algorithms (based on multi-agent game theory)
    that can maintain QoS under dynamically changing 5G network; a result that can
    be further expanded with the use of more advanced DDDAS approaches in the future.
    In this prior work, using game theory, we show how a 5G system can particularly
    leverage high-speed millimeter wave links to opportunistically pre-store content
    at the mobile user, thus allowing it to smoothly transition between two base stations,
    as it moves in the network. This, in turn, leads to efficient resource management
    across base stations. A key result can be found in the work by co-author Saad
    [Fig. 7, 18], updated and shown here, as Fig. 3; in this figure is shown how the
    proposed system can maintain a smooth network QoS for a mobile user that is transitioning
    at high speed from being associated with the network slices of a given base station
    to those of another one. Fig. 3. Speed of mobile equipment vs. failure probability,
    reproduced from [18] Full size image In particular, a comparison is made how an
    algorithm that is aware of the dynamics can enable coordination so as to maintain
    a low handover failure (HOF) probability, i.e., a low probability that the high-speed
    user fails to associate with the needed network slices/resources. This figure
    particularly shows the average HOF probability versus the speed of the users,
    and it compares the dynamic-aware approach with a conventional scheme that does
    not make use of the dynamics (and of millimeter wave links) to store information
    at the device. These prior results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can
    significantly reduce the HOF probability by leveraging the information on the
    dynamics (i.e., trajectory) and the network’s topology. [Fig. 7, 18] also shows
    that the algorithm is considerably robust against HOF. For instance, the HOF probability
    decreases for speeds beyond 8 m/s, since higher speed allows the user to move
    for longer distances before the opportunistically stored data is used. The results
    showcase that being aware of the dynamics of the environment leads to better decisions,
    cognizant and optimized, and which will help the network maintain higher QoS levels.
    A key next step would be to introduce a larger-scale DDDAS framework that can
    be used to extend this work across other types of resource management problems
    beyond HOF management and data pre-storage. 3.2 Case Study II: Collaborative Microgrids
    The impact of dynamically adjusting the wireless network configuration is shown
    in a case of DDDAS-based coordination of three interconnected microgrids. These
    microgrids are equipped with numerous sensors whose readings hold importance that
    are subject to change, as the dynamic environment of the microgrids dictates.
    The importance of the sensory data is determined by real-time data filtering and
    detection techniques. More detailed explanation on the application of DDDAS framework
    within the concept of microgrids per se can be found in [11, 15, 17]. In this
    study, we did not only change the fidelity of the data (i.e., number of samples
    collected and integrated into the decision-making process from a specific sensor)
    but also the network configuration by dynamically assigning transmission of the
    high priority sensory data to the slices that have superior capabilities. Figure
    4a shows the dynamic assignment of the sensors to the network slices according
    to the importance ranking of the sensors. A key simulation experiment is conducted
    to assess the effectiveness of such a dynamic assignment approach on the total
    operational cost of the system. Figure 4b shows the difference between static
    and dynamic assignment of the sensors to the different network slices. In the
    former approach, the sensors’ assignment is determined by analyzing the historical
    data. In contrast, in the latter approach, the assignments are made based on the
    real-time ranking of the sensors. In parallel, Fig. 4c shows the total energy
    consumption incurred by communication and computation in a microgrid cluster using
    both approaches. These results constitute only a proof-of-concept that showcases
    how DDDAS can potentially provide a real-world, real-time decision support for
    5G system network slicing. Many future extensions are planned with results expected
    in the near future, including more realistic modeling of the wireless system and
    metrics (e.g., accounting for precise formulations of latency and reliability,
    incorporation of high-frequency bands and integrated sensing and communication
    for 6G, etc.), incorporation of additional services, and the integration of larger-scale
    dynamics. Fig. 4a. Dynamic sensor assignments to the network slices Full size

    Fig. 4c. Normalized total energy consumption Full size image 4 Conclusion The
    paper discusses and demonstrates in example cases how 5G networks can benefit
    from DDDAS-based methods and frameworks akin to those presented in this paper.
    Emerging and communication systems (i.e., 5 G/B 5G (6G)) are appealing, due to
    their desired and advanced properties, the dramatically increasing amount of data
    traffic in today’s IoT applications transcends the capacity growth rates of new
    wireless communication technologies. Furthermore, ensuring efficiencies in the
    design and the operational management of the 5G and 6G infrastructures themselves,
    is in tandem and synergistically related to the applications that will exploit
    the 5G and 6G capabilities. Thus, the deployment and management of the communication
    networks require further attention to achieve conflicting objectives of spectrum
    efficiency, cost/energy efficiency and QoS in terms of low latency and high reliability.
    Addressing this need, the DDDAS framework is very promising since it offers bi-directional
    information flow between decision-making mechanism and the real-time data collected
    from the system to harness the large amount of data systematically. References

  description: Smart agriculture has quickly gained popularity due to the tremendous
    introduction, growth, and integration of modern techniques with conventional agriculture,
    including the internet of things (IoT), computer vision (CV), machine learning
    (ML), big data, edge computing, and cloud computing. With the use of inexpensive
    sensors, smart agriculture aims to improve the effectiveness and sustainability
    of agriculture. These comprise airflow, location, optical, and mechanical sensors.
    Along with the real-time monitoring, identification, and categorization of objects,
    these sensors can be used to gather information about the position of crops and
    assess the condition of the soil. Furthermore, because IoT and open wireless communication
    networks are used in smart-agriculture ecosystems, these channels are vulnerable
    to a variety of cyber threats and security concerns. It has been stated that these
    actions could have a significant negative impact on the economy of a wide range
    of nations due to the rise in harmful assaults on the agricultural industry. Without
    the necessity for a centralized authority, AI and blockchain can be utilized to
    address a number of difficulties related to the deployment and management of smart
    agriculture. The benefits of cloud computing include its capacity to manage enormous
    amounts of data while offering a range of storage alternatives. Edge computing,
    on the contrary hand, provides a faster response time and less latency. The technique
    smart agriculture systems are created is anticipated to change as a result of
    this interaction. As a consequence, the way these techniques are applied is changing
    paradigmatically.

    2022 ISSN Information: DOI: 10.1109/MCE.2022.3193268 Publisher: IEEE The rapid
    evolution of technologies and communications raises the demand for emerging smart
    paradigms, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT aims to transform “things”
    from conventional to a smart object, enabling multiple connected devices to send,
    process, and receive data across multiple locations with minimal or no human involvement.
    Such technology provides several great features to end users, including cost reduction,
    automation, real-time analysis, improving productivity, and better business opportunities.
    IoT technology has been integrated into the operations of smart systems in a wide
    range of critical sectors, such as energy, transportation systems, industrial,
    communication, and healthcare. As a result, the number of IoT-connected devices
    has been growing exponentially and might reach 27 billion by 2025.[1] Thus, from
    a consumer perspective, IoT should be centered on providing safe and automated
    infrastructure in living and nonliving environments. IoT technology plays a vital
    role in allowing smart villages to provide cost-effective and efficient solutions
    for villagers. As the majority of people in different countries live in rural
    settlements with minimum technology and resources, this offers several opportunities
    for developing IoT applications in different important domains within rural settlements.[2]
    For example, villagers regularly use traditional crop harvesting methods, making
    farm management extremely difficult. A smart village includes the agricultural
    IoT, which can help farmers deal with all of the issues associated with farming,
    such as weather and water management. The use of IoT applications and services
    in such a village will improve the quality of life by providing a resilient, cost-effective,
    and sustainable smart village.[3] Even though IoT-based smart villages improve
    the quality of villagers’ lives, developing rural areas as smart villages with
    limited technological resources, such as computational and communication infrastructure,
    remains critical. To address these issues, fog computing is a new emerging technology
    that enables storage, communication, and network functions in a distributed fashion.[4]
    The main principle of fog computing is to extend the cloud closer to IoT devices,
    acting as an intermediate layer between the IoT end user and the cloud. Cloud
    technology has several limitations, such as latency, volume, limited bandwidth,
    data protection, and Internet connectivity. To provide secure, robust, and safe
    telecommunication infrastructures, fog computing offers a great opportunity to
    improve the quality of life for villagers and IoT-enabled smart village consumer
    electronics (CE) devices by offloading security features to multiple fog nodes,
    and providing real-time cyberattack detection near to the data source (see Figure
    1). However, fog computing is not a replacement for cloud computing but it functions
    as an extension of the cloud. Fog computing is considered to be an implementation
    or evolution of edge computing, which is another network paradigm that enables
    technologies to allow computation performed at the edge of the network, closer
    to the data generation points, i.e., sensors.[5] Fog computing shifts the data
    process into a fog node or IoT gateway, which is located within the local area
    network. This is physically more distant from sensors. In addition, the flexibility
    of placing fog nodes anywhere between devices and the cloud is the most significant
    feature that distinguishes fog computing from several implementations of edge
    computing.[5] Figure 1. Fog computing improved security and privacy services in
    IoT-based smart villages. Show All Although IoT-based smart villages aim to improve
    human life and ameliorate the quality of service in several domains, their security
    issues remain a big challenge.[6] Since the term “smart” and “things” often refers
    to technology, such as the IoT, the deployment of such platform in villages introduces
    several cyber threats worth investigating. A Sybil attack, for example, is one
    type of security threat in which an attacker may exploit vulnerabilities in smart
    village networks. In a Sybil attack, a malicious node falsifies its identity and
    excessively broadcasts incorrect information to legitimate nodes, causing a node''s
    resources to be completely drained.[7] In addition, a scanning attack could pose
    a major risk, as such an attack scans vulnerabilities in smart village devices
    and performs malicious activities. Another well-known cyber threat is the man-in-the-middle
    attack, in which an adversary intercepting the network communication between connected
    smart village devices acts as a legitimate device to eavesdrop and steal sensitive
    information. Following this introduction, this article discusses the integration
    of distributed fog computing (DFC) with IoT-based smart villages to improve security
    and privacy services. In addition, this article discusses security-by-design (SbD)
    for an intrusion detection system (IDS) based on DFC in IoT-enabled smart villages
    and explores the potential uses of other emerging technologies with such an environment.
    We also design and implement an IDS for a DFC-based smart village as a case study.
    Finally, this article discusses several open security issues and recommendations
    regarding Fog-to-Things enabled smart villages. DFC-ENABLED IDS The integration
    of fog computing and IoT has driven Fog-of-Things to overcome the cloud limitations
    and provide several advantages. Fog computing improves the security and privacy
    of IoT-enabled smart villages from many perspectives. One of the distinctive features
    of fog computing is that it provides a distributed computing environment, unlike
    cloud computing, which follows a centralized architecture.[6] Therefore, DFC can
    be utilized to provide distributed security solutions, such as IDS. Moreover,
    in such an environment, IoT devices generate a large amount of heterogeneous data
    that require rapid, efficient, and real-time response. The DFC has the ability
    to improve the computational resource of IDS as a security function by working
    closer to the network edge. This can help by providing a lightweight, efficient,
    and rapid mitigation response against several cybersecurity threats. In addition,
    fog computing enables the deployment of parallel and distributed security solutions.
    For example, IDS can be implemented as distributed security functions at multiple
    fog nodes in the context of Fog-of-Things architecture. Thus, enabling a collaborative
    detection and mitigation approach that can share and exchange data to provide
    an effective and robust mitigation approach against several cyberattacks. The
    IDS can benefit from DFC in providing a low latency that allows rapid response,
    resulting in a decrease in potential damages caused by such attacks. Several approaches
    can be implemented to achieve a collaborative IDS in fog computing; however, Fog-of-Things
    IDS architecture has several advantages because it fully leverages the benefits
    of distributed fog nodes in terms of data processing, storage, latency, and scalability.
    In addition, the recourse constraints of IoT devices that require lightweight
    detection are closer to applications and in the proximity of IoT nodes. Therefore,
    utilizing fog architecture in detecting various cyber threats, such as man-in-the-middle,
    sniffing, and eavesdropping attacks, is more effective than the cloud.[8] As Figure
    2 shows, the detection model is hosted locally at each node, while the master
    fog node performs the computation and updates the detection model parameters to
    each node. The architecture reveals that the data can be trained and validated
    at a single node, and distributes the model parameters in parallel to each node,
    enabling a collaborative intrusion detection closer to IoT devices while distributed
    detection nodes exchange the learning parameters with their neighbor nodes through
    the master fog node. The Fog-of-Things IDS architecture allows the building of
    a lightweight, scalable, and rapid detection approach that can effectively and
    efficiently mitigate several cyber threats. Figure 2. Fog-to-Things distributed
    IDS architecture in IoT-based smart villages. Show All IDS-BASED EMERGING TECHNOLOGY
    IN FOG COMPUTING The IDS as a security service can be improved with emerging technologies
    as well as benefit from the architecture of the DFC paradigm in order to enable
    a secure IoT-based smart village that can effectively and efficiently combat several
    cyber threats. We discuss SbD for the possible integration of emerging technologies
    with IDS-based DFC to improve security and privacy solution in smart villages.
    5G Networks The new generation of wireless network technology promises a significant
    revolution in wireless connectivity and network communications. As the IoT environment
    contains a large number of connected devices from several smart domains, which
    communicate with different network topology and protocols, the 5G networks provide
    several benefits over current cellular networks, including fast data transmission,
    low latency, improved capacity, and enhanced coverage for machine type communication.
    The 5G networks also can be a complement with fog computing as such an environment
    cooperates with different network layers requiring fast, reliable, and efficient
    machine-to-machine communication. As the nature of fog computing reveals a decentralized
    architecture that requires a high-frequency transmission rate with minimum delay
    among distributed Fog nodes, such a collaborative security function like a distributed
    IDS can leverage the benefits of 5G technology with fog computing in providing
    rapid and effective security attack mitigation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) AI
    plays a vital role in smart technology and has potential uses of its applications
    within critical domains in smart villages. When speaking of AI, machine learning
    and deep learning (ML/DL) have gained much attention in detecting malicious activities
    and reducing damages to the systems when integrated with security functions, such
    as IDS. The IDS can be employed as a collaborative detection model based on ML/DL
    techniques, leveraging the computational resources, and low latency that are provided
    by DFC to analyze, classify, and mitigate attacks effectively on real time.[9]
    Such features of DFC help develop a lightweight, efficient, and rapid mitigation
    mechanism based on ML/DL techniques, reducing the risk caused by cyber threats
    in smart villages. Software-Defined Network Fog computing can employ software-defined
    networking (SDN) and benefit from its significant features. SDN is a network architecture
    paradigm that enables a network topology to be managed and programmed by software
    applications. As the SDN controller is considered the most important function
    of SDN architecture, the fog layer can utilize the SDN controller to provide the
    anomaly detection approach where the network traffic has to go through a fog node
    or a fog server, in which the SDN controller is hosted.[10] The detection and
    mitigation mechanism provides the controller with updated flow rules to segregate
    and disregard malicious traffic from legitimate traffic. Fog computing provides
    sufficient computational resources for such an implemented detection algorithm
    based on an SDN controller. Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) In addition
    to the SDN, NFV is an emerging technology that employs virtualization concepts
    to its network functions, decoupling network components from underline hardware
    to be all virtualized network functions running as software on standard servers.
    As fog computing operates in a virtualized intermediate layer and virtual machines
    can be dynamically instantiated and removed, the NFV paradigm will benefit fog
    computing by virtualizing different network functions, such as switches, IDS,
    load balancers, and firewalls, and operating those instances over fog nodes.[11]
    NFV also provides flexibility to its virtualized security functions, such as intrusion
    detection and prevention systems, by adapting new rules or instantiating new security
    instances on demand. Blockchain Blockchain technology has been employed with several
    emerging technologies, such as the IoT ecosystem. Blockchain technology follows
    the decentralized architecture by its nature, which can help provide decentralized
    security services for an IoT-based smart village ecosystem. A distributed IDS
    gains several advantages over a single IDS in detecting sophisticated attacks.
    Moreover, distributed IDS nodes need to collaborate and exchange data efficiently
    and effectively between IDS nodes to detect and mitigate a diverse range of cyber
    threats. However, two major challenges with distributed IDS have been observed[12],[13]:
    sharing the information among multiple IDS nodes and computation trust between
    participants. To resolve these issues, blockchain technology ensures the integrity
    of data when sharing and exchanging information among multiple IDS nodes through
    building a trust management model for data sharing. With the advent of fog computing,
    fog nodes can communicate with each other by using blockchain technology without
    the involvement of a centralized authority or third party in the cloud, which
    helps avoid the single point of failure problem.[12] Blockchain technology has
    strong potential and can be integrated with other emerging technology, such as
    SDN and fog computing, to provide a secure, resilient, and more efficient mitigation
    system against several cyber threats in IoT-based smart villages. Big Data Analytic
    The massive amount of heterogeneous data produced from IoT devices requires a
    cost-effective and efficient computational resources method to process, analyze,
    and filter Big Data near IoT devices. The architecture of DFC provides fog data
    services, which comprise several functionalities, such as data management, data
    analysis, data security, and data virtualization.[14] With such features of data
    services in fog architecture, the distributed fog nodes help analyze data in real
    time, providing rapid and efficient decision-making near the IoT sensors. Such
    a lightweight analytical tool implemented based on ML techniques will help in
    analyzing data and selecting the most important features in classifying and detecting
    attacks effectively. CASE STUDY OF DFC FOR SECURE SMART VILLAGE As a case study,
    we have designed and implemented an IDS based on XGBoost and Random Forest using
    DFC. Figure 3 shows the general architecture of our proposed distributed and parallelized
    attack detection process in an IoT-based smart village scenario. In this case
    study, we have several IoT sensors and actuators responsible for capturing real-time
    data from their surroundings and transmitting it to nearby fog nodes for further
    processing. Once the data are received by the nearest worker fog nodes, they compute
    the gradient and send the partial gradient to the master fog node. The master
    fog node aggregates the gradients from all worker fog nodes and sends back the
    new weight to worker fog nodes. The gradients are further used to produce attack
    detection models as an output from the worker fog nodes. This sharing reduces
    overall training time in real time and increases the efficiency of the attack
    detection process. The proposed IDS is based on three different steps. Data acquisition
    and preprocessing: In particular, actual IoT datasets obtained from the IoT environment
    are used to simulate the proposed IDS. The initial features are preprocessed to
    make datasets more generalized and compatible for learning algorithms. Distributed
    learning in fog environment: The learning algorithms are implemented and trained
    on multiple fog nodes. This process can be executed on routing and switching devices
    of the smart village. Attack detection: This phase use the knowledge obtained
    from training to detect attacks. Figure 3. Case study of DFC for secure smart
    village. Show All Performance Evaluation The abovementioned steps are used to
    design and simulate the proposed IDS. The overall experiments of this study were
    performed on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4114 CPU @ 2.20 GHz (2 processors), 128-GB
    RAM, and a 2-TB hard disk. We have used Kubernetes and H2O.ai platform to train
    and test the proposed IDS. The parallelism and distribution are carried out by
    a varying number of machines used during training. The ToN-IoT dataset is used
    to show the effectiveness of the proposed model.[8] This dataset contains various
    recent attacks, such as backdoor, DoS, DDoS, injection, MITM, password, ransomware,
    scanning, and XSS attacks, which are mostly found in IoT-based smart village environments.
    The algorithms mentioned in Kumar et al.''s[13] work were used to design proposed
    IDS using DFC. Figure 4 shows the training time for XGBoost and Random Forest
    using 15 fog nodes. It is clear that the training time decreases with the increase
    in worker fog nodes. We have used multiple evaluation metrics, such as detection
    rate (DR), precision (PR), F1, and false alarm rate to evaluate the performance
    of the proposed IDS, as mentioned in Kumar et al.''s[13] work. Table 1 shows per-class
    prediction results using the ToN-IoT dataset. It is worth noting that the performance
    of both algorithms on the ToN-IoT dataset is effective and has obtained higher
    values (i.e., 86%–100%) for different evaluation metrics. Moreover, we see that
    the FAR for the attack groups has been reduced close to 0%. This indicates that
    the DFC-enabled IDS has huge potential in detecting attacks in a real-time IoT-based
    smart villages environment. Finally, we have compared our work with some recent
    state-of-the-art techniques using the ToN-IoT dataset. Table 2 shows the comparison
    in terms of overall accuracy. The proposed distributed IDS has achieved 99.89%
    and 98.31% accuracy with XGBoost and Random Forest, respectively. This is higher
    compared with the works presented in Alsaedi et al.[15] and Ribeiro Junior et
    al.''s[8] works. Moreover, the proposed framework works in distributed environment
    compared with Alsaedi et al.[15] and Ribeiro Junior et al.''s[8] works that uses
    centralized attack detection approach. Table 1. Per-class prediction results (%)
    for proposed IDS on ToN-IoT dataset. Table 2. Performance comparison with existing
    state-of-the-art techniques using ToN-IoT dataset. Figure 4. Training time analysis
    by varying fog nodes. Show All SECURITY ISSUES AND CHALLENGES Although the integration
    of fog computing in a smart village provides considerable advantages to end users,
    security and privacy issues remain significant challenges. We briefly discuss
    the major security and privacy challenges in the integration of fog computing
    with IoT-based smart villages. Authentication The nature of IoT technology requires
    devices to prove their identity and ensure that IoT devices can be trusted to
    connect and exchange data among IoT objects and fog nodes. Authentication of devices
    is important to avoid cyberattacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks. Many proposed
    authentication schemes were presented in the previous work; however, traditional
    authentication approaches are insufficient and lack scalability. Therefore, a
    lightweight authentication protocol is needed to meet the security requirements
    between IoT devices and fog nodes.[15] As fog computing authenticates many end
    users’ devices simultaneously, to become a part of the network, it lacks real-time
    interaction and causes high latency. Another challenge of authentication is regarding
    trust and service level agreement between different members of interconnected
    services while designing a mutual authentication scheme is another obstacle. Access
    Control Access control is one of the major security protection approaches that
    entails protecting, preserving, and restricting access to a user''s data or service
    from unauthorized access, and allowing the credentials for only authorized entities.
    The main objective of access control is to maintain security and privacy for end
    users and protect data from attacks that attempt to gain unauthorized access and
    perform malicious activities. Due to the involvement of different members of interconnected
    services, “IoT-Fog-Cloud,” maintaining access control between a large group of
    different service providers becomes a challenge. As fog computing comprises many
    fog nodes and data are transmitted among those nodes, it may trigger time delay
    and result in a high latency issue, which affects the access decision to be within
    an acceptable time.[15] Preserving the privacy state while transmitting data from
    one domain to another through fog access control is another challenge in terms
    of maintaining the user''s security and privacy requirements. Data Privacy With
    the rapid growth of several emerging technologies that deal with users’ data,
    privacy constantly becomes a major concern. When discussing privacy, the main
    issues center on how the data are collected, shared, and stored. Due to the increasing
    number of interconnected devices and emerging new technologies that may be integrated
    with other technology architectures, users’ privacy becomes a crucial part to
    maintain and control. An example is sharing users’ data across multiple domain
    architectures, such as IoT-Fog-Cloud. As fog computing follows a distributed architecture,
    in other words, multiple fog nodes scattered and distributed over large areas,
    maintaining data privacy across multiple nodes in different locations becomes
    another challenge.[15] Moreover, fog nodes receive and process data at different
    fog storage levels and forward users’ data to the cloud, such an attack on fog
    node storage will reveal sensitive user data. Therefore, designing new solutions
    for ensuring data privacy is another major challenge. Trust Management Trust management
    is an essential part to be maintained and established to identify a trusted node
    and isolate a malicious node before it is connected to the network. Due to the
    nature of the fog environment, which includes scattered and distributed fog nodes
    over large areas, defining and maintaining the trust status of each node to determine
    whether a node is trustworthy or not becomes a challenge. Another trust management
    challenge is the integration of multiple environments, such as Things-Fog-Cloud,
    which reveals a centralized architecture for the cloud and a distributed environment
    for fog computing. Consequently, designing and maintaining trust management among
    distributed fog nodes is a research issue.[13] Virtualization Technologies The
    primary purpose of network function virtualization (such as SDN and NFV) is to
    enhance network performance while enhancing the network infrastructure''s programmability
    and flexibility. In IoT-based smart villages, the inherent constraints in adapting
    such virtualized infrastructure and ensuring low latency, high throughput, and
    minimal computation overheads are challenging and a research issue. Transition
    From 5G to Beyond 5G The introduction of 5G and the shift to beyond 5G may present
    possible issues for carrier access networks in large-scale DFC installations of
    IoT-based smart villages (e.g., interconnections and interfaces, coordination,
    administration and control, and interconnections between mobile, user plane function
    and fixed carriers). Thus, it will be an interesting research direction to design
    a security solution in such an ecosystem. CONCLUSION In this article, we have
    explored the integration of DFC with IoT-based smart villages to improve the quality
    of life for villagers and CE devices from a security and privacy perspective.
    We have discussed SbD for IDS with the integration architecture of DFC in IoT-based
    smart villages. This article also presented the possible integration of several
    emerging technologies with the IDS-based distributed fog computing to improve
    security and privacy solutions in a smart village. We also designed and implemented
    a case study of an IDS for a distributed fog computing-based smart village. In
    the end, we discussed various security and privacy challenges that require attention
    from the research community. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Keywords: smart agriculture sensors; IoT; precision farming; sensor-based technologies;
    data analytics; interoperability; wireless communication protocols 1. Introduction
    Agricultural systems will be under tremendous pressure to increase food production
    in sustainable ways as the world’s population is projected to nearly double to
    10 billion by 2050 [1]. In order to be prepared for the future, agriculture must
    find inventive solutions to problems like unstable climatic patterns and dwindling
    arable lands. Agricultural frameworks in the modern era face a number of difficulties.
    Unpredictable weather patterns brought on by climate change include more frequent
    droughts and floods. Such unpredictabilities place a severe pressure on conventional
    farming techniques, necessitating a change to more robust agricultural practises
    [2]. Further increasing the need for effective and sustainable agricultural methods
    is the growing loss of arable land, which is mostly linked to urbanisation and
    soil deterioration [3]. The potential of technology intervention shines brilliantly
    in the midst of these difficulties. A ray of hope is provided by precision agriculture,
    which is supported by cutting-edge sensor technologies. By continuously tracking
    crop conditions, weather patterns, and soil health, these devices provide actionable
    data that enable well-informed decisions and prompt treatments. In essence, sensor-based
    technology integration in farming landscapes resolves many of the current problems
    and, more importantly, sets the way for a sustainable and productive agricultural
    future [4]. 2. Sensor-Based Technologies: An Insight into Modern Agricultural
    Practices The era of traditional farming is evolving towards a tech-centric agricultural
    paradigm. Sensor-based technologies, leveraging data, promise enhanced production
    and sustainability. Table 1 highlights key sensor technology advancements and
    their agricultural applications to illustrate this shift. Table 1. Advanced sensor
    technologies being used in modern agriculture. By providing real-time information
    on the qualities of the soil and optimising irrigation and fertilisation, soil
    sensors have transformed precision farming [5]. Farmers can adjust to changing
    atmospheric conditions by using weather sensors to optimise planting and harvesting
    seasons [6]. Crop health and yield are improved by the fine-tuning of microclimatic
    conditions by light and humidity sensors [7]. Spectral imaging-based crop health
    monitors notify farmers to problems like infections or nutritional deficiencies
    and allow for pre-emptive interventions [8]. 3. The Convergence of IoT and Wireless
    Communication in Precision Agriculture Through the incorporation of sensor technology
    and cutting-edge wireless communication systems, the Internet of Things (IoT)
    has transformed agriculture. Transmitting enormous amounts of real-time data over
    great distances, especially in difficult circumstances, becomes crucial as farms
    transform into digital ecosystems. 3.1. Sensor Networks in IoT-Based Agriculture
    Interconnected sensor networks, which collect various agronomic metrics, are agriculture’s
    IoT [9]. Their true value comes from their ability to interface with centralised
    databases and decision-making tools, giving farmers the power to make quick decisions
    based on current data and promoting a precision culture [10,11]. 3.2. Communication
    Technologies: Bridging the Gap Numerous communication protocols, ranging from
    well-established ones like ZigBee to more recent ones like 5G (fifth generation)
    and NB-IoT (NarrowBand Internet of Things) are available in the tech world for
    smart farming. ZigBee provides balanced power and range, making it perfect for
    isolated farms [12], while NB-IoT provides extensive coverage with low energy
    requirements for large-scale agricultural endeavours [13]. With its speed, low
    latency, and dependability, 5G is poised to redefine data transfer [14]. 4. The
    Interplay of Sensor Technologies and Data Management Modern precision agriculture
    is built on a foundation of seamless sensor technology and data management, creating
    a synergy that offers increased agricultural productivity and better resource
    management. 4.1. Need for Interoperability among Diverse Technologies Different
    sensor systems used in smart agriculture have unique data formats and protocols
    [15]. Interoperability becomes more important as systems become more complex.
    Enhanced interoperability optimises yield and resource consumption by consolidating
    and coherently analysing data. 4.2. Data Analytics, Management Techniques, and
    Challenges Artificial intelligence and smart algorithms help with the rigorous
    management and analysis of the massive amounts of data from sensors [16]. Making
    the transition from raw data to usable insights presents difficulties, such as
    managing storage and protecting data privacy. To solve this, you need to have
    a solid grasp of agriculture and be an expert data manager. 4.3. Techniques for
    Sensor Data Analytics and Management To analyse huge amounts of sensor-generated
    data, advanced analytics, from classical statistical techniques to contemporary
    machine learning, are required. An overview of these analytics and management
    methods for agricultural sensor data is provided in Table 2. Table 2. Comprehensive
    overview of sensor data analytics and management techniques in precision agriculture.
    5. Future Perspectives and Current Challenges in Sensor-Based Agriculture The
    nexus of sensor development, telecommunications, and artificial intelligence is
    the next frontier in agricultural technology. These cutting-edge fields, while
    they hold the potential for paradigm-shifting effects, are also rife with complex
    problems that each call for in-depth investigation. 5.1. Potential of 5G Technology
    and AI Predictive Modelling 5G’s ultra-reliable low latency promises more than
    fast data transfer, facilitating real-time analysis in distant agricultural fields
    [22]. AI (artificial intelligence) predictive modelling, enhanced by real-time
    data, offers precise forecasts, from weather to pest detection [23]. 5.2. Challenges:
    Cost, Data Privacy, System Compatibility, Energy Management Economic difficulties
    arise with the adoption of cutting-edge technologies, particularly for agrarians
    who are resource-constrained [24]. Increased encryption and security measures
    are required due to the increase in data [25]. In order to combine several digital
    platforms in agriculture, seamless system compatibility is essential [26]. Energy
    conservation, notably the use of renewable energy for sensors, must be prioritised
    [27]. For a thorough summary of the obstacles and future directions for sensor-based
    agriculture, see Table 3. Table 3. An analytical synopsis of prospective avenues
    and challenges in sensor-based agriculture. 6. Conclusions With the combination
    of cutting-edge sensor technology and data-driven innovations, agriculture’s historical
    evolution is ready for yet another important revolution. This discussion went
    deep into the technical details of these technologies and highlighted how they
    might affect present and future agricultural endeavours. The analysis of our research
    yields the following key conclusions: Primacy of Sensor Integration: Sensor technologies
    that track factors like soil quality, weather erraticness, light, humidity, and
    crop health are largely responsible for the advancements in precision agriculture.
    They have fuelled data-centric farming methods by offering granular insights,
    assuring the best use of resources and raising yields. Sensor Technologies and
    Data Management Confluence: Different sensor technologies add different data formats
    and communication protocols to the agricultural tapestry as they are woven in.
    Thus, interoperability is essential for achieving a seamless connection. A sophisticated
    analytics and management solution is also required to transform the massive amount
    of collected data into a useful agricultural strategy. Prospective Technological
    Boons: The impending use of 5G technology and the skill of AI predictive modelling
    are positive signs for the future of agriculture. These tools could revolutionise
    agricultural decision making since they promise accurate forecasting and real-time
    data transfer. Inherent Challenges: Even with advances in technology, significant
    problems still exist. These cover issues including the price tag associated with
    adopting new technology, protecting data privacy in an era of information overload,
    establishing system interoperability among various tech solutions, and dealing
    with energy management for remote sensor operations. Implications for Upcoming
    Research: Focused Investigation: Future studies may benefit from focusing on particular
    sensor types as technology continues to progress. This would enable a deeper investigation
    of the problems and applications that are unique to them. Holistic System Design:
    The creation of complete systems that integrate various sensor technologies should
    be prioritised in order to streamline data collection, processing, and the extraction
    of insightful information. Broader Dimensions: Prospective studies ought to extend
    beyond the strictly technical to include ethical considerations of data privacy
    and the larger socio-economic effects of technology adoption in agriculture. Fundamentally,
    even while the fusion of sensor-based technology with agriculture ushers in a
    new era of productivity and sustainability, the road ahead is not without obstacles.
    However, the advantages they offer vastly outweigh these challenges, prompting
    a concerted effort by academics, technologists, and agricultural stakeholders

    IEEE Conference Location: Trichy, India SECTION I. Introduction Water is a basic
    necessity for all the life forms on Earth [1], [2]. It is well known that water
    is the main reason behind Earth being the only living planet. It is impossible
    for any living being to live without water [3], [4]. Without water, a plant cannot
    perform its essential photosynthesis. It is understandable that if the problem
    of water scarcity continues to increase, it will remove the greenery in the future.
    As a result of which, there will be less rainfall. Water is also essential for
    agricultural production and food security [5]–[7]. Technology has always served
    to overcome such problems and to make lives easy with its innovations. Here through
    this study one such solution is introduced, named ‘lOT based Soil Management System,’
    a model for controlling irrigation that uses IoTto sense soil moisture with temperature
    and humidity of the surroundings with a microcontroller to make an intelligent
    irrigation system to help millions of farmers and University gardeners [8], [9].
    Soil moisture is critical to plant growth, and maintaining the right amount of
    moisture can help plants grow faster and produce better yields. An efficient soil
    moisture management system can help conserve water by reducing the water needed
    for irrigation [10], [11]. A soil moisture management system can help reduce water
    usage and lead to cost savings of water bills and other expenses. By managing
    soil moisture levels, it helps to maintain soil health and reduce erosion, which
    is essential for sustainable agriculture [12]–[14]. Farmers and growers can proactively
    avoid drought conditions and other weather-related risks that can harm crops by
    monitoring soil moisture levels [15]–[17]. To evaluate the link between soil moisture
    readings acquired from soil moisture sensors and the gravimetric approach, a study
    was conducted at the Water Technology Centre farm (WTC) at Hyderabad based college
    [18]. In 2021, Fengfei et al.''s Portable PHS Method for Moisture in the Soil
    Monitoring Based on Thermal Effect is implemented. The results were compared to
    those obtained using the drying procedure, confirming the practicality of the
    suggested method [19]. In 2019, G. S. Swileam et al. assessed soil heterogeneity
    utilising electrical resistance for typical alluvial soils in Egypt [20]. In 2018
    smith et aI., proposed a system for efficiently maintaining optimal soil moisture
    levels for crops using various traditional soil management systems [21]. Gupta
    et al. (2020) analyze whether rooftop harvesting of rainwater and outline bunding
    enhances the moisture in the soil. Their effects on yields of crops, availability
    of water, and soil moisture management are examined [22]. Contour plowing, terracing,
    and checking dams in arid environments are the main focus of this study by Patel
    et al. It assesses their ability to reduce soil moisture evaporation and increase
    water retention [23]. To measure the soil moisture content, humidity, and temperature
    using Raspberry Pi Pico and other sensors to minimize the over-watering and under-watering
    of plants. This paper deals with multiple sensors/modules and Raspberry Pi Pico
    to measure the current readings of the soil & surrounding of the University plants,
    analyze them, display the measurements on the webpage, and automatically water
    the plants when required by connecting them to a water pump. IoT-based soil management
    systems can collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather conditions,
    and other relevant factors. This enables farmers and growers of the university
    to make data-driven decisions and respond quickly to changes in soil moisture
    levels. Farmers and growers can remotely monitor soil moisture levels and other
    factors with this system. This can save time and reduce the need for manual labor
    in the field. The curated system can automate the irrigation process based on
    soil moisture levels and other data. Intelligent systems can help reduce water
    waste and improve crop yields. IoT -based soil management systems can be easily
    scaled to accommodate more significant areas of farmland or garden spaces in universities.
    These innovative systems are also suitable for large-scale agricultural operations
    and smaller-scale applications. SECTION II. Proposed Work This IoT -based system
    deals with multiple sensors/modules and Raspberry Pi Pico to measure the current
    readings of the soil & surroundings, analyze them, display the measurements on
    the website, and automatically water the plants when required by connecting to
    a water pump. The system uses micro python to interface the sensors and modules
    with the microcontroller Raspberry Pi Pico. This project deals with the automatic
    watering of plants whenever the moisture, humidity, and temperature level decreases
    to a specific standard limit. The working of proposed model consists of a soil
    moisture sensor and a temperature humidity sensor, which tracks the soil moisture
    along with the humidity and temperature of the surroundings. When the measurements
    exceed the required standard readings, the relay directs the motor to pump water
    to plants. This model will benefit people with large patches of gardens, Universities,
    or those farther from their places. The proposed system has advantages in reducing
    costs, restricting water waste, and minimizing physical interference. It also
    promotes irrigation that requires little maintenance and is environmentally friendly.
    In order to regulate the water flow, a relay module has been installed. The model
    shows expected impacts at various levels of humidity and temperature. Figure 1
    shows the proposed model of our IoT -based system. Fig. 1: Proposed IoT-based
    system for Soil Moisture management system Show All SECTION III. Methedologies
    Used The Soil Moisture Sensor yields real-time data in the form of an analog.
    Analog to Digital (A/D) and data conditions are converted using Raspberry Pi Pico
    Microcontroller. The Microcontroller is used to acquire real-time soil moisture
    using a soil moisture sensor. The Thonny Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
    is a cross-platform application that supports high-level programming languages
    like Python. The IDE makes writing code and uploading the source program to the
    board easy. It contains libraries and cores. The samples are measured from low
    to High moisture contents of the soil. The gardener can get the processed data
    through the webpage with the help of Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Technology. This
    system can give real-time data on soil moisture. The Soil moisture system is connected
    to the web page. We have interfaced the soil moisture sensor, DHTII Module, and
    relay with a Raspberry Pi Pico to measure the volumetric concentration of water
    inside the soil and the humidity and temperature of the surroundings. This system
    uses Raspberry Pi Pico as a microcontroller, which is then connected to the Moisture
    Sensor, which measures the soil''s moisture content. Raspberry Pi Pico acts as
    the central brain of the IoT-based soil moisture management system, responsible
    for data collection, processing, analysis, communication, and automated control.
    It is also linked to DHT -11, the Temperature and Humidity sensor, which measures
    the ambient temperature and humidity. The Pico is also connected to the Wi-Fi
    module ESP-Ol, bridging the divide between the hardware and software components
    of the system shown in fig. 2. The measurements of the above sensors and modules
    and the standard measurements will subsequently be displayed for users on our
    self-designed website using the ESP-Ol. Fig. 2. Schematic Layout of our Proposed
    System Show All SECTION IV. Experimentation & Model Evaluation The proposed intelligent
    system captures data in real-time using a range of sensors and modules shown in
    fig. 5. University gardeners use these sensors to assess soil and environmental
    conditions. The soil management system we built is responsible for several duties.
    It begins by measuring the soil moisture content using a capacitive soil moisture
    sensor and then monitors the humidity and temperature of the surrounding environment
    with a DHTII Module. All plants have a threshold value set to standard soil moisture
    content for home/university gardeners. When the moisture level falls below the
    set standard/threshold level, the relay module turns the Motor On and begins pumping
    water to the plants from the tank until the moisture level returns to the desired
    level. The measurements mentioned above’ readings will be shown on a website built
    with the ESP-OI, which we designed with HTML and CSS and coded in Python. Fig.
    3 shows the hardware connection of sensors/modules to Raspberry Pico and figure
    4 depicts the Circuit diagram of the connection of all the sensors, modules, and
    motors. Fig. 3. Hardware connection of sensors/modules to Pico Show All Fig. 4.

    our proposed System Show All SECTION V. Result Analysis & Validation The analysis
    of the results demonstrates the efficacy of IoT-based watering systems in sustaining
    optimal soil moisture levels for plant growth in the university. These systems
    provide optimal irrigation, water conservation, improved plant health and growth,
    resource efficiency, data-driven insights, remote monitoring and control, and
    flexibility. Using IoT technology, plant owners, farmers, and gardeners can achieve
    precise and effective watering techniques, resulting in healthier and more robust
    plants. The moisture reading experiments conducted at our University on different
    plants and shrubs can provide valuable insights into plant water requirements
    and watering patterns shown in fig. 6. Fig. 6. Soil moisture reading experimentation
    done at our University''s Plants & Shrubs Show All The collected data on moisture
    readings from the different plants and shrubs helps in understanding their specific
    water requirements and watering patterns. This IoT-based system enables informed
    decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling, optimization of water management
    practices, and adjustment of watering parameters based on the specific needs of
    each plant species. The model then starts measuring and taking the readings displayed
    on the Thonny Shell shown in fig. 7. Table I shows the soil moisture readings
    from the capacitive soil moisture sensor & level of accuracy of the sensor when
    compared to the recommended moisture level. Fig. 8 depicts the soil moisture level
    and the recommended moisture needed for the plants. The relationship between soil
    moisture levels and the recommended moisture level for plants is graphically represented
    in Figure 8. Individuals can make informed decisions to promote healthy plant
    growth, conserve water, and preserve natural and agricultural ecosystems by comprehending
    this relationship. Gardeners can decide when and how much to water their plants
    by monitoring soil moisture and using the specified range. Avoiding under watering
    and overwatering optimizes plant growth and conserves water. Water management
    influences the ecological balance and is essential for plant and animal survival.

  description: The unprecedented growth of population in urban areas has been causing
    a challenge for the citizens in their day-to-day lives such as road congestion,
    public security, environmental pollution, electricity shortage and water shortage.
    To control and resolve all these issues, new technologies have been developed
    for smart cities. Intelligent services and better applications are deployed in
    smart cities, by combining the Internet of Things (IoT) with the technologies
    like data mining (DM) and deep learning (DL). Many sectors like healthcare, governance,
    agriculture and public safety can increase their efficiency with the help of these
    new technologies and can convert these into smart applications for smart cities.
    Different kinds of computing like edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing
    support to provide better insights into analytics with the help of big data in
    smart cities. All these technologies are transforming or raising healthcare ecosystems,
    leading them in the direction of smart healthcare. This permits surgeons to get
    real-time data of their patients distantly with the help of wireless communication.
    Smart healthcare is established on new technologies to convey enriched and valued
    healthcare facilities for patients. This chapter explores the current challenges
    that are faced during the indigenous development of the smart cities. Furthermore,
    the chapter discusses the theoretical background of smart cities with the explanation
    of their components. Moreover, the chapter describes the necessity of computational
    infrastructure for smart cities in a framework of big data and DM. The chapter
    highlights some mining methods for extracting important information from huge
    and mixed data. Additionally, the chapter examines the advancement of healthcare
    sector in smart cities in context of big data and DM.

    Internet of Things (IoT) provide a promising Smart irrigation facilitator for
    continual monitoring and control of environmental parameters, thereby leading
    to a huge volume of data to be efficiently collected, transferred, processed and

  description: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are autonomous devices employed as
    data collectors in precision agriculture to support a large number of applications.
    These UAVs gather data from on-the-ground wireless sensor networks, especially
    in scenarios that lack any kind of fixed communication infrastructure or where
    the available infrastructure does not fit the application requirements. Sensors
    on the ground can store sensing data, and in scenarios that do not require a real-time
    observation and analysis of the data, like in smart farming, a drone can be used
    maybe once or two times each day to collect and report the data to a command-and-control
    center that use them directly, without any other infrastructure (cloud or edges).
    In this article, we study analytically how close the drone, that uses a LoRa radio,
    needs to fly over the sensors to collect data with a given quality of data collection.
    This can be used to properly spacing the sensors on the field at deployment time,
    to select among different type of drones, and to properly solve some tradeoff
    related to field size vs autonomy of the drones and the path used by the latter
    when collecting the data.

    Keywords: agriculture 5.0; drones; remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs); precision
    agriculture; remote sensing; Internet of Things (IoT); digital agriculture; sustainable
    development goals; sensors; agricultural robots 1. Introduction Constant industrial
    innovation has made it possible that 2021 has been officially marked by the European
    Commission as the beginning of the era of “Industry 5.0” [1]. The industrial world,
    including the agricultural sector, is starting this year by getting a bit closer
    to digitalized and automated systems. Although, agriculture began in the Copper
    Age, after the Neolithic period, when man started cultivation by making use of
    wooden instruments and domesticating animals, this was then revolutionized through
    the use of metallic equipment for crop cultivation and this time was categorized
    as the first and second agricultural revolutions. The third and fourth industrial
    revolutions brought robotics, machines, telecommunication systems, genetic decoding,
    etc., to agriculture. The fifth and current revolution is based on artificial
    intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, applied to agricultural remote sensing
    (RS). A simple illustration of all the principal industrial revolutions, with
    respect to agriculture, is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1. An illustration of
    industrial revolutions, with respect to agriculture, over time. Representative
    events/technologies are mentioned in each respective technological era, although
    they are not limited to only these. The increasing world population, climate change,
    and sustainable development goals require the agriculture sector to be efficient
    and sustainable: thereby ensuring food safety and security. According to the Food
    and Agriculture Organization (FAO), current agricultural production must increase
    by 70 % by 2050 considering the increasing demand for high quality and environmentally
    friendly food [2]. Similarly, on 25 September, 2015, the United Nations (UN) general
    assembly approved the agenda “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
    Development”, which is an action plan for the prosperity of people and the planet
    [3]. Under this agenda, 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were embodied,
    replacing the previously established Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), with
    a timeframe of completion from 2015 to 2030. Out of these 17 SDGs, the second
    SDG is “zero hunger”, i.e., eradicating the hunger, as it was estimated that,
    in 2015, around 690 million people were suffering from hunger [3,4]. This situation
    has worsened with the COVID-19 pandemic by affecting food transport systems and
    threatening people’s access to food due to the associated loss of income or increased
    food prices. In this context, FAO considers that agriculture can contribute to
    achieving the SDGs, particularly SDG-2, by providing healthy food that is directly
    related to better health and a productive life. The aims of SDG-2, to eliminate
    hunger and ensure access for all people, particularly the poor and in vulnerable
    situations, including infants, to healthy, nutritious, and sufficient food all
    year round (goal 2.1: SDG-2), are very ambitious. Nevertheless, agriculture has
    the potential to fulfil these objectives by enhancing the income of small-scale
    farmers (goal 2.2: SDG-2), strengthening the capacity to combat climate change,
    extreme weather events (e.g., droughts, fires, floods and other disasters), and
    progressively improving soil and land quality (goal 2.4: SDG-2). However, in order
    to do all of the above, a change is required in the way in which all stakeholders
    in the agri-food ecosystem approach the production process. The first and perhaps
    the most important step towards this goal is to change the way decisions are made
    at all levels of agricultural production, from the most primary level of the farmer
    who is called upon to make decisions every day on his cultivation to the agronomists
    and decision makers in large agri-food enterprises. Storage and analyses of large
    volumes of data (big data) for predictions (e.g., production or spread of diseases)
    but also for the possibility for agri-food companies to produce, from the data
    collected by digitization of production, information that is relevant to the value
    of their products and services. Therefore, a promising technology like RS can
    be an efficient tool to support agricultural sustainability. As an example, having
    RS as a novel tool to face adversities in agriculture, especially in developing
    countries, will produce positive effects in the global economy (maintaining the
    cost of agricultural products), will reduce the scale of economic emigration (often
    due to one or several years of low crop yield), and will help distribute richness
    more evenly across the planet [5,6]. In this 5th industrial revolution, RS has
    the potential of being one of the most important technologies for today’s agriculture.
    This is why RS, in the context of “agriculture 5.0”, is discussed in this article.
    RS sprouted in the 19th century (specifically in 1858) through the use of air
    balloons for aerial observations [7]. At present, it occupies a central position
    in precision agriculture (PA) and soil studies. It is also important to mention
    some of the interchangeable terms most commonly used include “precision farming”,
    “precision approach”, “remote sensing”, “digital farming”, “information intensive
    agriculture”, “smart agriculture”, “variable rate technology (VRT)”, “global navigation
    satellite system (GNSS) agriculture”, “farming by inch”, “site specific crop management”,
    “digital agriculture”, “agriculture 5.0”, etc. RS is a vast term that covers various
    technological systems, such as satellites, RPAs, GNSS, geographic information
    systems (GIS), big data analysis, the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of
    Everything (IoE), cloud computing, wireless sensors technologies (WST), decision
    support systems (DSS), and autonomous robots. A remarkable breakthrough in RS
    technology occurred approximately fifty years ago with the advent, and later with
    launch, of Landsat-1 in 1972 [8]. Given the importance of such technologies, a
    rapid increase in investigations in the agricultural domain has been witnessed
    in terms of the number of publications. For example, in the last five years (2015–2019)
    the highest number of publications regarding the use of RPAs in agriculture belonged
    to Europe at 34%, followed by United States and China at 20% and 11%, respectively
    [6]. Primary work on RS has mainly been focused on the reflection mechanism, absorption,
    and diffusion of light rays from plant leaves, which differ based on the leaf
    thickness, structure, and pigment content of plant species [9]. Nevertheless,
    during the last decade, the scenario has changed and RS technology has been entirely
    revolutionized. Current studies are more related to designing novel algorithms,
    improving sensor technology, and the incorporation of artificial intelligence.
    In addition, agricultural RS is now experiencing a shift from structural parameter
    monitoring to functional trait monitoring, e.g., nitrogen contents, foliar and
    canopy functional traits, pigments, etc. For example, a profound characterization
    of spatiotemporal variability of chlorophyll a and b contents has been recently
    undertaken [10]. The “SmartAgro” project is a Romanian national project with the
    aim of developing a self-diagnosing and self-configuring telemetry system, enabling
    the use of IoT for areas with limited global system for mobile communication (GSM)
    signals [11], and is an example of improving the potential of RS by filling in
    research gaps. Similarly, various projects by the European Union (EU), such as
    “VIRTUOUS”, “NEWBIE”, “SWAMP”, etc., are also oriented to strengthen modern precision
    agriculture by utilizing state-of-the-art computational technologies [12,13,14].
    In the same way, the creation of new AI-enabled software and applications is underway,
    which can verbally communicate with users and receive commands, e.g., AgroHub
    [15]. Quite a number of review articles, with respect to RS, are also available
    now—discussing or comparing particular aspects of these novel technologies. For
    example, a few of the reported studies, just in past three years (2018–2020),
    have discussed topics like plant biodiversity, monitoring of a particular crop,
    highlighting various applications, discussing substantial improvements to different
    platforms or technologies, use of particular technology, weed management, data
    management, underlining limitations, and hinting towards opportunities in this
    field [7,11,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40].
    Such a huge number of publications emphasize the tenacious necessity of using
    RS technologies in agriculture. Similarly, this increasing number of studies also
    depicts the significant progress of RS technology in the agricultural sector.
    The persistent need for food safety and security [9] is a driving factor for the
    incorporation of RS technologies into farms. Furthermore, the restriction of free
    movement and transport due to the current COVID-19 pandemic are impeding agricultural
    growth, which necessitates the implementation of RS technology for a better, economical,
    secure, efficient, and profitable industry. Therefore, the scope of this article
    is, not only to incite future research in this sphere, but also to highlight the
    importance of RS in ensuring food safety and security given the rapidly increasing
    world population. Similarly, the potential of RS to ensure sustainable agriculture
    is also described with its respective products. Correspondingly, research gaps
    are emphasized, based on the current status of these technologies, along with
    possible opportunities and the enabling technologies of this era. This work has
    four sections. The first section highlights the prominent features of RS technology
    (i.e., RS technology products, data retrieving approaches, most commonly used
    vegetation indices, and spectral bands) and identifies current research efforts.
    The second section indicates the potential and applications of artificial intelligence
    to complement RS technology with respect to the 5th industrial revolution. In
    this regard, research gaps and challenges are also discussed. The third section
    deals with sensors used in RS; novel technologies and opportunities that this
    new technological era offers are also discussed. Similarly, the most common platforms
    of RS technology (i.e., satellites and RPAs) with practical examples in agriculture
    are presented in this section. Finally, the fourth section highpoints the research
    gaps and future potentials of RS technology, with examples, where possible, for
    guaranteeing agricultural sustainability and making the best use of the 5th industrial
    revolution. 2. Agricultural Remote Sensing Agricultural remote sensing is a very
    useful technology that allows us to observe crops on a large scale in a synoptic,
    remote, and non-destructive manner. Usually, it involves a sensor mounted on a
    platform, which could be a satellite, RPA, unmanned ground vehicles (UGV), or
    a field robot. The sensor collects the reflected or emitted electromagnetic radiation
    from plants, which is then further processed to produce useful information and
    products. This information consists of traits of the agriculture system and their
    variations in space and time. Functional traits have been defined as the biochemical,
    morphological, phenological, physiological, and structural physiognomies that
    regulate organism (plant) performance or fitness [18]. These traits vary from
    one plant to another and from one location to other, and can be categorized as
    typological-, biological-, physical-, structural-, geometrical-, or chemical-based
    in terms of their respective natures. RS provides an effective relation between
    the radiance of plants and the respective traits to extract useful information,
    e.g., leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll content, soil moisture content, etc.
    Nevertheless, a number of factors, like the crop phenological stage, crop type,
    soil type, location, wind speed, precipitation, humidity, solar radiation, nutrient
    supply, etc., need to be known to generate accurate information from RS products.
    Among others, plant density, organ computing, LAI, green cover fraction, leaf
    biochemical content, leaf orientation, height, soil and vegetation temperature,
    and soil moisture are prominent informational products that RS delivers. This
    information is further processed and used to interpret crop health, disease infraction,
    irrigation period, nutrient deficiency, and yield estimations. Weiss et al. [18]
    categorized agricultural data retrieving approaches from RS into the following
    three principal categories: Purely empirical methods: establishing a direct relationship
    between a measured RS signal and biophysical variables (linear and nonlinear regressions:
    machine learning). Mechanistic methods: model inversion based on Maxwell’s equations
    (for radar interferometry and polarimetry), optical and projective geometry (for
    LiDAR and photogrammetry), and radiative transfer theory (for solar and microwave
    domains). Contextual methods: processing the spatial and temporal characteristics
    of captured images using segmentation techniques. Another way to describe information
    treatment using RS technology is the preparation of vegetation indices (VIs).
    Most commonly, VIs calculated using RS, among others, include: normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) for crop monitoring and empirical studies; soil-adjusted
    vegetation index (SAVI) for improving the sensitivity of NDVI to soil backgrounds;
    green normalized difference vegetation index (gNDVI) for estimating the photosynthetic
    activity; wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) for enhancing the dynamic
    range of NDVI; chlorophyll index–green (CI–G) for determining the leaf chlorophyll
    content; modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) for reducing the influence
    of bare soil on SAVI; optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) for calculating
    aboveground biomass, leaf nitrogen content, and chlorophyll content; chlorophyll
    vegetation index (CVI) for representing relative abundance of vegetation and soil;
    triangular vegetation index (TVI) for predicting leaf nitrogen status; normalized
    green red difference index (NGRDI) for estimating nutrient status; visible atmospherically
    resistant index (VARI) for mitigating the illuminating differences and atmospheric
    effects in the visible spectrum; crop water stress index (CWSI) for measuring
    canopy temperature changes and dynamics; and photochemical reflectance index (PRI)
    for detecting disease symptoms [7]. Normally sensors used in RS that are for crop
    monitoring detect the following electromagnetic wave bands, depending on specific
    objectives [7]: Thermal infrared band; Red, green, and blue (RGB) bands; Near
    infrared (NIR) band; Red edge band (RE). The amplitude of the information retrieved
    from RS is considerable to support sustainable agriculture capable of feeding
    a rapidly growing world population. Among the prominent advantages or applications
    of RS are the identification of phenotypically better varieties, optimization
    of crop management, evapotranspiration, agriculture phenology, crop production
    forecasting, ecosystem services (related to soil or water resources) provision,
    plant and animal biodiversity screening, crop and land monitoring, and precision
    farming [8,18,19,40,41,42]. 3. Artificial Intelligence and RS In this new era
    of computing, the pace of technological advancement is reaching peaks as it never
    has before. Artificial intelligence (AI) has vast potential in the agricultural
    field, although it has not been fully explored in this sphere and is still in
    its infancy. One of the subsets of AI is machine learning, which is used for operating
    definite tasks using a computer system [43] and is generally divided into supervised
    and unsupervised learning techniques. Similarly, neural networks, another basic
    pillar of AI, provide the basis for deep learning algorithms by recognizing patterns
    [44]. Although deep neural network (DNN) became famous in 2016, due to engineering
    complexities they are not very popular today. Instead, convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) and recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures are becoming more popular
    and their application can be found in object detection, classification, segmentation,
    etc. [28]. It has been previously reported that machine and deep learning techniques
    are playing pivotal roles in the following three main domains of RS [10]: Classification
    problems [45,46]; Model emulators development [47,48]; Complex empirical relationships
    [49,50]. Nonetheless, there is plenty of room to make the best use of these techniques
    that has not previously been undertaken. For example, Weiss et al. [18] reported
    that despite the potential to account for contextual information in space and
    time based on historical series, machine learning has been mainly exploited to
    estimate variables at the pixel and instantaneous level. Likewise, it is also
    important to consider the limitations of artificial intelligence tools applied
    to agricultural RS through the construction of training databases. The machine
    learning algorithms, describing the relation of causality between inputs and outputs,
    often cannot solidify the full complexity of a diverse relationship due to oversimplifications
    in reality [18,40]. Such limitations need to be resolved. The 5th industrial revolution
    is expected to address the challenges faced in RS to enhance the proficiency and
    productivity. One of the most important areas in agricultural RS is plant stress
    detection. In this regard, image classification is the foremost area of deep learning
    application and gives a diagnostic decision (healthy or diseased) based on the
    input (one or two related images). For example, A CNN was used to detect and classify
    individual lesions and spots on a plant leaf, allowing to identify multiple diseases
    on the same leaf [51]. Researchers reported an increased accuracy of 12% compared
    to previously reported methods, which was over 75% overall. Similar applications
    to stress (biotic and abiotic) classification using AI principles have been reported
    using deep learning principles in apple, cassava, wheat, maize, tomato, soybean,
    grapevine, coffee, and rice [51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67].
    In the same way, various studies on segmentation and object detection, subsets
    of deep learning, include studies on cucumber diseases [68], fruit crop diseases
    [69], rice leaf diseases [70], cucumber leaf disease [71], tomato diseases and
    pests [57], grapevine esca disease [61], maize disease [72], strawberry disease
    [73], and sweet pepper disease [74]. Likewise, AI methods have been implied in
    diverse agricultural contexts, including high-throughput phenotyping [5], yield
    prediction [75], fruit detection [76], weed detection [77], and biomass studies
    [78]. Crops undergo a continuous change in their physiological characteristics
    over their lifecycles, and these physiological changes are greatly affected by
    stress (biotic or abiotic). AI is paving the way to make detection and identification
    processes of plant diseases faster, among other RS applications, but it is only
    based on obtained images, which hinders earlier detection of disease. Similarly,
    most of the commercial hyperspectral imaging sensors used in RS platforms can
    only work optimally under laboratory conditions. The other challenge is a lack
    of datasets for deep learning-assisted applications. Another commonly associated
    product of RS technology in relation to AI is the decision support systems (DSS).
    Therefore, it would be important to highlight the potential and roles of DSS in
    agricultural RS. Decision Support Systems (DSS) Agricultural decision support
    systems (DSS) can simply be identified as the informative resources that facilitate
    farmers in their decision making, based on knowledge of various crop-growth parameters
    [79]. DSS involves data collection, organization, and analysis to provide either
    short-term or long-term decisions. For example, for pest or weed control, DSS
    can establish a list of prospective fertilizers to use, or even suggest integration
    of both chemical and non-chemical-based practices, based on the crop type, growth
    stage, etc. One such practical example is the recommendation of herbicide use
    along with the suggestion of non-chemical weed control by a DSS, which investigated
    100 weed species and more than 30 crops, in Denmark [80]. Since RS provides near-real-time
    information, it can play a key role in the development of an efficient DSS, which
    will further support agricultural sustainability. RS provides the temporal and
    spatial attributes of a crop that can be used to improve decision making, as they
    can augment various field data and significant parameters [81]. For instance,
    DSS may establish a site-specific herbicide application map, predicting specific
    weed species or invasive plants [80]. Such technological interventions in this
    5th industrial revolution have the potential to combat climate change (by reducing
    the use of fertilizers) and reduce input costs. Despite the promising uses of
    DSS, its integration into agriculture is not prominent due to a number of factors.
    Examples of these limiting factors include high economic cost, lack of awareness
    or lower comprehension by farmers, the gap between the decision-making style required
    by DSS and the different types of farmer requirements, restrictions in capturing
    and storing environmental or biological data, etc. [79,80]. 4. Sensors The backbone
    of RS is the sensors that provide all the basic information, not only of crops,
    but also of the environment. The quality and yield of the plants is highly dependent
    on factors such as temperature, humidity, light, and the level of carbon dioxide
    (CO2) [82]. These factors, along with a variety of other parameters, can easily
    be measured using sensors [32]. Sensors usually serve for narrow band hyperspectral
    or broad band multispectral data acquisition, and can be space-borne, air-borne,
    and ground-based in terms of their respective use in satellites, RPAs, and fields
    or laboratories, respectively [40]. Currently, the most commonly used sensors
    in agricultural RS include synthetic aperture radar (SAR), near-infrared (NIR),
    light detection and ranging (LiDAR), fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging, multispectral,
    and visible RGB (VIS) sensors; thereby studying a variety of parameters according
    to needs. Table 1 lists the RS sensors, grouped under main categories, with their
    respective applications in agriculture. For an elaborated use of different sensors
    in agriculture, the study by Yang et al. [83] is recommended. Table 1. Principal
    categories of remote sensing (RS) sensors with their respective functions in agricultural
    studies. Ground-based sensors have long been in use, i.e., since the third industrial
    revolution, and those of the current era are wireless sensor technologies (WSTs).
    WSTs use radio frequency identification (RFID) and wireless sensor networks (WSN)
    [88]. The 5th industrial revolution has also resulted in rapid research and development
    in terms of smaller sensing devices, digital circuits, and radio frequency technology.
    The principal difference between RFID and WSN is that WSN permits multihop communication
    and network topologies, whereas no cooperative capabilities are offered by RFID
    devices. Now, WSNs are, not only the base of precision agriculture, but also that
    of precision livestock farming and precision poultry farming. RFID, which was
    basically developed for identification purposes, is currently being used for developing
    new wireless sensor devices. These systems comprise of a number of tiny sensor
    nodes (consisting of three basic components: sensing, processing, and communication)
    and few sinks. Each wireless sensor node can be employed in the desired crop field
    and are linked through a gateway unit, communicating with other computer systems
    via wireless local area networks (WLAN), local area networks (LAN), the Internet,
    wireless wide area network (WWAN), or controller area network (CAN), making use
    of standard protocols (i.e., general packet radio service (GPRS) or global system
    for mobile communication (GSM)) [10]. Given the maturity and potential of these
    technologies, they seem to be promising technologies for agricultural remote sensing.
    Another reason for WSN implementation in agriculture is a prerequisite of DSS
    is that it needs processed information rather than sensor-taken raw data. Therefore,
    WSNs using a meshed network of wireless sensors collect, process, and communicate
    the data for DSS, thus ensuring a controlled system [45]. WST applications in
    the agricultural sector have gone through considerable research and it is found
    to be very common in greenhouse and livestock monitoring applications. These applications
    are becoming more common by the day. Additionally, it is also important to consider
    challenges, e.g., weather conditions, reliable link quality above crop canopies,
    and coverage, that are faced when implementing radio frequencies in crop fields.
    It is also important in remote sensing that there be a mechanism of erroneous
    measurement detection, thereby rectifying wrongly collected data. Actual examples
    of the applications of WST, although few, include creating a mobile WSN connecting
    tractors or combining harvesters with other vehicles, enabling them to exchange
    data [10]. Recently, a customized WSN was used to detect fungal disease in a strawberry
    production using a distributed mesh network of wireless mini weather stations,
    equipped with relative humidity, temperature, and leaf wetness sensors. Similarly,
    other studies included the implementation of WSN in vineyards for precision viticulture
    and addressed heat summation and potential frost damage [10]. Similarly, various
    other studies on their application in irrigation, greenhouse, and horticulture
    domains have been reported [45]. However, it is important to consider that there
    is an immense need for a standard body to regulate agricultural sensor device
    development as well as their subsequent implementation in modeling and DSS. These
    technologies have been in constant transition over the past few years, e.g., updating
    various ISO (International Organization for Standards) standards for RFID (ISO/IEC
    18000, ISO 11784, etc.), Bluetooth, Wibree, WiFi, and ZigBee for WSNs [88,89].
    Various studies have reported on the use of these technologies, such as the use
    of ZigBee for precision agriculture (elaborated by Sahitya et al. [90]). A substantial
    improvement in WSN for subsequent incorporation into satellites and RPAs will
    certainly augment the efficiency of these platforms. For a summary of some of
    the commonly implied sensors in agriculture that provide data about plant, soil,
    and climate conditions, the study by Abbasi et al. [89] is recommended. A lot
    of renowned companies and institutes, including NASA, are involved in the production
    of novel and efficient sensors. For example, the Microsoft Kinect sensor developed
    in the last decade shows remarkable potential for rapid characterization of vegetation
    structure, as reported previously [91]. For a comprehensive study on the latest
    advances in sensor technology applied to the agricultural sector, the study by
    Kayad et al. is recommended [26]. Joint ventures by governments and academic institutes,
    apart from those of the private sector, in the implementation of sensor technology
    can bear rapid and efficient results, such as the Center of Satellite Communication
    and Remote Sensing at Istanbul Technical University (ITU), and the Turkish Statistical
    Institute joining hands to realize the sensor-driven agricultural monitoring and
    information system (TARBIL) project [92]. Various sensors are being currently
    invented and developed, through private firms and joint ventures, based on wireless
    technology for subsequent applications in viticulture, irrigation, greenhouse,
    horticulture, pest control, fertilization, etc. [89], but this also highlights
    the necessity of some regulating and standard bodies. Similarly, John Deere, a
    leading farming equipment company, is currently undertaking various IoT projects,
    including sensor-fitted autonomous tractors, capable of yield estimation features,
    among various other features [93]. Apart from the industrial perspective, a great
    deal of research in the academic domain is also on the rise in this sphere. These
    technologies are promising for efficient and sustainable farming, which is basically
    expected in the 5th industrial revolution. Satellites and RPAs are two prominent
    platforms of RS technology and therefore, it is important to consider their use
    in the 5th industrial revolution, mainly focusing on the agricultural sector.
    Various studies have highlighted the limitations of the one or the other, but
    both are beneficial in general. In this regard, their current and future roles
    in on-board sensors and cameras are reported here. 4.1. Satellite One of the oldest
    and main platforms of RS technology is the satellite. In 1957, the first ever
    satellite: Sputnik 1, weighing 183 pounds and the size of a basketball, was launched
    into space by the Soviet Union [94]. It has been over 40 years since satellite
    systems became operational, but a milestone in RS was achieved with the creation
    of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps, providing information about
    land cover, phenology, and vegetation activity, using advanced very high resolution
    radiometer (AVHRR) [35]. In terms of improved performance, considering geometric,
    spectral, and radiometric properties, the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) significantly helped with remote sensing. MODIS instruments laid the foundation
    of a new era in remote sensing after their launch in 1999, providing 1-km spatial
    resolution GPP products [35]. Numerous satellites had been launched in the past
    two decades with various spatial and temporal resolutions [95], which proved to
    be the basis of the 5th technological revolution. Today, various privately-held
    and government-managed satellites harboring versatile sensors are an efficient
    foundation to RS, thereby providing huge sets of interpretable data and information.
    For example, Spain started its “National Remote Sensing Plan (PNT)” in 2004, aimed
    at data provisioning for various Spanish public administrations [96]. Although,
    it is important to bear in mind that this domain was envisaged with a little boost
    in 2008, when Landsat (US operated satellites) images were set freely accessible
    (under open license), and the launch of Sentinel 1A and Sentinel 2A satellites,
    in 2014 and 2015, respectively, under the Copernicus Program, further increased
    the momentum of RS. The Sentinel constellation is the part of Copernicus program
    that was launched by the European Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA).
    As more than 30 satellites provide data for this program, it is of great use to
    scientists to analyze the freely available data regarding agriculture. In addition,
    a separate database, titled “Copernicus Academic”, of the Copernicus program also
    facilitates the training and better utilization of satellite data [97]. Similarly,
    the Landsat program, launched by the United States as a joint venture between
    the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the United States
    Geological Survey (USGS), also offers free access to high-resolution images. The
    present needs are to wisely utilize these free accessible data to achieve ambitious
    agricultural goals. Furthermore, space-borne hyperspectral missions, such as ZY1-AHSI,
    PRISMA, DESIS, and GF5-AHSI, which launched recently, or are planned to be launched
    in upcoming years, such as SBG, CHIME, and EnMAP, are expected to augment agricultural
    monitoring in terms of vegetation functions and traits. It is imperative to address
    recurring limitations, such as soil background and canopy structure interference,
    signal variations in optical vegetation properties, and poor discrimination of
    functional traits due to lesser narrow spectral regions [2]. Recently, a cloud-free
    crop map service utilizing radar and optical data from Sentinel-1 and -2, respectively,
    was announced under a joint venture by two private companies i.e., VanderSat and
    BASF Digital Farming GmbH, thereby providing daily maps of field-scale crop biomass
    [98]. This advancement is a remarkable breakthrough in RS from satellites, as
    it has been a great challenge since the beginning of this technology. Recent advances
    in this technology are making it a fine and efficient technology through the use
    of machine learning. A study conducted by Mazzia et al. [99] reported a novel
    strategy for refining the freely available photos from satellites to minimize
    the errors often encountered by their low or moderate resolutions. This is an
    excellent example of the use of blended technology, where the authors trained
    a convolutional neural network using high-resolution images from RPA and then
    derived the NDVI to interpret the low- or moderate-resolution satellite images
    of vineyard vigor maps. Among other uses of this RS platform, one is the construction
    of historical maps of crops, as these play a significant role in crop prediction
    estimation and related simulations. Recently, a study established the relationship
    between MODIS-derived NDVI and the grain yields of wheat, barley, and all cereals
    for 20 European countries (including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany,
    Ireland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, etc.). After analyzing the data from 2010
    to 2018, a higher percentage of cereals was reported; 35% for arable land. The
    efficacy of yield prediction in relation to NDVI and cereals was reported as trustworthy
    over a good time period of 4 months [100]. More studies of this nature on a global
    scale are needed to strengthen the agriculture of today. Implementation of existing
    technological tools is also very important. For instance, Google Earth Engine
    (GEE) offers diverse services in this domain for the agricultural industry. GEE
    facilitates product downloading of various satellites imagery (Landsat, Sentinels,
    MODIS, etc.) along with cloud-based management, by granting access either through
    an academic email or simply a standard Gmail account to their servers. Processing
    very large geospatial datasets often makes the process slow and difficult. In
    this regard, GEE, a cloud-based platform, facilitates access to high-performance
    computing resources without any cost. Systematic data products and interactive
    applications can be developed based on GEE once an algorithm is developed—thereby
    reducing the complexities of programming and application development [45]. A stepwise
    illustration for product downloads from GEE is presented in Figure 2, although
    the final exported product can be different from this illustration, based on the
    needs and preferred format. Figure 2. A stepwise illustration (1 to 7) of processing
    and downloading satellite imagery products from Google Earth Engine (GEE). A practical
    example of benefiting from free services GEE is presented as the construction
    of vegetation indices (VIs) maps for olive grove trees located at Guadahortuna
    (Granada, Spain) (Figure 3). Sentinel-2 images, between July 2020 and February
    2021, were accessed through GEE, at a resolution of 10 × 10, and were processed
    to generate NDVI (as indicated in the below formula) vector tiles, followed by
    their export into GeoJSON format. The GeoJSON format is user friendly and generates
    data in the form of a table where each pixel represents a file with its NDVI value,
    which is quite handy to work with. Figure 3. Sentinel-2 images accessed through
    Google Earth Engine (GEE). (A) Area of interest, (B) RGB field composition, (C)
    NDVI raster tile, (D) NDVI vector tile, (E) RGB field composition, (F) NDVI raster
    tile (Images facilitated by Graniot). Likewise, another practical example of this
    nature is the data acquisition, via GEE, for a parcel of vineyard crop situated
    at Reggio Emilia (Emilia-Romagna, Italy) (Figure 4). In both of these examples,
    NDVI was calculated using the following formula: NDVI= NIR−VIS NIR+VIS =[Sentinel2
    Bands] 𝐵08−𝐵04 𝐵08+𝐵04 where NIR is the near-infrared band and the VIS is the
    visible red. Bands 8 and 4 of Sentinel-2 were used given their desired spatial
    resolution of 10 m as well as their spectral range (e.g., bands 8 and 4 measure
    NIR and red spectral bands, respectively) to calculate the NDVI. These serve as
    an example of free data acquisition and processing; the future promises enormous
    possibilities. The only need is to make use of such freely available resources
    for academic, as well as real-world, applications. Figure 4. Sentinel-2 images
    accessed through Google Earth Engine (GEE). (A) Area of interest, (B) RGB field
    composition, (C) NDVI raster tile, (D) RGB field composition, (E) NDVI raster
    tile, (F) NDVI vector tile (Images facilitated by Graniot). Another important
    aspect of using satellite technology is the digital boundaries of crop fields
    that are a pre-requisite. Areas with intensive agriculture have solved this, but,
    for small crop areas (>1 ha), it persists. The 5th revolution is playing its part
    here. Recently, a novel method, “DESTIN”, of crop field delineation was reported
    with an accuracy of 95–99%, fusing temporal and spatial information acquired from
    WorldView and Planet satellite imagery [101]. Such types of studies are opening
    up the way for digitalizing agriculture and making it sustainable. This new era
    is not just about processing acquired data it is also about optimizing it for
    improved-quality products. For example, a recent study on formulating optimal
    segmentation parameters to obtain precise spatial information of agricultural
    parcels that normally suffer over- or under-segmentation is an evident demonstration
    of this idea [102]. This is not just limited to the optimization of satellite
    imagery, it is a way to achieve automation and implementation of these technologies
    on all scales. 4.2. Remotely Piloted Aircrafts (RPAs) A rise in the use of this
    technology has been seen over the past decade given its worth as an integral part
    of RS technology. Intensive research has been conducted using RPAs, considering
    their application in crop monitoring, disease surveillance, soil analysis, irrigation,
    fertilization, mechanical pollination, weed management, crop harvest, crop insurance,
    tree plantation, etc. [7] (Figure 5), which obviously hints towards their remarkable
    potential in the agricultural sector. Figure 5. A schematic diagram of RPA application
    in agriculture. The first use of RPAs in agriculture was reported as back as 1986
    for monitoring Montana’s forest fires [7]. This 5th revolution is anticipated
    to make more frequent use of RPAs in farming. According to an estimate, RPAs and
    the agricultural robotics industry could be worth as much as 28 billion dollars
    by 2028 and up to 35 billion dollars by 2038 [103]. The use of RPA imagery consists
    of mission or flight planning, data collection, data processing, and information
    report generation. Several free resources are available for each of these purposes.
    For example, QGroundControl is an open-source software that can act as a ground
    control station (GCS) for RPAs. Similarly, several user-friendly open-source software
    titles are available in the market for image processing, orthomosaic assembly,
    digital surface model (DSM), and digital elevation model (DEM) constructions.
    Open Drone Map (ODM) is a prominent example of this, and offers creations and
    visualizations of orthomosaic, point cloud, 3D models, and other products [7].
    RPAs offer better resolutions and flexibility of use over satellite imagery. A
    few such desired features help to monitor the most important crop parameters:
    nitrogen (N) and chlorophyll contents [36]. For example, Figure 6 shows an overview
    of the practical applications of RPAs to acquire Vis, such as NDVI, normalized
    difference red edge (NDRE) and thermal maps. A Yuneec Typhoon H hexacopter RPA,
    flown at a 100-m height, equipped with a multispectral camera (parrot sequoia)
    and a thermal sensor (Yuneec CGOET) was used to monitor olive crops in Cordoba,
    Spain. After processing the images, treatment zones were indicated depending upon
    the vegetation vigour, stress, and N content (Figure 7). Figure 6. Vegetation
    index (VIs) maps generated through Parrot Sequoia (a multispectral camera) and
    Yuneec CGOET (a thermal sensor) mounted on Yuneec Typhoon H hexacopter RPA. (A)

    vegetation status generated based on NDVI. (D) Thermal map established using Yuneec

    for treatment based on the vegetation indices (VIs) maps, generated using a parrot
    sequoia and Yuneec CGOET mounted on a Yuneec Typhoon H hexacopter RPA for olive
    crops (image facilitated by MCBiodrone). Quite a number of studies have reported
    on various aspect or uses of RPAs but it is interesting to learn what this new
    era means for one of these RS technologies. New research is being based on artificial
    intelligence to derive more detailed information about growth, yield, disease,
    and automation. For example, use of wireless sensor technology and control automation
    is on the rise in agriculture [104,105,106]. Some of the representative studies
    with respect to principal applications of RPAs in agriculture are summarized in
    Table 2. Table 2. A summary of a few representative studies for principal agricultural
    applications of RPAs. (The purpose of citing these references is impartial and
    is not confined to these studies only). One of the prominent features of this
    technology is its higher resolution than the satellite imagery—offering up to
    0.2 m of spatial resolution, which is approximately 40,000 times better resolution
    that means more and high-quality information can be extracted from these images.
    Furthermore, laser imaging detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems are using this
    technology to pave the way towards building 3D maps of plant canopy, soil, and
    field analysis, which are crucial factors for yield estimation, irrigation, and
    nutrients estimation, such as for N [7]. Nevertheless, impeding metrological conditions,
    local and national regulations, limited spatial coverage due to battery or payload
    limits, along with a lack of standard procedures for inflight calibration of RPA
    sensors [18,107] are few of the constraints of this platform. Likewise, it is
    also important to consider regional and national regulations for operating RPAs,
    although agricultural applications of RPAs do not invoke substantial risks for
    people. Government bodies are trying to cope with such regulations, but there
    is plenty of room for growth. In Europe, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency
    (EASA) presented legislative framework: “Easy Access Rules for Unmanned Aircraft
    Systems” (Regulations (EU) 2019/947 and (EU) 2019/945), in 2019, for RPA operations
    and it went into effect from 31 December 2020 [138]. The three principal categories
    established under this legislation are presented in Table 3. Safety of people,
    security, privacy, and data protection were the principal parameters considered
    for establishing these regulations. Nevertheless, most countries are struggling
    to establish standard regulations, and this requires urgent attention. A general
    list of RPA laws and regulations can be consulted in [139]. Table 3. Three categories
    established by European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) for operating RPAs.
    This new era is of the Internet of Drones (IoD), where a fleet of drones is deployed,
    controlled through a ground station server (GSS) via a wireless channel, to harvest
    the desired data. Currently, research is being undertaken to explore these possibilities
    for remote areas, where there is no Internet connection. For example, a recent
    study reported on the possibility of using a cellular network for this purpose
    [140]. An interesting study by Prasanna and Jebapriya [141] on the use of RPAs
    in smart agriculture, based on IoT, is highly recommended, where the possibilities
    of this novel technology with their practical examples are discussed. Similarly,
    novel applications of RPAs can also enrich RS technologies; for example, very
    recently, an RPA was used as a mobile gateway for a wireless sensor network (WSN),
    establishing a 24-m flying height and a 25-m antenna coverage provided maximum
    node density [142]. In the same way, the benefits of drone centimeter-scale multispectral
    imagery were investigated in sugar beet crop to improve the assessment of foliar
    and canopy parameters; five important structural and biochemical plant traits
    were reported, highlighting the importance of drone imagery for centimeter-scale
    characterization [4]. RPAs are already used for capturing videos and photos under
    specific flight plans, as such, setting an RPA as a node for a WSN is an efficient
    way to fully benefit from this RS tool. Despite the appeal of IoD, security may
    be a recurring issue in upcoming years; large companies are already at the brink
    of this issue. For this reason, thorough research in this domain is recommended
    to ensure a reliable application of RS. A recent study undertaken on this aspect
    of technology offers the implementation of blockchain and smart contracts to safeguard
    data, which are then archived through IoT-enabled RPAs and sensors, with their
    respective deployment considerations [143]. Alternative and economical solutions
    are urgently required to address these issues. 4.3. Satellite and RPAs: A Complementing
    System The use of RPAs versus satellites is often debated in the context of their
    agricultural applications. Nevertheless, the choice of any of these RS platforms
    is highly subjective to the needs of farmer and the crop to be studied. However,
    a minor comparison of these is presented considering their usefulness in RS. Limited
    battery life and flight time hinder extensive spatial coverage using RPAs, despite
    being regarded as optimal for providing robust, reliable and efficient crop phenotyping
    [144]. RPAs offer lower operational costs; however, for large amounts of data
    (to cover larger areas), data processing costs increase exponentially. Similarly,
    flexibility with flying times and the significant resolution of RPA imagery are
    desirable characteristics over satellite imagery [7]. On the other hand, freely
    accessible satellite data are gaining popularity. Even so, these freely available
    data come with coarser spatial and temporal resolutions (with the exception of
    a few commercial satellites), and is being used to generate VIs. In this regard,
    AI offers leverage to fine-tune coarser satellite data based on high-resolution
    drone data [5]. Moreover, a large dataset for training AI models, despite poor
    quality or noisiness, generates substantial results compared to smaller datasets,
    indicating the importance of huge datasets obtained through satellite imagery
    [5]. This is why big data holds a remarkable position in this regard. For example,
    a previously reported study demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning associated
    with the availability of large and high-quality training samples [145]. Furthermore,
    crop simulation models can be generated beforehand from these data for respective
    agronomic measures and crop yield estimations. Therefore, a complementing system
    based on these two RS platforms can supplement the efficiency of RS products.
    5. Future Perspective RS technology is anticipated to maximize the potential of
    the agricultural sector to feed future generations. Integration of modern science
    is greatly needed. A few possible future studies, with regard to the 5th industrial
    revolution, are hinted at below (Figure 8). Figure 8. Future considerations of
    remote sensing (RS) technology applied to agriculture. − Satellites, RPAs, and
    sensors seek a vast amount of data in a raw form, which requires tiresome pre-processing,
    processing, and data evaluation procedures. This is where big data comes in play
    and ML can be applied to handle this difficult task as an effective tool for managing
    and processing huge data sets, as has also been previously reported [42]. Although
    traditional ML methods (i.e., artificial neural networks, random forests, and
    support vector machines) provide the characteristics of a subject under study,
    these prove to be subjective and cumbersome processes when dealing with the problems
    of a complex domain, e.g., yield estimation of a crop or highly dimensional datasets
    [42]. Therefore, selection of key features is very important to further train
    models for a higher accuracy. Furthermore, such machine and deep learning models
    for various crop characteristics (i.e., stress, disease, ripeness, etc.) are urgently
    required for almost all of crops. For example, postharvest grading processes can
    be easily regulated by the implementation of quality-based ML fruit classification
    models. Similarly, an image offers a great deal of information, such as chlorophyll,
    plant canopy, size, color, fruit number, etc., which can be analyzed using various
    ML networks with the potential of minimizing input costs and making the crop yield
    more profitable. − Incorporation of GIS-enabled biosensors into plants cannot
    only help to reveal plant molecular processes, e.g., nutrients assimilation, production
    of antioxidants, etc., but also the location of pathogenic attack, drought stress,
    and other valuable growth parameters. − Novel low-cost sensors are highly in demand
    and can certainly complement the efficiency of RS technology. For example, novel
    sensors detecting ethylene gas levels, which is an indicator of fruit ripening
    [146], can help farmers to make essential management decisions before harvest.
    Similarly, durable ground-based sensors can be incorporated with cellular and
    WST technology for real time information gathering, as well as programing for
    respective measures. Further novel applications of sensor, as well as new sensors
    measuring a variety of parameters, can certainly take RS technology to another
    level. − An integrated and complementing system for satellites, automatically
    guided land vehicles (AGVs), and RPA imagery could be quite beneficial to overcome
    physical hurdles in data acquisition and improving the efficiency and accuracy
    of these technologies. Novel algorithms can also fill in this gap and, therefore,
    research should be focused on this domain. − Given the tremendous potential of
    LiDAR, it could be used to extract architectural information of crops, as well
    as of forests. Such morphological information can pave the way to unveil growth
    processes, phenotypic explorations, structural patterns, establishing biomass–yield
    relationships, etc. Using AI, this information could be amplified for various
    other plant species and even to simulate plants developmental behavior in space.
    − Freely available satellite imagery with coarse temporal and spatial resolutions
    have not been exploited for scale-appropriate precision agriculture applications
    [147]. These free resources can be manipulated in a number of ways to extract
    desired information; for example, historical and current field data can be a game
    changer for estimating soil fertility status, which immensely influences crop
    yield. Similarly, distanced and under-nourished plants in a field patch indicate
    inadequate growth conditions, e.g., salinity stress, drought stress, shallow patch,
    etc. This is quite valuable information for assuring precision. − The maturity
    of 5th generation (5G) technology is increasing the possibilities of automation
    of field processes and the acquisition of real-time information. During this 5th
    industrial revolution, 5G is a substantial performer that has the potential, not
    only to facilitate high speed connectivity, but also faster data acquisition followed
    by analysis. For example, Google Earth, a free geolocation search engine, facilitates
    access to satellite imagery and integrates a processing code that could generate
    NDVI in turn [148], subsequently producing desired analytics in a mobile application
    or webpage. A practical example is the private company Graniot, operating in Spain
    [149]. Another interesting implementation of 5G could be the real time streaming
    of ultra-high definition images (4K–8K), taken by RPAs along with its potential
    to overcome the severe regulations on beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) flight
    challenges. These tools are not limited to these kinds of applications, but rather
    to the unlimited opportunities. Further startups of this kind can help to achieve
    sustainable agriculture. − Masking all the data analyzing processes and protecting
    the end user, especially farmers, from the perplexity of technical processes in
    the form of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) could greatly boost the incorporation
    of these technologies among small-scale farmers. Only a limited number of studies
    have been reported where a user can visualize and interpret data in the form of
    mobile or tablet applications [150,151,152]. The invention of such types of GUIs
    can further ease sustainability and the profitability of the sector. − Benefiting
    from radio signals, television communication systems and cellular data are also
    appealing aspects of RS applications in rural areas. Another attractive option
    is the use of hotspot satellites for the determined range and area. RS technology
    is quite mature in developed countries, but, for developing countries, these tools
    can outweigh resource scarcity. − An anticipated model considering this 5th revolution
    can be envisioned as one where data acquisition resources (e.g., sensors, RPAs,
    WSN, etc.) operate in synergy with field actors (e.g., tractors, AGVs, irrigation
    systems, spray systems, robots, etc.). Acquired crop data are then processed by
    cloud computing platforms, and ultimately generate insightful results. Thus, enabling
    the end user to interpret, make a reasoned decision or program a regulated activity
    through the corresponding GUI. Figure 9 shows this anticipated model. Figure 9.
    An anticipated model of remote sensing (RS) technologies applied to agriculture
    in the 5th industrial revolution. The figure can be read from left to right, where
    (A) represents the user control center, (B) represent servers, cloud and the related
    storage accessories, (C) represents the real players, e.g., satellites, remotely
    piloted aircrafts (RPAs), autonomous robots, metrological stations, etc., for
    data acquisition, (D) represent data processing using machine learning and related
    platforms that ultimately produce infographics and other useful information in
    (E). − The incorporation of RS technologies into agriculture can facilitate sector
    sustainability, but the associated costs could be a hindering factor. Today, most
    sensors applied in agriculture are quite expensive, along with the hiring of third
    party services for data interpretation. This is quite a big hurdle that need to
    be resolved. − Similarly, providing farmers with the basic skills needed for RS
    technology and training a fleet of young scientists can ease frustrations among
    people directly related to agriculture, like farmers, agronomists, extension workers,
    etc. The rate of adoption of a technology can be augmented using such measures.
    Private and public bodies can equally contribute to this sphere. − RS technology
    is no longer in its nascent phase and, therefore, a framework of proper vocabulary
    and standardization is urgently needed. Various terminologies are in use today
    that only create more confusion. An example of this problem is the naming of RPA
    technology—unmanned air vehicle (UAV) is the proper term for drones for few scientists,
    whereas others consider this term obsolete [7]. 6. Conclusions The study aimed
    to convey an overview of the principal players of RS technology, including satellites,
    RPAs, and sensors, in this new era of the 5th industrial revolution (of agriculture
    5.0); thus, highlighting its importance in achieving SDG-2. Satellites occupy
    a prominent place in RS technology that can be appended with IoD to maximize its
    potential in assuring sustainable agriculture. Satellite imagery data are freely
    accessible, and RPA technology becoming more and more economical with each passing
    day. Integrated application of these RS components and training ML models is what
    is expected from this 5th revolution. Few studies have been done on cohesive applications
    of AI in this field, such as automation in the fruit grading process, crop variety
    identification, visual representation of data analysis in the mobile applications,
    etc. Moving forward, the aim is to improve resource use efficiency. Similarly,
    there is a need to address the limitations of AI in terms of model training, standardization,
    and oversimplifications of reality. With the novel technologies come the novel
    challenges; initiating novel research projects addressing challenges of data privacy,
    slow data processing, lack of historical maps, cost of sensors, standardization,
    processing complexity, training, etc., can effectively contribute to, not only
    the dissemination of novel technologies, e.g., IoT, IoE, IoD, ML, etc., but also
    adoption, thereby promising a sustainable agriculture 5.0. Author Contributions

    access and data transfer is the key driver of mobile communications technologies.
    The next step is wireless real-time networking. The “Tactile Internet” demands
    completely new technologies. Low latency, short response times, high reliability
    and resilience, a network of edge clouds and security are basic requirements.
    Therefore, 5G is developed. Novel use cases are industrial automation, autonomous
    vehicles, e-health, and the Internet of Things. For agriculture, 5G is a crucial
    technology enabler for robotization and Smart Farming processes. Agriculture needs
    own ad-hoc radio network solutions to efficiently provide coverage and manage
    data transfer, privacy and flexibility. The synergy of cellular and local mesh
    communications can solve the problem of unreliable communication and allows farmers
    to take full control of their data. Zusammenfassung Die Nachfrage nach Internetzugang
    und Datentransfer ist der wichtigste Treiber für mobile Kommunikationstechnologien.
    Der nächste Schritt ist die drahtlose Echtzeit-Vernetzung. Das “taktile Internet”
    erfordert völlig neue Technologien. Geringe Latenz, kurze Reaktionszeiten, hohe
    Zuverlässigkeit, Ausfallsicherheit, eine Vernetzung von Edge Clouds und Datensicherheit
    sind Grundvoraussetzungen. Deshalb wird 5G entwickelt. Neuartige Anwendungsfälle
    sind industrielle Automatisierung, autonome Fahrzeuge, E-Health und das Internet
    der Dinge. Für die Landwirtschaft ist 5G ein entscheidender Technologie-Enabler
    für die Robotisierung und Smart Farming Prozesse. Die Landwirtschaft benötigt
    eigene Ad-hoc-Funknetzlösungen, um effizient Abdeckung zu bieten und Datenübertragung,
    Datenschutz und Flexibilität zu verwalten. Die Synergie von zellulärer und lokaler
    Mesh-Kommunikation kann das Problem der Kommunikation lösen und ermöglicht den
    Landwirten die volle Kontrolle über ihre Daten. Keywords: Smart Farming; 5G; Tactile

    I. Introduction Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems with video analytics tasks
    are an emerging need in applications such as smart agriculture, disaster scene
    scenarios, surveillance, military applications, and package delivery. Multi-drone
    systems with such tasks have significant challenges in terms of security and privacy.
    For instance, they are susceptible to not only malicious attacks that cause disastrous
    misuses, but also can be impacted by accidental adversaries who could cause broken
    cameras or serious drone misconfigurations [1], [2]. Malicious communications,
    jams or spoofs in Ground Control Station (GCS) signals, or Denial of Service (DoS)
    attacks that disrupt the drones operations (e.g., cause data integrity or loss
    of privacy issues) are reported frequently and have raised concerns [3]. Hence,
    building UAV systems increasingly involves overcoming challenges in terms of security
    and privacy of data affected by malicious attacks while performing computation
    offloading (CO) and control networking (CoNet) [4] –[6] as shown in Fig. 1. Moreover,
    drone operations in FANETS are inherently insecure and need to be integrated with
    effective security schemes to be capable of defending against cyber-attacks [7]
    during continuous video stream transmission from drones to GCS, and processing
    with edge resources. Fig. 1. GCS communication with UAVs and integration with
    a cloud/edge network infrastructure; Cyber-attacks can target UAV flights, GCS
    communication, or containerized data processing tasks. Show All In this paper,
    we address the above security challenges and develop the \"DroneNet-Sec\", which
    is an cloud-based, end-to-end security framework addressing common attacks (e.g.,
    Man-in-the-middle (MITM), Replay, DoS attacks) that have significant impact on
    UAV systems. The DroneNet-Sec features a security scheme that comprises of a custom
    secure packet designed with MAVLink protocol. The packets use nonce, encryption
    and message authentication code in drone and GCS communications to provide secure
    network-edge connectivity to defend against data privacy and integrity attacks,
    without high degradation of performance in a real-time FANET deployment. Our DroneNet-Sec
    uses an intelligent attack detection method based on machine learning together
    with a fully containerized design to improve computation security. The components
    of the DroneNet-Sec are compatible with architectural designs that are suitable
    for cloud applications that use micro-services in management of UAV systems. In
    addition, they are easily deployable and scalable, providing extensibility to
    include a flexible number of tasks and video analytics processes. The design of
    DroneNet-Sec uses the Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) paradigm that is based upon
    \"never Trust, always verify\" principles. The ZTA is commonly used as part of
    security mechanisms which assume that all network communications are hostile.
    In addition, ZTA creates the necessity of constant monitoring of the system to
    check every transmission as a suspicious activity, taking possible precautions
    to ensure the reliability of the communication in between the parties with the
    assumption that there is always an intruder that can intervene. We validate our
    DroneNet-Sec approach using a hybrid testbed that can support scalable simulation
    and emulation experiments for a variety of drone video analytics purposes. We
    specifically use this testbed to verify whether, adding a security layer would
    degrade the performance of the control networking and the computation offloading
    of given set of data processing pipelines involving UAV systems. Our experiments
    show that the DroneNet-Sec approach allows for a light-weight security mechanism
    and also ensures the computation security, data privacy and integrity of the containerized
    real drone-video analytics tasks, while minimizing any possible degradation in
    the processing performance. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized
    as follows: A novel security framework for real-time UAV systems with containerized
    video analytics tasks, combining two schemes: A secure messaging scheme with custom
    packet design enforcing data privacy and data integrity, securing the messaging
    in between drone-to-drone and drone-to-edge servers providing a secure protocol
    over MAVLink [8]. A machine learning based anomaly detection, control and countermeasure
    scheme with constant monitoring for computation security, which can be updated
    dynamically to improve the security of a UAV system further. A hybrid testbed
    to be used in experimentation of schemes to improve network-edge connectivity
    and computation security for multi-UAV systems. The hybrid testbed contains: A
    FANET network simulation on ns-3 [9] for scalability of the FANET nodes, a variety
    of mobility models and network transmission protocols. An emulation of edge resources
    on allocated virtual machines on real nodes on the Powder infrastructure [10]
    for scalability of the resources that is needed for offloading of computationally
    intensive tasks to edge resources. The remainder of this paper is organized as
    follows: In Section II, we present related work. Section III details our DroneNet-Sec
    framework solution and implementation. In Section IV, we describe performance
    evaluation experiments and findings. Finally, Section V concludes the paper. SECTION
    II. Related Work A. UAV Systems and Security Issues UAV systems can be considered
    as a representative application of embedded systems in Internet of Things (IoT)
    scenarios. Several technological ecosystems can converge in a multi-drone video
    analytics platform involving e.g., different communication technologies such as
    WiFi, 4G/5G cellular, and leveraging edge/fog and cloud/edge computing resources
    [11]. In multi-UAV systems featuring highly resource intensive tasks involving
    data collection and video analytics (i.e. video stabilization, motion detection,
    and tracking), the resources of on-board components are easily overwhelmed. In
    order to process high volumes of images with commensurate computing, memory and
    storage capabilities, some of those tasks can be offloaded to resources on edge
    and cloud servers by using different policies to decide ‘when and how’ to perform
    offloading [5], [12]. In such systems where offloading policies are applied, the
    vulnerabilities of UAV systems are higher since there is a direct connection to
    edge servers that constantly send and receive video-stream processes over the
    network [13]. Moreover, the limited resources on UAVs brings additional constraints
    on any security scheme that can be applied to the common protocols in the UAV
    systems. The targets of these attacks can be classified into three main categories:
    (i) the availability of the system, (ii) data integrity and (iii) confidentiality
    in the data communications and storage [7]. Fig. 2 provides an overview of three
    malicious cyber-attack categories and the selected attack types under those categories
    that compromise the communication and data safety in UAV systems. Fig. 2. Attacks
    on UAV system communication links and data processing servers in edge computing
    resources. Show All In availability attacks, the attacker can jeopardize the availability
    through control and disruption of the communication among UAVs and GCS nodes.
    Integrity attacks can be launched in two ways: (i) the attacker modifies data,
    or (ii) the attacker fabricates malicious data. In confidentiality attacks, the
    attacker gets unauthorized access to classified data, intercepts signals, and
    sends data to other unauthorized entities via eavesdropping on communication links.
    In this work, the first focus is on communication interruption, targeting availability
    of the system, in particular Denial of Service (DoS) attacks [14]. The second
    focus is on data modification targeting the integrity of the data, specifically
    Replay attacks [15]. The third focus is on data interception, targeting the data
    confidentiality, in which Man in the Middle (MITM) [16] attacks might occur. B.
    Securing UAV Systems There are many recent works that proposed different solutions
    with variety of techniques for UAV security issues pertaining to possible attacks.
    Several works focus on using machine learning for misuse, intrusion and anomaly
    detection with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in wireless networks in general,
    and UAV systems specifically, by classifying inputs in the network [17] –[19].
    On the other hand, there are several works on the communication security aspect
    on UAV systems; policy-based fingerprint features and methods for data redundancy
    [20], software defined network (SDN) based architecture [21], using artificial
    intelligence on incident command response co-ordination [22] as well as authentication
    of trusted drones in the GCS [23], encrypted communication channel and authentication
    to prevent hijacking [24]. One of the recent works, MAVSec [25], proposed a security-integrated
    version of the commonly used, lightweight UAV communication protocol, MAVLink
    to address its vulnerabilities. Their comparison of different encryption algorithms
    including AES varieties, RC4 and ChaCha20 in terms of memory usage and CPU consumption
    showed that ChaCha20 can be integrated into MAVLink without affecting its performance
    drastically. Furthermore, ChaCha20-Poly1305 authentication encryption, which is
    a combination of ChaCha20 stream cipher with Poly1305 message authenticator has
    been shown to be suitable as a fast and secure transport layer security protocol
    for IoT devices and remote cloud servers [26], [27]. Motivated by this work, we
    also consider the feasibility for the implementation of ChaCha20 stream cipher
    with Poly1305 message authenticator in UAV systems. There are many existing methods
    on the communication side, i.e., static encryption schemes, and on the intrusion
    detection side, i.e., static and machine learning approaches. However, development
    of a feasible holistic security scheme that ensures the security of the entire
    system, especially when there is computation offloading with continuous video
    streaming processes [28], is still an open problem. Such a security scheme should
    not only consider the low resource constraints on-board UAVs, but also minimize
    degradation of the throughput of the data. As shown in many previous works, machine
    learning techniques are successful candidates for the intrusion detection on multi-UAV
    systems. However, the hardship and the challenges on acquiring data to train,
    together with the dynamics of the system, creates a need to have a system that
    is suited to adopt machine learning models. Moreover, most of the existing datasets
    [29] –[31] that have been used for training IDS are not specifically created for
    UAV systems, and hence are not relevant to e.g. computation security in FANETs
    around video analytics. There is a need for data collection on a realistic simulated
    and/or emulated multi-UAV testbed that can be used for training different learning
    algorithms. In addition, there is a need for computation security solutions that
    are not cost-prohibitive and are portable when experimenting on real systems.
    Our work helps equip UAV systems through the novel DroneNet-Sec frameworks and
    algorithms for training and testing data to develop IDS with selected machine
    learning models that improve computation security in video analytics tasks in
    UAV systems. C. Testbeds for UAV Systems In order to have realistic testbeds for
    testing and validating innovative solutions and schemes that are related but not
    limited to security, policies, protocols, energy and performance optimization
    methods for multi-UAV FANETs, simulation is necessary, but not sufficient by itself
    in terms of resource requirements and computation capabilities. To have enhanced
    experiments by leveraging the advantages of both simulations, i.e., the scalability,
    and emulations, practicality and resourcefulness, there have been many prior studies
    to create end-to-end-frameworks on both sides in the context of FANETs. Recent
    works such as [32], [33] detailed the implementation of Virtualized Environments
    (VE) for multi-UAV network emulation, and testing of multi-UAV FANET simulations
    along with network service deployments on VEs. To meet the needs of experimenting
    a solution on multi-UAV systems featuring FANETs as described, there are also
    several works that created hybrid testbeds combining different simulators and
    emulators to cover multiple components. A recent study that focused on creating
    a hybrid testbed for validating experiments viz., VENUE [34] proposed a VE for
    multi-UAV emulation for realistic experiments with service deployments that can
    be integrated with 5G technologies. VENUE is built on Linux Containers (LXC),
    using ns-3 simulator and emulations on real UAVs. An implementation of the emulation
    module with TapBridge model (virtual TAP interface and a Linux Bridge) inside
    ns-3 is used to make it interact with external real devices and VEs. This work
    however, did not consider the applicability of mobility models for multi-UAV system
    applications or the pre-installation of routing capabilities, which are the features
    needed for more realistic application implementations. Apart from VE, there are
    other prior approaches such as [35] that provided a hybrid implementation, creating
    a setting that features the injection of traffic generated from a network simulator
    to an emulated live [36] network and vice-versa. This work did not test network
    protocols such as routing protocols, or extended their implementation for distributed
    networks, making it hard to have a more realistic network simulator. In order
    to implement, test and validate our security mechanisms in a scalable, and end-to-end
    manner, a hybrid testbed was needed, combining simulation on ns-3 with emulation
    of VEs that can be deployed on any physical machine that is located on the ground
    or on the cloud, specifically Powder nodes [10]. Our hybrid testbed jointly integrates
    network and UAV simulation, extending features that are not available in these
    wireless facilities. Ns-3 provides models (e.g., battery, mobility) and helps
    us to instantiate a rich wireless topology. Our work novelty is in the consideration
    of cloud-based testbeds, joining extendable and resizable network simulator and
    wireless facilities capabilities to deploy hybrid testbed environments to support
    development of schemes to secure network-edge connectivity and improve computation
    security in drone video analytics. SECTION III. DroneNet-Sec Framework Implementation
    A. DroneNet-Sec Overview In this section, we detail the DroneNet-Sec framework
    implementation illustrated in Fig. 3 that is based on the Zero Trust Architecture
    paradigm. Our approach combines secure messaging for network-edge connectivity
    security, and attack detection with countermeasures on edge resources for computation
    security. A secure messaging scheme with custom packet design in MAVLink protocol
    is deployed in a FANET module in order to secure the communication in between
    drone-to-drone and drone-to-edge server nodes. Apart from the secure messaging
    module, the FANET includes an attack monitoring and detection module, a deamon
    controlling simulation commands and metrics collection and a video analytics containers
    manager. Our framework provides measures for data integrity and confidentiality
    by implementing a secure messaging scheme, as well as for data access controllability,
    realizing the design based on the ZTA paradigm. DroneNet-Sec also includes a secure
    mechanism deployed in the edge server, in a UAV system with containerized video
    analytics tasks, focusing on attack types in Fig. 2. There is a pre-trained machine
    learning model, i.e. decision tree, deployed on edge server for anomaly detection,
    with a control and countermeasure scheme that constantly monitors the system through
    a simulation control for computation security. This pre-trained model is updated
    dynamically, since it is being trained further continuously with the feedback
    received from the simulation control, as well as the investigation results of
    the compromised parties. This secure mechanism, detects DoS attacks and can launch
    security controls such as e.g., pausing of containers inside compromised UAV or
    edge server components, for further investigation and recovery. Fig. 3. DroneNet-Sec
    framework components involving FANET and edge server resources that are integrated
    with security incident response. Show All In the following, we provide details
    of our system threat model, and also describe our use of zero trust architecture
    as well as the hybrid testbed deveopment for studying network-edge connectivity
    security and computation security in DroneNet-Sec. B. Threat Model Amongst the
    numerous targeted attacks on availability, integrity and privacy in UAV systems,
    our focus as shown in Fig. 2 is on DoS, (i.e., UDP flooding), Replay attack and
    MITM attack types. Our threat models is created considering specific scenarios
    as listed in Table I to be implemented and tested on the hybrid testbed. For UDP
    flooding, a compromised UAV starts flooding while the normal network flow with
    image transmissions continue concurrently. Each incoming packet is monitored inside
    the edge resources, and a prediction is made with the pre-trained Decision Tree
    model. In order to filter false positives, a threshold is used to decide whether
    to detect an attack occurrence. This threshold, selected as 500 after running
    experiments helps us to decide on a high enough volume to exclude false positives
    and on a low enough volume to quickly detect and deploy a countermeasure to mitigate
    the attack. Once the number of packets received and classified as suspicious by
    the model reaches the above threshold, the source UAV is labeled as untrusted,
    and the countermeasures for computation security are enforced. The containers
    inside the compromised UAV are paused after getting a snapshot, a message is sent
    to the UAV to ground it, and all the other network activities are halted on that
    UAV, to prevent further impact of the violation. In the case of Replay attacks,
    when one of the UAVs is compromised and eavesdropped, it replays a previous message
    that is spoofed. In order to prevent Replay attacks, the receiver UAV/edge keeps
    tracks of the nonce values of the packets it receives, updates the biggest nonce
    each time it receives a packet with a valid nonce i.e., greater than the previous
    largest number of nonce. If the incoming nonce is smaller than or equal to the
    tracked largest nonce, replay attack is logged and the packet is discarded. In
    the case of MITM attacks, a Poly-1305 message authentication code (MAC) is used
    to authenticate the sender on the receiver side i.e., on the UAV/edge server.
    TABLE I Threat model for a UAV system. C. Use of Zero Trust Architecture Our DroneNet-Sec
    is based on the Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) paradigm [37] that uses the \"never
    Trust, always verify\" principles. DroneNet-Sec provides intelligent mechanisms
    with secure communication and image data messaging, to dynamically adapt the security
    of the multi-UAV system as shown in Fig. 4. We can see that our system with ZTA
    involves reducing access to resources to only those who are \"trusted\" agents.
    We validate all access as necessary and continuously verify the identity of every
    access request, providing a collection of concepts, designs, and architectures
    that are created with the purpose of eliminating the risk. Fig. 4. A new UAV’s
    attempt to access the system resources will be considered as untrusted and moderated
    using a Policy Decision Point (PDP) and a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) by DroneNet-Sec
    to protect the UAV system assets in the operational environment. Show All Our
    ZTA approach focuses on eliminating unauthorized access to data and services of
    the system, making access control enforcement as granular as possible. High granularity
    i.e., dividing access control privileges to a resource into small pieces that
    allow fine-grained authorizations to known agents/UAVs as needed without over/under-provisioning
    of privileges. We enforce policies to allow data/resource assets access to only
    authorized and approved agents, security groups. All other agents, attackers,
    unknown agents, etc. are not authorized and prohibited from accessing the data
    or resource assets. The ZTA-enabled infrastructure ensures users are trustworthy,
    and allows only valid system requests to be authorized through the PDP and PEP
    functionality. Two basic rules are applied with the ZTA, first, authentication,
    and then authorization. Policies such as, can the system remove any uncertainty
    about an agent trying to access the system? Is the access justified? Is the agent
    trusted? For resource access, risk-based policies need to be implemented to ensure
    that authorization policies are performed accurately. Implied trusted zone, outlines
    an area where all the agents are trusted to at least the level of the last PDP
    and PEP gateway. For instance, a UAV has to pass these policies to be allowed
    to have access to a common trusted zone, safe perimeter in the operational UAV
    environment. We remark that the PDP and PEP rules utilize a set of controls and
    mechanisms such as all traffic beyond the trusted zone have a common level of
    trust. These rules must not operate or apply policies beyond its location in the
    flow of traffic. Furthermore, the implied trusted zone must be considered as small
    as possible as a best practice. D. Hybrid Testbed Development We deployed a hybrid
    testbed for the purposes of this study as shown in Fig. 5. The testbed setup includes
    two allocated wireless nodes, one for our computation tasks on the edge, and another
    node for our FANET implementation in a real-time network simulator that instantiates
    a richer wireless topology for our agent drones. The components employed for the
    deployment of our hybrid testbed include, Powder [10] a platform for Open Wireless
    Data-driven Experimental Research, that provides us with computing resources to
    allocate our edge server and FANET resources. This platform is composed synergestically
    with ns-3 [9], an open-source network simulator primarily used in networking research.
    The system communicates with MAVLink [8], a hybrid lightweight messaging protocol
    used for communication amongst drones. It also provides communication between
    on-board drone components, following a modern hybrid publish-subscribe and point-to-point
    design pattern. An autopilot system, Ardupilot [38], supports the flight controllers,
    sensors and frame types. A simulator allows us to test the behaviour of real drones
    without any software. Software In The Loop, [39] and data located in Docker [40]
    containers that allows container-based applications are deployed in an easy, lightweight
    and consistent manner [41] in our hybrid testbed. E. Network-Edge Connectivity
    Security The main components of our hybrid testbed related to experiments with
    network-edge connectivity security can be described as follows: Communication
    between Powder nodes. We implemented a ns3::TapBridgeHelper class and used it
    for the ns-3 side on the FANET to facilitate P2P (Peer-to-Peer) drone communications.
    Reliable User Datagram Protocol (RUDP). While User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is
    simpler and faster than Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), it does not provide
    sequenced message delivery. We made the decision to use UDP over TCP because UDP
    is message-based and not stream-based compared to TCP. Despite the fact that UDP
    structure is relatively simple and offers high processing capabilities, its reliability
    is low as it does not check whether packets have been delivered to the destination
    or not. Another main drawback of UDP is that it keeps transmitting regardless
    of reliability issues, and also sometimes packets are not delivered sequentially
    [42]. To address above issues, we implemented a custom reliable UDP (RUDP) protocol
    for use in the drone-to-drone and drone-to-edge communications (i.e., in the non
    inter-drone services). Our reliable protocol attempts to decrease packet loss,
    and guarantees sequenced data delivery. This aids not just to improve the data
    throughput but also reduces the latency on data packets, which is achieved with
    the employment of sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, and timers to monitor
    packet loss and sequence of the packets received. Secure Messaging. MAVLink packets
    are encrypted with ChaCha20-Poly1305 directly [27], with no need for Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) certificates. This also allows us to prevent Replay attacks
    through the use of an incrementing nonce. In addition, packet encryption can also
    be easily toggled within our experiments to test performance impacts. Fig. 6 gives
    an overview of the custom encrypted packets, with information about target sysid,
    nonce, MAC tag and encrypted MAVLink packet in terms of size. Encrypted packets
    sender and receiver with ChaCha20Poly1305 algorithm. Fig. 7 shows how ChaCha20-Poly1305
    [27] was implemented. The implementation was done with the package available at
    [43], which is a self-contained Python package of low-level cryptographic primitives.
    Authenticated encryption is implemented following one of our basic ZTA rules for
    authentication, which simultaneously assure the confidentiality and authenticity
    of data. The process of encryption and decryption of packages works as follows.
    The sender, provides a plain text in MAVLink protocol, simultaneously, a ChaCha20-Poly1305
    cipher from the shared key and current nonce is generated. This updated cipher
    with receiver’s MAVLink sysid is later encrypted together with the plain text
    from MAVLink. Finally, the nonce is incremented and an encrypted packet is sent.
    From the receiver side, a received encrypted data alongside with nonce and sysid
    is received. After this happens, a series of decisions are made before the plain
    text is decrypted. For instance if the current or the previous received nonce
    is not received, then the packet must be discarded, providing a log replay attack.
    Otherwise, decisions such as updating the received nonce or save current received
    nonce are also made before the ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm is generated in order
    to decrypt the plain text. Fig. 5. Hybrid testbed that includes two allocated
    wireless nodes, one node for our computation tasks on the edge, and another node
    for multi-UAV nodes implementation; built using ns-3 bridge/tap functionality,
    containers for video data processing as microservices, and MAVLink lightweight
    messaging protocol to facilitate peer-to-peer drone communication in a repeatable
    and scalable experiment setup. Show All Fig. 6. Secure messaging with packet encryption
    in our MAVLink protocol implementation. Show All Scalable number of containers
    in ns-3. Our framework is implemented with Docker containers, which run the FANET
    ns-3 simulations. We implemented a Python script that scales the number of containers
    in our ns-3 implementation. This implementation supports reliable and more configurable
    code that helps with an easy integration and supports updates for future work
    involving container orchestration. Our system can support any number up to around
    254 drones as MAVLink supports 255 total systems and a numeric naming scheme is
    used for the bridges/taps, which is necessary for our peer-to-peer FANET setup.
    Image simulation, sending packages from edge to server and viceversa. Our experimentation
    relies on the open-source 10-class geospatial object detection dataset [44]. This
    also aimed us to evaluate the image/data transmission simulation performance of
    our proposed hybrid testbed. For each image, it splits into chunks that fit the
    MAVLink data packet (253 bytes) until it waits for the edge server to send a data
    transmission handshake request. It responds with an acknowledgment, then it sends
    out each image chunk consecutively in MAVLink encapsulated data packs. It does
    this until the image has been sent out fully, then waits for the next request
    from the edge. The goal is to generate network traffic, once all the images in
    the dataset are exhausted, it just restarts the process. A secure messaging scheme
    with custom packet design enforcing data privacy and data integrity, securing
    the messaging in between drone to drone and drone to edge server providing a secure
    protocol over MAVLink. Custom messaging design enforces encryption [27] on the
    MAVLink packet for data privacy. This includes nonce information that can be used
    for enhancing data integrity by keeping track of last nonce, detecting and preventing
    possible replay attacks. The message authentication code (MAC) in the custom message
    is used to prevent MITM attacks by ensuring the source of the message as a trusted
    party. The custom packet is highly scalable, and can provide the secure messaging
    up to 254 UAVs with MAVLink protocol. Fig. 7. Encrypted packets sent between the
    sender and receiver using the ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm. Show All F. Computation
    Security In order to ensure secure computation task offloading in the drone video
    analytics, we need to address security measures for data confidentiality, data
    integrity, and data access controllability. There is a need of a dynamic framework
    to determine if the source UAV is trusted i.e., the data it sends can be received
    and used in the processes in the recipient drone. Based on the ZTA, the trusted
    execution environment allows drones to execute video analytic tasks to run with
    containerized data as shown in Fig. 8. In support of such a functionality, a machine
    learning algorithm that we implemented decides if the source is trusted or not.
    Fig. 8. Cloud-hosted monitoring and anomaly detection module that dynamically
    ensures computation security by controlling container execution only on trusted
    UAV nodes. Show All Computation security is achieved by implementing a framework
    that is dynamic, persistent, and intelligent. Our framework continuously checks
    the status of the edge server and the components (UAV, UAV systems, and machines)
    that are part of the system. Our machine learning algorithm uses system monitoring
    data, including the outputs received from UAV-to-edge and vice versa. Any device
    that attempts to get access to the system must be verified, including data that
    can be accessed and compromised. The framework provides a robust solution to put
    all containerized computation safe and mitigates impact of any potential DoS attacks
    on the system. While constantly monitoring the system, our machine learning implementation
    is trained for DoS attack detection and thus classifies all the traffic deployed
    on the edge. Dynamicity of the framework comes from the constant monitoring and
    the ability to learn from more data produced in the system in order to handle
    new attack types. When there is a DoS attack detected, in order to avoid possible
    false positive effects, a threshold is used before deciding to pause the containers
    inside a compromised component. When the threshold is reached, meaning the suspicious
    activity that has been classified as an attack, the containers inside the compromised
    component are paused and the network traffic for that party is halted for further
    investigation and recovery. Once the containers are paused, the data inside and
    the state of the container is preserved by a snapshot, while halting the network
    also prevents the compromised party to do further damage. The integrated cloud
    resources for the machine learning process help with computationally intensive
    operations involved in the training step. Our cloud-hosted machine learning scheme
    forms a key aspect in dynamically and successfully configuring the security of
    the drone flights at the network-edge. In order to test our cloud-hosted machine
    learning implementation, we utilize the BOUN DDoS dataset [45]. The dataset is
    generated through Hping3 traffic generator software by flooding TCP SYN, and UDP
    packets, towards a server where over 4000 active user traffic was flowing on the
    router at the same time with the attacks. It includes attack-free user traffic
    and attack traffic that makes it suitable for the evaluation of network-based
    DDos attacks detection. We trained a machine learning model and deployed it on
    an edge server for anomaly detection, in which training data can be any existing
    data set and/or real data collected from the hybrid testbed. Model weights are
    updated continuously and dynamically as new data is monitored from the system
    as illustrated in Fig. 9 Fig. 9. Machine learning data training steps with existing
    or collected data from the hybrid testbed. Show All Algorithm 1: Dynamic DoS Attack
    Mitigation Algorithm 1 shows the steps for the anomaly detection process that
    consists of a continuous monitoring of the system. Once an attack is detected
    by the pre-trained Decision Tree model on the edge server, the agent is identified
    and labeled as untrusted. A snapshot of the containers inside the compromised
    drone is taken, then the containers are paused. The network communications are
    also halted with a message that is sent to the compromised drone to ground itself
    for further investigation and recovery. The containerized design of the tasks
    allows the investigation and recovery phase to be performed faster. This is because
    the snapshots can be used to examine the problem further, and rebooting the compromised
    drone or adding a new drone to the system instead of the compromised one can be
    done by deploying the corresponding images. Moreover, isolating the compromised
    drone prevents the spread of the effect. This scheme uses the monitored network
    flow to detect an attack that has been used in the training of the model weights,
    specifically DoS - UDP flooding attacks, which are deployed on the edge server.
    The model can be updated dynamically to detect more complicated attacks and a
    variety of attacks during on-going system operations. SECTION IV. Performance
    Evaluation In this section, we present experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness
    of our DroneNet-Sec framework. All experiments are simulated in our hybrid testbed,
    in which UAVs run containers in a multi-hierarchical manner, with centralized-control
    communication networks, and leveraging edge server data. Each drone is operated
    by one GCS and all commands and computation processes are controlled by a single
    edge server. We also provide experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed
    hybrid testbed. Two Powder wireless nodes include FANET and edge server respectively.
    Seven drones running via ns-3 simulator, Docker containers and Daemon running
    on host node acts as the container manager. We monitor the system CPU and memory
    measurements for each container, during both normal flows and flows with attacks.
    A. Network-Edge Connectivity Security Experiments We implemented a novel secure
    and realistic configuration of computing resources that are extendable and resizable
    on the ns-3 side. Through this configuration, we simulate a large number of UAVs,
    that interface with the Powder side for emulating various edge and cloud computing
    resources. In addition, we develop an image-offloading simulation between the
    FANET network and edge server in a secure manner through a scheme that defends
    against MITM and Replay attacks. Further, we implement a protocol that is specific
    to drones and running experiments with the best encryption method to secure the
    communication between UAVs and GCS. Specifically, we use a custom encrypted packet
    that is designed with MAVLink messages using ChaCha20-Poly1305 for efficiency
    and light-weight functionality. Chacha20-Poly1305 is the combination of two algorithms,
    the Chacha20 stream cipher and the Poly1305 MAC, both designed separately by Daniel
    J. Bernstein. These two algorithms were designed to be fast in software and are
    widely adopted. They also present excellent options to provide encrypted communication
    between, low resourced or constrained UAVs [27]. ChaCha20-Poly1305 is efficient
    and has little overhead for on-board UAV resources. In order to show that ChaCha20Poly1305
    is indeed efficient and has little overhead for onboard UAV resources, we compare
    the performance of the system with and without encryption. Fig. 10 shows the CPU
    Usage %, and Fig. 11 shows the Memory Consumption measurements of messaging in
    the system without encryption and with different encryption algorithms: ChaCha20-Poly1305,
    AES GCM, AES EAX and AES CCM. Our performance evaluation results demonstrate that
    our security mechanism guarantees secure message transmission and communication
    between drone-to-drone and drone-to-GCS links, with less degradation of CPU consumption
    and memory usage, compared to other common encryption algorithms. In these results,
    we can see that the average CPU % consumption for ChaCha20 is the closest one
    to the consumption without any encryption, which is the second smallest as expected.
    On the other hand, in memory consumption %, we can see that ChaCha20 has the closest
    value to no encryption case, which is the second highest. The reason of the reverse
    trend we see on memory consumption when compared to CPU consumption is as follows:
    a faster messaging allows more images being transmitted with packets, leading
    to more packets in the RUDP queue. Hence, the memory consumption is the highest
    in the no encryption case, followed by the ChaCha20 case. Therefore, our evaluation
    results show that ChaCha20Poly1305 performs in a more efficient manner compared
    with other encryption schemes (i.e., AES CCM, AES EAX, AES GCM) and no encryption
    (i.e., plain-text). Thus, we demonstrate our novel security mechanism which has
    the capacity to save memory and battery for drones that have resource constraints
    in the network-edge within a UAV system. Fig. 10. CPU usage performance comparison
    with different encryption methods and without encryption. Show All Fig. 11. Memory
    consumption performance comparison with different encryption methods and without
    encryption. Show All B. Computation Security Experiments Dynamic security scheme
    with machine learning accurately detects anomaly events. While the system is being
    monitored on both UAV and edge sides, we run experiments that involve launching
    DoS attacks i.e., UDP flooding. Either external UAV system or a machine might
    be manipulated to instantiate an attack, in order to interrupt the system availability
    and thereby the system communications. Fig. 12 shows one experiment in which an
    external agent tries to get access to a trusted agent. Since the machine learning
    implementation runs continuously, it checks the status of all the agents that
    are part of the mission. Once the external agent is detected, the trusted agent
    container is immediately paused, and a snapshot of the state and data is obtained.
    Concurrently, all network communication is halted and the trusted UAV is sent
    to GCS for further analysis and recovery. It is important to highlight that even
    if one agent’s container is paused, the rest of the agents that are part of the
    mission are still working. This prevents the spread of the breach in the system
    to other trusted parties, which is important in cloud systems to avoid amplification
    of a breach at cloud-scale. Moreover, the offline analysis and recovery phase
    will provide valuable information to improve the security of the system, while
    rebooting the compromised UAV will be fast with containerization. In order to
    understand better the severity of this type of attacks, we run a series of experiments
    to demonstrate the number of transmitted images with no attacks and the system
    under increasing number of attackers. In Fig. 13 shows the number of transmitted
    packets with a normal network traffic and when 1, 2 and 3 attackers flooding the
    network traffic, respectively. As expected, the degradation on the system gets
    more severe as the number of attackers and the duration of attacks increase. Security
    framework improves the network throughput under DoS attack. We considered an experiment
    scenario to demonstrate network throughput improvement using the security framework
    under DoS attacks. In the experiment scenario, the packets are sent for the first
    60 seconds without any attack, on the 60th second, the first attacker starts UDP
    flooding. On 120th second, the second attacker starts UDP flooding. On the 180th
    second, the third attacker starts UDP flooding. The number of packets received
    by the attack monitoring on the edge server under this experiment can be found
    in Fig. 14. This experiment shows how the framework handles the attacks in short
    time and the throughput does not flatten as in Fig. 13, where there are no security
    measures. Also, the throughput does not drop after attacks start, but packets
    are received continuously, while under attack, since only the compromised UAV
    container is paused. Machine learning classification methods implementation utility.
    We tested a variety of classical machine learning classification methods on the
    BOUN DDoS dataset [45]. To do this, we made significant changes to the implementation
    associated with work [46], and made several changes to their classical machine
    learning code for our purposes. We selected 4 features; Time,Frame_length,Source_ip,Destination_IP
    with respect to our monitoring collections of packets from our hybrid testbed
    that are relevant to our setup. The data from BOUN containing UDP flood attacks
    with the 4 features were used to train 6 different models. Given that all IPs
    are the same, the port is used as a weight against the IP with a bitwise XOR,
    and the dataset relies on inference between IP addresses, packet size and time.
    Fig. 12. Experiment scenario illustration to handle an attacker’s attempt to get
    unauthorized access to information from a secure drone, which involves anomaly
    detection and a security control initiation to pause the relevant container in
    a compromised UAV node. Show All Fig. 13. Total images received without any security
    measures for cases involving: no attacker, one, two and three UDP flooding attackers.
    Show All Fig. 14. Total packets received under UDP flooding attack experiment
    scenario involving: packets sent without any attack in first 60 seconds, and consequent
    attack initiations with a 60 second inter-attack period. Show All With respect
    to the testing measurements of the trained models that can be seen in Table II,
    Decision Tree, and KNN classifiers performed the best, followed by Random Forest;
    all models achieved greater than 90 percent F1 score, while Logistic Regression,
    Naive Bayes, AdaBoost performed poorly. Table III shows timing characteristics
    to demonstrate that using machine learning models (especially Decision Tree) to
    perform inference continuously is suitable in terms of speed and accuracy in a
    real-time UAV system. TABLE II Machine Learning based classification results TABLE
    III Machine Learning training and testing time results Using the collected statistics
    and timing results from these experiments, we chose to implement the Decision
    Tree model that was the fastest and most accurate model in comparison with the
    other models. As a final step, we evaluated this chosen model on more than 14,000
    simulated packets that were collected from our hybrid testbed implementation,
    with an average prediction time per packet being less than half a second. The
    accuracy achieved on the real data experiments on the testbed is 0.977, where
    precision is 1, recall is 0.920 and the F1 measure is 0.958, compared to the results
    obtained from the training dataset. The results on the real data thus show that
    our chosen model is highly suitable for detecting UDP flood attacks and allows
    UAV system operators to make the necessary corrective actions with high speed
    and accuracy. SECTION V. Conclusion In this paper, we proposed a framework to
    secure drone communications and improve computation security in video processing
    container tasks in terms of data privacy, integrity and availability. Our scheme
    features an intelligent and dynamic decision algorithm to detect anomaly events
    in a UAV system with FANET configuration without decreasing the performance. Our
    scheme performance can be improved continuously with the feedback from the system
    itself, as the system operates in the field. We created and deployed a hybrid
    testbed management module that synergized simulation and emulation experiments
    as part of realistic scenarios for evaluation studies. Hybrid testbed experiment
    results showed that our proposed security framework successfully detects anomaly
    events on drones in a fast and accurate manner, allows for secure messaging with
    the MAVLink protocol, and provides UAV system operators the necessary knowledge
    to securely operate containers for drone video analytics. As part of future work,
    we are planning to create investigation and recovery schemes for video processing
    pipelines, along with forensic investigation techniques based on offline analysis.
    This will help in analyzing the snapshots or images of the paused containers for
    providing feedback to the system to further improve the security scheme by using
    transfer learning. Future work can also support multiple FANETs in the edge server,
    and provide more options such as drones going out of range, or operating on different
    FANET topologies. Further, our work on using machine learning models can be extended
    to detect and mitigate the impact of other attacks such as probing, GPS jamming
    or zero-day anomalies. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This material is based upon work supported

    Location: Beijing, China SECTION I. Introduction In the present, the information
    data generated by sensor and Internet of Things (IoT) devices is increasing every
    day. These devices are characterized by limited data processing and stability.
    That limitations are solved by offloading processing and storage from devices
    to the cloud. The cloud is an ideal solution for computation offloading due to
    its on-demand and easily scalable for the future system. However, cloud computing
    resources are hosted in large data centers built in locations far away from most
    end-users. For this reason, resulting in a high communication latency between
    end users and the cloud. Moreover, the increasing amount of data transfer from
    several devices will increase the load on the network to the cloud. To help these
    issues, the concept of edge and fog computing has been proposed. The Computing
    resources are made available at the edge of the network, close to end devices,
    make the devices generating the data reduces communication latency. Furthermore,
    network-intensive data can be processed and analyzed just one access point from
    end-devices and reducing the bandwidth demands on network to data centers. Mobility
    and distribution are the key ability of IoT deployments that can solve by edge
    computing. A few example applications include traffic management for vehicles,
    make some real-time analytic of data collected for rapid control devices in industrial,
    environment in building, and agriculture monitoring through wireless sensor networks.
    From the above, in this paper we focus in developing the Edge hub for supporting
    of wireless sensor based on docker containers and docker swarm orchestration.
    We discuss the prototype implementation of edge hub for efficient environ-mental
    management in the building. SECTION II. Edge hub Architecture Design The edge
    hub is prototype and verified as an example case. It aims to the efficient environmental
    management in the building with the support of monitoring and recording the physical
    conditions of the environment. The edge hub is designed into collection, transportation,
    processing, storing, and visualization, as shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 1. IoT Edge Hub
    Architecture. Show All A. Edge hub : Device Access and Transport In Edge hub,
    Node-Red base flow editing is used for determination of data transport from various
    data sources [1]. Node-Red, placed as Docker containers in Raspberry Pi4, control
    the collection and transport of environment data. Then, the environment data on
    the IoT devices sending mqtt message into MOSCA brokers in the edge hub. MOSCA,
    as a node.js mqtt broker, which can be used standalone and embedded in another
    Node.js application [2]. In the edge hub manager, each edge hub has a MOSCA broker.
    The environment data is distributed and stored in multiple edge hub. If a broker
    is interrupted, the other brokers can help to backup the environment data. B.
    Edge hub : Rule Engine and Storing Rule Engine is a system that applies a series
    of decisions to determine how to react to a certain situation or what to do with
    a piece of data. It helps you model complex logic in an easy way. Collected data
    from MOSCA brokers are handled over to Node-Red flow agent. Node-Red supports
    many of extension module for data processing. Node-Red can customize flow to determine
    condition for piece of data. The environment data, temporarily stored in MOSCA
    brokers, is processed by Node-Red. After data processing, the processed data is
    stored in flowagent. The group of environment data can store data in message format.
    Message data is stored as format in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and processed
    data is stored into a MongoDB NoSQL database [3]. C. Edge hub : Visualization
    The stored data can be visualized by Grafana. Grafana is open source visualization
    and analytics software. It allows to query, visualize, alert on, and explore your
    metrics no matter where they are stored [4]. Grafana also has many kinds of extension
    plug-in to match diverse IoT Cloud service platform and interface with the data
    storage options of Edge hub. SECTION III. Implementation of edge hub for wireless
    sensor networks The edge hub for Wireless Sensor Networks consist of two group
    of devices, as shown in Fig. 2. One group is 18 nodeMCU, utilized as environment
    sensor for IoT things to collect the environment data, temperature, humidity,
    Brightness, and particulate matter 2.5. The next group is 7 single-board Raspberry
    Pi4, which 6 Raspberry board for processing IoT devices on each floor and 3 Raspberry
    board for docker Swarm-based orchestration. In this implementation, all devices
    are inter-connected by both wired and wireless connections into a private building
    network. Fig. 2. IoT Edge Hub Architecture. Show All To monitor environment building,
    IoT device is measured every 10 seconds by SHT-31 (temperature and humidity),
    LDR (Brightness), and SPS30 (PM 2.5) sensors connected to NodeMCU. To collect
    the environment data and send them in the mqtt protocol into edge hub, some library
    from arduino IDE is used. Fig. 3. The edge hub display PM 2.5 on grafana dashboard.
    Show All Grafana visualization tool is used to visualize the collected time-series
    data in MongoDB. The visualized information provided by environment parameter
    consist of temperature, humidity, brightness and PM 2.5. With Grafana, it is easy
    to see changes in the specific period. The default refresh period is set to 5
    seconds. As shown in Fig. 3, the gauge and chart widget display PM 2.5 values
    on difference position in building, which each widget requires a determine query
    to collect data from MongoDB. In this case, We adopt Docker Swarm [5] as the container
    orchestration tool for Wireless Sensor Networks in building. Since the service
    performance and resource utilization need to automatically orchestration for dynamic
    containerized deployment when increasing the scale of IoT devices connection.
    The edge hub can be facilitated by utilizing Docker Swarm orchestration as manager
    Node controls the entire cluster management and task distribution. [6] SECTION
    IV. Conclusion and perspectives In this paper, we presented a Development prototype
    of IoT Edge Hub for Wireless Sensor Networking based on Docker Container. This
    concept uses Docker Swarm orchestration to build wireless communication networks
    by docker con-tainer. Thus, the use of wireless sensor networks in building is
    undoubtedly beneficial to the development of building management systems. As perspectives,
    we want to develop and implement communication on the other field such as rapid
    control devices in industrial, and agriculture , not only environment sensor but
    also energy consumption sensor. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    been a recent spike of research activity in precision agriculture and environmental
    sustainability [1]. One popular direction, focuses on the advances of cloud computing
    enablers [2] and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [3]. These systems embed pioneering
    wireless technologies, such as ZigBee [4,5], to monitor field conditions in secure
    and credible ways [6]. The current trend, however, especially when considering
    the wide proliferation of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications [7,8], and
    the opportunities that they bring [9], is to employ a cloud/fog computing environment
    [10,11,12], offering computing, networking, and storage support near the end user,
    minimizing response times and greatly improving operational capacity and scalability.
    Cloud servers (typically located in large data centers) are expected to have increased
    computational capabilities, whereas fog devices located in close proximity to
    the end users will obtain similar, though less-in-power attributes [13], and transmute
    them into suitable candidates for offloading cloud elastic resources and alleviating
    the communication overhead and traffic burden. 1.1. Challenges and Motivation
    Despite the turn towards these information communication technologies (ICT), current
    practices focus heavily on standalone and trivial data logger systems, whose main
    tasks are data acquisition, regarding specific environmental facets, from spatially
    distributed sensors [14]. These initiatives, although useful, lack sophistication
    and do not take advantage of the full potential brought about by the assimilation
    of cloud/fog IoT platforms. That being said, the design, implementation, and large-scale
    installation of a fully functional IoT platform will provide the involved parties
    with instant decision-making models, yielding an analytical understanding of natural
    systems. When combined with other visualization and knowledge tools, such as area
    maps or hazard scale metrics, they can become highly effective actuators for adaptive
    field administration, targeted interventions, and personalized notification procedures.
    Nevertheless, their programming is considered a devious process that requires
    expertise and extensive know-how, since in most cases it relies on custom-designed
    equipment and non-standard hardware solutions [15]. Therefore, the procurement
    of a complete design methodology across all system elements is imperative and
    the main motivation behind the current work, which attempts to address these issues
    with the proposition of a complete field-to-stakeholder IoT solution. Meanwhile,
    the challenges that arise are numerous, especially when it comes to monitoring
    catastrophic events in nature [16], e.g., floods [17], earthquake activity [18],
    and volcanic eruptions [19]; or biological dangers to the plantation itself, e.g.,
    vegetation deceases and pest infestations, which deeply distort the health of
    the farms, forests, and wild-lands, thereby requiring clear and fast tracking
    of the agents that cause them, and a continuous stream of data regarding the conditions
    that drive their spreading. For example, consider the work found in [20], which,
    much like the study presented here, reports on the development of a WSN-based
    IoT system, coupled with cloud/fog liturgies, to address time-sensitive agents
    that affect the health of olive groves. Still, one of the major challenging environmental
    hazards to confront is the wildfire, mainly due to the large number of different
    variables affecting this complex phenomenon, which can wreak havoc on vast areas
    of land [21]. With that said, the main causal factors remain high temperature
    and low relative humidity, especially in prolonged drought during summer seasons,
    which is a common sight in regions such as the Mediterranean basin [22]. However,
    in conjunction with heterogeneous geographic and micro-climate habitats, such
    as the ones found in the island regions of Greece, their appearance becomes increasingly
    hard to predict. In such circumstances, in order to offer targeted fire suppression
    techniques, the WSNs must be deployed in various landscapes with potentially diversified
    prevailing conditions (e.g., under different altitudes, wind conditions, temperature/humidity
    levels, etc.), making the system complex and hard to manage. Consequently, the
    procurement of an ergonomic, adaptable, and easy-to-use IoT system, able to promptly
    manage data from various input sources, along with suitable visualization, forecasting,
    and decision-support functionality, is of the utmost importance for understanding
    habitat inter-dependencies and a key element of the proposed system in the current
    work. Lastly, most existing systems for environmental monitoring or fire prediction/detection
    require significant computational resources and do not incorporate self-acting
    operational conformation towards achieving increased precision and energy conservative
    automation. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first complete
    end-to-end IoT implementation that attempts to tackle these issues based on local
    decision-making processes at the fog layer. 1.2. Contribution The fundamental
    premise of this paper lies in the presentation of a three-layered cloud/fog computing
    architecture, suitable for facilitating smart agricultural applications, especially
    those related to wildfire monitoring, and to propose a low-cost, WSN-based IoT
    system that seamlessly embeds the proposed logic. The presented architecture follows
    the main directions of the cloud/fog computing paradigm [10] based on the general
    framework found in [12]. In particular, Guardo et al. [12] revealed how the cloud/fog
    hybrid architecture can be effectively utilized in agriculture and they evaluated
    it using a prototype of ten nodes. In the current work, the basic principles are
    similar with an emphasis on the special case of wildfires; hence, a prototype
    system of 25 sensing nodes, forming six (6) distinct WSNs, each equipped with
    its own sink node, which is in turn connected to a fog device and then to the
    remote cloud server, is assumed for evaluation purposes. The prototype has been
    developed in the facilities of the Ionian University and is able to autonomously
    adjust its operations to mirror the necessity for efficient wildfire alertness
    and lower power consumption. To demonstrate its potential, the prototype was put
    to the test in a controlled laboratory environment, with the most important evaluation
    metric being response time, which is considered vital for smart applications of
    the future. Experimental results showcase how such an architecture can indeed
    improve precision, by effectively reducing the average response time across all
    used platforms, with parallel energy efficiency, and high accuracy and throughput
    rates. To further validate the criticality-adaptable behavior, the prototype was
    calibrated to deal with one of the most imminent threats to rural and outdoor
    environments, i.e., wildfires. Greece is known for suffering from heavy fire activity
    [23]. In fact, the annually burned area exceeds 245,000 acres of land, and so
    the experiment has great value for future farming in the area. As a case-study
    scenario, the Island of Corfu was considered for the firefighting period of 2019,
    to showcase the architecture’s conforming character under different fire risk
    ignition severity degrees. Experimentation under these conditions showed great
    promise, highlighted the role of fog computing in dealing with such extreme phenomena,
    and verified the flexibility of the hardware components used. Moreover, to better
    visualize and manage the systems’ outputs, a user-driven graphical user interface
    (GUI) has also been developed to accompany the prototype system and assist the
    involved parties in the decision-making process, named the Fog-assisted Environmental
    Monitoring System, or F.E.MO.S. In short. That being said, F.E.MO.S. provides
    users with the ability to oversee the whole sensing process as it enfolds with
    suitable data curation and visualization. In fact, based on the two environmental
    sensed parameters (i.e., temperature and relative humidity), it is capable of
    objectively assessing the fire ignition risk, based on the popular \"Chandler
    burning index\" (CBI) [24], and generating an indication of the fire risk severity,
    subsequently allowing for targeted countermeasures that will mitigate the hazard.
    In this direction, automated notification alerts are generated to instantly mobilize
    the authorities to take appropriate mitigation actions. The main contributing
    factors of the current paper can be summarized in the next bulletpoints. A robust
    three-layered cloud/fog computing architecture for environmental monitoring, capable
    of dynamically conforming its sensing functionality to meet stringent latency
    requirements and the needs for energy conservation, and high accuracy and throughput.
    A thorough presentation of its data flow and operations, starting from the initialization
    of the field WSNs and reaching up to the remote cloud infrastructure, in order
    to contextualize the steps undertaken from data acquisition to the creation of
    the appropriate response analysis. The design, analysis, and development of a
    proof-of-concept prototype, mirroring the given architecture and utilizing state-of-art
    and low-cost hardware modules for transparent interactions. Its performance evaluation
    primarily via the response time metric, which is crucial for time-sensitive agricultural
    applications of the future, especially those keeping track of wildfire activity.
    The experimentation with real fire risk data considering the fire fighting season
    of 2019 for Corfu Island, which demonstrates how the considered approach can be
    effectively utilized to deal with such phenomena and showcases its alertness-adjustable
    character. The implementation of an accompanying user-friendly web application
    to monitor the system’s behavior and data curation and acquire real-time information
    relating to the monitored fields’ health, including CBI-based fire risk severity
    forecasting along with the autonomous generation of appropriate notification alerts
    to actuate fast mobilization and countermeasures. The aim here is on timely environmental
    monitoring, especially regarding wildfire ignition prediction and early detection;
    nonetheless, the novelty lies with the considered cloud/fog IoT solution that
    can be utilized for a wide range of time-sensitive agricultural applications with
    simple system modifications. Since its functionality is easily adjustable to network
    alterations or ecosystem changes, it can be easily customized and expanded to
    map its activity to the farmers’ occasional needs and demands regarding other
    smart agriculture and forestry applications. The remainder of the present paper
    is organized as follows. In Section 2 necessary background concepts are summarized.
    The proposed hybrid cloud/fog computing architecture, networking principles, and
    data flow methodology are underscored in Section 3. The evaluation process is
    presented in Section 4, while the appliance experiment for the case study of wildfires
    is showcased in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and outlines
    directions for future work. 2. Literature Background The current section presents
    related work regarding IoT systems and WSNs in the environmental/agricultural
    monitoring and fire prediction/detection/protection sectors. 2.1. Internet of
    Things and Wireless Sensor Networks For both existing and upcoming applications,
    given the standardization process of the emerging Fifth-Generation (5G) of mobile
    communications [25], one of the major aspects that requires careful consideration
    is the support of multiple devices with parallel real-time processing of large
    volumes of data [26]. This is essential for the assimilation of IoT decision-making
    functionalities, with low energy consumption [27] and high accuracy and throughput
    [28]. An IoT system consists of smart devices that collect, transmit, and act
    on data they acquire from the environment, without the need for human intervention
    [15]. Each IoT device transmits its data either directly to the Internet or through
    a gateway, which are then gathered at a central station for further computation
    and analysis. However, the centralized paradigm does not always meet the storage
    and process requirements for the amount of data. This becomes abundantly obvious
    when considering the diversity of these devices and their lightweight and resource-constrained
    nature [29]. An alternative road refers to the benefits brought by the integration
    of cloud computing [30]. Moreover, the Internet necessities for low latency and
    high mobility push the cloud functionality to the edges of the IoT network [31],
    making way for fog computing [32], offering higher cognition and agility [33,34].
    That being so, the IoT appliances have made a great leap in the direction of meeting
    high quality of service guarantees set by the upcoming 5G era, especially when
    combined with heterogeneous WSN systems [35,36]. WSNs generally consist of battery-powered
    sensor nodes that are spatially distributed in a wide area, capable of sensing
    environmental conditions, using powerful processors with low energy consumption
    [37], a subject of the utmost importance when realizing IoT platforms [38]. The
    data are often transmitted in a multi-hop manner towards a sink node, which can
    either store them locally or transmit them to a central location [39], e.g., a
    collection server. Until recently, such systems faced many challenges, mainly
    due to the lack of wide-area connectivity and energy resources, and sometimes
    harsh environmental conditions. However, modern WSNs, though their inbuilt routing
    and relay capabilities [40], can quickly adjust to topology changes, allowing
    their large-scale deployment, even in areas where the battery replenishment may
    not always be feasible. A popular WSN configuration nowadays embeds Arduino boards
    [41] and utilizes the ZigBee module [5]. 2.2. Related Research in the Agricultural/Environmental
    Monitoring Sector Precision agriculture and smart farming [42] are considered
    two of the most rapidly evolving sciences of the twentieth century and major pillars
    for boosting productivity and economic growth [43]. Ergo, modern research turns
    to the previous ICT solutions and their seamless migration towards a multidisciplinary
    model [11] to support these sectors [28,44]. In fact, innovative enablers and
    wireless technologies (like SigFox [45], LoRa [46], NB-IoT [47], GSM-IoT [48],
    and ZigBee [49,50]) have empowered the involved stakeholders with the ability
    to experiment, manage, and record the dynamics of complex systems [51]. With that
    in mind, many systems, besides deceasing spread [52] or pest infestations [53],
    now tackle other aspects for climate protection, as identified in [54]. A recent
    appliance that meets these guidelines was described in [55]; the paper details
    a control system for monitoring field data originating from camera and sensor
    nodes deployed in crops. It then actuated the control devices adhering to threshold
    constraints relating to specific climate agents. One of the major WSN obstacles
    refers to the energy needed to keep the network “alive”. Many works attempt to
    address this barrier. Suárez-Albela et al. [56] identified in this regard the
    opportunities that arise from smart micro-controllers, such as Orange Pis. Meanwhile
    in [57], a green WSN node suitable for fog computing platforms named “FROG” was
    proposed, which introduces proactive power management tools for smart farming.
    In the present project, the WSN heavy demands on energy are counterbalanced with
    the use of Arduino boards that have been proven power-efficient (e.g., in [27]),
    along with ZigBee antennas, which yield significant energy gains [58]. Likewise,
    the utilization of Raspberry Pis has also revolutionized the data curation process.
    The work in [59] details a WSN, where information is collected by a Raspberry
    Pi acting as the base station. In the case of [59], however, the Raspberry Pi
    was used as a database and web server to manage the data. Similarly, in [60],
    the overseeing Raspberry Pi was responsible for data acquisition and analysis,
    while in [61] it created appropriate visualization. Contrarily, in the current
    study the Raspberry Pis are assigned the role of driving the data processing procedure
    through fog computing methods. Diving deeper into the cloud/fog architecture,
    the works in [62] proposed a scalable fog network architecture to increase coverage
    and throughput. Emphasis was given to cross-layer channel access and routing,
    combining inputs generated in multiple networks. However, this work does not involve
    the use of open-access hardware and software utilities offered by Arduino and
    ZigBee, respectively, as in the current work. On the other hand, Bin Baharudin
    et al. [63] showcased the benefits of using Raspberry Pis as fog gateways in a
    three-layered IoT architecture, similarly to the one incorporated here, using
    ZigBee for communication. Clearly, ZigBee has been identified as a reliable and
    affordable standard for smart agriculture realization (e.g., [64]), thereby becoming
    the central field communication protocol here. On a different path, the authors
    in [65] explored agricultural WSNs consisting entirely of Raspberry Pis. In their
    system, WSN administration was enabled using a GUI, developed in ”MATLAB” and
    installed on the base station’s board. Likewise, Zamora-Izquierdo et al. [66]
    developed an IoT platform for greenhouse automation that allows human operators
    to configure the individual system components through an ”HTML5” interface. Understandably,
    GUIs are essential for an enhanced end-to-end IoT monitoring solution. This is
    clearly demonstrated in [14] and highly acknowledged in the current work, which
    also provides a user-driven GUI for delivering the system outputs in a user-friendly
    manner. The majority of WSNs are deployed in uncontrolled areas, making them vulnerable
    to various types of attacks. Souissi et al. [67] try to tackle this issue by introducing
    trust in three different levels, namely, the data acquisition level (when the
    node takes a measurement), the network level (between the nodes of the network),
    and the data fusion level (during the aggregation and the processing of the measurements).
    Fortino et al. [68] performed a comparison of the existing architectures by modeling
    trust in IoT environments. Meanwhile, there is always a possibility that incoming
    packets may suffer from data distortions. To detect such occurrences, a field
    is usually used, called \"checksum.\" Alternatively, Cao et al. [69] attempt to
    overcome this problem by deducing the measurements’ correctness, based on predefined
    boundaries (e.g., for the temperature the boundary could be set in the  [−5,40]
    ∘ C). Another problem that WSN-based system operators have to consider is the
    false data detection. Casado-Vara et al. [70] offered a distributed algorithm
    that allows the collected temperature data to be self-corrected by the neighboring
    nodes’ readings. In the current project, simple data validation is conducted in
    the considered fog computing network, where the fog devices evaluate the consistency
    of the received data packets. Lastly, a special case of IoT refers to their assimilation
    for the detection and management of extreme events caused by climate change or
    other ecological agents. In general, this is a difficult ordeal due to the complex
    nature and conditions that lead up to their emergence; however, with WSN-based
    IoT infrastructures, new opportunities have come to light [71], enabling time-critical
    data curation, while achieving high semantic correlation and efficient risk forecasting
    [72]. To mention a few, consider the following for extreme weather estimation
    [73], air pollution detection [74], earthquake prediction [18], flood warning
    [75], landslide analysis [76], oceanic monitoring [77], etc. Unfortunately, one
    of the most sensitive and unpredictable hazardous phenomena is the wildfire, which
    leads to extensive catastrophes around the globe. The next subsections describe
    to relevant research into these events. 2.3. Related Research in the Wildfire
    Monitoring Sector A plethora of systems have been developed to monitor the wildlands
    for fire threats. Nevertheless, the integration of WSNs for fire regime tracking
    has not yet been thoroughly explored, although there exists increasing research
    activity towards this direction (e.g., [78,79,80]), because compared to conventional
    methods, such as satellite imagery, which is affected by weather conditions (e.g.,
    clouds), the amount of smoke, the image resolution, etc., WSNs offer faster detection
    [81]. According to Li et al. [82], these WSNs must possess four key aspects, namely,
    reactivity, reliability, robustness, and network lifespan elongation. Consequently,
    exertions are placed in realizing systems with these attributes. For instance,
    the research by [83] outlines a novel WSN monitoring methodology that adopts a
    maintenance process to detect temperature anomalies. On the other hand, [84] follows
    a contiguous approach to the one presented here, to adjust their prototype’s sampling
    and reporting rates based on temperature fluctuations, while the work in [85]
    provided a fire detection WSN clustering solution with notable reduction in energy
    consumption. The current study adjusts the response time of the system by using
    the risk degree that Greece’s General Secretariat for Civil Protection (GSCP)
    publishes every day for the fire fighting season. Additionally, the interval between
    measurement readings depends on the risk degree, resulting in energy conservation
    when the fire risk is low. Obviously, energy conservation is important to prolonging
    the WSN’s life. Having this in mind, the authors of [86] have developed an energy-efficient
    fire monitoring protocol, i.e., ”EFMP”, over clustered-based WSNs. Their results
    showed potential for overall energy consumption reduction, by forming a multi-layer
    cluster hierarchy depending on forest fire propagation. Despite its effectiveness,
    the EFMP introduces additional system complexity for dynamically computing the
    hierarchy. Ergo, alternative communication protocols have also been proposed.
    For instance, in [87,88] the authors have designed WSN systems, where the data
    transactions are conducted over the ZigBee protocol. Their experimentation results
    conduced that ZigBee is a powerful enabler for fire weather monitoring. Similarly,
    this study uses the ZigBee to realize the communication between the WSNs’ nodes.
    At the same time, many frameworks sanctioned by different emerging ICT have been
    also explored, e.g., [89,90], aiming to accomplish reliable field data dissemination,
    promptly predict wildfire ignitions, and autonomously launch avoidance responses.
    Similarly, Kaur and Sood [91] proposed a fog-assisted IoT framework for forecasting
    fire incidents. The framework, close to the current approach, comprises three
    layers, namely, the data accumulation, fog, and cloud layers. Experimentation
    exhibited high precision in assessing the susceptibility of the considered habitat
    towards wildfire spreading. Note that many frameworks, like the ones presented
    in [92,93], employ WSNs established by Arduino sensory nodes along with Raspberry
    Pi gateways, since their highly customizable and flexible modes allow for the
    fast adaptation to the ever-changing climate conditions that favor the fire regime.
    That being said, the presented study also employs a similar architecture, using
    Arduino-powered sensory nodes and Raspberry Pis as intermediary nodes between
    the WSNs and the remote cloud server. Moving on, Roque and Padilla [94] developed
    a prototype using Arduino Uno that communicates through Sigfox. Their prototype
    is able to detect fires utilizing sensors for temperature and smoke/gas concentrations.
    Despite their positive performance in terms of response time, their solution is
    only able to detect fire. In contrast, the current approach is able to also predict
    fire ignitions, by utilizing temperature and humidity readings. The same applies
    when considering the case of the LoRaWAN prototype found in [95]. On the other
    hand, works like [93,96,97,98] take a different approach through neural networks,
    resulting in highly accurate fire models via pattern recognition, especially when
    considering long-term monitoring. These works highlight the efficiency of machine/deep
    learning approaches that are lightweight enough to run even on Raspberry Pis.
    Although the current work does not include such algorithms, it is understandable
    that they can easily be embedded in future work to increase precision and timely
    warnings. Other studies employ alternative means of detection, e.g., Khan et al.
    [99] used cameras, while Kalatzis et al. [100] used unmanned aerial vehicles.
    However, these are more expensive to deploy and on many occasions do not fare
    well under conditions of heavy rain, fog, snow, mist, etc., and so fail to promptly
    acknowledge fire incidents. Whatever the case, the main aim in all the aforementioned
    works remains the early fire detection in order to launch appropriate remedy countermeasures
    (like the ones shown in [101,102]), and to execute evacuation procedures (e.g.,
    [103]), while conserving precious energy resources [104] and reducing the end-to-end
    delay [105], as outlined by [106]. With that said, a close alternative approach
    to the one followed here is located in [107], which provides a similar IoT platform
    for the semantic correlation of the generated raw data and their interpretation
    in terms of imposed fire risk, based on the popular “fire weather index” (FWI)
    [108]. That particular index is very accurate; however, it requires costly hardware
    installations. Contrarily, the IoT solution presented here utilizes the CBI [24],
    which is also precise, but most importantly it relies solely on atmospheric agents,
    making it a suitable candidate for low-cost implementations. To better contextualize
    this claim, the following subsection enlists some of the most popular fire danger
    indexes (FDI) and their requirements. 2.4. Overview of Fire Danger Indexes Fire
    outbreaks are affected by different factors related to various physical processes
    and events. To quantify the fire risk situation, different FDIs have been proposed
    that combine different quantity environment variables to compute the ignition
    risk [109]. The McAthur Mark 5 FDI, also known as the ”forest fire danger index”
    (FFDI), is one of the oldest measures, dating back to the 1960s. It is mostly
    utilized in Australia and is characterized by five ratings, these being low, moderate,
    high, very high, and extreme. Noble et al. [110] expressed the FFDI as an equitation
    based on wind speed, relative humidity, temperature, and drought effects. Contrarily,
    the FWI is a fire risk model issued by the Canadian Forestry Service in the 1970s
    [108]. It is affected by four meteorological parameters regarding the noon temperature,
    noon relative humidity, 24 h precipitation levels, and the maximum speed of the
    average wind. Its mathematical output procures a number ranging from 0 to 25,
    which is then suitably mapped to the very low, low, moderate, high, or extreme
    fire severity risk indications. Although it is considered a highly accurate metric,
    de Groot et al. [111] showed that it requires significant calibration for the
    classification thresholds to suit the local weather conditions appropriately.
    Compared to FFDI and FWI, a simpler solution has been proposed by Sharples et
    al. [112], which is correspondingly called the ”simple fire danger index” (F).
    F takes into account the wind velocity, fuel moisture content, temperature, and
    relative humidity to divide the fire danger into a five-level scale that ranges
    from low to extreme. Although simpler than the FFDI and FWI, it has generated
    mixed performance results that depend on the site of deployment [109]. The aforementioned
    FDIs are costly when observed from the perspective of equipment utilization. Moreover,
    they demand a priori the collection of large volumes of data, in order to produce
    accurate risk classification, especially when considering highly heterogeneous
    environments such as the Mediterranean Basin. The CBI, however, which was initially
    proposed by the Chandler et al. [24] in the 1980s, is solely based on weather
    conditions. Hence, it only requires the air temperature and relative humidity
    conditions to calculate the immediate fire risk. This makes CBI cost-efficient,
    since it does not postulate high equipment expenses for the collection and analysis
    of the field data, rendering it an ideal candidate for low-cost implementations
    and time-critical applications, as is the case here. 3. System Design and Configuration
    Having discussed relevant literature, it is now feasible to venture forth and
    thoroughly present the proposed IoT solution. Although the scope here focuses
    on wildfire, the presented architecture is generic and can easily cope and comply
    with other types of timely environmental monitoring applications. 3.1. The Considered
    Cloud/Fog Computing Network Architecture The particular cloud/fog hybrid architecture
    proposed here (i.e., Figure 1) follows a simple layering model to categorize the
    available services based on resource availability. Figure 1. The considered three-layered
    cloud/fog computing IoT architecture for environmental monitoring, with an emphasis
    on fire detection applications. Cloud computing providers commonly employ data
    centers considering various parameters, such as user proximity and energy consumption
    [113]. Thus the top layer, i.e., the cloud layer, usually includes a cloud infrastructure,
    formed by data centers offering amenities and resources, which are dynamically
    allocated based on the users’ demands. These services may include, among other
    things, storage, networking, and server (computational power, rendering tools,
    etc.) privileges, as illustrated in Figure 1. As expected, cloud data centers
    are usually situated in remote, safe locations and require expensive installations.
    To procure an affordable and scalable solution, the fog computing paradigm has
    been proposed. Fog devices, similarly to their cloud-only counterparts, can act
    as mini data centers that are generally cheaper and highly accessible, extending
    the service provisioning to the edges of the network [114], forming an intermediary
    layer, i.e., the fog layer. In this way, the computational burden is alleviated
    and resources are freed, avoiding traffic bottlenecks and increasing the cloud/fog
    system’s overall capacity. The application layer, located at the bottom layer,
    corresponds here to agricultural/environmental monitoring applications that have
    already been described in Section 2, including the ones that address the subject
    of fire handling events, running on the deployed WSNs. The last are comprised
    of devices called sensory nodes, capable of monitoring environmental agents, such
    as temperature and humidity, and a sink node, which is tasked with collecting
    all the field readings and reporting back to the higher layers for further computation.
    Note that end users also include the various stakeholders that manage the particular
    WSNs—farmers, firefighting services, researchers, environmental agencies, etc.,
    possibly through various GUIs—different displays, smart or mobile devices, diversified
    platforms, etc., and are responsible for initiating appropriate countermeasures
    in cases of emergency (e.g., fire ignition) or high risk (e.g., when temperature
    and humidity favor the spreading of wildfire). Clearly, the end users on most
    occasions can access fog devices in their near vicinity, without the necessity
    for establishing connections with the remote cloud servers. As a result, communication
    bandwidth is saved and the proposed architecture can trigger actions with lesser
    delay, reducing network congestion near the cloud servers if the need arises.
    3.2. Hardware and Software Specifications In the current subsection, a proposed
    customizable configuration comprising popular hardware micro-controllers for realizing
    the WSNs and a fog computing network is provided. These rely on market-based low-cost
    hardware solutions and established software operating systems and formats. The
    WSNs are synthesized by sensory nodes, governed by the sink node, which is responsible
    for data collection. All nodes consist of Arduino micro-controller boards. Arduino
    [115] is an open-source electronics platform, popular for its hosting capacity
    and simple configuration, which can easily embed various components and modules,
    thereby extending its functionality and fast-tracking the creation of prototypes.
    In detail, each sensory node is made of an Arduino Uno. To enable wireless connectivity,
    the board is enhanced by an Arduino wireless Secure Digital (SD) shield, with
    a Digi XBee ZigBee module [116]. The shield encapsulates three different protocol
    stacks: IEEE 802.15.4, DigiMesh, and ZigBee. The last one specifies a spacial
    carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol for
    creating wireless networks from small, low-power digital radio antennas [59].
    Using wireless communications, although convenient, opens the door to potential
    security threats. Fortunately, the XBee makes securing the network a trivial task,
    since it uses encryption and a secret key, named the ”network key”, to ensure
    transmission protection and packet integrity [41]. Regarding the sink node, this
    differs because of its special properties regarding the collection and management
    of all the sensed data. For this reason, an Arduino Mega is utilized, which boasts
    greater memory capacity. The sink node is also enhanced with a wireless SD shield
    and a similar ZigBee radio module, allowing wireless communication with the Arduino
    Uno sensors of its assigned WSN. Dwelling deeper into the WSN connection scheme,
    according to [117], three basic types of node roles are identified. The coordinator
    is a key structural component during the WSN initiation, tasked with setting up
    the conditions for its formation, including the selection of the operating channel,
    the assignment of a personal area network (PAN) identity (ID), and the establishment
    of a suitable routing traffic plan. There can only be a single coordinator in
    each WSN; hence, for the system at hand, the Arduino Mega is assigned this role
    during the field installation. In comparison, there can exist multiple routers,
    which are intermediate nodes with routing properties, tasked with relaying data
    from other nodes that cannot directly communicate with the coordinator due to
    long distances, i.e., the end devices. The routers and end devices, for the described
    system, are the Arduino Uno nodes. The Arduino Mega is also utilized as a gateway
    for transmitting the field data to the overseeing fog device, through serial communication.
    With that said, the fog computing network is formed by Raspberry Pis, each responsible
    for receiving and analyzing readings from near WSNs and then relaying the data,
    if necessary, to the central cloud computing infrastructure using the local area
    network, in this case the Third-Generation (3G) of mobile communication connectivity.
    Unlike the Arduino devices, the Raspberry Pis have increased computational power
    that can be upgraded with cloud elastic resources, by offloading cloud demands
    in close proximity to the WSNs [118]. Additionally, they are able to seamlessly
    connect/interact with the former, thereby making them an ideal device for hosting
    fog-related processes. Of course, there are many alternatives that can be employed
    to realize both the WSNs and the fog computing network. For instance, consider
    the Banana Pis or Orange Pis [119]. Although these are valid counter-proposals,
    the Arduino and Raspberry Pi devices were selected due to their extensive documentation,
    low-cost peripherals, highly configurable nature, and facile intercommunication.
    Similarly, the XBee modules, although they offer less reliability or range than
    other wireless antennas, such as the LoRa-based antennas [120], the former were
    chosen due to their affordable character, ease of programming, and low network
    and deployment cost, especially when considering large-scale, heterogeneous, and
    geographically distributed installation sites. In any case, the adoption of an
    alternative solution is strongly attainable since the elastic and extendable nature
    of the proposed system allows for such modifications with ease. That being said,
    for convenience and to better contextualize the economic aspects of the utilized
    hardware, Appendix A describes in more detail the specifications of the incorporated
    micro-controllers, whereas Appendix B compares wireless communication technologies.
    3.3. Data Flow and Processing Methodology The first phase of setting up the system,
    as depicted in Figure 2, involves the WSN initialization stage, where all nodes
    are deployed and then join and form the WSN [41]. This stage refers only to the
    WSN since it is assumed that the fog computing network and cloud computing infrastructure
    are already fired up and running, awaiting new raw data. Figure 2. Flow chart
    of all processes taking place in the WSNs. The first to power-on is the ZigBee
    coordinator, which in turn initializes the remaining WSN hardware. This is accomplished
    by initiating the protocol stack and performing an energy detection scan [4] to
    obtain a list of secure potential channels. Thereafter, it will continue with
    an active scan, where it chooses a free channel and enables the joining process,
    during which a routing plan is established. Moreover, due to WSNs being vulnerable
    to exogenous environmental factors, the clocks of the individual nodes experience
    de-synchronization. Hence, the proposed system encompasses a synchronization period
    during which the nodes calculate their time offset and synchronize their clocks
    accordingly, using as a reference point the coordinator’s time. Upon completion
    of the above phase, the various nodes start sensing environmental data. This occurs
    at regular intervals using their attached sensory modules. For the project at
    hand, which is targeted at fire alertness, the sensors track temperature and humidity,
    both variables critical to wildfire spreading. Conveniently, both come packed
    together in the DHT22 digital temperature/humidity sensor (also named AM2302 and
    depicted in Figure A1). After a sensing period ends, the new data are transmitted
    towards the sink node over the established routing paths. If the nodes are too
    far away to convey the data directly by themselves (i.e., the coordinator is out
    of range), then they forward the data to their parent router. This check is repeated
    on all nodes along the given route until the data reach the coordinator. For this
    process to be reliable, the routers and the coordinator must continuously monitor
    the wireless channel for incoming signals. Upon data reception, the Arduino Mega
    adopts a new role, forming a gateway for connecting the WSN with the fog computing
    network, comprised of several Raspberry Pis. For simplicity, these are connected
    with their assigned Arduino Mega devices through serial connections. The Raspberry
    Pis, as reported in Figure 3, listen to their serial channel for incoming data
    so as to initiate a connection. Note that the Raspberry Pis may potentially communicate
    with one or more Arduino Mega devices, collecting, in the second case, data from
    multiple WSNs. Figure 3. Flow chart of all processes occurring in the cloud/fog
    side of the proposed system. The moment the Raspberry Pis receive a stream of
    data, they decide if they will perform the necessary calculations themselves or
    forward them to the central server infrastructure. This depends on the adopted
    implementation road, since the increased capabilities of the Raspberry Pis allow
    for such modifications in their configuration to support customized solutions.
    For the case study at hand, a simple distributed approach was considered; ergo,
    the fog devices’ processing behavior was developed as follows. For every set of
    data packets received, a percentage of them would be computed on the spot by the
    fog computing network and the rest would be forwarded to the cloud computing infrastructure.
    In this way, the trafficking and computational load at the cloud servers would
    remain low and balanced by the fog devices, and so the system’s overall response
    time would decrease. The last can be further explained considering that, as the
    data packets are transmitted along the route, they are queued inside intermediate
    node buffers. The same occurs when the data reach the cloud server. However, if
    the data arriving rate exceeds the processing rate of the server or the data gets
    too many in number and too big in size, this will lead to the creation of network
    bottlenecks. In turn, the response time of the system might increase dramatically,
    especially in cases where there exist spikes and fluctuations in the sensed data,
    like in the cases of sudden fire spreading. At any rate, when the sensed data
    are collected, computed, and analyzed, a system decision is generated and a response
    report is created. In the first case (where the computation takes place in the
    fog), the response is directly transmitted through the local area network to the
    end users’ devices. Meanwhile, if the computation occurs in the cloud, the generated
    report travels backward towards the corresponding fog devices and then to the
    end users that administrate the corresponding WSNs. 4. Evaluation The current
    section validates the effectiveness of the presented cloud/fog architecture and
    evaluates its adaptability in terms of reliable monitoring. To do so, an experimental
    prototype was designed in a closed control laboratory environment in the facilities
    of the Ionian University, located on Corfu Island. 4.1. Experimentation Setup
    The designed experimental prototype comprised 25 Arduino Uno Rev 3 nodes, six
    (6) Arduino Mega 2560 nodes, and three (3) Raspberry Pi 3 Model B fog nodes (for
    more details about these models consult the Appendix A). In particular, six WSNs
    were considered, each containing a various number of Arduino Uno devices and an
    Arduino Mega coordinator/sink node, along with their arsenal of sensory and communication
    modules. Each sink node was linked with a serial cable to a Raspberry Pi. Following,
    the three fog devices communicated via 3G with the central cloud infrastructure,
    comprised of a virtual machine (VM) server with its accompanying database and
    storage, located in a different building of the Ionian University’s facilities,
    as depicted in Figure 4. The exact setup of the WSNs in conjunction with the corresponding
    fog devices is outlined in Table 1. In fact, the number of sensory nodes varies
    among the WSNs in order to create diversified traffic load case scenarios (from
    low to high) at the respected fog devices and obtain a more objective assessment
    of their conforming capabilities. Figure 4. The experimental prototype system
    setup, programmed and installed in different locations of the Ionian University’s
    facilities in Corfu Town. Table 1. Deployment setup of the WSNs and fog network
    For simplicity, it was assumed that the WSNs are composed of their coordinator
    and all sensory nodes were assigned the role of routers in the constructed PANs,
    leading to more scalability. The sensed measurements along with the appropriate
    PAN ID were encapsulated inside data packets at regular intervals with a +/−5
    s of random increment, in order to force diversity in the packet generation rate
    and minimize the appearance of packet collisions. In addition, the Arduino Uno
    timestamped each packet and encapsulated their own medium access control (MAC)
    address. Finally, the packets were marked with a unique ID and flagged based on
    the processing location (i.e., the fog or the cloud). The complete structure of
    a data packet is depicted in the upper part of Figure 4. Each Arduino Mega stored
    the incoming information inside its SD memory card and then forwarded the data
    packet its assigned Raspberry Pi. The latter stochastically handled the incoming
    sensed data, based on a probability function, deciding whether to process the
    data locally or convey the data to the remote cloud server. More information regarding
    the server’s resources can be found in Appendix A. Both fog and cloud performed
    the same processing by extracting the sensed data and calculating the average
    values for each discrete variable. However, if the process took place directly
    at the fog network the data packet was flagged with a zero (0), whereas if it
    was carried out at the cloud, it was flagged with a one (1). Each data packet
    was processed once based on its unique identifier. Then the procured data (e.g.,
    average temperature and humidity) were used to overwrite the corresponding fields
    in the data packet, while at the same time being stored in separate database logs
    and compatible formats for future reference. At this point, it is important to
    state that data probity validation occurs for each data packet received to ensure
    that no data corruption exists and to exclude values that are miscalculated. Initially,
    the sensory and sink nodes’ antennas perform a checksum on the data packets to
    verify their composition. Then, upon reception of a new data packet, the Raspberry
    Pis also check the structural integrity of the packet. First, based on the ID
    and PAN ID fields they cross-validate the origin of the data packet based on their
    assigned WSNs and previous observations. Then the measurement fields (i.e., the
    HUMIDITY and temperature) are assessed for their correctness, e.g., they must
    humidity be float numbers with a defined number of digits. Additionally, to verify
    that packets with information losses or distorted data are not taken into consideration,
    the fog devices inspect the format of all fields that must meet certain criteria;
    e.g., the ID and MAC ADDRESS fields must always process a specific sequence of
    characters. Data packets that infringe these conditions are automatically discarded.
    By embedding such mechanics, the fog devices are able to filter the data and offer
    basic data validation. Of course, there are other more sophisticated ways to verify
    the data integrity and offer reliability. For example, future work will include
    the cross-validation of the data based on pre-defined thresholds regarding the
    expected environmental and seasonal conditions in the monitored lands. For instance,
    during the summer pic a lower bound of 15 ∘ C could be enforced and data packets
    that violate this constraint will be automatically dropped. Correspondingly, an
    upper bound of 50 ∘ C could be placed and when violated the fog devices will assess
    the credibility of the reading based on the measurements previously obtained by
    the other sensory nodes in the immediate neighborhood. If multiple readings are
    received in sequence that record extreme heat, especially when originated in multiple
    sources, then the alarm will be raised appropriately. 4.2. Experimentation Results
    For the presented prototype, response time is one of the most important performance
    metrics for timely monitoring and accurate correlation, and is computed as the
    Round Trip Time ( 𝑅𝑇𝑇 ), i.e., the time that elapses between the moment a sensory
    node sends a new data packet and the moment it receives a reply from the cloud/fog
    system. In other words, the  𝑅𝑇𝑇 is the sum of network and processing delays,
    which can be better observed in Figure 5, where the arrows depict the transmissions
    and the gray boxes illustrate the process time at each device. Note that Figure
    5 represents the simplest scenario where the sensor is situated in the sink node’s
    immediate neighborhood, i.e., one hop away. Figure 5. Calculation of the 𝑅𝑇𝑇 ,
    for both cloud and fog computing scenarios. The gray boxes symbolize the processing
    times along the route, whereas the arrows the transmissions that occur. In detail,
    at time 𝑡 0 the Arduino Uno generates a data packet, hereafter called Data, containing
    the newly obtained measurements and their timestamp, which will be forwarded to
    the Arduino Mega at 𝑡 1 , when the channel becomes available. Upon reception from
    the Arduino Mega, the Data undergoes some processing. When this is over, they
    are sent to the overseeing Raspberry Pi. Once there, the fog device decides with
    a probability P as to where the data process will eventuate, i.e, locally or remotely.
    In the former case, the Raspberry Pi decodes the Data, processes the information,
    and extracts the average values, computing all relative information gathered up
    until that moment from the specific WSN. The average values are encapsulated into
    a new data packet, named F_Data, replacing the corresponding values of the received
    Data, but keeping intact the values of the  𝐼𝐷 , 𝑇𝐼𝑀𝐸𝑆𝑇𝐴𝑀𝑃 , and  𝑀𝐴𝐶_𝐴𝐷𝐷𝑅𝐸𝑆𝑆
    fields. Then the F_Data is flagged accordingly, by replacing the value of the  𝐹𝐿𝐴𝐺
    field, in order for the system to acknowledge the fog network as the processing
    location. Next, the F_Data begins its journey back towards the sensor node that
    generated the measurements. At the coordinator it stays a period equal to the
    time it takes for the Arduino Mega to read the  𝑀𝐴𝐶_𝐴𝐷𝐷𝑅𝐸𝑆𝑆 and decide the route
    the F_Data must take to reach the respective Arduino Uno. Finally, it is forwarded
    to the last, which reads the  𝑇𝐼𝑀𝐸𝑆𝑇𝐴𝑀𝑃 field and compares it to its current clock,
    calculating in this way the total 𝑅𝑇𝑇 . Note again that in order for this procedure
    to be accurate there exists a simple clock synchronization method enforced at
    regular intervals. In contrast, during the latter case, the Raspberry Pi conveys
    the data packet to the remote cloud server VM. The server performs similar actions
    to the ones described earlier. However, the information is now encoded into a
    data packet, named C_Data, and flagged with a value indicating the corresponding
    location, i.e., the cloud infrastructure. Similarly, the C_Data then travels backward
    the network route until it reaches the appropriate Arduino Uno, which, at that
    point calculates the  𝑅𝑇𝑇 . In Figure 5, the fog processing scenario is depicted
    through straight-arrow transmissions, whereas the cloud processing scenario is
    illustrated through dotted-arrow transmissions. Notice that the F_Data reaches
    the Arduino Uno in  𝑡 𝑚 , while the C_Data arrives at 𝑡 𝑛 , where 𝑡 𝑛 = 𝑡 𝑚 +𝐷𝑇
    . The  𝐷𝑇 is the difference between the two calculated 𝑅𝑇𝑇 s, and is viewed as
    a measure estimate of the system’s performance in terms of response time for multiple
    values of P. Following the last assumption, Figure 6 encapsulates the results
    of the approach by presenting the average achieved 𝑅𝑇𝑇 , as a function of P, for
    different experimental runs with varying time intervals regarding the data packet
    generation rate. The error bars demonstrate the upper and lower 95% confidence
    intervals. Clearly, for all depicted cases as P increases the 𝑅𝑇𝑇 decreases. In
    fact, starting from the extreme scenario, where all processing occurs in the remote
    cloud server, i.e., for 𝑃=0 , the average 𝑅𝑇𝑇≃1160 ms. Then, for every increment
    in P, more operations are performed in the fog network and so the 𝑅𝑇𝑇 steadily
    drops, reaching its minimum value for the opposing extreme scenario, where all
    processing takes place directly in the fog network, i.e., for 𝑃=1 the average
    𝑅𝑇𝑇≃1080 ms. Any spikes in the depicted plots are attributed to cloud/fog processing
    pulsations and delays posed by the ZigBee CSMA/CA protocol or other network intermediates
    during experimentation. What is more, no clear tendency can be derived by the
    abatement in the time interval period between sensory readings, eliciting that
    the fog network successfully coped with the incoming traffic in all circumstances.
    Figure 6. Experimental results of the system’s total mean 𝑅𝑇𝑇 as a function of
    the probability P for different data packet generation intervals, i.e., for 25
    s, 20 s, 15 s, 10 s, and 5 s. The error bars represent the upper and lower 95%
    confidence intervals. To further highlight the latency reduction behavior, Figure
    7 decomposes each depicted case of Figure 6, by showcasing the mean 𝑅𝑇𝑇 from the
    viewpoint of the involved fog devices. Even at a lower level of illustration the
    behavior still holds, proving once more the response time reduction across all
    fog devices as probability P is increased. To complete the system’s 𝑅𝑇𝑇 deconstruction
    Figure 8 offers a microscopic view of the system’s 𝑅𝑇𝑇 decaying behavior by encasing
    the same results from the scope of the deployed WSNs. In all six depicted cases
    the particular decreasing behavior is verified once more. Figure 7. Experimental
    results of the system’s total mean 𝑅𝑇𝑇 value, through the viewpoint of the involved
    fog devices. The error bars correspond to the 95% upper and lower confidence intervals.
    (a) Interval: 25,000 (in ms). (b) Interval: 20,000 (in ms). (c) Interval: 15,000
    (in ms). (d) Interval: 10,000 (in ms). (e) Interval: 5000 (in ms). Figure 8. Experimental
    results regarding the mean 𝑅𝑇𝑇 , through the scope of the deployed WSNs. The error
    bars refer to the upper and lower 95% confidence intervals. (a) Interval: 25,000
    (in ms). (b) Interval: 20,000 (in ms). (c) Interval: 15,000 (in ms). (d) Interval:
    10,000 (in ms). (e) Interval: 5000 (in ms). Finally, it is noteworthy that the
    number of WSNs and eventually of sensory nodes (according to Table 1) does not
    impact the responsiveness. Actually, all three Raspberry Pis successfully managed
    to handle the incoming traffic load, and thus it is further assumed that the 𝑅𝑇𝑇
    is affected by other processes running at the background during the experiment
    at the cloud or the fog devices. 5. System Conformation Based on Wildfire Risk
    Forecasting To demonstrate the potential of the presented solution, which does
    not impose the irreducible network delays associated with conventional environmental
    IoT systems, whilst remaining energy efficient, the prototype is put against one
    of Greece’s most hazardous states of emergency, i.e., the wildfires, to determine
    how well it can react and adapt its behavior to deal with a potential crisis.
    Additionally, a user-friendly designed GUI for data visualization and fire risk
    forecasting is presented. 5.1. The Case of Greece’s Wildfires According to Greece’s
    Fire Brigade’s (GFB) official statistics, 8006 forest fires were recorded during
    the year 2018 alone [121], while for 2019 the number is much higher, reaching
    9502 fire fronts. The year 2007, however, was reportedly the worst of the last
    thirty years, since the country, during the summer, was hit by three consecutive
    heat waves (over 46 ∘ C each), which coupled with strong winds and low relative
    humidity (around 9% ), resulted in forest fires breaking out all over Greece.
    In fact, according to the European Space Agency (ESA), Greece has witnessed more
    wildfire activity during the summer of 2007 than other European countries have
    experienced over the last decade [122]. This led to 11,996 forest fires by the
    end of the year, burning over 675,000 acres of land, which was a European record
    for that period. To put this in more perspective, just on Corfu Island, an area
    of barely 236 square miles, in the year 2019 alone, 171 wildfires were recorded,
    burning around 137.5 acres of land, a great percentage of which consisted of farming
    lands and forests [121]. To deal with the fire peril and increase the degree of
    readiness, the GSCP during the firefighting period (from June the 1st to October
    the 31st), issues a daily map depicting the fire risk degree regarding all regions
    of Greece for the following day. In this way, the GSCP warns the corresponding
    authorities to prepare for the possibility of environment-threatening fire events
    in their respective regions and the citizens to stay on alert. The map is color-coded
    based on a five risk rate scale, starting from green, which indicates low risk,
    and up to red, which raises alarm to the highest possible level. Having this information
    available is important because it allows for targeted adjustments to the proposed
    system’s configuration, in order to maximize the effectiveness in detecting such
    catastrophic events. Consequently, for the purposes of the current experiment
    the cloud/fog system was programmed to autonomously adapt its behavior based on
    the risk degree scale regarding Corfu Island, where the experiment takes place.
    Figure 9 describes this procedure in depth. Figure 9. Steps for retrieving the
    risk degree and relaying the information to a WSN. Once per day, during the early
    hours, when the map has been already published, the Raspberry Pis connect to the
    website of the GSCP (step a in Figure 9), which holds the information regarding
    the updated map [123]. Then they extract the specific risk degree regarding Corfu
    Island. To do so, the fog devices recognize the particular pixels that form Corfu
    on the map and retrieve their RGB color-code. For example, in Figure 9, where
    the fire risk for Corfu is set to “medium”, the RGB color-code is determined as
    “#A8CAE” (i.e., step b). By reading the particular value, the Raspberry Pis immediately
    assess, according to the fire risk degree scale, the risk to be at level two (i.e.,
    step c). After obtaining this value, they relay the information to their assigned
    Arduino Mega devices (i.e., step d), which in turn broadcast the information to
    their WSN, as illustrated in step e of Figure 9. By the end of this procedure,
    all WSNs’ nodes have received the fire risk degree and can modify their operation
    accordingly. Specifically, in order to be energy efficient, during the experiment,
    the sensors mapped their sampling behavior based on the risk degree that was fed
    into the WSNs by the fog devices. As such, when the sensory nodes received a degree
    of one (1), the interval period that intervened between two successive sensing
    periods was stretched to 25 s, with the goal of preserving battery energy and
    ensuring that communication bandwidth is not wasted, since there was no need for
    heavy monitoring at the time. For every degree that was added to the fire risk
    scale, however, the particular interval was autonomously reduced by 5 s. In this
    way, the generation rate of the packets was sped up as the risk got higher and
    continuous monitoring was required. Table 2 captures the described behavior by
    presenting the interval period for every fire risk degree along with the probability
    P that drives the fog processing. In order to keep the main cloud infrastructure
    informed about the general ongoing situation in the fields, even in cases where
    the fire risk degree is five, a small percentage of the generated packages are
    still transmitted to the cloud server. Table 2. System behavior under the different
    degrees of the Fire Risk. To test its performance the IoT system was instructed
    to retrieve each fire risk degree regarding Corfu, for the firefighting period
    of 2019. Ergo, 153 values corresponding to the five (5) months, were extracted
    and used as an input. The upper part of Figure 10 illustrates these values organized
    per month. Note that only once the risk achieved a degree of four (4), while no
    days existed that reached the value of five (5). Having these values stored, made
    it practicable to use them as system parameters. Thus, each day was represented
    with twenty (20) min of experimentation time. Figure 10. The fire risk degree
    (upper part) versus the average 𝑅𝑇𝑇 in ms (bottom part), per day during the firefighting
    season of 2019. The system’s alertness encapsulates perfectly the change in the
    fire risk degrees as time goes on. Specifically, the system’s obtained average
    𝑅𝑇𝑇 over all six deployed WSNs, is adjusted autonomously by pushing/pulling functionality
    towards/from the fog computing network, without human intervention. The result
    of this procedure is shown in the bottom part of Figure 10. In fact, the average
    𝑅𝑇𝑇 is reduced as the degrees climb the fire risk scale, enabling faster field-health
    analysis. In fact, it reaches its minimum value on the day that reported a fire
    risk degree of four (4), i.e., 𝑅𝑇𝑇≤1110 ms, during the pic of the firefighting
    season. In comparison, when the fire risk is one (1), most notably recorded during
    the beginning and ending of the firefighting season, the mean 𝑅𝑇𝑇 is maximized,
    i.e., 𝑅𝑇𝑇≃1160 ms, since most processing activity befalls the cloud server and
    there is no need for heavy field monitoring. Regarding the traffic load, i.e.,
    the data packet generation rate here, the system dynamically adapts its sampling
    periods, as validated in the upper part of Figure 11. Ergo, for low risk, the
    data packet generation rate is slowed down to save communication bandwidth and
    conserve precious energy, untimely elongating the WSNs’ lifespan. The last is
    perfectly mirrored in the bottom part of Figure 12, where the energy consumption
    is visualized per day (i.e., for the 20 min experimental cycle here). This equates
    to the sum of the energy spent by all sensory modules, i.e., the temperature/humidity
    sensor to generate a new reading or not, plus the energy consumed by all antennas
    for their two alternate states, i.e., for transmission or idle respectively. Specifically,
    the DHT22 when in standby mode uses 50 uA while in reading mode 1.5 mA [124].
    As for the XBee antenna, it consumes 31 mA in idle state and 120 mA in transmission
    state, respectively [125]. Likewise, as the degrees rise, the demand for higher
    precision impels the system to prioritize the need for continuous wildfire monitoring,
    thereby increasing the packet generation and transmission rates. In particular,
    for fire risk equal to one (1) the number of data packets per day is clustered
    around 900, translating to roughly 2.567 kJ of energy consumption. Contrarily,
    for the day reporting a degree of four (4), the packet number is launched to almost
    double and close to 1800, leading to increased energy consumption, which reports
    a value of around 2.572 kJ. Figure 11. The traffic load, i.e., the number of transmitted
    packets (upper part), versus the corresponding energy consumption (bottom part)
    in kJ, per day of the firefighting season of 2019. Figure 12. The achieved throughput
    in percent, per day during the firefighting season of 2019. Although the aforementioned
    differences, especially in regards to energy consumption, at first glance might
    not seem crucial, it is understandable that under a real-world field deployment,
    where the number of sensory devices could grow to hundreds or even thousands of
    nodes and the time period will be expanded to real days, then the number of transmissions
    will greatly increase. However, the distributed fog processing methods adopted
    here will significantly reduce the 𝑅𝑇𝑇 when compared to cloud-only approaches,
    especially considering the long distances that data packets will have to transverse
    to reach the remote cloud server from the field sites. In conjunction with multi-hop
    topologies and CSMA/CA re-transmissions and carrier sensing waiting times, it
    is obvious that the gap between the energy consumption during a low-risk day and
    an extreme-risk day will also be vastly larger. Moreover, in a real-world scenario,
    many of the WSNs’ nodes will be assigned the role of end devices according to
    the ZigBee standard. Ergo, they will be permitted to enter “sleep” mode, by powering-off
    their antennas between transmissions to save additional battery usage. The network’s
    lifetime can then be extended until the point of the first router or sink failure,
    which can jeopardize the WSN’s connectivity, cutting access to the sink or fog
    network respectively. Nevertheless, this can also be addressed with energy-replenishment
    and harvesting tools, like solar-panel power-banks. Besides, ZigBee embeds re-routing
    methods that can promptly establish a new routing plan among the routers. With
    that said, it is possible to estimate the lifetime, by computing the average energy
    consumption per router/sink for the different fire risk degrees (using past observations),
    so as to predict the possible time of failure based on their residual battery
    energy from the previous day. To verify that the rise in data packet traffic load
    does not sever the system’s credibility, Figure 12 depicts the total throughput
    for each day of the experiment, based on the number of successfully retrieved
    data packet 𝐼𝐷 s. In most circumstances, even during heavy network traffic, the
    achievable throughput fluctuates around 80% . A few exceptions (i.e., throughput
    drops) are clearly attributed to the underlying CSMA/CA protocol. This finding
    is crucial because it enables the almost real-time forecasting/detection of a
    fire incident, with minimum loss of data, allowing for accurate monitoring and
    early notification of the authorities in case of fire ignition, in order to launch
    appropriate countermeasures that will mitigate the danger. Additionally, it is
    clear that the system can effectively cope with the computational burden, achieving
    high network performance, and retaining its accountability intact. 5.2. F.E.MO.S.:
    The Fog-Assisted Environmental Monitoring System A key factor for truly providing
    an end-to-end IoT solution is the ability to visualize the data in a user-friendly
    manner through a proper GUI. Besides, as already mentioned the whole purpose of
    the considered monitoring cloud/fog system is to offer end users in the application
    layer the opportunity to quickly access and make sense of the field data, informing
    them about the ongoing status and alerting them regarding potential environmental
    hazards, like probable wildfire ignitions. The necessity becomes even more prevalent
    when the monitored lands are geographically scattered, with potentially diversified
    exposure to elements, altitudes, weather conditions, etc., and so the sensed data
    may vary substantially among the WSNs, resulting in complexities that jeopardize
    the decision making process. To this end, a simple, yet accurate and extendable,
    web application has been developed for visualizing the streams of data arriving
    from either the cloud or the fog, suitably named the ”Fog-assisted Environmental
    Monitoring System”, or F.E.MO.S. in short. Both the server and the Raspberry Pis
    feed into F.E.MO.S. In real-time the captured environmental readings from the
    WSNs, and then F.E.MO.S. generates proper data-gram charts of their behavior in
    relation to time. Figure 13 depicts the web GUI dashboard of the F.E.MO.S. The
    dashboard is separated into panels, which are as follows. Figure 13. The web GUI
    dashboard of F.E.MO.S. Starting from the top central panel, namely, ”Data Visualization”,
    this is where the generated field data are plotted and custom-made figures are
    created regarding the chosen environmental parameters in relation to time. For
    the demo prototype system, the possible parameters to choose from are temperature
    (in ∘ C ) and relative humidity (in %). By default, F.E.MO.S. will plot the mean
    values of both, computed by the accumulated data from all installed WSN nodes,
    to procure an overall overview of the prevailing weather conditions in the deployment
    sites during the latest week, as is the case in Figure 13. Clearly, the generated
    plots are of high resolution and showcase the precision of the sensory nodes.
    Next to the bottom left corner of the panel, an indication of the current energy
    consumption (in kJ) is also provided to inform the stakeholders about the nodes’
    power utilization and help them in cases where energy replenishment is required.
    This value is updated on an hourly basis. To customize the plots the left top
    panel, namely, ”Parameter Editor”, enables the users to configure the data visualization.
    In this respect, they may choose from a plethora of available options, to create
    targeted filtered queries and generate appropriate plots. The first option determines
    the type of system entity. There are mainly three types, these being the fog computing
    network, the deployed WSNs, or the sensor nodes themselves. However, in all three,
    the user is free to select either an averaged view of all sensory readings or
    further filter the data source. Ergo, he/she can designate which specific Raspberry
    Pi, WSN, or sensory node to explore respectively. A complete map of the system
    setup is provided, in the form of a Table, named “System Configuration”, below
    the parameter editor, so as to assist the user in searching the appropriate device
    ID. Moreover, to access past measurement logs, a precise time period for data
    retrieval can be specified, in an hour/date format. Finally, a separate drop-down
    field is attributed to choosing the desired environmental parameter to populate
    the data visualization panel. In Figure 13, a simple user input example is shown,
    just before data generation. While the aforementioned panels focused only on the
    presentation of the raw data, it was also considered imperative to augment F.E.MO.S.
    with cognition behavior, by offering semantic correlation of the readings in terms
    of wildfire forecasting, and thus highlight its potential in sensitive and timely
    decision-making procedures. To this end, the right top panel, suitably named the
    ”Fire Risk Forecaster”, presents the fire risk in each separate deployed WSN,
    using a color-coded, five-degree scale. To evaluate the risk, the CBI is utilized
    here [24], which is based solely on weather conditions. As such, CBI uses the
    air temperature and relative humidity to calculate in real-time a numerical index
    of the fire danger at the corresponding WSN sites, according to the following
    formula: 𝐶𝐵𝐼= ((110−1.373×𝑅𝐻)−0.54×(10.20−𝑇))×(124× 10 −0.0142×𝑅𝐻 ) 60 , (1) where
    T is the current atmospheric temperature (in ∘ C) and 𝑅𝐻 is the current relative
    humidity (in %). That number is then equated to the fire risk severity of either
    low, moderate, high, very high, or extreme, and mapped to the F.E.MO.S. color-coded
    scale mentioned earlier based on Table 3. Table 3. F.E.MO.S. fire risk forecaster
    scale Having this information available in real-time is exceptionally important,
    since it facilitates the dynamic conformation of the cloud/fog system to meet
    the requirements for greater or lesser environmental monitoring, as explained
    in Section 5.1. Moreover, it enables the early notification of the stakeholders
    and respective authorities for a possible fire threatening event at the monitored
    lands, allowing for timely interventions and targeted countermeasures (e.g., the
    launch of water-spraying mechanisms). Actually, to further increase mobilization,
    when the fire risk forecaster reports a fire risk rating equal or greater than
    three (3) at any given WSN (i.e., for CBI ≥75 ), F.E.MO.S. automatically generates
    and sends alerts to the registered email addresses of the responsible parties.
    An example of two such notifications is shown in Figure 14 for the case where
    the fire risk forecasting hits the severity score of four (4) and five (5), i.e.,
    for “very high” and ”extreme” danger respectively. Figure 14. F.E.MO.S. automated
    notification alert messages for the cases of (a) very high and (b) extreme fire
    risk forecasting. Similarly, F.E.MO.S. also provides in a separate panel the corresponding
    alert indication. In Figure 13, it is observable that all WSNs have a fire risk
    score of one (1), suitably highlighted with the color green. As a result, the
    indication is also a green check marker symbol, declaring that the ongoing situation
    in the WSN deployment sites is safe, and so there is no need for alarm. Contrarily,
    in Figure 15, an example of how a caution warning alert indication will look like
    in the case where the fire risk in the WSNs reaches the yellow indication, i.e.,

    case of a high fire risk scenario in one or more WSNs. Lastly, for the users’
    convenience, F.E.MO.S. also provides a separate panel containing a map with all
    information regarding the marked deployment sites, organized in different layers
    that follow the considered three-layered system network architecture. The map
    is scrollable and flexible to allow users to explore the installation sites even
    when the system entities are situated in geographically different or remote locations,
    with long distances among them. An instance of the map panel, regarding the deployment
    sites of the prototype system, can be seen in the bottom part of Figure 13. 6.
    Conclusions and Future Directions A hybrid, three-layered system architecture
    for smart and timely environmental monitoring, embedding affordable IoT and WSN
    appliances, while in its core following a cloud/fog computing approach, was presented
    here. The architecture was then extensively studied and its data flow functions
    were analyzed in depth, starting from the field nodes and up to the moment the
    information was delivered to the appropriate parties. Furthermore, the current
    work reported on the design and implementation of a demo prototype that can easily
    conform its functionality to address critical environmental challenges, based
    on the described architecture. To this end, a hardware/software solution was also
    proposed that is affordable and suitable for fast prototyping, while utilizing
    highly customizable components and controllers capable of networking, communication,
    measurement sensing, and processing. Moreover, extensive experimentation was conducted,
    in controlled laboratory conditions in the facilities of the Ionian University,
    to evaluate the prototype’s performance and highlight its alertness-conforming
    characteristics. A popular metric for precision environmental monitoring was considered,
    i.e, the response time. Initial experimentation to investigate the system’s elements
    interactions and seamless adaptability captured the expected behavior and validated
    its effectiveness in dealing with time-sensitive agricultural and environmental
    applications. In all cases presented, the average response time was reduced as
    more operations took place in the intermediate fog computing network. That being
    said, for the two extreme cases, i.e., in the cloud-only processing and fog-only
    processing, the average 𝑅𝑇𝑇 values were 1160 ms and 1080 ms respectively, indicating
    an overall 80 ms improvement across all system elements without exception. To
    further highlight its performance, the developed prototype was put to the test
    under a real case scenario involving one of Greece’s most notable environmental
    hazards, the wildfires. Again the results support the research claims, as it is
    shown that the system is able to adapt its operation and alertness, sufficiently
    addressing the problem, based on the five-degree fire risk scale retrieved from
    the GSCP. Hence, it was able to reserve communication bandwidth (on average ≃900
    data packets) and decrease energy consumption, when the fire risk was low, all
    the while increasing its monitoring precision, effectively raising its sensory
    readings to almost the double (i.e., ≃1800 data packets), when there existed high
    probability of fire ignition, achieving in most cases an average throughput over
    80% . To contextualize the system outputs and augment the data visualization process,
    a user-driven web-based GUI was also developed to accompany the prototype and
    allow users to proactively partake in the monitoring process. F.E.MO.S., as is
    its name, provides friendly panels to enable the filtering of the raw data and
    the flexible presentation of the monitored environmental conditions and system
    entities. Actually, it even goes a step further, by enhancing the decision-making
    process and offering real-time CBI-based fire risk forecasting, considering the
    prevailing weather conditions at each separate WSN deployment site. To increase
    alertness and actuate higher mobilization, targeted alert notifications are generated
    automatically in cases of emergency, while systematic logs are maintained to successfully
    correlate the data and allow the stakeholders to efficiently keep track of the
    status and health of the monitored lands and energy consumption levels of the
    system modules. The paper also focused on the prototype’s limitations. That being
    so, the biggest drawback of the approach is the lack of actual large-scale deployment
    in a real-world environment, which due to the poor network connectivity, power
    limitations, hostile environmental conditions, multi-hop routing, etc., will certainly
    affect the credibility and reliability of the sensor readings. However, the system
    in its current form can act as a proof-of-concept testbed, to fast test various
    other parameters or technologies prior to field deployment and investigate more
    deeply their implications, without endangering hardware/software elements. Moreover,
    it can significantly boost system debugging and offer insights regarding cases
    where device/module failures or data corruptions occur. The last is considered
    critical for the successful adoption of the approach; therefore, appropriate actions
    must also be undertaken to validate the accountability and credibility of the
    measured readings with the adoption of appropriate filtering and threshold methods.
    Other constraints, relating to automation, diversified network topologies, sensor
    clock synchronization, power utilization, and so on, are also taken into consideration
    during the prototype’s design process, through proper software solutions and engineering
    decisions. The latter, although custom-made, remain generic and flexible, following
    established practices, and so can be easily modified to fit and include other
    appliances. Nevertheless, more research must be conducted towards the direction
    of securing these functionalities and augmenting their operations, even under
    extreme scenarios, e.g., during an actual fire outbreak. Another subject that
    raises attention relates to the optimal placement of the sensor nodes. For the
    case at hand, this was not necessary; however, during field deployment, this aspect
    will definitely go a long way towards alleviating possible WSN bottlenecks, routing
    issues, transmission collisions, and ultimately energy consumption. The same applies
    in the case where a proper subset of sensor nodes (backbone network) is discovered
    for each WSN, e.g., using a dominating set methodology, to boost information collection
    and dissemination. Obviously, tackling these challenges and limitations will greatly
    improve the system’s overall performance, especially when considering that field
    deployment will involve a large number of sensory nodes. With that being said,
    future guidelines will explore the system’s standardization and its large-scale
    deployment in outdoor areas, where its activity will be extensively recorded and
    documented, as well as assessed in comparison with alternative techniques and
    systems. In fact, through mathematical formulation, it is feasible to identify
    additional crucial climate variables that lead to the formation of wildfire devastating
    events, in order to implement targeted field interventions. To this end, substitute
    fire burning indexes, such as the FWI, will be also researched, and their accuracies
    will be evaluated. Moreover, with a few tweaks in the code, the considered cloud/fog
    prototype system and F.E.MO.S. could be easily configured to support additional
    sensor modalities, and by extension alternative agricultural and environmental
    applications. In this respect, they will be enriched with extra monitoring tools
    (e.g., for determining smoke/gas emissions, soil moisture, wind velocity, pH levels,
    and rain intensity), which among other things, can also target or detect other
    environmentally hazardous events, for instance, earthquakes, rain floods, volcanic
    eruptions, tree deaths, pest infestations, etc. To manage the huge amount of raw
    data acquired by these additions, machine learning algorithms will be investigated,
    which coupled with the F.E.MO.S. forecasting metrics will lead to new prediction
    models, fostering high accuracy and enhanced decision-support mechanics. Furthermore,
    alternative wireless technologies (e.g., LoRa, NB-IoT, etc.) and hardware controllers
    (e.g., Orange Pis) will be tested to discover the optimum configuration. Great
    effort will be put toward providing a complete, low-cost IoT solution, reflecting
    the daily needs and accomplishing alignment with the expectations of future smart
    agriculture and environmental protection and preservation. Author Contributions

    VM Virtual Machine WSN Wireless Sensor Network Appendix A. The Prototype’s Utilized
    Hardware and Software Specifications The utilized hardware micro-controllers for
    the design of the experimental cloud/fog IoT prototype include Arduino Uno, Arduino
    Mega, and Raspberry Pi devices. The current appendix encloses detailed information
    regarding technical specifications of these technologies, their selected models,
    and their accompanying modules, in addition to the resources utilized by the remote
    cloud server VM. Arduino Uno: In the current project implementation, the considered
    WSN sensors consist of an Arduino Uno Rev. 3, which is built on top of the Atmel
    ATmega328P micro-controller. This is in turn enhanced with a Digi XBee-PRO S2C
    ZigBee module [116] for wireless communication. The sensors were equipped with
    a DHT22 sensory module which is able to calculate the temperature in the scale
    of −40 ∘ C to 80 ∘ C, with a ±5 ∘ C inaccuracy, and assess the humidity atmospheric
    levels in a scale of 0% to 100% , with an accuracy deviation between 2% and 5%
    . Arduino Mega: For the programming of the WSNs’ sink nodes, an Arduino Mega 2560
    micro-controller board was chosen, which is based on the ATmega2560. The sink
    nodes were augmented with communication capabilities using a wireless SD shield
    and a Digi XBee-PRO S2C module. They were also equipped with an SD memory card
    to save logs regarding the incoming readings. Moreover, they serially forwarded
    the data packets to their overseeing Raspberry Pi at a data rate of 115,200 bps.
    Raspberry Pi Model B: The fog devices composing the second hierarchy layer of
    the system’s architecture, correspond to Raspberry Pis 3 Model B. This model was
    chosen due to its low-cost and low-power consumption attributes and its ability
    for wireless and serial connectivity. Essentially it is a small computer board
    that supports a number of different operating systems. For the purposes of current
    work, the Debian-based Linux operating system, named “Raspbian”, was used. Cloud
    Server VM: The cloud server runs on a Unix-based VM, with a four-core central
    processing unit (CPU) and 4 GB of random access memory (RAM), which is part of
    the Ionian University’s central cloud data center infrastructure, capable of high-speed
    computation and data transmission. To put the aforementioned technologies in more
    perspective, Table A1 enlists technical specifications of the three micro-controller
    boards used, whereas Figure A1 depicts them after their assembly. Table A1. Technical

    of Existing Wireless Technologies The current appendix contains the comparisons
    of alternative wireless technologies in order to showcase the affordable character
    of the adopted approach in the current work and propose alternative solutions
    that can easily be incorporated in future system alterations. As such, Table A2

    The development in the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile usage has found a profound
    impact in the enhancement of cloud storage. Hyperscale data centers had been created
    due to the accelerated data center traffic that has been created by the increased
    usage of cloud computing environment (B. M. C. Silva et al. 2015). The data storage
    capacity should increase significantly due to the growth of IoT based application,
    which plays a major role in Smart city, Healthcare and Industries. According to
    the prediction done by the Cisco Global Cloud Index, the workload created by the
    cloud environment will be increased by 94% and the traditional data center will
    be just 6% by the year 2021(B. Mei et al. 2015). Certain impacts limit the blooming
    cloud infrastructure and reduce its flexibility that is as follows: 1. Latency/Determinism:
    The time delay created among the interaction of IoT devices and the cloud is known
    as latency. Certain industries like Electronics Health Records (EHR) and Telemedicine
    has a major concern with the latency requirements and this impact must be concerned
    essentially. 2. Data/Bandwidth: According to Statistics, the installation of IoT
    devices could increase by 31 billion worldwide by the year 2020. In generating
    the medical records, at least 15-20 devices should be connected at each patient’s
    bed, which increases the data rate. This causes a limitation in the network bandwidth,
    overpowering the cloud and also increases data traffic. 3. Privacy/Security: According
    to IBM data breach study, the security and the privacy of each patient’s data
    in the healthcare line could be affected due to the increased data breach cost,
    which will be about $480 per patient and this cost could be three times the data
    cost of other industries. Continue Reading References Follow Reference Alemdar

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Alexandria, Egypt SECTION I. Introduction
    Now the processes of beverage manufacturing such as juice, butylation water, are
    based on using complex and expensive analytical instruments such as refractometers,
    chromatographs, spectrometers, and so on. The analytical instruments are applied
    in large manufacturers, but small producers have no the opportunity to arrange
    it. So, absence of the equipment for the control of parameters of juice, and butylation
    water causes degradation of the quality of the beverages. It is possible to solve
    the problem by using rather cheap smart biosensor designed in the Institute of
    Molecular Biology and Genetics of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, with
    wireless sensor networks designed in Institute of Cybernetics of National Academy
    of Sciences of Ukraine. The main contribution of this paper is the designing and
    fast-prototyping of WSNs with different sets of sensors, according to the requirements
    of applied task of WSN in beverage manufacturing and using two wireless protocols
    simultaneously for customer convenience. The remainder of this paper is divided
    into four parts. Section 2 reviews some solutions with networks, based on two
    wireless protocols. Section 3 presents the design of one-protocol WSN for agriculture
    and industry. Section 4 gives the design and features of two-protocol WSN based
    on previous wireless network. Section 5 concludes this paper. SECTION II. Related
    work Nowadays, there are projects and solutions, developers of which tried to
    integrate several wireless protocols into one network. Typically, most solutions
    integrate wireless and wired parts. So, the wired network is local and small by
    scale, and serves for acquiring data directly from measurable object, and wireless
    part serves to transmit collected data to control or coordination center, or to
    system of higher level. There many papers in this area, but we highlighted only
    several among them to point used approaches. In [1] authors compared the operation
    of networks, designed for medical application and that had two different types
    of protocol interaction: wired-wireless and wireless-wireless. Example of network,
    that uses two protocols, is given in [2] . As authors note, the use of different
    protocols for communication between nodes and user interaction optimizes the performance
    of the system without complicating user experience. On the contrary, the user
    can manage acquisition and data download from any kind of portable device with
    a web browser. Applications in industry and interaction of several networks with
    different protocols are presented in [3] . The authors consider cases, when in
    the industrial workshop there are two main networks (i.e., wired/wireless fieldbus
    networks and wireless sensor networks). According to results of many other modern
    papers in the context of Industrial Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 the number
    of researches, projects and commercial applications, aimed on interaction of different
    protocols within one network will increase every year. In this paper, WSN and
    computer devices were presented for digital agriculture, beverage product control,
    and medicine. It should be noted that almost all industrial WSNs in modern agriculture
    include sensors for estimating of environmental parameters, but do not include
    sensors for direct estimating of plant state without plant damage. Such sensors
    are presented in the paper. Computer devices for measuring chlorophyll fluorescence
    induction are produced as standalone devices [4] . It is impossible to use them
    in large fields for monitoring of plant state, and green houses for control of
    environmental parameters. Compared to them, developed WSNs make it possible cover
    a large area of agricultural land and support climate control in greenhouse. The
    wireless electrochemical multisensors for control of beverages manufacturing does
    not use in food industry till this time. Now, the multisensor devices are used
    in experiment researches [5] , unlike famous the developed multisensors are wireless,
    work as part of the WSN, and support the manufacture of beverage products. Medical
    communicator with set of wireless sensors is new product not only in Ukrainian
    market, but in external market. The difference between the developed communicator
    and the existing ones is that new design has many options missing from market
    products [6 , 7] . It supports communication with doctors and patients lost the
    ability to speak, include family doctor handbook, and etc., and are a part of
    WSN to support wireless communication with remote hospital. SECTION III. WSN System
    Design Smart biosensors with WSN make it possible to improve control systems for
    biological and chemical testing. There are modern systems of new generation with
    high sensitivity, selectivity, and processing of checking of beverage products.
    Designed smart multisensor and analog front-end interface for WSN for beverage
    production processes control is shown in Fig. 1 . The purpose of multisensor is
    to measure concentrations of main substances of tested beverage during some minutes.
    The output signal of the multisensor is variable current [8] . The multisensor
    includes analog front-end interface with current/voltage converter and ADC, data
    processing, and data communication units. All electronic units are designed on
    VLSI. Data processing system-on-chip ADuCM350 of Analog Devices is based on 16
    MHz ARM Cortex M3 processor, which includes 16-bit ADC with sampling rate 160
    kHz. Fig. 1 Analog front-end interface of smart multisensor node Show All Developed
    prototype of analog front-end interface of smart multisensor node is shown in
    Fig. 2 . Fig. 2 Prototype of analog front-end interface of smart multisensor node
    Show All Developed WSN consists of wireless smart multisensory measuring nodes,
    network coordinator, and workstation for technology staff. The architecture of
    developed WSN is given in Fig. 3 . In the first version of WSN all wireless modules
    were built on wireless microcontroller JN5168 [9] , manufactured by NXP company.
    Every node includes 32-bit RISC-processor with a clock speed equals 32 MHz and
    wireless unit, compatible with IEEE802.15.4 standard. We used ZigBee Pro stack
    as wireless protocol for network organization and data transferring. The first
    version of ZigBee-compatible measuring node for estimating plant state is shown
    in Fig. 4 . Fig. 3 Architecture of developed WSN Show All Fig. 4 The first version
    of ZigBee-compatible measuring node Show All The main control unit of the WSN
    is coordinator. It supports the operation of the WSN. The next function of coordinator
    is data acquisition, processing, visualization, and data communication with workstation
    of technology staff. Network coordinator additionally supports communication with
    cloud environment, Internet, and so on. Developed coordinator functional diagram
    is shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5 Functional diagram of developed network coordinator
    Show All The main WSN coordinator functions are following: network configuration,
    network initialization, network status checking, memory management, measurement
    management, communication management, and data visualization [10] . The wireless
    measuring node includes multisensory module, which can contain different sets
    of sensors depending on the applied tasks, and wireless modules, which are responsible
    for connection to network and data transmission within this network. User workstation
    is PC or notebook, equipped with special ZigBee/USB converter and applied software
    for data analysis and visualization. The main aim of this converter is to connect
    user PC or notebook with WSN. Such approach allows user to control the operation
    of network and view the measured data on the PC display in convenient form. SECTION
    IV. Two-Protocol WSN Design Application of developed ZigBee-based wireless sensor
    networks in smart greenhouses and beverage manufacturing processes caused appearance
    of new requirements from customers, namely: Necessity to connect user portable
    computer devices to wireless network via other wireless protocols without using
    intermediate ZigBee/USB converters. This necessity was caused by absence of standard
    USB ports in mobile phones or tablets and by presence of standard wireless adapters
    (for example, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.). Desire to use individual measuring nodes
    in autonomous mode on other objects of interest without network coordinator and
    to control them with mobile phone or tablet. Since the capabilities of ZigBee
    protocol cannot support those tasks, it was decided to upgrade hardware and software
    of measuring nodes to support wireless data exchange with concurrent usage of
    several wireless protocols. In our opinion, the optimal solution was to add Bluetooth
    5 protocol support to the measuring nodes, which includes low power consumption
    (BLE) capabilities to enhance the power-efficient characteristics of wireless
    nodes. Bluetooth 5 protocol (and later versions) has a number of important features
    for us. The distance of data exchange equals 100–150 meters on open territories,
    what is almost the same as for our ZigBee-compatible measuring nodes. Indoors,
    e.g. in smart greenhouses or beverage manufacturing premises, the effective distance
    of data exchange equals 30–35 meters. It satisfied the requirements of our applied
    task. Message size of 255 bytes makes it possible to transmit whole curve of fluorescence
    chlorophyll induction for estimating the plants’ state. It is very important for
    us to have possibility to connect up to 20 nodes in network of star-like configuration.
    In addition, if it is necessary, the Bluetooth 5 protocol gives possibility to
    build a network of larger size as Bluetooth Mesh networks, which includes from
    hundred to several thousands of nodes. Measuring nodes of developed network were
    built on wireless microcontroller JN5168, which gives possibility to exchange
    data by means of 802.15.4 protocol, in our case on base of ZigBee protocol. Therefore,
    the hardware upgrading involves two approaches. The first approach provides embedding
    Bluetooth adapter in existing measuring node and connecting it to microcontroller
    JN5168 via SPI or I 2 C port. In this case, software updating provides creating
    additional program modules to control proper port, Bluetooth adapter and to support
    the uncollision operation of two wireless modules. The disadvantage of this approach
    is increase of overall dimensions and weight of printed-circuited board, increase
    of power consumption and necessity to design new measuring node with new microelectronic
    components. In the case of measuring plant state, the wireless node weight is
    critical parameter, since its increasing leads to damage of live plant. The second
    variant provides replacement of used wireless microcontroller JN5168 with new
    one, which will be capable to work in concurrent mode with multiply wireless protocols
    of data exchange, namely ZigBee and Bluetooth for our application. Such approach
    is optimal to solve new challenges because it will satisfy the main criteria:
    The weight of wireless sensor after microcontroller replacement should be the
    same or less. The overall dimensions of new printed-circuited board should remain
    within size of existing node case. The power consumption of new wireless sensor
    should not exceed the value before upgrading. Analysis of the market of wireless
    microcontrollers made it possible to select a number of variants, among which
    our attention was drawn to the wireless system-on-chip nRF52840, manufactured
    by Nordic Semiconductor [11] . The microcontroller nRF52840 [ Fig. 6 ] is multiprotocol.
    It supports following protocols: Bluetooth 5, Bluetooth mesh, Thread, ZigBee,
    802.15.4, ANT and 2.4 GHz proprietary stacks. The nRF52840 is built on 32-bit
    ARM Cortex-M4 CPU with floating point unit (64 MHz). The ARM TrustZone CryptoCell
    cryptographic unit is included on-chip and brings an extensive range of cryptographic
    options for data protection. It has digital peripherals and interfaces such as
    high speed SPI and QSPI for interfacing to external flash and displays, PDM, and
    a full speed USB device for data transfer and power supply for battery recharging.
    Fig. 6 Functional diagram of developed network coordinator Show All The updating
    of software can be implemented in two variants. In the first case, the ZigBee
    and Bluetooth protocols are implemented in non-concurrent mode. In this mode during
    one protocol working, it is necessary to stop operation of other protocol. Switching
    from one protocol to another and backward occurs without rebooting hardware or
    software of wireless module. The second variant provides concurrent implementation
    of protocols, in which the applied software has access to both wireless protocols
    simultaneously. The first approach is enough simple for implementation, since
    it is not necessary to use additional software modules or libraries. Operation
    and switching of protocols are realized by means of existing API and libraries.
    The second approach provides implementation of concurrent operation of ZigBee
    and Bluetooth protocols. It is necessary to use additional technologies, which
    allow applied software to get access to both wireless protocols simultaneously.
    In this case, we use technology “Radio Timeslot”, the software library of which
    is provided by manufacture of system-on-chip. Wireless sensor network for smart
    greenhouses, developed on base of ZigBee protocol, has tree-like structure. After
    switching on the network coordinator forms the network, adds new nodes and controls
    operation of both individual nodes and whole network. Communication between coordinator
    and very remote nodes is provided via routers (signal repeaters), which also control
    the operation of local clusters of measuring nodes, connected to them. User can
    control network or its individual nodes only via network coordinator in manual
    mode or by means of portable or stationary PC, equipped with ZigBee/USB convertor.
    Besides, the user should be near the coordinator or PC with convertor. The disadvantage
    of the system is impossibility to use wireless measuring nodes (smart sensors)
    in autonomous mode. To measure by one node it is necessary to deploy network,
    which includes network coordinator and only one node. Adding Bluetooth protocol
    to wireless measuring nodes made it possible significantly to extend the functionality
    and autonomy as individual nodes, so a network in whole. Generalized structure
    of developed two-protocol wireless sensor network is given in Fig. 7 . So, the
    measuring nodes can function not only in network via ZigBee protocol, but also
    as individual autonomous sensors apart from network via Bluetooth protocol. In
    such case, the user can control measuring node and acquire data from it by means
    of mobile phone or tablet. It should be noted, that the user can interact with
    individual node even when the node is a part of network. Nowadays, ZigBee and
    Bluetooth protocols function in non-concurrent mode. The order of switching between
    protocols is follow. As part of network, the measuring node operates through ZigBee
    protocol. When user needs to access certain node without the network coordinator,
    he switch node from ZigBee to Bluetooth by pressing hardware button. Then user
    controls the node to perform one or several measurements according specified program
    or acquire data from node. If the stable connection with Bluetooth master device
    is lost (in our case the user with mobile phone or tablet move away on distance,
    larger than distance of stable connection), the measuring node automatically disables
    Bluetooth protocol and enables ZigBee protocol with further connection to available
    WSN. Fig. 7 Structure of two-protocol wireless sensor network Show All Creation
    of two-protocol wireless measuring nodes made it possible to upgrade the medical
    information communicator [12] , developed at the Institute of Cybernetics of NAS
    of Ukraine for purposes of first-contact medicine or family doctor. The original
    medical communicator provided the doctor with supplemental information about injury
    or disease, emergency actions and methods of further treatment and caring, during
    initial examination of injured or patient. Currently the doctor has possibility
    to connect via Bluetooth to medical communicator several autonomous wireless nodes,
    equipped with sensors for measuring medical and physiological parameters of human.
    Structure of system on base of medical information communicator and set of two-protocol
    wireless nodes for measuring medical and physiological parameters of human is
    shown in Fig. 8 . Fig. 8 Medical information communicator with sets of wireless
    two-protocol measuring nodes Show All SECTION V. Conclusion Features of wireless
    sensor network for beverage manufacturing process monitoring and control, based
    on new smart multisensor nodes are considered. Block diagrams of smart multisensor
    nodes, and coordinator are developed. As result, new nodes of WSN were designed
    and prototyped according to the requirements of applied tasks of WSN application
    in beverage manufacturing and using two wireless protocols simultaneously for
    customer convenience. That caused upgrading measuring modules with new sets of
    sensors, hardware and applied software of ZigBee-compatible network nodes to operate
    with two wireless protocols, namely ZigBee and Bluetooth. Authors Figures References

  description: A challenge exists in horticultural greenhouse farming as a result
    of the current decline in the agriculture labor force in Japan. Although there
    is a need for cutting-edge technological Information and Communications Technology
    (ICT) application in agriculture, few small-scale farmers are willing to risk
    significant capital on sensing technologies. In this study, a simplified smart
    agriculture system using limited resource expense was developed and applied in
    a tomato greenhouse. The system’s real-time information capability is composed
    of commercial inexpensive wireless sensor network (WSN) devices, and a developed
    web database (web DB) for daily activity data collection was used for crop environment
    monitoring and management. The crop microclimate environment was monitored on
    the basis of an agro-climatic index, namely, growing degree day (GDD). Microclimate
    spatiotemporal distributions using GDD were also determined, which showed well-defined
    microclimate variations within the greenhouse. Crop calendars were embedded into
    the developed web DB for tomato farms. We drew conclusions for better crop management
    and crop yields using our smart agriculture system. The applicability of the system
    based on initial cost, running costs, and the reliability of WSN data makes it
    cost-effective. Consequently, it could be used for the accurate crop production
    planning and decision making of cultivation activities.

    1. Introduction and motivation The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a term first
    coined by a British visionary, Kevin Ashton, back in 1999. As the phrase “Internet
    of Things” reveals, the IoT paradigm will provide a technological universe, in
    which many physical objects or “Things”, such as sensors, everyday tools and equipment
    enhanced by computing power and networking capabilities will be able to play a
    role, either as single units or as a distributed collaborating swarm of heterogeneous
    devices. Agriculture is one of the sectors that is expected to be highly influenced
    by the advances in the domain of IoT. The Food and Agricultural Organization of
    the United Nation (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion
    people by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 (FAO, 2009). This practically means
    that an increase of 70% in food production must be achieved by 2050 worldwide.
    The great increase in global population and the rising demand for high-quality
    products create the need for the modernisation and intensification of agricultural
    practices. At the same time, the need for high efficiency in the use of water
    and other resources is also mandatory. One of the most promising concepts, which
    is expected to contribute a lot to the required increase of food production in
    a sustainable way, is precision agriculture (PA) (Zhang, Wang, & Wang, 2002).
    Precision agriculture aims to optimise and improve agricultural processes to ensure
    maximum productivity and requires fast, reliable, distributed measurements in
    order to give growers a more detailed overview of the ongoing situation in their
    cultivation area, and/or coordinate the automated machinery in such way that optimises
    energy consumption, water use and the use of chemicals for pest control and plant
    growth. At a higher level, having gathered information from many heterogeneous
    systems, well-evaluated scientific knowledge can be organised in the form of smart
    algorithms to provide a better insight into the ongoing processes, do the reasoning
    of the current situation and make predictions based on heterogeneous inputs, produce
    early warnings about potential dangers that threaten the cultivars, and improved
    automated control signals, based on plant responses (Kacira et al., 2005, Körner
    and Van Straten, 2008). The algorithms required to handle the distributed data
    in real time are far too complicated to run locally on a low-power Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) node. However, in the context of IoT, all the objects will be interconnected,
    and therefore the computational overhead can be easily shifted to the cloud or
    be distributed among more than one interconnected devices. The greatly increasing
    interest in IoT in agriculture can be roughly seen in Fig. 1. The increase in
    the appearance of the term “IoT” along with the term “Agriculture” in the international
    scientific literature is rather indicative. These data motivated us to present
    an overview of the state-of-the-art research on IoT in its various forms, appearing
    in the agricultural sector, rather than a generic review. For this reason, a research
    methodology was adopted derived from the existing guidelines used by medical researchers,
    adapted and optimised for software engineering matters (Kitchenham, 2004). According
    to this methodology, a selection of recent literature was done, setting the year
    2010 as starting point. The 2010 starting point year was determined because it
    is then when a significant number of publications appeared. Moreover, technologies
    and approaches before 2010 are quite obsolete at the time of writing the present
    manuscript. Other selection criteria included the multidisciplinary nature of
    a publication. Works utilising more than one technology in order to synthesise
    their solutions were considered as IoT-oriented; for instance, cloud and embedded
    devices/wireless sensors, or, works that make use of more than one type of end
    devices (things) within the same network. Having none of the aforementioned restrictions,
    the reviewed literature area would be too wide and out of the scope of this work.
    Moreover, this paper seeks to present research that adopts newer architectures,
    closer to the principles of IoT. Download : Download high-res image (97KB) Download

    to “IoT in Agriculture”, as they appear in Scopus. This paper begins with an introduction
    in the recent trends in the technologies, which represent the building blocks
    of IoT, such as the Radio Frequency Identification Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID), wireless sensor networks, the addressing of the “things” in a common network,
    as well as the applications running on the cloud. Following the same categorisation,
    several works are presented, which incorporate one or more of the IoT aspects
    and focus on the agricultural sector. Some of the most popular hardware platforms,
    met in agricultural deployments, is also surveyed. The review closes with a discussion
    on future challenges and their effect on IoT spreading, which has effects on the
    adoption of IoT in the agricultural sector too. One of the goals of this work
    is to provide the members of a multidisciplinary community, such as the researchers
    working on deploying innovative monitoring, tracking, decision support and control
    systems, with a handful manuscript that summarises the latest advances in embedded
    devices, sensor modules, wireless communication technologies, programming paradigms
    and cloud services suitable, or optimised, for use in agriculture. Some of the
    most common keywords appearing in the presented literature are presented in Fig.

    Keyword distribution in the presented literature. 2. Internet of Things enabling
    technologies The structure of IoT is based on three layers; namely, the perception
    layer (sensing), the network layer (data transfer), and the application layer
    (data storage and manipulation). Despite great improvements, IoT is still evolving,
    trying to obtain its final shape, as can be seen in several reviews (Atzori et
    al., 2010, Botta et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013, Miorandi et al., 2012). As
    the term “Internet” implies, networking capability is one of the core features
    of the IoT devices. The internet as we know it today is mostly an internet of
    human end-users, while the IoT will be an internet of non-human entities, therefore
    a lot of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication will take place. 2.1. Layer 1:
    the perception layer At the perception layer, we meet technologies such as WSN,
    RFID and, recently, Near Field Communications (NFC). There is some overlap between
    WSN and RFID technologies, since semi-passive and active RFID tags can also be
    regarded as wireless nodes with lower computational and storage capacity. Typically,
    a wireless sensor node consists of a processing module, usually a low-power microcontroller
    unit (MCU), one or more sensor modules (embedded or external analogue or digital
    sensing devices) and an RF communication module, usually supporting a low-power
    wireless communication technology (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image
    (202KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The architecture of a typical
    wireless sensor node. Apart from monitoring and control during the production
    process, there is a need for monitoring, identification and tracking of agricultural
    and livestock products after harvest. WSNs are often met in several works related
    to monitoring and climate control of storage and logistics facilities. RFID technology
    is considered the first, and most basic, example of interconnected “Things”. RFID
    tags contain data in the form of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the RFID
    Readers are triggering, reading and manipulating a large number of tags. Offering
    object identification, tracking and data storage on active or passive (without
    the need for embedded power supply) tags, RFID and NFC technologies play an important
    role in the agricultural domain. Typical user scenarios include products or livestock
    monitoring, supply chain and quality control tracking and lifecycle assessment
    of agricultural products (Welbourne et al., 2009). 2.2. Layer 2: the network layer
    At the second layer of IoT, wireless sensor nodes interacting with physical objects
    and/or their environment, communicate with their neighbouring nodes or a gateway,
    building networks through which the data are usually forwarded towards a remote
    infrastructure for storage, further analysis, processing and dissemination of
    the valuable knowledge that can be extracted (Gubbi et al., 2013). When it comes
    to wireless communications, a large scientific literature has been created on
    sensor networks, addressing several problems, such as energy efficiency, networking
    features, scalability and robustness (Atzori et al., 2010). Communication protocols
    built over wireless standards, such as 802.15.4, facilitate the device networking
    and bridge the gap between the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. Such
    protocols include ZigBee, ONE-NET, Sigfox, WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and 6LowPan,
    to name a few (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), LoRa/LoRaWAN, DASH7 and low-power WiFi have also appeared in
    several deployments recently. 2.3. Layer 3: the application layer The application
    layer is the third layer of the IoT. It is of high importance and, in many ways,
    it is this that facilitates the realisation of the IoT. The application layer
    faces several issues which have to be resolved, such as the identification of
    the devices as unique entities. Identifying and addressing billions of devices
    around the globe will provide a direct, internet-like access and control over
    them through the future internet. The uniqueness of identity, reliability, persistence
    and scalability represent important features of the addressing schema (Gubbi et
    al., 2013). IPv6, with its internet mobility aspects, could alleviate some of
    the device identification problems and is expected to play a vital role in this
    field (Botta et al., 2014). However, the heterogeneous nature of wireless nodes,
    the variability of data types, concurrent operations and confluence of data from
    the devices amplifies the problem even further (Zorzi, Gluhak, Lange, & Bassi,
    2010). Meta-data and context-aware addressing, supplementary to IPv6, are expected
    to contribute a lot while dealing with the above-mentioned challenges (Kalmar,
    Vida, & Maliosz, 2013). Heterogeneity is another big challenge in the IoT world.
    The vision of IoT is to allow billions of devices, with great diversity in their
    technical specifications (form factor, power supply, environmental capabilities,
    compatibility with other devices), computing power, peripheral devices and networking
    subsystems to co-exist in one inter-network. Middleware is a software layer, composed
    of sub-layers located between the devices and the application layer, abstracting
    the device functionalities and technical specificities and providing developers
    with sets of more generic tools to build their applications (Fig. 4). Middleware
    has gained much attention due to its major role in simplifying the development
    of new services and the integration of legacy technologies into new ones (Atzori
    et al., 2010). Furthermore, middleware is the mechanism that combines the cloud
    infrastructure with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the sensor networks
    in a generic manner, ready to provide appropriate tools for any type of deployment
    (Ghosh & Das, 2008). SOA approach benefits the enterprise by reducing the time
    invested in adapting itself to the changes imposed by the market and allows software
    and hardware reuse, since it is technology independent, when it comes to service
    implementations (Pasley, 2005). Future agricultural IoT interconnected devices
    may include sensors, connected machinery and vehicles, weather stations, internet
    gateways, network storage, RFID scanners, smartphones, tablets, wearables and
    many other devices. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Software layers over heterogeneous devices and operating
    systems presenting how the Middleware layer serves in order to make it possible
    for a single/common application to run seamlessly on several platforms and operating
    systems. Finally, in order for the sensed data to have a real value for the end-user
    or another system (in case of M2M scenarios) they have to be stored, analysed,
    synthesised and presented in an understandable and intuitive manner. Big Data
    is one side-effect of the continuous data flow coming from billions of geo-distributed
    devices and has three dimensions, namely volume, variety and velocity (Beyer,
    2011). The Cloud with its virtually unlimited computational and storage capacity
    is the only technology capable of withstanding the IoT workload. In modern agricultural
    scenarios, stored data are automatically processed, corrected and used or combined
    under artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning technologies, and decision-making
    systems based on models, in order to extract knowledge about phenomena, which
    cannot be directly measured. These systems can either propose the optimal tactic
    to the end-user, or produce the appropriate control signals for actuator devices,
    offering fully-automated sensing and control solutions. Plenty of studies have
    focussed on the standardisation of the IoT core technologies (Jazayeri et al.,
    2015, Sawant et al., 2014). The classical WSN/WSAN (Wireless Sensor-Actor Network)
    paradigm, i.e. distributed smart devices sensing and transferring data to a sink
    and/or driving one or more actuators, moves one step further towards interoperability
    of devices and objects. Other aspects of IoT include technologies that support
    the intercommunication among devices and/or end-users, as well as the platforms,
    the software, the hardware abstractions and the programming tools, over which
    developers and providers can build new applications and services (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Miorandi et al., 2012). The IoT paradigm is driven by the principles: “Anything
    communicates – anything is identified – anything interacts”. 3. Internet of Things
    hardware, platforms and sensors in agriculture 3.1. Low-power wireless sensor
    networks In the recent literature, a large number of embedded programmable devices
    have been used. Some are custom-built, while others are either commercial programmable
    boards or complete, closed-source sensing/monitoring solutions. Researchers choose
    their equipment depending on the research priorities set, or the main focus of
    each study. Commercial sensing solutions provide a number of features out of the
    box, allowing researchers to focus on other aspects of IoT deployments, like meta-processing,
    smart algorithms for monitoring and control, cloud interoperability, etc. (Edwards
    Murphy et al., 2015, Mamduh et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2011). Programmable, open
    solutions, on the other hand, provide developers the flexibility to have full
    control over the behaviour of the nodes and the network and program new peripheral
    devices to make them compatible with the nodes, like new sensor or actuator modules
    (Akshay et al., 2012; Wu, Li, Ma, Qiu, & He, 2012; Hou and Gao, 2010, Jayaraman
    et al., 2015a, Jimenez et al., 2012, Park and Park, 2011). The potential applications
    of IoT in agriculture cover a large number of scenarios. Barcelo-Ordinas, Chanet,
    Hou, & Garcia-Vidal (2016) categorise them in networks of scalar sensors, utilised
    in sensing and control of agricultural infrastructures, such as greenhouses, multimedia
    sensor networks for the remote image capturing and processing for the detection
    of insects and plant diseases, and tag-based networks (RFID, NFC) for product
    tracking and remote identification. Especially in the case of WSN in agriculture,
    the specific characteristics of the situation and the environment, in which the
    nodes will be deployed, should be taken into account. Crops, or other obstacles
    in farmlands whose positions may move, cause considerable interference in the
    communication between nodes. This varying movement of obstacles affects the connection
    quality of links, making it variable with space and time, affecting the deployment,
    routing, failure diagnosis, and other aspects of WSN. Harsh environmental factors
    such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and high solar radiation, the effect of
    shading by the plant leaves, as well as the noise produced by building structures,
    such as greenhouses, extend the spatiotemporal climatic variation, greatly affecting
    the links and communication quality among the nodes (Wang, Yang, & Mao, 2017).
    The periodic nature of the recorded phenomena in agricultural installations usually
    drive the development of the applications. This characteristic sets the requirements
    and provides opportunities for novel duty-cycle control, sampling scheduling,
    data reconstructions, as well as data storage and query, intelligent control,
    and so on (Ahonen et al., 2008, Mottola and Picco, 2011; Pawlowski et al., 2008).
    Therefore, the choice of the correct IoT platform to build a deployment could
    affect the overall success of the project. A summary of some of the popular programmable
    boards and embedded platforms used in recent deployments is presented in Table

    for agricultural Internet of Things/Wireless Sensor Network deployments Although
    many theoretical aspects of WSN have been extensively studied in literature, realistic
    IoT/WSN deployments in agricultural sector are quite demanding and remain a challenging
    task. Sensor modules need to be accurate enough, with the appropriate measuring
    range for the situation at hand, and shielded against environmental factors which
    can either create false readings or even destroy the sensor permanently. Due to
    the distributed nature of IoT, in cases of battery-operated nodes, placed in open
    fields or other agricultural facilities, replacing the power source can be a very
    difficult task, if not impossible. Therefore, very strict power constraints affect
    the selection of hardware and the low-power features of the selected peripheral
    devices are always considered when designing a new system. Software-wise the components
    which are to be integrated in order to implement the functionality of an end-device
    have to be carefully inspected. The final functional code requires deep embedded
    software engineering knowledge and sufficient testing to avoid failures in the
    field (Barrenetxea et al., 2008, Langendoen et al., 2006). . Other characteristics
    making a low-power, embedded device selectable for a deployment are its long-term
    stability, the number of digital and analogue inputs/outputs which determines
    the number of peripheral devices (sensors and actuators) that can be supported,
    the ability to be sustainable through power harvesting modules, and, the effort
    required for its programming. 3.3. Wireless communication protocols in agriculture
    The dominant wireless technologies in the domain of IoT are separated into seven
    main categories, namely, Global System for Mobile Communications (Groupe Spécial
    Mobile – GSM) offered by authorised operators, Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (WPAN), Wireless Regional Area Networks (Cognitive Radio/WRAN), Mesh, Point-to-Point
    (P2P) and Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPN/LPWAN). GSM standard is further divided
    into GSM EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) and UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network
    (UTRAN). Numerous wireless devices have been developed upon the various wireless
    standards. As in many aspects of IoT, interoperability is the biggest challenge.
    Another challenge, which is common in the wireless communications, is the interference
    among devices that operate in the same band (Bluetooth, ZigBee and WiFi, for instance)
    or in neighbouring bands. An attempt to summarise the most popular IoT wireless
    standards is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary table of the most popular

    provide a wide variety of bandwidth, communication range, power consumption and
    security measures. The variety of technologies and standards, as well as the differentiation
    among the IoT projects and their specific requirements, hamper interoperability
    at the networking layer. When it comes to agricultural deployments, high temperature,
    and high humidity are two very common phenomena. Based on the observations of
    Bannister, Giorgetti, and Gupta (2008), temperature has a significant effect on
    the received signal strength (RSS) when it rises from 25 °C to 65 °C. Similar
    results were presented by Boano, Tsiftes, Voigt, Brown, and Roedig (2010). Furthermore,
    humidity can also be very high in agricultural deployments. In the case of open
    fields, the wireless nodes are directly exposed to rain or irrigation systems.
    In greenhouses, relative humidity can be over 80% for long periods too. Humidity
    has been shown to strongly affect radio wave propagation (Room and Tate, 2007,
    Thelen, 2004). Therefore, the number of nodes, the distance between them, the
    height of the antenna, and the operating frequency based on the desired size of
    messages are serious matters to be taken into consideration, when choosing a wireless
    transceiver for an agricultural deployment. 4. Applications in agriculture The
    general overview of IoT structural elements presented in Section 2 clearly reveals
    the great potential of these technologies in the domains of Agriculture and the
    recent trend of Precision Agriculture (PA). Recent advances in sensor technology,
    along with the miniaturisation of electronics and the great drop in their cost
    have contributed a lot to the technological evolution of traditional agriculture
    to precision and micro-precision agriculture (Kacira et al., 2005). Climate sensors,
    ground sensors, radiation sensors, weather stations (made of sensors) emphasise
    that it is all about sensors and sensor data flows, which are stored and used
    for monitoring, knowledge mining, reasoning, and control. Additionally, in recent
    years, there is an increasing demand for high quality and safe agricultural products.
    This trend has yielded the need for interoperable, distributed, robust, and accurate
    logistics traceability systems. The IoT family of technologies provides all the
    appropriate tools for building and maintaining such infrastructure and services,
    specially designed to support supply chains in agricultural and floricultural
    sectors (Verdouw, Beulens, & van der Vorst, 2013). 4.1. Agricultural monitoring
    and control Sensors, in the form of wired and wireless sensors, have been widely
    used in agriculture during the last decades. Sensing the environment in which
    production occurs, and, more recently, the responses of the plants to the climate
    (Nishina, 2015), is crucial for taking the correct and more precise decisions,
    optimising productivity and quality of the cultivars. The traditional WSN have
    recently evolved to IoT-friendly-WSN, by adopting more generic standards in terms
    of communication, allowing remote access to the internet and implementing smart
    algorithms for meta-processing of the data aiming to improve monitoring and/or
    control. Versatile devices, with high computational abilities, very convenient
    form factor and low cost, can nowadays be used, on batteries, and operate for
    long periods, with or without the assistance of power harvesting modules. In addition,
    modern embedded devices have sufficient resources to support more demanding sensors,
    such as image sensors, and the support of more sophisticated networking protocols,
    such TCP/IP, extending the traditional WSN networking capabilities. A rough classification
    of literature on monitoring and control could be: - Monitoring and, in some cases,
    creation of early warnings, via simplified rules. This includes multi-point monitoring
    for catching and absorbing climatic gradients in greenhouse cultivation (Katsoulas
    et al., 2017a, Tolle et al., 2005). - Monitoring, meta-processing (algorithm/model
    implementations on the server/cloud side) and control, including control suggestions
    to the user and fully automated control (Aiello, Giovino, Vallone, Catania, &
    Argento, 2017). - Monitoring using more computationally demanding sensors, such
    as image sensors and more powerful end-nodes. Captured images are used either
    for plain monitoring of the system, or utilised for image processing on-board,
    at the edge of the network (Fog computing) or on a cloud/server-based infrastructure
    (Katsoulas et al., 2016, Ravikanth et al., 2017, Senthilkumar et al., 2016). Sensing
    is of high importance in agriculture. WSNs have been widely used in climate and
    soil monitoring deployments both in open field and in controlled environment agriculture.
    4.2. Controlled environment agriculture Greenhouses have been shown to present
    significant climate variability, which affects the productivity of the plants
    (Kittas, Bartzanas, & Jaffrin, 2003), if not harming them. Greenhouse cultivation
    is more intense, therefore, in many cases, it requires higher precision in terms
    of monitoring and control (Fig. 4). Several studies have focussed only on localised
    and remote monitoring. In most cases data are stored and represented in various
    graphical ways (Wu et al., 2012; Jimenez et al., 2012; Katsoulas, Bartzanas, &
    Kittas, 2017; Yu et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2010). In addition to the high-precision
    monitoring, there have been studies presenting systems which incorporate meta-processing
    procedures with data transferred on remote infrastructures through the internet.
    Utilising well-evaluated equations, crop and climate models, such systems produce
    assessments of the climate and/or crop status in order for the grower to take
    better decisions or get early warnings (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Fernandes et
    al., 2013, Hernandez and Park, 2011, Hu and Qian, 2011, Jiao et al., 2014, Katsoulas
    et al., 2017b, Ma et al., 2011, Suciu et al., 2015, Tuli et al., 2014, Yu and
    Zhang, 2013, Zhou et al., 2013). Agricultural-cloud IoT solutions for greenhouse
    monitoring and control are more and more common. End-nodes collect various data
    which are uploaded to a cloud infrastructure where these data are analysed deeply,
    in a faster way, at a lower cost, reliably and efficiently (Jiawen et al., 2013,
    Keerthi and Kodandaramaiah, 2015, Wang et al., 2013a). Since plant factories are
    becoming more popular in the wider frame of urban CEA in smart cities, there have
    been a number of studies focussing on artificial growth systems (Kozai and Fujiwara,
    2016, Lee and Yoe, 2015). Katsoulas, Bartzanas, et al. (2017) presented a system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling for greenhouses (OpIRIS) based on well-evaluated
    scientific knowledge organised in the form of a web application communicating
    with remote sensors installed in greenhouses. The system integrated industrial-grade
    climate sensors and machinery including fertigation valves/controllers and sensors
    for automatic drainage sampling and forwarding the data to the cloud infrastructure
    for further analysis. The system proved very accurate in predicting the crop water
    needs and provided growers with very efficient indications about when to irrigate
    and how much nutrient solution to apply. Similar attempts to automate irrigation
    have been based on an agricultural information cloud and a hardware combination
    of IOT and RFID (Tongke, 2013), the system achieving dynamic distribution of resource
    and load balancing. As a result, authors report high efficiency of resource use
    and significant improvement in water quality. There have also been studies that
    implement control of one or more of the actuator systems in greenhouses, such
    as climate, or, irrigation controllers, also known as WSANs (Moga et al., 2012,
    Sabri et al., 2011). The control can be done remotely in two ways. The first is
    manual control by the farmer. In these cases, system administrator, based on the
    suggestions made by a Decision Support System/Expert System, chooses to control
    the machinery. Applications in this monitoring and control category include Integrated
    Pest Management (IPM) (Chougule, Kumar, & Mukhopadhyay, 2016), remote monitoring,
    warning and control in open field (Chu et al., 2013, Dinh Le and Tan, 2015), and
    in controlled environment agriculture (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Pahuja et al.,
    2013, Qiu et al., 2013). There also plenty of studies attempting fully-automated
    control by communicating the control signals, produced after processing the sensed
    data, directly to the actuators succeeding a closed-loop control (Kassim et al.,
    2014, Nikolidakis et al., 2015, Rajaoarisoa et al., 2012, Yin et al., 2014, Yongheng
    and Feng, 2014). 4.3. Open-field agriculture In open-field deployments researchers
    usually measure climate conditions, but also focus a lot in soil monitoring. In
    many cases authors use more than one sensors in the ground, at different depths.
    Optimising irrigation by providing exactly as much water as the plant needs is
    the only way to preserve water, since all the extra amount or irrigation is either
    lost into the ground, or in the atmosphere through evaporation (Fig. 5) (Sivakumar,
    GunaSekaran, SelvaPrabhu, Kumaran, & Anandan, 2012). Optical sensors have been
    used for additional information on crop reflectance or remote temperature sensing,
    as well as, mapping of the situation in the field (Fisher and Kebede, 2010, Inoue
    et al., 2012, Moshou et al., 2011, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). Integration
    of IoT and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has been proposed in cases where
    precision of mapping of the sensed data is important (Li et al., 2012, Wang et
    al., 2013b, Ye et al., 2013). Another aspect of WSNs in agriculture are the Underground
    Wireless Sensor networks, which present significant advantages, especially in
    open field applications (De Lima et al., 2010, Dong et al., 2013, Silva and Vuran,
    2010). Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. A modern example of Cloud IoT solutions for climate monitoring and
    climate optimisation based on cloud analytics services. Data fusion is realised
    on the cloud. These data come from various sources, like sensors inside and outside
    the facilities, weather stations, historical data from data bases. User can interact
    remotely with the system through a wide variety of devices (laptops, tablets,
    smartphones, etc.). As mentioned earlier, the advances in embedded device technology
    have made very powerful platforms available at very convenient prices. This has
    given the chance to researchers to implement more sophisticated end-devices, such
    as Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks, incorporating sensing nodes with much
    bigger computational capabilities, enough to support highly demanding peripheral
    devices, such as image sensors. This kind of node allows heavier local processing
    at the edge of the network, in fog-network-like manner. These works either use
    cameras for simple security or facility monitoring purposes (Cai et al., 2011,
    Zhang et al., 2011), or implement various image processing algorithms in order
    to track invading animals (Baranwal & Pushpendra, 2016), insects or other plant
    threats (Dang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014) and crop growth (Rodriguez de la
    Concepcion, Stefanelli, & Trinchero, 2014). 4.4. Livestock applications Several
    deployments have been realised in the fields of livestock. Optimal environment
    which absorbs extreme climate conditions known to have negative effects on animals
    productivity is a serious matter for many authors (Corkery et al., 2013, Ilapakurti
    and Vuppalapati, 2015, Wang and Lee, 2012, Zhang et al., 2016). Livestock IoT
    includes not only animal and animal climate monitoring and control, but, in some
    cases includes field monitoring for optimal feeding practices (Fig. 6) (Bhargava,
    Ivanov, & Donnelly, 2015). Another aspect of livestock IoT includes the instrumentation
    and analysis of beehives (Edwards Murphy et al., 2015). Wireless sensors have
    been used in animal tracking and behavioural analysis (Asikainen et al., 2013,
    Huircán et al., 2010, Jeong and Yoe, 2012, Kwong et al., 2012, Nadimi et al.,
    2012) as well as odour and hazardous gas monitoring (Mamduh et al., 2012). There
    are also studies that focus on optimising the performance of the equipment used
    in livestock deployment, based on the imposed challenges of the situation at hand
    (Jeong & Yoe, 2012). Download : Download high-res image (151KB) Download : Download

    overview. 4.5. Food supply chain tracking Modern agriculture tends to be more
    and more industrialised. Therefore, standardisation mechanisms at each step for
    the product, from the grower to the consumer, have to be adopted in order to assure
    food safety and quality (Fig. 8). This need has led to a growing interest in food
    supply chain traceability systems. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies include
    plenty of solutions to contribute greatly to the construction, support and maintenance
    of such systems. In the reviewed literature, solutions focus either on the business
    side of Food Supply Chain (FSC) or technology. There are some works, though, which
    attempt to propose solutions for both sides. Recent developments in e-commerce
    have given a boost to various Supply Chain research activity. In this review,
    however, a focus only on FSC was attempted, since they are optimised for food
    supplies. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Schematic representation of the food supply chain from the production
    phase until the final consumer. RFID is the most common IoT technology found in
    Food Supply Chain (FSC). RFID tags, acting as enhanced barcodes, enable the tracking
    of agricultural products. Recent research, following the IoT paradigm, has combined
    more than one sensor to enrich the information of product status whenever this
    is recorded through its RFID (Maksimovic et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013). A common
    issue in IoT is its distributed nature and the asynchronous and heterogeneous
    flow of information. Therefore, naming is vital for the accurate and fast retrieval
    of information when it comes to FSC tracking services (Liu et al., 2015). The
    realisation of IoT-based infrastructure leads to the virtualisation of the supply
    chains, since physical proximity is no longer required (Verdouw et al., 2013).
    Various models analysing the FSC issues and the way IoT technologies tackle them
    appear in literature (Lianguang, 2014, Zhang, 2014). Technological evolution,
    combined with the increasing robustness and maturity of several technologies met
    in IoT, have given researchers the chance to develop complete systems, which incorporate
    sensing modules and software infrastructures. The software part of these systems
    is either hosted on cloud providers or shared among distributed shareholders.
    Complete systems offer automated services, intelligent schemes and automatic reasoning
    based on the measured phenomena and artificial intelligence (Chen, 2015, Jiang
    and Zhang, 2013, Xu et al., 2011). Other works present approaches on how to organise
    a complete FSC information management system (Li, Chen, & Zhu, 2013) or how to
    design the system in such a way that it maximises the economic profit (Pang, Chen,
    Han, & Zheng, 2015). 4.6. Internet of Things middleware and interoperability Interoperability
    at all levels is a key concept in the developing IoT world. Middleware is an approach
    that aims to facilitate interoperability (Fig. 9). The concept of interoperability
    in IoT can be expressed in many ways. Modern agriculture has evolved into a highly-intensive
    industry, expanding from the level of single grower up to international organisations.
    Therefore, agricultural-oriented IoT research offers literature in all aspects
    of interoperability, namely technical, syntactical, semantic and organisational
    interoperability . Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 9. The dimensions of interoperability (Serrano et al., 2015).
    Technical interoperability is associated with hardware and software components,
    aiming to provide seamless exchange of information between systems (M2M). Syntactical
    interoperability has to do with data formats, i.e. the syntax that messages should
    have, in order to be exchanged between the systems, in the form of bit-tables
    or high level languages (HTML, XML, etc.). Semantic interoperability has a special
    value for end users, since it has to do with the human interpretation and understanding
    of the content produced by IoT systems. Finally, organisational interoperability
    is of high importance when it comes to IoT scalability. The ability to communicate
    effectively and transfer meaningful data, over highly varying systems and/or geographic
    regions is the key to success of distributed, global-IoT infrastructures (Serrano
    et al., 2015). Hu, Wang, She, and Wang (2011a) present a middleware to promote
    data (Technical) interoperability among various grain storage systems. Technical
    interoperability is the absolute basic type of interoperability a system must
    satisfy. At a higher level of intercommunication among systems, syntactical interoperability
    has to be implemented, in more generic, understandable and human-friendly messages.
    The incorporation of new, high-end, technologies, such as IoT, within a traditional
    productive sector, such as agriculture, and the trend of precision agriculture
    has given Semantic interoperability middleware an extra value. This is because
    Semantic interoperability middleware makes technology more intuitive and easier
    to understand, for both growers and agronomists (Jayaraman et al., 2015b, Sawant
    et al., 2014). Knowledge retrieval is a second feature of Semantic middleware.
    Data flows are organised and synthesised, allowing for better reasoning and management
    in agricultural (Perera et al., 2013, Yuan et al., 2013) and livestock (Saraswathi
    Sivamani, Park, Shin, Cho, & Cho, 2015) deployments. Moving one step further towards
    the realisation of large-scale national, or international cooperative deployments,
    organisational interoperability has been studied (Hu et al., 2011b, Sivamani et
    al., 2013). Providing the base for seamless cooperation between organisations
    presents numerous advantages, ranging from the technical level, for instance,
    quality improvement in sensing, reasoning and control systems by automatic exchange
    of knowledge between self-learning and self-improving systems, up to economic
    and business level by adapting the production rate according to market trends.
    4.7. Multi-layer deployments and commercial solutions IoT allows for the interoperability
    of the systems and organisations. Therefore, it makes it easier to interconnect
    systems involved in the various phases of a product''s lifecycle and several studies
    have presented systems which integrate numerous platforms that monitor, control
    and track agricultural products. Fu (2012) presents in short an intelligent agricultural
    system which could potentially be used in optimal melon and fruit production and
    management, as well as internet trading and supply chain tracking of organic goods.
    IoT concepts and technologies have been widely applied in many aspects of the
    transportation and storage of goods from the producer to the wholesale reseller
    to the consumer, from post-harvest treatment optimisation, storage facilities
    monitoring and management, and controlled environment shipping containers (Dittmer
    et al., 2012, Moon et al., 2015) to swarms of delivery drones (Yu, Subramanian,
    Ning, & Edwards, 2015), autonomous trucks and ships. IoT applications are there
    to drive future changes (Hribernik, Warden, Thoben, & Otthein, 2010). Several
    vendors have moved towards providing solutions either in the form of service or
    solutions that also include the hardware to do the monitoring. In all these cases
    cloud-based applications do the analysis of the data providing suggestions, warnings
    or control signals. These solutions do not only focus on large-scale production,
    but also on individual gardening and home production. Bitponics is cloud-based
    solution offering automated advisory services for garden care (Bitponics, 2016).
    Plantlink offers a solution for connecting garden to home users integrating sensors
    and irrigation controller in one network (Plantlink, 2016). Growtronix is a modular
    system that can monitor almost every aspect of indoor gardens and plant factories
    (Growtronix, 2016). Some promising smart greenhouse monitoring and control solutions
    are offered by Sensaphone, Monnit and GetSenso (GetSenso, 2016, Monnit, 2016,
    Sensaphone, 2016). These solutions aim to optimise climate in greenhouses minimising
    the risk of yield losses through a more optimal climate for the crops. In addition,
    Fieldclimate appears to be a rich platform providing both hardware (weather stations,
    sensor nodes) and cloud-based software solutions (weather forecast, irrigation
    management, disease models etc.) (FieldClimate, 2016). CropX is a complete system
    including field ground sensors measuring soil moisture and temperature, uploading
    the data to the cloud and offer a mapping and optimal irrigation planning as a
    service to the grower through a mobile application (CropX, 2016). Microsoft has
    recently launched its end-to-end IoT platform for agriculture. FarmBeats consists
    of UAV drones and sensors, connectivity support, and cloud infrastructure which
    includes machine learning-based backend analytics with predictive features, and
    cloud storage (Microsoft, 2015). 5. Discussion 5.1. Internet of Things hardware
    & software challenges in agriculture When it comes to IoT in agriculture, several
    challenges arise. Firstly, the equipment residing at the perception layer has
    to be exposed directly to harsh environmental phenomena, like high solar radiation,
    extreme temperatures, rain or high humidity, strong winds, vibrations and other
    dangers capable of destroying the electronic circuits. The end-devices will have
    to stay active and function reliably for long periods relying on the limited power
    resources of batteries. Therefore, appropriate programming tools and low-power
    capabilities are mandatory, since the frequent battery replacement or reset of
    the stations (in case of a program failure), for example in a large-scale open
    field deployment, is not easy. Power harvesting can be a solution to some extent,
    however, the power consumption has still to be within the power budget of small
    power harvesting modules (e.g. solar panels, wind turbines etc.). Furthermore,
    the large number of interconnected (in an internet-like manner) devices produces
    an incredibly large amount of data, which will soon be beyond the resource capacities
    of small-scale server infrastructures to handle (Atzori et al., 2010, Ziegeldorf
    et al., 2014). 5.2. Organisational challenges & interoperability When it comes
    to logistics for the food and agricultural sector, this infrastructure aims to
    facilitate the exchange of information and the transportation of goods, optimising
    the production process and the supply chain networks globally. IoT is gradually
    transforming business processes by providing more accurate and real-time visibility
    to the flow of materials and products (Lee & Lee, 2015). Cloud Computing provides
    high quality services, hardware-agnostic application development tools and sufficient
    storage and computational resources to store and process the data produced at
    the edge of the network. Therefore, it seems like an ideal complement for the
    IoT technologies towards the composition of “CloudIoT” paradigm (Botta et al.,
    2014). The huge amount of data produced at the edge of the network, however, can
    incur a severely high cost to be transferred to the cloud, both in terms of money
    and latency. Therefore, the optimal balancing between the edge storage and processing
    and the part of the workload that is to be done on the cloud is a serious matter.
    Fog Computing is an extension of the Cloud Computing paradigm, expanding cloud
    technologies and tools, as well as, the horizons of application development (Bonomi,
    Milito, Natarajan, & Zhu, 2014). 5.3. Networking challenges The characteristics
    of the environment do not only impose challenges to the hardware, but also to
    the network layer. Wireless communication is the most common in agricultural deployments,
    due to the lack of wiring costs. Environment is known to be one of the major factors
    which lead to low wireless link quality, through the multi-path propagation effects
    and its contribution to background noise (Wang et al., 2017). Real-world deployments
    have shown that the performance of popular transceivers is affected by temperature
    (Bannister et al., 2008, Boano et al., 2010), humidity (Thelen, 2004), human presence
    and other obstacles within the space in which a wireless node attempts to communicate.
    Therefore, data have to be transferred using robust and reliable technologies,
    according to the requirements and challenges of the rural environment. 5.4. Security
    challenges The transfer to an interconnected internet of “smart things” must ensure
    the security, authenticity, confidentiality and privacy of the stakeholders involved
    in this network. In other words, IoT must be secure against external attacks,
    in the perception layer, secure the aggregation of data in the network layer and
    offer specific guarantees that only authorised entities can access and modify
    data in the application layer. Security in IoT is summarised in three requirements:
    authentication, confidentiality and access control (Sicari, Rizzardi, Grieco,
    & Coen-Porisini, 2015). In the perception layer the most common security issues
    include information acquisition security and physical security of the hardware.
    The latter one is quite important in the case of agriculture, since the devices
    can be deployed in open fields and function without surveillance for long periods.
    Due to the distributed nature of IoT and the fact that its devices may be deployed
    in diverse environments, a single security protocol is, usually, not enough (Li,
    2012). RFID security issues are usually related to leakage of information, which
    can unveil the location and other sensitive data. Security countermeasures include
    data encryption, use of blocker tags, tag frequency modification, jamming and,
    finally, tag destruction policy, in other words the physical ending of a tag''s
    life (Matharu, Upadhyay, & Chaudhary, 2014). Sensor nodes differ from RFID tags,
    in the way that sensors are active and relate to dynamic properties of things.
    Therefore, encryption algorithms, key distribution policies, intrusion detection
    mechanisms and security routing policies have to be deployed, always keeping in
    mind the hardware restrictions of smart devices. In the current IoT concept, data
    flow from the end devices to a gateway, which is in charge of uploading these
    data to other infrastructures, such as the cloud. Various security policies for
    sensor terminals exist, including cryptographic algorithms, identity authentication
    mechanisms, data flow control policies, data filtering mechanisms etc. (Li, 2012).
    Moreover, the perception layer requires information acquisition security measures
    too. Wiretapping, tampering, cheating, and replay attacks are just a few of the
    security threats. Therefore, authenticity, confidentiality and data integrity
    have to be ensured during the phase of data acquisition, and key management protocols
    and secure routing policies should be adopted and sensor node authentication policies
    must be leveraged to prevent data access by unauthorised entities (Gou, Yan, Liu,
    & Li, 2013). 5.5. Stack challenges Middleware is another part of IoT presenting
    specific requirements for increased security, since it stands between the network
    and application layers and is responsible both for data processing and communication
    interface between these two layers. Security in the middleware layer requires
    confidentiality and secure data storage. Wireless medium is challenging, when
    it comes to security in transmissions, even for more sophisticated hardware than
    the platforms met in IoT deployments. Therefore, the IoT architecture can easily
    be exposed to risks, such as denial of service attacks, unauthorised access, man-in-the-middle
    attacks, and virus injections which target and affect confidentiality and data
    integrity. Authentication, intrusion detection, key management and negotiation
    mechanisms could possibly provide solutions against the network layer threats.
    Application layer is the top layer in the IoT vision. It is the place where enormous
    flows of data streams end, requiring increased storage and computational resources.
    This is why the application layer is so closely-related with the cloud. The security
    issues here are not very different from the security issues of the cloud itself,
    including data security, privacy, backup and recovery. Control mechanisms need
    to administer the privileges and ownership of data and manage the access rights
    to all, or part of the information, both for physical users and between machines,
    or even organisations. 5.6. Potential value of IoT in agriculture Internet of
    Things is rapidly evolving and many novel applications and services are emerging
    from it. A great amount of research is being conducting towards the integration
    of various heterogeneous systems, the security assurance at various levels of
    IoT and the analytics, which will give a better insight into the “Big Data” in
    order to optimise various business processes. National policy of governments around
    the world for increased production rate of fresh-cut vegetables and meat, at lower
    price, with higher quality standards, as well as, the consumers'' demand for transparency
    in the production cycle and the environmental footprint of the products they buy,
    provide IoT a huge field for development and diffusion. According to Bradley,
    Barbier, and Handler (2013), the estimates from 2013 to 2022 of potential IoT
    value vary significantly, ranging from a minimum of $1 trillion up to more than
    $15 trillion, not including the increased revenues, the benefits of cost reduction
    among companies and industries and the general economic activity due to IoT. Much
    of the added-value of IoT comes from the flexibility and the optimisation and
    precision that it introduces into the production processes of industry and production
    units of all types. Therefore, it is not so risky to forecast that agricultural
    sector processes at all levels will drastically change in the very near future.
    Obviously the economic numbers related to IoT are very big, tempting some very
    serious players to invest in it. Examples, like the recent purchase of Nest Labs,
    a company specialising in IoT for home automation, by Google for $3.2 billion
    in cash and the purchase of Jasper Technologies, developer of and IoT cloud platform,
    by Cisco for $1.4 billion, reveal the great potential of IoT and prove that it
    is highly attractive to big investors and behemoth technological firms. The partnership
    formation, however, is not so trivial. This is due to the fact that the companies
    involved in IoT invest in one or a few aspects of it, because of its wide nature.
    Therefore, sooner or later, they will have to cooperate with each other, putting
    aside any competition, or the notion of who is more important, in order to introduce
    some universal standards in the evolving IoT hype. 6. Conclusion When it comes
    to agriculture, IoT is expected to optimise the production by many means. Farmlands
    and greenhouses are about to move from precision to a micro-precision model of
    agricultural production. Distributed, pervasive computing and precise monitoring
    of the facilities will provide the optimal growing or living conditions for both
    vegetables and animals. Autonomous systems will be able not only to command the
    actuators in the most efficient way, optimising the utility and resource usage,
    but also to control the production in accordance to the market situation, maximising
    the profit and minimising the costs in every possible way. On the other hand,
    food supply chains, equipped with WSN and RFID equipment, will be able to monitor
    each stage in the life of a product, make automatic reasoning, in case of a faulty
    product and increase consumer''s feeling of safety, through a transparent product
    lifecycle information system. All the above is the optimistic approach of the
    IoT integration in agriculture. However, in this concept, plenty of individual
    players are about to participate. First of all, local networks have to be secured
    against interference from other networks, especially as these technologies reach
    their full potential. In a real IoT scenario, most of the players will use different
    equipment, with different technical specifications and/or sensor characteristics.
    Obviously, the interoperability, the filtering and the semantic annotation of
    the data, coming from each producer, has to be made to some extent. This is the
    only way in which the data, coming from vastly heterogeneous sources, can be used
    to optimise a shared decision support or expert system. Security, anonymity and
    control over the access rights on the information is vital for such a system to
    be adopted. In a wider perspective, many of the data related to business/institution
    strategic planning cannot be disclosed or retrieved by non-authorised entities,
    so that the market is safe against unorthodox tactics. References Ahonen et al.,

  description: Some problems of facility agriculture machinery locating system still
    exist now, such as poor stability, low positioning accuracy and high cost. In
    addition, agricultural machinery navigation and positioning system based on Global
    Position System (GPS) is widely used at home and abroad. But it is not applicable
    to the agricultural facilities and the scenes of more buildings. In order to resolve
    these problems, a wireless sensor network (WSN) locating system based on NanoPAN5375
    module was designed. NanoPAN5375 module is based on the technology of chirp spread
    spectrum (CSS); it not only has advantages of reliable communication, good stability,
    long transmission distance, low system power consumption, and so on, but also
    adopts the principle of the time difference of arrival (TDOA) to calculate the
    distance between nodes, so that its ranging accuracy is high. Therefore, NanoPAN5375
    module was chosen as positioning node of facility agriculture vehicle. In the
    locating system, the 3 beacon nodes were responsible for the wireless ranging,
    and the car installed with location node was responsible for the wireless ranging
    and location coordinates calculation. WD5032N module based on NanoPAN5375 was
    used as WSN node. And microprocessor STM32F103CB and NanoPAN5375 module were integrated
    on WD5032N module. NanoPAN5375 communicated with the microprocessor through the
    serial peripheral interface (SPI), so it could realize the function of wireless
    communication and wireless ranging. A power supply backplane circuit of WD5032N
    module was designed to meet the power supply requirement of its microprocessor
    and NanoPAN5375 module, and location coordinates X and Y were displayed in real
    time through the serial port communicating with liquid crystal display (LCD).
    The node software, which was compiled by C Language taking the Keil MDK as development
    environment, could complete data acquisition and processing, wireless transmission,
    serial communication and other functions. The distances between unknown nodes
    and each beacon node were calculated by using Symmetrical double-sided two way
    ranging (SDSTWR) algorithm which was based on CSS technology in location node.
    And then the coordinate information of the unknown node was calculated by the
    triangle centroid localization algorithm. Finally in order to resolve the effects
    of measurement noise on positioning accuracy, the iterating based on Kalman filter
    algorithm was applied to observed values of target state. The antennas of 3 and
    5 DB were respectively used on WD5032N to do ranging and positioning experiments
    in the indoor and outdoor. On one hand, the results of ranging experiments have
    shown that the ranging accuracy of the nodes based on NanoPAN5375 module is high.
    Within the scope of the appropriate distance, point-to-point ranging accuracy
    between the nodes can reach 1.02 m or less. On the other hand, the results of
    positioning experiments indicate that the stability of WSN positioning system
    based on NanoPAN5375 is good and the positioning accuracy is high. And the positioning
    precision could reach about less than 1 m within the scope of 3 edges of equilateral
    triangle formed by 3 beacon nodes. And the positioning accuracy was about 1-2
    m close to the outside of the triangle edges. So it can satisfy the requirement
    of positioning accuracy of general facility agriculture vehicle, and can be applied
    to other agricultural machines' positioning.

    sensor network，WSN）定位系统。该定位系统的3个信标节点负责和定位节点的无线测距，安装有定位节点的车辆构成的移动节点负责无线测距和定位坐标的计算。WSN节点采用的是基于NanoPAN5375的WD5032N模块。NanoPAN5375模块通过串行外设接口和微处理器进行通信，实现无线通信和无线测距的功能。设计了WD5032N模块的供电底板电路，满足其微处理器和NanoPAN5375模块的供电要求，以及通过串口和液晶显示屏模块通信实时显示定位坐标X和Y。节点软件以Keil
    MDK为开发环境，采用单片机 C 语言开发，实现节点数据采集与处理、无线传输和串口通信等功能。在定位节点上，采用基于线性调频扩频技术的对称双向双边测距算法来计算定位节点到各个信标节点之间的距离，并使用三边质心定位算法计算出未知节点的坐标位置信息，最后使用卡尔曼滤波算法对目标状态的观测值进行迭代，解决因为测量噪声对于定位精度造成的影响。在WD5032N上分别采用3DB天线和5DB天线进行室内和室外测距和定位试验，结果表明，基于NanoPAN5375的WSN定位系统稳定性好，定位精度高，在3个信标节点组成的合适的等边三角形3条边线范围内定位精度能达到1
    m左右，而在接近三角形边线外侧的位置定位精度是1～2 m左右，可以满足一般设施农业车辆的定位精度要求。该文为农业机械精确定位的深入研究提供了参考。   关键词:

  description: The advancement of technology has changed the way how industries operate.
    With current advancement of computer and communication technology; the agriculture
    industry is transforming from labor-intensive to more and more technology-relying.
    To support the ever growing world population with limited farm land, researchers
    investigate the concept of precision agriculture, which helps to increase farm
    produces by using less resources. Precision agriculture successfully uses technology
    like Decision Support System (DSS) and Information and Communication Technology
    (ICT). The convenience and wide availability of smart devices make such technology
    accessible to small farms. Based on the observation, a project-based learning
    opportunity is offered to students at Prairie View A&M University. In the project,
    students investigate research focusing on a real-time DSS for smart irrigation.
    Temperature and humidity information is collected with field sensors, and then
    is transmitted through Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). WSN, which is operated based
    on the IEEE 802.15.4 standards, contains nodes that are used to help transmit
    data to a gateway. Mobile device programs, such as iPhone and iPad applications
    are developed for farmers to help them make decisions. The use of mobile devices
    in the farm will give the farmers the ability and convenience to observe data
    and make decisions in real time manner. The WSN based DSS is successfully setup
    and tested by several senior design groups. Based on the success of the project,
    related topics will be included in a special topic course, which will be offered
    in the Department of Engineering Technology. Through these activities, students
    gain hands-on experiences on computing, communication, as well as smart sensor
    technologies. Students increase their confidence in pursuing future career opportunities
    in the abovementioned areas, especially in agriculture and engineering. By doing
    so, not only the students are equipped with cutting edge technology but also they
    will be more competitive in their future careers. The teaching project also provides
    a platform for collaboration among educators from diversified disciplines for
    enhancing agricultural and engineering education at Prairie View A&M University.

    \ on the use of modern technologies in the\ncyber-physical ﬁeld management cycle.\
    \ Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud\nComputing have\
    \ accelerated the digital transformation of the conventional agricultural practices\n\
    promising increased production rate and product quality. The adoption of smart\
    \ farming though is\nhampered because of the lack of models providing guidance\
    \ to practitioners regarding the necessary\ncomponents that constitute IoT-based\
    \ monitoring systems. To guide the process of designing\nand implementing Smart\
    \ farming monitoring systems, in this paper we propose a generic reference\narchitecture\
    \ model, taking also into consideration a very important non-functional requirement,\n\
    the energy consumption restriction. Moreover, we present and discuss the technologies\
    \ that incorporate\nthe seven layers of the architecture model that are the Sensor\
    \ Layer, the Link Layer, the Encapsulation\nLayer, the Middleware Layer, the Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, the Management Layer and the Application\nLayer. Furthermore, the proposed\
    \ Reference Architecture model is exempliﬁed in a real-world\napplication for\
    \ surveying Saffron agriculture in Kozani, Greece.\nKeywords: Wireless Sensor\

    \ of the agricultural sector is considered a priority to face the\nnumerous challenges\
    \ presented in the ﬁelds. Environmental monitoring and remote controlling in\n\
    agriculture is rapidly growing towards developing more productive and competitive\
    \ agricultural\nsystems and tools. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming can\
    \ lead to this direction. These two terms\nrefer to the integration of advanced\
    \ technologies into existing agricultural practices to achieve ﬁne-grid\ncrops\
    \ management. Smart farming systems can provide to farmers meaningful environmental\
    \ data\nfrom the cultivation ﬁelds aiming to boost competitiveness and proﬁt.\
    \ Almost every aspect of the\nagricultural ﬁeld can beneﬁt from these kinds of\
    \ technological advances ranging from planting and\nirrigation processes to plant\
    \ protection and harvesting methods.\nThe future of precision agriculture lies\
    \ upon modern technological advancements and remote\nsensing techniques using\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and different kind of smart sensors. Sensors\n\
    are measuring devices that convert an external stimulus or else input signal,\
    \ into an appropriately\nmeasurable output signal. Sensor devices can transform\
    \ a macroscopic size (light, power, pressure,\netc.) to an electrically measurable\
    \ size. Once the electrical signal is processed, it is converted into a\nstandardized\
    \ signal with certain characteristics. The sensor’s properties can be altered\
    \ in a measurable\nmanner, either directly or indirectly by the exposure to a\
    \ particular analyzer or change in environmental\nconditions. UAVs are ﬂying vehicles\
    \ that do not have a pilot on their spindle. Instead they ﬂy either\nInformation\

    \ Unmanned aircraft used for remote monitoring are part\nof Unmanned Aerial Systems\
    \ (UASs). UASs involve all necessary devices and procedures for UAV\noperation,\
    \ while managing data collection. UAVs enable Earth Observation (EO) towards improving\n\
    accuracy, executing more frequent and better monitoring of the ﬁelds and cover\
    \ large (not easily\naccessible) areas. Sensors and UAVs are a part of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) paradigm. The IoT is a\nmodern communication network involving\
    \ the employment of a vast number of distributed smart\ndevices around a uniﬁed\
    \ wide area network. Its basic characteristic stands upon the ability to recognize\n\
    and notify users instantly about real-time events by the use of smart objects.\
    \ Smart objects-devices\nhave basic computational skills, constrained resources\
    \ and unique identiﬁers for communication.\nThe adoption of smart farming though\
    \ is hampered because of the lack of models providing\nguidance to practitioners\
    \ regarding the necessary components that constitute IoT-based monitoring\nsystems.\
    \ The typically dense and heterogeneous nature of IoT deployments poses immense\
    \ challenges\non interoperability among the desired components. However, an efﬁciently\
    \ designed architecture based\non modern enhanced IoT technologies can pave the\
    \ way into easily adopting and deploying smart\nsystems into our everyday life\
    \ activities. The latest years a signiﬁcant number of efforts were presented\n\
    regarding the most suitable network structure and technologies for smart farming\
    \ applications [1–9].\nHowever, the architectural models presented in [1,7–9]\
    \ were based only on static sensor nodes, ignoring\nthe advantage of UAVs in monitoring\
    \ and failing to provide efﬁcient mapping of the ﬁeld to the\nfarmer. Furthermore,\
    \ no prediction mechanisms were employed in [2] towards improving production.\n\
    Moreover, limited contribution was provided in [3–5] regarding energy saving and\
    \ link layer IoT\ntechnologies in farm management information systems, while the\
    \ data-driven agricultural model\nproposed in [6] did not discuss data security\
    \ issues. In contrast to previous studies, the contribution\nof this paper lies\
    \ upon the presentation of a detailed architectural model for an advanced smart\n\
    farming monitoring system by using UAVs and taking into consideration energy-saving\
    \ and security\nrequirements. This architectural model engages novel IoT technologies\
    \ [10] and Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSNs) capabilities to provide a sufﬁcient\
    \ view of precision agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe proposed architecture enables\
    \ a combination of modern remote sensing techniques such as UAV\ntracking, Global\
    \ Positioning System (GPS) for location detection, Geographic Information Systems\n\
    (GIS), real-time monitoring with different types of sensors and intelligent input\
    \ control systems. These\ntechnologies have already been tested in various agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds in different countries for the\ncultivation of rice, wheat, tomatoes,\
    \ vegetables, potatoes, ornamental ﬂowers, chilly, cacao, pepper,\ncorn, olives,\
    \ apples, lemons, grape and others. By incorporating new technologies into agricultural\n\
    production and by using modern EO techniques growers will be able to manage their\
    \ crops at a\ndifferent and more advanced kind of level in detail that was not\
    \ possible a few years ago. This\npaper is an extension of our work in [11]. Towards\
    \ enhancing contribution a use case study is also\npresented regarding an ongoing\
    \ research project known as Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture\nSurveillance(DIAS).\
    \ The DIAS architectural model is based on the proposed paradigm.\nThis paper\
    \ is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the proposed smart\
    \ farming\nmonitoring system architecture. In Section 3, the sensor layer is introduced,\
    \ followed by the network\nlayer and its suitable protocols and technologies regarding\
    \ communication, routing, encapsulation\ntechniques and interoperability mechanisms\
    \ in Section 4. Section 5 is focused on the management\nlayer and the provided\
    \ services of the proposed monitoring system, while Section 6 focuses on IoT\n\
    agricultural applications. Section 7 deals with energy-saving technologies and\
    \ security mechanisms\nthat can be implemented in cooperation with networking\
    \ technologies of the system. The use case\nstudy of the DIAS architecture is\
    \ presented in Section 8. Existing challenges are mentioned and\ndiscussed in\
    \ Section 9. Finally, Section 10 concludes this study.\n2. The Architecture of\
    \ a Smart Farming Monitoring System\nA precision agriculture monitoring system\
    \ consists mainly of the sensing agricultural parameters,\nthe identiﬁcation of\
    \ sensing location and data gathering, the routing of data from crop ﬁeld to\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 348\n3 of 25\ncontrol station for decision making, the actuation\
    \ and control decision based on sensed data and the\nvisualization of results\
    \ to the grower through an application. The architectural design of our model\n\
    follows the ISO/IEC 7498-1 standard or else known as the OSI Model [12], proposing\
    \ a communication\nsystem into seven abstraction layers. However, due the employment\
    \ of IoT technologies and artiﬁcial\nintelligence capabilities the basic agricultural\
    \ layers are deﬁned as presented in Figure 1:\nFigure 1. Remote Sensing System\
    \ Architecture.\n•\nThe Sensor Layer, referring to the Physical Layer of the OSI\
    \ Model, includes all kinds of\ncrops sensors and smart objects for data collection\
    \ and monitoring. Sensors can be placed\nunder ground(in the soil), on the crops\
    \ or on UAVs [6]. Underground sensors are especially\nmanufactured to be water\
    \ resistant and usually refer to measurements of moisture, pH and soil\nchemical\
    \ properties such as sulfur. UAV sensors measure environmental parameters such\
    \ as\nhumidity, temperature, wind speed, luminosity or solar radiation. However,\
    \ the most popular\nkind of sensors to be placed on UAVs are thermal cameras.\
    \ Thermal drones which use vision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n4 of 25\nimaging\
    \ cameras have so many positive uses by detecting heat coming from almost all\
    \ objects\nand materials turning them into images and video.\n•\nThe Link Layer,\
    \ referring to the Data Link Layer of the OSI Model, constitutes of all available\n\
    networking and routing technologies between sensors for information exchange.\
    \ To deploy\nefﬁcient crop and ﬁeld management the IoT platform uses Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks (WSNs).\nThe use of WSN in smart farming systems provides immediate\
    \ monitoring and optimization of\ncrop quality, while offering a potential for\
    \ large area surveillance with high sampling densities.\nThe constant monitoring\
    \ of a great number of environmental parameters by distributed sensor\nnodes along\
    \ the ﬁeld help the grower supervise and maintain optimal conditions to achieve\n\
    maximum productivity with remarkable energy savings.\n•\nThe Encapsulation Layer,\
    \ referring to the Network Layer of the OSI Model, focuses on the\nestablishment\
    \ of smart sensor connection to the IPv6-based internet. This layer consists of\n\
    IoT networking encapsulation techniques and routing protocols to transform the\
    \ regular WSN\nnetwork trafﬁc into smart information. In other words, the technologies\
    \ of this layer enable the\ncultivated ﬁeld sensory data to be encapsulated in\
    \ IPv6 routing packets and be forwarded to the\naccording network server.\n•\n\
    The Middleware Layer, referring to the Transport Layer of the OSI Model, uses\
    \ different application\nlevel transport protocols in order to forward the data\
    \ generated from IoT sensor devices based on\ndifferent paradigms. It also provides\
    \ interfaces that enable device communication for management\nor actuation purposes.\
    \ This layer facilitates the desired interoperability due to the existence of\n\
    diverse standards, which are endorsed by different entities.\n•\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, referring to the Session and Presentation Layers of the OSI Model,\n\
    is situated between the Middleware Layer and the Management Layer. This layer\
    \ is responsible\nfor gathering the raw data coming from the devices or other\
    \ external services, curate, harmonize\nand possibly aggregate them, so that they\
    \ can be published as context information, or supplied\nto upstream data processing\
    \ algorithms or analytics. In addition, this layer is also capable of\nsending\
    \ actuation commands to the Middleware Layer. Finally, the Conﬁguration Layer\
    \ may\nalso be capable of gathering data from other data sources, such as agricultural\
    \ machinery or\npublic geo-services.\n•\nThe Management Layer involves the processing\
    \ and analysis of the collected data. In this layer\nthe most efﬁcient data management\
    \ and data mining techniques are adopted to obtain accurate\npredictions and support\
    \ regarding ﬁeld operations such as optimized pesticide application,\ndisease\
    \ detection, efﬁcient irrigation management. Data processing is supported by Decision\n\
    Support Systems (DSS) that take care of the overall management of available collected\
    \ information\nfrom the ﬁelds towards increasing productivity, optimizing crop\
    \ yield, maintaining quality\nand saving resources.\nIt is well known that farmers\
    \ suffer great economic losses due to\nincorrect weather forecasting or incorrect\
    \ irrigation methods. Data analysis is the most important\ncomponent of IoT agricultural\
    \ systems resulting in efﬁcient pesticide use and protection against\ndiseases.\
    \ This layer can be considered to be an additional layer regarding the OSI Model\
    \ enabling\nartiﬁcial intelligence advancements to the overall system.\n•\nThe\
    \ Application Layer, referring to the Application Layer of the OSI Model, includes\
    \ all\nsuitable application module interfaces for implementing fertilizer and\
    \ irrigation control, disease\nand animal detection, alerts regarding the cultivation\
    \ process and visualization of statistical\ndata. This layer enables the farmer\
    \ to monitor and manage his ﬁelds in a user-friendly way.\nData visualization\
    \ techniques such as graphs, heatmaps, orthomosaics, and three-dimensional\nmodels\
    \ are employed, among others, to allow easy and intuitive representation of the\
    \ knowledge\nacquired from the ﬁeld monitoring. The farmer can inspect the results\
    \ produced by the services\nof the system and take action accordingly.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 348\n5 of 25\nEnergy-saving mechanisms and data privacy and security\
    \ techniques are also considered to be\nvery important in the context of Smart\
    \ farming and should be applied vertically in all the layers of\nthe architecture.\
    \ To support the efﬁciency and effectiveness of a smart farming monitoring system\n\
    energy consumption should be kept under control. Due to the limited battery life\
    \ and constrained\nresources of sensor nodes, energy-saving techniques must be\
    \ applied across the sensor and network\nlayer accordingly. Energy-saving techniques\
    \ deal with the active and inactive operational time\nin each sensor node, the\
    \ scheduling of information transmission and the routing process of data\npackets.\
    \ Moreover, security mechanisms are vital for maintaining the privacy of the collected\
    \ data and\nsafeguarding farmers’ personal information exchange.\n3. The Sensor\
    \ Layer\nThe Sensor Layer is in charge of acquiring the data of the different\
    \ climatic and soil variables\ninvolved in the growth and production of the crops.\
    \ Data can be acquired either by ground sensors,\nlocated above or inside the\
    \ soil, or by UAV sensors involving embedded cameras, location and other\nsensors.\
    \ The Sensor Layer constitutes the cradle of modern EO approaches towards optimizing\n\
    decision support in remote sensing monitoring systems. EO monitoring of cultivation\
    \ areas is\nhighly enhanced using autonomous UAVs. Popular EO techniques include\
    \ satellite and radar-based\ntechnologies [13] towards estimating basic biophysical\
    \ parameters in the ﬁelds, such as Leaf Area\nIndex (LAI), crop height and water\
    \ requirements [14,15]. According to [16] radar-based technologies\nare used to\
    \ enable the estimation of soil moisture spatial variability and can efﬁciently\
    \ estimate LAI.\nHowever, EO can achieve sturdy higher spatial resolutions only\
    \ with calibration against accurate\nground truth instruments that measure at\
    \ within ﬁeld scale resolutions. UAVs deploy EO via using\nphotogrammetry techniques\
    \ enabling the generation of three-dimensional digital surface models of the\n\
    ﬁelds. In particular, autonomous, manual or GPS-based image acquisition, ortho-image\
    \ generation and\nimage triangulation and geo-referencing based on navigation\
    \ sensors are employed. More information\nregarding these methods is provided\
    \ in Sections 5 and 8.2. In the Sensor Layer each sensor sends the\nacquired data\
    \ in the cloud through a WSN. The WSN is made up of sensor nodes that operate\
    \ under a\nmesh or point-to-point topology, a coordinator node and a gateway.\
    \ Each node in such a network is\nconnected to one or more sensors [17]. In precision\
    \ agriculture the most important types of sensors for\nmeasuring the different\
    \ types of corps attributes are:\n•\nOptical Sensors/UAV Sensors: Optical sensors\
    \ are usually embedded in UAVs and use light\nreﬂection information to measure\
    \ the varying properties of soil and vegetation. In that case,\nthe sensors acquire\
    \ image data, which are further analyzed with photogrammetry techniques.\nObject\
    \ detectors and pattern recognition form the basic building block for extracting\
    \ information\nfrom the images. Such information may involve the vegetation and\
    \ soil color, the moisture\ncontent and temperature of soil and vegetation, the\
    \ position, height, size and shape of vegetation\nalong with the level of chlorophyll.\
    \ In this category we ﬁnd visible light sensors, multispectral\nsensors, hyperspectral\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors.\n•\nElectrochemical Sensors/Ground Sensors: These\
    \ types of sensors acquire data regarding the\nnutrient contents of soil and its\
    \ associated pH. Electrodes in these sensors work by detecting\nspeciﬁc ions in\
    \ the soil. Different families of electrochemical sensors can be recognized depending\n\
    on the electrical magnitude used for transduction of the recognition event: potentiometric,\
    \ which\nindicates change of membrane potential; conductometric, which indicates\
    \ change of conductance;\nimpedimetric, which indicates change of impedance; and\
    \ voltammetric or amperometric, which\nindicates change of current for an electrochemical\
    \ reaction with the applied voltage in the ﬁrst\ncase, or with time at a ﬁxed\
    \ applied potential in the latter.\n•\nLocation Sensors/UAV Sensors: Location\
    \ sensors are usually embedded in UAVs and provide\nspatial information regarding\
    \ the positioning of an element. These types of sensors use signals\nfrom GPS\
    \ satellites to determine latitude, longitude, and altitude to within feet. Three\
    \ satellites\nminimum are required to triangulate a position. Precise positioning\
    \ is the cornerstone of precision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n6 of 25\nagriculture.\
    \ GPS integrated circuits such as the NJR NJG1157PCD-TE1 are a good example of\n\
    location sensors.\n•\nWeather Stations/Ground Sensors: Weather stations are free-standing\
    \ units situated at different\nlocations throughout the cultivating ﬁelds. These\
    \ stations measure various data for precision\nagriculture such as airﬂow, seasonal\
    \ rainfall, speed of wind, humidity level, direction of wind,\natmospheric pressure\
    \ and solar radiation, etc. Weather stations are an important component\nof EO\
    \ technologies since they can provide daily agro-meteorological information regarding\
    \ the\ncultivating ﬁelds.\nSummarizing the above, Table 1 presents the most frequently\
    \ acquired data by sensors in the\nagricultural domain. A sensor node consists\
    \ of a radio transceiver with an internal antenna or a\nconnection to an external\
    \ antenna, a micro-controller, an electronic circuit for interfacing with the\n\
    sensors and an energy source, usually a battery or a built-in energy harvested\
    \ form. There are numerous\ncommercial models of micro-controllers to be used\
    \ in precision agriculture applications. The most\npopular ones are the Arduino,\
    \ the Raspberry Pi, the Atmega328 and the LPC2148 boards. Accordingly,\ncommonly\
    \ used wireless communication modules used are the XBee module, the WSN802G module\n\
    and the NRF24L01 module. A sensor node can vary in size and cost, depending on\
    \ the complexity\nof its capabilities. Size and cost constraints result in corresponding\
    \ limitations on resources such as\nenergy, memory, computing speed, and bandwidth\
    \ of communications. The types of sensors that are\nmostly used in Smart farming\
    \ monitoring systems are summarized in Table 2.\nTable 1. Precision agriculture\

    In precision agriculture WSN communication protocols and technologies are used\
    \ to support\nthe connection between sensor nodes in the network and to provide\
    \ a channel for communication\nbetween the coordinator node and the gateway. According\
    \ to the type of application, such as precision\nfarming, ﬁeld irrigation management\
    \ or greenhouse crop management, the sensor network topology\nand communication\
    \ demands may differ. Hardware and software characteristics may also affect\n\
    the choice of communication technology to be used between the nodes. Each node\
    \ uses a routing\nprotocol [18] in the view of transferring the data collected\
    \ to the coordinator node.\nBased on many experimental studies on agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, there is not an ideal combination of a\nspeciﬁc communication technology\
    \ and a routing protocol. Discovering and keeping up with routes in\nWSNs is a\
    \ quite demanding task since energy restrictions and alterations in node status,\
    \ such as failure\nmay cause sudden changes in the network topology. It is a fact\
    \ that the wireless routing solution for\nagriculture applications should be highly\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, scalable, and autonomous. Up until now\nrouting tactics proposed\
    \ in the literature for WSNs employ speciﬁc methods such as data aggregation,\n\
    clustering, different node role assignment and data-centric methods.\nThe basic\
    \ goal is to build each smart monitoring system upon application appropriate networking\n\
    technologies to operate efﬁciently with minimum energy consumption. Once the coordinator\
    \ node\nobtains the data it forwards the ﬂow of information to the gateway to\
    \ reach the main server, where\nthe database is located. However, in some cases\
    \ the coordinator node can be substituted by a base\nstation to obtain the collected\
    \ data using a Wi-Fi connection as presented in [2], or another cellular\ncommunication\
    \ technology.\n4.1.1. Precision Agriculture Communication Protocols\nThere is\
    \ a wide variety of networking technologies suitable for the deployment of smart\
    \ farming\napplications. The most popular are the following:\n•\nThe IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard is a widely used networking technology in precision agriculture and\n\
    deﬁnes the physical layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) technique in Low-Rate\
    \ Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (LR-WPANs).\n•\nZigBee is another suitable\
    \ technology for short range radio communication in the ﬁelds using\nlow-power\
    \ devices capable of transmitting data over long distances using intermediate\
    \ stations.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n8 of 25\n•\nLoRa is a type of wireless\
    \ conﬁguration that has been created to achieve long-range connections\nfor Low-power\
    \ Wide Area Networks (LPWANs).\nLoRAWAN is a protocol for managing\ncommunication\
    \ between LPWAN gateways and nodes.\n•\nBluetooth Low Energy is a global personal\
    \ area network protocol built for transmitting small\ndata pieces infrequently\
    \ at low rates with signiﬁcantly low power consumption per bit.\n•\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identiﬁcation) is a different technology that uses radio signals to\
    \ monitor\nand identify in real time objects without requiring line-of-sight communication.\
    \ An RFID\nsystem includes a reader, a tag, and a host and is presented as ideal\
    \ for ﬁeld monitoring in\nmultiple studies.\nMoreover, the communication between\
    \ sensor nodes and a base station can be supported by:\n•\nthe Wi-Fi protocol,\
    \ based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. This standard speciﬁes the set of media\n\
    access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless\
    \ local area\nnetwork (WLAN) Wi-Fi computer communication in various frequencies.\n\
    •\nthe GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), a standard developed by\
    \ the European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe the\
    \ protocols for second-generation\n(2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile\
    \ devices such as mobile phones and tablets.\n•\nthe GPRS (General Packet Radio\
    \ Service) technology standard that provides rapid sending and\nreceiving of data\
    \ over the GSM mobile networks based on packet switching, a well-known\nnetwork\
    \ transmission process.\n•\nthe 2G, 3G and 4G (LTE) are respectively the 2nd,\
    \ 3rd and 4th generation of GSM technology\naiming at higher speeds.\nTable 3\

    \ Agriculture Routing Protocols\nData routing algorithms play an important role\
    \ in WSNs by establishing the path of\ncommunication for data exchange between\
    \ sensor nodes and base stations on a network. A variety\nof routing techniques\
    \ have been proposed until now, aiming to achieve higher performance with\nminimal\
    \ power consumption. IoT and WSN routing protocols can be categorized according\
    \ to network\nstructure and the way information will be disseminated through the\
    \ network. A routing protocol can\nbelong to more than one category, aiming to\
    \ satisfy as many performance metrics as possible.\nAccording to the way by which\
    \ routing decisions are made proactive and reactive routing\ntechniques can be\
    \ used. Proactive routing (or table-driven) supports the periodic renewal and\n\
    updating of the routes and destinations that are formed between the nodes throughout\
    \ the network.\nOn the other hand, reactive routing (or on demand) includes discovering\
    \ routes on demand based\non the transmission of route request packets. The downside\
    \ to reactive protocols is their latency,\nsince transmissions over unknown or\
    \ expired routes face delays, for which either the application or\nthe routing\
    \ protocol must account by buffering or dropping data.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n9 of 25\nFurthermore, according to WSN structure, routing algorithms can\
    \ depend on neighbor nodes to\nbroadcast the collected information. Another popular\
    \ technique is based on dividing the network into\nclusters. Each cluster depends\
    \ on a cluster head node to manage the routing of information between\nother clusters\
    \ or base stations. Hierarchical routing is the most popular routing method in\
    \ smart\nfarming monitoring systems and soil parameter monitoring [23,24]. Multi-path\
    \ routing protocols\ncan also be used to implement a smart farm monitoring system\
    \ to balance the data transfer load and\nconserved energy. Table 4 presents characteristic\
    \ examples of routing protocols adopted in smart\nfarming systems according to\

    \ monitoring applications are based on machine to\nmachine (M2M) communication\
    \ support regarding real-time data transmission. There is a variety\nof communication\
    \ patterns to be used so that the terminal can receive the information necessary\
    \ to\nmonitor the production. WSN technologies, enhanced by the IoT paradigm,\
    \ enable smart sensor\ncommunication and connection to the IPv6-based internet,\
    \ by addressing the agricultural sensors\nwith IPv6 long addresses that can ﬁt\
    \ in lightweight IoT data link frames. IoT can immensely improve\nthe autonomous\
    \ capabilities of resourced-constrained nodes in a Low-power and Lossy Network\n\
    (LLN). An agricultural WSN is a LLN. In such a network, some of the nodes may\
    \ have a direct\nInternet connection to send and receive messages from the Internet.\
    \ However, other nodes from the\nsame network, may lack that kind of ability due\
    \ to hardware limitations, and require the use of the\nInternet-connected nodes\
    \ to access external services. Data exchange in a local context is also possible\n\
    without the necessity of transmitting data to the Internet. The task of discovering\
    \ the routes and\nallowing data messages to be transmitted among agricultural\
    \ sensor nodes is performed by the routing\nprotocol. Due to this fact, in such\
    \ networks, network performance is strongly related to how the\nrouting protocols\
    \ use the limited hardware resources of the network device.\n•\nThe 6LoWPAN [7,26]\
    \ is the most popular network encapsulation protocol for precision agriculture\n\
    applications. It refers to the transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over Low-Power\
    \ Wireless\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n10 of 25\nPersonal Area Networks. In a\
    \ smart farming monitoring system, it is used by sensor devices that\nare compatible\
    \ with the IEEE802.15.4 standard for WSNs. 6LoWPAN efﬁciently encapsulates\nIPv6\
    \ long headers in IEEE 802.15.4 small data frames for information exchange between\
    \ sensor\nnodes. The advantages of this protocol are that it uses a special header\
    \ compression method and\na fragmentation process to reduce the transmission overhead\
    \ [10].\n•\nThe IPv6 over LoRa [27] implementation enables the transmission of\
    \ IPv6 protocol packets over\nLoRa links. If LoRaWAN is chosen for sensor node\
    \ communication in a smart farming monitoring\nsystem, LoRa is the MAC protocol\
    \ responsible for establishing communication between the\nLoRa gateway and the\
    \ LoRa sensor end devices. In an agriculture monitoring system, the IPv6\nadaptation\
    \ enables the deployment of the IoT paradigm as a separate architectural layer.\
    \ The basic\naim of this layer is to manage header compression and packet fragmentation\
    \ to deal with the\nrequirements of LoRa modulation in the physical layer.\n•\n\
    The IPv6 over 802.11ah [10] or Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) is a low-power/low-rate protocol\
    \ able to support\nnumerous sensor node devices on a single base station. This\
    \ technology can be used for precision\nagriculture by enabling wireless base\
    \ stations in the ﬁeld to transmit data while also being energy\nconservative.\
    \ Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) uses special characteristics of the 6LoWPAN technology for\n\
    effective transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over IEEE 802.11ah wireless networks.\n\
    •\nRPL (IPv6 Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks) [26] is the most popular\
    \ IoT routing\nprotocol based on the distance vector routing technique. It is\
    \ a proactive protocol that constructs\na speciﬁc graph able to direct all trafﬁc\
    \ towards the sink node. RPL is the ideal routing protocol\nfor agricultural LLNs,\
    \ since it can quickly create network routes between sensor nodes in the\nﬁeld,\
    \ share routing knowledge and adapt the topology in an efﬁcient way. It is also\
    \ efﬁcient for\nmulti-hop, many-to-one and one-to-one communication.\n•\nLOADng-IoT\
    \ is another IoT routing protocol, proposed in [28] as an enhancement for reactive\n\
    protocol LOADng, which is considered to be the best current solution for LLNs.\
    \ LOADng-IoT is\nable to boost the process of route discovery, reduce the overhead\
    \ of control messages, and improve\nthe network′s quality-of-service(QoS). In\
    \ a smart farm monitoring system, this protocol will allow\nsensor nodes without\
    \ an Internet connection to forward their data packets to external Internet\n\
    services with much greater reliability and lower latency.\n4.3. The Middleware\
    \ Layer\nThe Middleware Layer is responsible for establishing and controlling\
    \ the association between\nIoT sensor devices. More speciﬁcally, the services\
    \ of this layer include smart device management by\nthe use of different transport\
    \ protocols to forward the generated data from the involved IoT devices.\nMost\
    \ of these transport standards use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or\
    \ the User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP) for forwarding information. There is a wide\
    \ variety of data protocols [29] that belong\nto this layer towards developing\
    \ an efﬁcient managing platform for smart ﬁeld devices. However,\nchoosing the\
    \ most appropriate device management technology depends on software and hardware\n\
    speciﬁcations, network and technology architecture and communication standards\
    \ being used in the\naccording system to achieve maximum and efﬁcient performance.\
    \ In the view of using different kind of\nsmart entities in an agriculture monitoring\
    \ system, the services of this architectural layer facilitate the\ndesired interoperability\
    \ of the technologies introduced. All collected data will be stored on a remote\n\
    server and transmitted to the client machine through Application Programming Interfaces\
    \ (APIs) that\nprovide web services for third-party users. APIs enable device\
    \ communication in an application level\nfor different kinds of purposes and are\
    \ based on different architectures to transfer data from the server\nto the client.\n\
    •\nThe MQTT-SN (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport For Sensor Networks) is a\
    \ messaging\nprotocol that facilitates device data collection and communication\
    \ with servers using brokers.\nA broker is a network entity which arranges transactions\
    \ between other network entities. By using\nthe MQTT protocol, a precision agriculture\
    \ monitoring system can enable smart sensor devices to\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n11 of 25\npublish messages to a broker and/or subscribe to a broker in\
    \ order to receive certain messages.\nThe exchanged messages will be organized\
    \ by topics that act as a system for dispatching messages\nto subscribers.\n•\n\
    The CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is another popular protocol for IoT\
    \ device\ndata management. CoAP is based on a request/response pattern of communication\
    \ allowing\nconstrained devices to have web service functionalities. It is an\
    \ HTTP-like web transfer protocol\nwith the ability to extend the Representational\
    \ State Transfer (REST) architecture to Low-Power\nWireless Personal Area Networks\
    \ (LoWPANs). REST is an architectural style for providing\nstandards between computer\
    \ systems on the web, while distinguishing the concerns of client\nand server.\n\
    •\nThe XMPP-IoT (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open technology\
    \ for real-time\ncommunication based on XML messages between connected devices\
    \ and the available server.\nXMPP can efﬁciently power instant messaging, collaboration\
    \ and content syndication in a smart\nfarm monitoring system between all network\
    \ entities.\n•\nDevice and asset management in a precision agriculture monitoring\
    \ system can also be\nimplemented using the Mihini [30] software.\nMihini is an\
    \ open-source project by Eclipse\nTechnology that enables communication between\
    \ an M2M server and the applications running\non an embedded gateway. M3DA is\
    \ the protocol used for the transport of M2M data. M3DA can\nallow user applications\
    \ to exchange typed data/commands back and forth with an M2M server,\nin a way\
    \ that optimizes the use of bandwidth.\n•\nThe OMA SpecWorks’s Lightweight M2M\
    \ [31] is another device management protocol for M2M\nor IoT devices. It can be\
    \ used in a smart farming information system to efﬁciently transfer\nservice data\
    \ from the network to resource-constrained devices. In contrast to traditional\
    \ M2M\nstandards in which a device usually needs to keep up multiple stacks of\
    \ technologies, protocols\nand security services, the LwM2M scheme allows the\
    \ existence of one stack of technology for\ndevice management, not only on the\
    \ level of the device itself, but also on the application level.\nIn addition,\
    \ LwM2M is based on protocol and security standards from the Internet Engineering\n\
    Task Force (IETF).\n•\nThe ONEM2M [32] technical speciﬁcation standards are an\
    \ upcoming solution for device and\nasset management in precision agriculture.\
    \ ONEM2M is a middleware IoT platform that provides\nfunctions and APIs for different\
    \ service domains dealing with interoperability challenges. There\nare commercial\
    \ and open-source implementations of this technology.\n•\nA popular queuing protocol\
    \ for enabling server connection in IoT is the AMQP (Advanced\nMessage Queuing\
    \ Protocol). This open standard protocol can facilitate message orientation,\n\
    queuing, routing, reliability and security in precision agriculture applications.\n\
    •\nLast but not least, the DDS (Data-Distribution Service) [33] is the ﬁrst open\
    \ international M2M\nstandard directly addressing publish-subscribe communications\
    \ for real-time and embedded\nsystems. This protocol has the advantage of providing\
    \ fast data, event, and command exchange\namong the IoT sensor nodes in a precision\
    \ agriculture monitoring system.\n4.4. The Conﬁguration Layer\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer deals with protocols running on top of the IoT monitoring platform\nallowing\
    \ the exchange of data speciﬁed by its context regarding what is described, what\
    \ was measured,\nwhen, where, by what, the time of validity, ownership, and others.\
    \ The main objective of this layer\nis to curate, harmonize and aggregate the\
    \ collected raw data, so that it can be published as context\ninformation, or\
    \ supplied to upstream data processing algorithms or analytics. It is also capable\
    \ of\nsending operational commands to the Middleware Layer. Context information\
    \ is a term widely used\nin IoT research and characterizes data that may come\
    \ from existing systems, users, through mobile\napplications, IoT smart devices,\
    \ agricultural machinery or public geo-services. The Conﬁguration layer\nuses\
    \ an IoT broker to guarantee a common interpretation of information produced by\
    \ heterogeneous\ndata sources that typically employ different data formats and\
    \ ontologies, and therefore are unable to\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n12 of 25\n\
    directly share information among them. An IoT broker enables the forwarding of\
    \ lower-level device\ninformation to higher-level Thing Information.\n•\nRegarding\
    \ precision agriculture applications, a popular context broker is implemented\
    \ by the\nFIWARE NGSI technology, named Orion Context Broker. FIWARE is a framework\
    \ of open-source\nplatform components towards the deployment of the IoT paradigm.\
    \ FIWARE NGSI is the FIWARE\nversion of the OMA NGSI, an API based on HTTP that\
    \ enables the integration of components\nand provides the basis for the interoperability\
    \ and portability of IoT-enabled Smart Agriculture\napplications [34]. NGSI is\
    \ an information model developed by OMA SpecWorks to manage\ncontext information\
    \ with a meta-model based on entities, attributes and metadata. This protocol\n\
    manages data concerning context entities, such as the lifetime and quality of\
    \ information.\n•\nThe implementation of a smart farming monitoring system is\
    \ greatly depended upon geo-services,\nlocation detection tools and mapping technologies.\
    \ In such systems, the exchange of geographical\ninformation should be effortlessly\
    \ accomplished between the involved network entities across\nthe web. The Open\
    \ Geospatial Consortium-Web Feature Service (OGC-WFS) [35] constitutes a\ndesirable\
    \ asset in formulating geographic information and offering direct ﬁne-grained\
    \ access\nat feature property level of the data to IoT sensor nodes in precision\
    \ agriculture applications.\nOGC offers various standards that can ease the way\
    \ location data is exchanged and stored in\na smart farming system that is based\
    \ on drone monitoring. Furthermore, the OpenGIS Web\nMap Service Interface Standard\
    \ (WMS) [35] can be efﬁciently used by UAVs, since it provides a\nsimple HTTP\
    \ interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed\n\
    geospatial databases.\n5. The Management Layer\nIn a smart farming monitoring\
    \ system, the basic component of intelligence is considered to be the\nstudy and\
    \ ﬁltering of the collected data. The use of EO techniques enable the advance\
    \ of cultivation\nprocedures and increase productivity by providing the base layer\
    \ for spatial information analysis and\nmonitoring of agricultural activities.\
    \ A large percentage of smart agriculture applications are based\non simulators,\
    \ commercial programs and speciﬁc programming languages for implementing and\n\
    controlling the data system. The Management layer uses modern software tools to\
    \ efﬁciently satisfy\nmultiple tasks, presented in Table 5.\nInformation management\
    \ is deployed so the farmer can consult, record and modify the\ninformation collected\
    \ by the sensors in tables, statistical graphs and interactive maps. In addition,\n\
    it can download daily, monthly and annual reports of historical data. However,\
    \ the farmer can\nmainly see the current data of the monitored variables of one\
    \ or all the WSN nodes and consult the\nhistory. The interaction with the network\
    \ and services layer is achieved using an intermediate layer of\nmanagement logic\
    \ [36]. WSN data will be stored in an online database [37].\nThe system also enables\
    \ Big Data analytics in agriculture monitoring by using tools such as\nthe Apache\
    \ Hadoop software and various Big Data hardware platforms [38] as possible resources.\n\
    Big Data refers to information assets characterized by such a high volume, velocity\
    \ and variety\nable to require speciﬁc technology and analytical methods for its\
    \ transformation into value [39].\nIn precision agriculture smart applications,\
    \ the collected data are recorded in a speciﬁc format,\nto discover patterns,\
    \ correct errors, eliminate duplicate and inconsistencies and to solve noise problems.\n\
    Big Data technologies are playing an essential role in modern farming systems,\
    \ since predictive insights\nare provided regarding optimizing the quality of\
    \ the crop, minimizing environmental impact, reducing\ncosts, increasing proﬁt\
    \ and generally optimizing production efﬁciency. In addition, Big Data enable\
    \ the\nmanagement of real-time operational decisions and the redesign of business\
    \ processes for advancing\nthe food supply chain.\nFurthermore, the proposed architectural\
    \ scheme promotes various data processing techniques that\nupgrade the impact\
    \ of EO technologies in agriculture. EO by satellite leads to the acquisition\
    \ of regular\nor spatially continuous data regarding large areas. It provides\
    \ essential information on the functioning\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n13 of 25\n\
    of ﬁelds and on the causes of environmental change. UAVs enable EO by using photogrammetry\n\
    techniques to extract three-dimensional digital surface models of the ﬁeld, as\
    \ well as orthophotographs.\nOne popular algorithm for this purpose is Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) [40]. An orthophotograph\ncan be used to create a realistic\
    \ map of the ﬁelds by measuring true distances and providing to the\nfarmer a\
    \ clearer helpful view from the sky. Based on photographs, digital image processing\
    \ tools,\nsuch as Pix4Dmapper can calculate various vegetation indices that can\
    \ lead to conclusions, either\non each photograph individually or after the production\
    \ of orthophotos regarding the crops’ state.\nVegetation indices are mathematical\
    \ quantitative combinations of the absorption and scattering of\nplant in different\
    \ bands of the electromagnetic spectrum [41]. Calculating vegetation indices will\
    \ help\nto identify useful crop characteristics concerning important biological\
    \ and physical parameters of the\nvegetation. The best-known vegetation index\
    \ is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),\nwhich is the evolution\
    \ of the vegetation index ratio and is calculated by the visible and near infrared\n\
    light reﬂected from the vegetation.\nLast but not least, the smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system also performs data mining processes\nbased on tools such as\
    \ the Apache Mahout Framework so as to identify and discover hidden patterns\n\
    in the collected data, once they are processed, in the form of reviews. In addition,\
    \ Machine Learning\ntechniques will be used in the smart monitoring platform in\
    \ order to estimate the extracted parameters\nof the crops’ growth rate and also\
    \ help to identify objects or animals trough the collected images by\nusing Object-Based\
    \ Image Analysis (OBIA) [42]. Moreover, new machine learning models—algorithms\n\
    focused on data classiﬁcation [43,44]—can be used to minimize the size of redundant\
    \ data and fasten\nthe analysis.\nTable 5. Smart farming monitoring system services.\n\

    \ monitoring system architecture, the farmer can\ninteract with the IoT applications\
    \ of the system to remotely manage the cultivation process.\nSuch applications\
    \ may concern any aspect of the agricultural ﬁeld ranging from planting and irrigation\n\
    processes to plant protection and harvesting methods [45]. The applications that\
    \ can be adopted may\ninvolve the fertilizer application, the weed mapping, the\
    \ spraying process, the irrigation of the ﬁeld\nand the alert system.\nThe Variable\
    \ Rate Fertilizer (VRF) application has as a target to optimize the usage of nutrients\
    \ by\ndeﬁning the amount of fertilizer applied based on the health of the plant.\
    \ Variable rate fertilizer in\nprecision agriculture is an area of technology\
    \ that focuses on the automated application of fertilizer to\na given landscape.\
    \ The way in which the materials are applied is based on data that is collected\
    \ by\nsensors, maps, and GPS. VRF applications bring several beneﬁts related to\
    \ savings on fertilizers and\nchemicals, potential yield increase and environmental\
    \ protection. In the same context is the Variable\nSpraying application. These\
    \ types of applications implement controllers that turn the herbicide\nsprayers\
    \ on and off. Usually variable spraying applications take into consideration information\n\
    coming from the weed mapping tools such as the weed locations. In that case the\
    \ appropriate volume\nof herbicide is estimated and applied in the ﬁeld based\
    \ on the weed intensity.\nThe Weed Mapping application focuses on the visualization\
    \ of the weed occurrences within\na certain crop ﬁeld with the help of mappings.\
    \ The GPS receiver with an aerial vehicle generates\nmaps which show the weed\
    \ occurrences. These weed maps can be combined with fertilizer maps\nand yield\
    \ maps. The IoT-based irrigation system use a micro-controller that serves as\
    \ information\ngateway receiving real-time information from soil moisture and\
    \ temperature sensors placed on the\nﬁelds. Generally, a moisture/temperature\
    \ threshold is speciﬁed based on which the micro-controller\nautomatically switches\
    \ on the water pump. The micro-controller also has servo motors to ensure that\n\
    the area is uniformly irrigated. The entire system can be managed remotely by\
    \ the end-user through\nthe dedicated application.\nAlert/ notiﬁcation applications\
    \ are also very popular in IoT-based precision agriculture. Producers\nand agriculture\
    \ companies implement IoT solutions for instantly tracking their crop ﬁelds. In\
    \ this case,\nthe data coming from IoT devices is processed and transformed into\
    \ knowledge properly visualized\nfor offering information regarding the health\
    \ of the vegetation and the soil, the behavior patterns of\nthe plants, detect\
    \ signs of disease on time, identify insects and harmful animals and instantly\
    \ alert\nproducers about potential difﬁculties. This type of applications serves\
    \ for storing and analyzing data,\nproviding producers with relevant recommendations.\n\
    The aforementioned applications aim at the efﬁcient ﬁeld and crop management to:\n\
    •\nincrease production efﬁciency\n•\nimprove product quality\n•\nprovide more\
    \ efﬁcient use of chemicals in cultivation\n•\nmanage pesticide amounts\n•\nreduce\
    \ energy consumption\n•\nprotect the soil\n•\ncontrol water consumption and underground\
    \ water amounts\nThe IoT-based agriculture applications can be implemented for\
    \ an Android or Windows\nsmart-phone, a tablet or as a web application. The applications\
    \ of IoT-based smart farming apart from\nconventional, large farming operations,\
    \ targets also other growing or common trends in agricultural\nsuch as organic\
    \ farming, family farming (complex or small spaces, particular cattle and/or cultures,\n\
    preservation of particular or high quality varieties etc.), and enhance highly\
    \ transparent farming. Our\nprecision agriculture monitoring system can also beneﬁt\
    \ the dry farming technique that encompass\nspeciﬁc agricultural techniques for\
    \ the non-irrigated cultivation of crops. Furthermore, greenhouses\ncan use our\
    \ architectural model to intelligently monitor as well as control the climate,\
    \ eliminating the\nneed for manual intervention.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n\

    \ by low-energy batteries that\nare difﬁcult or impossible to recharge or replace.\
    \ This is considered to be a major disadvantage to\nmaintain a real-time monitoring\
    \ system. Energy-saving techniques is vital to maintain the system’s\nefﬁciency\
    \ in smart farming. This kind of techniques can provide battery life extension\
    \ by reducing the\namount of communication between the nodes and the base station,\
    \ while minimizing the redundant\ndata in the network. Energy preservation techniques\
    \ for precision agriculture systems are presented as\na separate architectural\
    \ level covering the sensing and networking procedures of smart farming.\nIn the\
    \ Sensor layer, the proposed energy-saving approach is an on/off process which\
    \ is based on\nthe selection of a subset of nodes that will remain active for\
    \ a certain period of time, while others remain\ninactive. Following this assumption,\
    \ SWORD (sleep/wake on redundant data) is an energy preserving\nscheme that can\
    \ be used to collect data on soil moisture [19]. The SWORD algorithm performs\
    \ data\ncontrol by removing redundant data so as to minimize energy consumption\
    \ and increase the life of\nsensor nodes in the network.\nIn the Network layer,\
    \ data transmissions and receptions can also be scheduled based on the\nsleep/awake\
    \ periods of sensor nodes at predetermined intervals. For this purpose, A2S, an\
    \ automated\nagricultural precision tracking system can be used [46]. Based on\
    \ this energy-saving technology,\nwhenever the sensing period is set by the application\
    \ server, the sink node keeps the schedule and\nit spreads the sleep order message\
    \ over its network every sensing period. Each time a node receives\nthe sleep\
    \ message, it sets the sleep timer’s end time to the value of the duration ﬁeld\
    \ included in the\nmessage. When the meter time ends, the node detects the environment\
    \ and battery voltage level and\nsends the data to the source. Then, he expects\
    \ the next sleep request message.\nMoreover, another energy-saving scheduling\
    \ technique that can be deployed in the Network layer\ninvolves the use of unmanned\
    \ ﬂying vehicles in an agricultural crop monitoring system. Based on this\nscheme,\
    \ the node on the unmanned ﬂying vehicle wakes the ground nodes to retrieve the\
    \ measured\ndata. To perform this function, a coded radio signal is sent via a\
    \ transmitter to the ground nodes.\nThe nodes are in an inactive state, except\
    \ for a small receiver waiting to receive the trigger signal.\nFurthermore, taking\
    \ advantage of APTEEN hierarchical routing protocol, a time division multiple\n\
    access technique can be implemented as a scheduling method. Based on this technique,\
    \ messages are\nsent to put some nodes in sleep mode so as to avoid packet collisions\
    \ between sensor nodes belonging\nto different clusters. In addition, carrier\
    \ sense multiple access technique is another alternative method,\nwhich is equally\
    \ effective for avoiding collisions.\n7.2. Security Mechanisms\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ monitoring systems involve the exchange of sensitive information regarding\n\
    the cultivation process, the state of crops and personal data of authorized staff.\
    \ It is of great importance\nfor such systems to be protected against cyber-attacks.\
    \ An unauthorized entry of a malicious individual\nin the system may cause great\
    \ damage to the cultivation process or even acquire the farmers personal\ninformation\
    \ [47]. In the pursuit of safeguarding a smart farm monitoring system the conﬁdentiality\n\
    of data should be met. In addition, it is vital to ensure the reliability of the\
    \ data and the ability to\nconﬁrm that a message has not been tampered with, altered\
    \ or changed while on the network. Also,\nthe services of resources offered by\
    \ the network, or by a single sensor node must be available whenever\nrequired\
    \ and ﬁnally to be able to identify the origin of a message received. Basic security\
    \ mechanisms\nare already deployed by the combined IoT technologies in every architectural\
    \ level of the proposed\nsmart monitoring system. However, there are more ways\
    \ to increase the level of security in each\nlayer separately.\nOne popular way\
    \ of providing physical layer security in WSN and IoT systems is cryptography.\n\
    Physical layer security refers to the inner security capabilities of the Sensor\
    \ layer regarding the\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n16 of 25\nrandomness of wireless\
    \ channels, the signal-to-noise ratio gaps or intended jamming. There are\nthree\
    \ kinds of cryptographic methods used in WSNs, the symmetric and asymmetric ones\
    \ and hash\nfunctions. Hash functions are special mathematical functions which\
    \ map a given input to a certain\noutput with a ﬁxed size. Well-known cryptographically\
    \ secure hashes are the Secure Hash Algorithm-2\n(SHA-2) and Advanced Encryption\
    \ Standard (AES) algorithm. In symmetric cryptographic techniques,\na single shared\
    \ key is used between the two communicating nodes both for encryption and decryption.\n\
    This key stays known only to the nodes of the network. On the other hand, in asymmetric\
    \ cryptography,\na private key can be used to decrypt and sign data. A public\
    \ key is also used to encrypt and verify data.\nThe private key needs to be kept\
    \ conﬁdential while the public key can be published freely. Asymmetric\ncryptographic\
    \ techniques may use the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm, the ECC (Elliptical\n\
    Curve Cryptography) algorithm or the pairing technique. Popular frameworks of\
    \ symmetric and\nasymmetric technique can be found in [48].\nRegarding the Link\
    \ layer of our proposed architecture security mechanisms focus against the\ninterception,\
    \ modiﬁcation and fabrication of the exchanged data. Attack detection mechanisms\
    \ can\nbe applied, such as the misbehavior-aware threshold detection scheme for\
    \ LLNs proposed in [49].\nIn addition, secure routing protocols may be used such\
    \ as SAR(Secure aware routing protocol), which is\nbased on on-demand protocol\
    \ such as AODV or DSR and DPRAODV (Detection, Prevention and\nReactiveAODV) [50].\n\
    Middleware security mechanisms deal with unauthorized modiﬁcations that occur\
    \ due to\ntransmission errors (accidental) and require the use of digital signatures.\
    \ Digital signature schemes\nare cryptographic schemes that include key generation\
    \ algorithms, signing algorithms and signature\nverifying algorithms. A digital\
    \ signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the\nmessage\
    \ to attach a code that acts as a signature. The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA),\
    \ developed by\nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology, is one of\
    \ many examples of a signing algorithm.\nAccess control is an important building\
    \ block for the overall security of a precision agriculture\nmonitoring system.\
    \ The IoT requires access control models that apply authorization policies across\n\
    a multitude of smart sensors. In a smart farm monitoring platform, authentication\
    \ is required\nto prevent authorized users from accessing resources in an unauthorized\
    \ manner. For instance,\na worker in the ﬁelds is a legitimate user but does not\
    \ have the access rights as the main administrator\nfarmer. Most importantly,\
    \ access control prevents illegitimate users from gaining access to resources.\n\
    The Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model is a technique that assigns attributes\
    \ to each entity\nin the system. The attributes may refer to either a user or\
    \ a resource and are deﬁned as properties\nof every entity to enable authentication.\
    \ Another paradigm able to provide solid communication in\nthe application layer\
    \ is the Role-Based Access Control model (RBAC) where a user is assigned as\n\
    administrator or ordinary user that predetermines access rights policies. In the\
    \ Application layer,\neach user can be authenticated by the use of passwords or\
    \ a smart key card [51].\n8. Use Case Study: The DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS research\
    \ project stands for Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture Surveillance.\nIt\
    \ is co-funded by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational\
    \ Program\nCompetitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation. University of Western\
    \ Macedonia (UOWM) in\ncooperation with Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative (KSPC)\
    \ aims at developing an integrated\nautomated surveillance system for saffron\
    \ cultivation.\nThis 24 h real-time saffron cultivation\nsurveillance system is\
    \ relied on signal and image collecting and processing, which is derived from\n\
    advanced surveillance, risk identiﬁcation and early warning systems, based on\
    \ integrated sensor\nnetworks, and aerial unmanned vehicles.\n8.1. Saffron Cultivation\n\
    The saffron cultivation is considered to be of extreme importance for the Western\
    \ Macedonia\ncitizens, due to the activity over saffron cultivation by a large\
    \ number of citizens, the limited farming\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n17 of 25\n\
    geography, the unique production process to plant the saffron seeds, and the unique\
    \ production risk\nthat this operation faces. The only kind of saffron that is\
    \ systematically cultivated around the world,\nfor at least ten centuries, is\
    \ the edible saffron or as it known in scientiﬁc (botanical) terminology Crocus\n\
    Sativus Linneaus.\nThe cultivation process includes harvesting the ﬂowers, as\
    \ presented in Figure 2, splitting the\nstigmas and stamens from the petals, drying\
    \ and sorting of saffron. The picking of 1000 ﬂowers is\nprocess of a duration\
    \ around 45–55 min, while additional 100 to 130 min are required for removing\n\
    the stigmas for drying. In total, 370 to 470 h are required to produce 1 kg of\
    \ dried saffron [52].\nThe ﬂowers are picked exactly when they are fully bloomed,\
    \ and the saffron strand or stigma is at its\nreddest. The harvesting process\
    \ begins shortly after dawn to minimize the further sunlight exposure\nto the\
    \ crops, since they may lose their color and even ﬂavor. Saffron cultivation requires\
    \ dry soil\nwith speciﬁc levels of moisture, controlled irrigation and right amounts\
    \ of nitrogen, phosphorus\nand potassium. Cultivation is commonly disturbed by\
    \ mice, moles and rats wrecking the stems.\nFurthermore, fungi may cause speciﬁc\
    \ diseases at the early stages of saffron growth.\nFigure 2. Saffron harvesting.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to improve the production process, by offering the ability\
    \ of immediate\ninterference in case of animal, disease or wild weeds detection.\
    \ The farmer will be able to monitor the\nﬁelds in real time and getting alerts\
    \ in case of unwanted incidents regarding the state of the plants\nduring all\
    \ cultivation period, while raising proﬁts. To satisfy these goals, the monitoring\
    \ process will\nbe aligned speciﬁcally with the farmers concerns and actions during\
    \ each month of cultivation as\npresented in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Saffron cultivation\
    \ yearly stages.\n8.2. DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS platform follows the architectural\
    \ design of the proposed remote sensing monitoring\nsystem. As presented in Figure\
    \ 4 the DIAS system is consisted of seven architectural layers. In each\nlayer\
    \ the most suitable aforementioned technologies are used towards achieving the\
    \ overall system’s\nefﬁcient performance and reliable operations. The saffron\
    \ cultivation is a quite demanding and delicate\nprocess requiring the deployment\
    \ of tailor-based technologies and continuous crop monitoring to\navoid animal\
    \ and disease interventions.\nIn the Sensor layer, quadcopter UAVs with thermal,\
    \ hyperspectral and RGB cameras are being\nused in cooperation with multiple wireless\
    \ nodes equipped with various sensors for data collection\nregarding the crops.\
    \ Saffron cultivation monitoring requires the study of small sized crops and\n\
    the notice of minimal crop state variations during each month. To select the desired\
    \ information\nUAVs must ﬂy in a certain distance and place for a speciﬁc period\
    \ of time and by using different\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n18 of 25\nposition\
    \ angles. Quadcopter UAVs is considered to be the best choice for saffron monitoring\
    \ since\nthey have rotary wings, which provide them with the ability of maneuverability,\
    \ while also ﬂying\nin low speed. Regarding RGB cameras, they are ideal since\
    \ saffron cultivation requires the capture\nof data-images in different weather\
    \ conditions avoiding inadequate or excessive exposure of the\nimage. Using multispectral\
    \ or hyperspectral sensors, UAVs can also obtain information related to\nspectral\
    \ absorption and reﬂection of the crops in several bands. This quite useful since\
    \ the provided\ninformation can then be used to calculate vegetation indices and\
    \ monitor the state of saffron crops\nbased on them. On the other hand, thermal\
    \ imaging detects speciﬁc levels of radiation and translates\nit into a grayscale\
    \ image, using brighter and darker shades of heat representation. This ability\
    \ is also\nessential in saffron cultivation since the ﬁelds are regularly trampled\
    \ by animals that are not being\ndetected on time in before they cause any damage.\
    \ The DIAS monitoring system uses different ground\nand on-leaf sensors to collect\
    \ useful data for improving the cultivation process. More speciﬁcally,\nenvironmental\
    \ humidity and temperature is evaluated since saffron requires speciﬁc conditions\
    \ to\nprosper. Additionally, the levels of luminosity, leaf-wetness, soil moisture,\
    \ pH and wind speed are also\nof great importance. Furthermore, the amounts of\
    \ nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil can\nhave a severe impact on\
    \ the plant’s growth, as well as the moisture levels in the soil. The farmer will\n\
    be able to predict production loss efﬁciently due to a round knowledge of the\
    \ saffron ﬁelds condition\nand even intervene with possible treatments to change\
    \ its course for the better.\nRegarding the Link and Encapsulation layer, sensor\
    \ data exchange in the DIAS platform is enabled\nby the LoRaWAN technology and\
    \ the IPv6 protocol. LoRa technology offers several advantages.\nThe LoRa physical\
    \ layer uses ISM bands 868 and 915 MHz—frequencies that are free to use anywhere\n\
    in the world. In addition, LoRa devices consume very little power making it ideal\
    \ for battery-powered\ndevices and it can also transmit and receive data for up\
    \ to 15 km in suburban areas and 5 km in\nurban areas. Another advantage of LoRa\
    \ is its high network capacity. In LoRaWAN, a single gateway\ncan accommodate\
    \ 1000 end-node devices. On the other hand, IPv6 offers large addressing space\n\
    and has built-in support for network auto-conﬁguration. In the DIAS platform,\
    \ each sensor node\nis characterized by its own IP address and uses a power saving\
    \ scheduling and routing protocol to\ntransmit the collected data to the nearest\
    \ LoRa Gateway. The information to be exchanged is encrypted\nbefore transmission.\
    \ Each LoRa gateway forwards the information to the according network router for\n\
    Internet access and data storage to the system’ database. UAVs’ data transmission\
    \ and communication\nis enabled by the IEEE 802.11ah networking standard in cooperation\
    \ with the IPv6 protocol, to forward\nthe collected images to the network server\
    \ as well.\nIn the Middleware layer, the DIAS platform will employ the MQTT-SN\
    \ protocol. MQTT-SN\nenables the management of all DIAS networking devices through\
    \ message exchanges coordinated by\nthe FIWARE’s context broker. It is essential\
    \ to maintain the monitoring’s system reliability towards\nachieving meaningful\
    \ data collection. Based on this protocol, the exchanged messages can be organized\n\
    by topics and importance regarding device management commands, transmission requests\
    \ initiated by\na higher layer and data acquisition. Sixteen number of message\
    \ types are supported and transmitted\nin an asynchronous way of communication\
    \ by the publish-subscribe model. TCP and UDP will also be\nused as transport\
    \ protocols. MQTT is ideal for the DIAS system since it excels in smart sensor\
    \ device\ncommunication on a wide area network, due to the publish/subscribe architecture\
    \ with the broker\nin the middle. MQTT is also very useful if the bandwidth is\
    \ limited to enhance network reliability\nand availability.\nIn the according\
    \ Conﬁguration layer, all saffron ﬁeld collected data will be grouped and\nformulated\
    \ to reach the information management unit. This layer facilitates the FIWARE\
    \ NGSI\nAPI so to produce the desired information model of the acquired ﬁeld data\
    \ based on efﬁcient\ncontext management.\nThe FIWARE’s Orion Context Broker has\
    \ powerful features enhancing\nthe capabilities and performance of the DIAS monitoring\
    \ system such as enabling asynchronous\napplication notiﬁcations. The basic operations\
    \ of the current layer include enabling the publication,\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n19 of 25\nconsumption, subscription and processing of all the information\
    \ relevant to the crops and the\ncultivation process in the DIAS platform.\nFigure\
    \ 4. The DIAS architecture.\nThe Management layer constitutes the basic operation\
    \ center of the DIAs platform. It stores,\nmaintains, analyzes the collected data\
    \ and produces predictions for the progress of the crops growth\nrate and statistics\
    \ regarding they current state. According to the commands acquired from the user\
    \ of\nthe platform in the highest architectural layer, the information management\
    \ logic initiates the according\nprocesses. Data processing includes the use of\
    \ the Random Forest machine learning classiﬁcation\nalgorithm for direct extraction\
    \ of conclusions regarding the growth and health of vegetation. This\nalgorithm\
    \ is directly applied on the data of the images acquired by the UAVs, evaluating\
    \ the RGB\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n20 of 25\ncolors and the intensity of each\
    \ pixel. The Random Forest scheme performs very well with high\ndimensionality\
    \ and can handle binary features, categorical features, and numerical features.\
    \ This\nmethod is chosen since very little pre-processing is required and the\
    \ data does not need to be rescaled\nor transformed. Digital image processing\
    \ of geospatially corrected aerial images (orthophotographs)\nfocuses on producing\
    \ the according vegetation indexes for evaluating the state of saffron plants.\
    \ Two\nkind of vegetation indexes will be calculated by the PiX4D image processing\
    \ tool. Vegetation indexes\nderived from multispectral information, such as NDVI\
    \ will enable the detection of unhealthy or sparse\nvegetation that reﬂects more\
    \ visible light and less near infrared light, making it easy to monitor the\n\
    growth and health of saffron crops. On the other hand, regarding the use of RGB-based\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices, Excess Greenness Index (ExG) is based on the assumption\
    \ that saffron plants will display a\nclear high degree of greenness, while soil\
    \ being the only background element. Finally, the Normalized\nDifference Index\
    \ (NDI) will be also used since it can enable the separation of saffron plants\
    \ from\nsoil and residue background images, using only green and red channels.\
    \ Spectral information can\nhelp signiﬁcantly in assessing a lot biological and\
    \ physical characteristics of the saffron crops. Any\nkind of wild weeds or animal\
    \ detection based on thermal imaging in the ﬁelds initiates alerts for\nimmediate\
    \ intervention and is taken into consideration as a note in the cultivation calendar\
    \ created by\nthe platform for the farmer. For this purpose, the OBIA algorithm\
    \ is also used to recognize weeds or\ndiscriminate species. Object-based image\
    \ analysis is based on the comparison between sets of similar\npixels called image\
    \ objects in measures of spectral properties (i.e., color), size, shape, and texture,\n\
    as well as context. The OBIA algorithm is chosen since it is more suited to landscape-scale\
    \ analyses\nand can ﬁlter out meaningless information and assimilate other pieces\
    \ of information into a single\nobject. After processing, all the collected sensor\
    \ data are categorized and evaluated in accordance with\nthe desired vegetation\
    \ index values, moisture levels and general plant state for each month during\n\
    the cultivation process. For these tasks, the DIAS platform employs powerful and\
    \ well-known tools,\nthe Apache Spark Framework focusing on Big Data analytics\
    \ and the WEKA (Waikato Environment)\nFramework specializing in data mining tasks.\
    \ The evaluation results will point out the vulnerable\nspots in the ﬁeld with\
    \ helpful statistical graphs and suggest possible solutions to the farmer, such\
    \ as\nthe use of fertilizer.\nIn the Application Layer, each user can access the\
    \ DIAS platform by using his/her own unique\npassword. According to their authority\
    \ and activities in the saffron ﬁeld the users have different access\nrights in\
    \ the DIAS platform. A user may be the administrator of the platform, a representative\
    \ of the\nKSPC board, a farmer or a worker in the ﬁelds. For instance, a worker\
    \ can only observe the evaluation\nresults in order to aid the farmer in treating\
    \ the plant growth, while the KSPC representative can\nadd observation notes,\
    \ can schedule and initiate sensor data collection in a speciﬁc ﬁeld and also\n\
    manage the ﬂight plan of UAVs. On the other hand, the platform administrator is\
    \ only one who can\nadd new users and new saffron ﬁelds for cultivation to be\
    \ observed in the system. Access in the\nDIAS platform is forbidden for non-authorized\
    \ users. In the Application layer, the management of\nthe four basic operational\
    \ units of the DIAS system can be initiated. These are the Visualization Unit,\n\
    the Data Management Unit, the Prediction Unit and the Data collection Unit. By\
    \ entering the Data\ncollection Unit, a user can initiate sensor data collection\
    \ in a selected ﬁeld or modify existing data\nin the platform. By entering the\
    \ Data Management Unit, the user can evaluate orthophotographs\nand calculate\
    \ vegetation indexes according to speciﬁc data in a speciﬁc saffron ﬁeld with\
    \ the help of\nPix4DMapper tool. The Visualization Unit is related to the presentation\
    \ of statistical results and graphs\nregarding each saffron ﬁeld, while the Prediction\
    \ Unit employs the aforementioned data mining tools\nto produce a sufﬁcient evaluation\
    \ of the collected data. All system information is stored in the central\nserver\
    \ database.\nBased on the acquired and processed data, farmers can produce statistics\
    \ regarding the progress in\nsaffron production and avoid ﬁnancial loss, while\
    \ improving the quality of the crops and accomplishing\na considerable rise in\
    \ production.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n21 of 25\n8.3. Beneﬁts and Costs\nGreece\
    \ is the second largest saffron producing country, with an average output of 4\
    \ tons of p.a.\nduring the last four decades, most of which is directed in export\
    \ markets. The establishment of the\n‘Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative’ marked\
    \ the beginning of a good decade for this product\nwith production reaching its\
    \ height record of more than 12 tons in 1982 [53]. Nevertheless, in the\nperiod\
    \ following Greece’s accession to the European Community, farmers began abandoning\
    \ saffron\ncultivation. This fact resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in yield with\
    \ an average yield of 800 g per\nstremma (1 ha = 10 stremmas = 1000 m2 ). However,\
    \ this trend seems to be reversed since 2010 and\ncurrently yields vary around\
    \ 1 ton per stremma. Currently, Greek saffron price is about 1200 euros per\n\
    Kg. Nearly 5000 spots are needed to produce 100 g of red saffron. The average\
    \ produce per acre is 6 kg\nof dried stigmas (red product). The lower production\
    \ of the plant is on the ﬁrst year of the plantation,\nwhile the highest on the\
    \ third and the fourth.\nIn the year of 2015, a study in Greek saffron cultivation\
    \ resulted that farm managers need\nto address the efﬁciency of input use and\
    \ raise capital and labor productivities to maintain\ncompetitiveness [53]. The\
    \ saffron quality is determined by the color, ﬂavor and size of the stigmas.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to upgrade proﬁt earnings by the adoption of new technologies,\
    \ ensuring\nﬂower picking at appropriate time in a proper collection material\
    \ at an appropriate age. Animal\nintrusions in the ﬁelds, causing a huge loss\
    \ in production, will be prevented and crops diseases will\nbe detected in time.\
    \ The overall equipment cost is considered to be a safe investment for farmers\n\
    since most of the technologies involved are open source and the initial cost of\
    \ the related hardware\nand software can be shared across producers. Currently,\
    \ the DIAS initiative is under construction\nand no experimental results are available\
    \ to conﬁrm the proposed objectives. However, in Table 6\nwe present the production\
    \ rate of Greek Saffron as recorded in [53], while in Table 7 an average\nestimation\
    \ is provided regarding the increase in cultivation operations by adopting the\
    \ DIAS platform.\nThese percentages are the estimations provided by two of the\
    \ producers whose ﬁelds participate in\nthe pilot study. The estimations show\
    \ that on average the farmers calculate an increase of around\n20% in production,\
    \ this percentage is in accordance to other types of cultivations such as olives\
    \ and\npotatoes [54].\nThe use of the DIAS project can offer a signiﬁcant increase\
    \ in saffron production. Nevertheless,\nsince no pilots have been implemented\
    \ yet in the project, the Return on Investment (ROI) is difﬁcult to be\nestimated.\
    \ An investment of time and money from the DIAS consortium is required to investigate\
    \ how\nthe data gathered from UAVs can connect to and affect other things that\
    \ are happening on the ﬁelds.\nSaffron growers need that information to provide\
    \ context and create a correlation regarding causes\nand effects. At that point\
    \ ROI becomes signiﬁcant promoting UAVs as a part of the desired solution\nand\
    \ not as the solution itself. Furthermore, due to shared costs between project\
    \ partners, ROI becomes\na collective performance measure that can be estimated\
    \ only when each member has acquired the\naccording technological beneﬁts. A complex\
    \ proﬁtability study is required to specify the precision\nservice offerings,\
    \ as presented in [55,56]. Each partner in the DIAS project owns and offers different\n\
    assets in this endeavor, thus calculating the overall ROI of UAV usage from the\
    \ side of farmers is not\nyet possible.\nTable 6. Greek saffron cultivation economic\

    \ system in precision agriculture faces\nseveral challenges. The greatest challenge\
    \ in the sensor layer is for sensor nodes to achieve efﬁcient and\ncontinuous\
    \ operation for a long time in a natural environment, while taking into account\
    \ the climate\nchange and wildlife interventions. The battery life of sensor nodes\
    \ is not considered satisfactory,\nand it is necessary to design and implement\
    \ energy-saving protocols with the highest possible\nsystem performance among\
    \ other precautions. In addition, depending on the type of application,\nthe supported\
    \ agricultural work and the implementation technologies, the problems that arise\
    \ can be\ndifferentiated. For instance, the use of sensors and controllers from\
    \ different manufacturers prevents\ncommunication between them and makes it more\
    \ difﬁcult to interconnect with other agricultural\ncomponents. Also, the sensor\
    \ inertia phenomenon was observed in a high-speed WSN due to non-steep\nchanges\
    \ in humidity and soil temperature.\nIn the network layer, the basic challenges\
    \ regarding the operation of a crop monitoring system\nwith WSN and IoT technologies\
    \ include the limited computational capabilities of sensor nodes.\nThe restricted\
    \ memory of the nodes disables them to handle large amounts of communication data\n\
    and cluster-based interconnection procedures. Due to this fact, long data queues\
    \ are created in each\nnode, leading to greater delay in transmissions. The same\
    \ outcome can be triggered by the long\ncommunication distance of sensor nodes.\
    \ One major issue that routing algorithms must deal with in\nsuch cases is the\
    \ high level of energy consumption, which leads to a reduction in the overall\
    \ viability\nof the network. In precision agriculture monitoring systems routing\
    \ protocols should offer minimum\ndelay, be able to provide efﬁcient services\
    \ in many sensor nodes, while taking into account the limited\nresources. They\
    \ should also be capable of accepting all sorts of environments including severe\
    \ and loss\nenvironments, while providing information security and privacy. Most\
    \ routing protocols use some\nlocalization technique to obtain knowledge concerning\
    \ their locations. The performance of the routing\nprotocol is a function of network\
    \ size and transmission media. Therefore, transmission media of good\nquality\
    \ enhances the network performance directly.\nHowever, in many cases the failure\
    \ of such advanced monitoring system may be due to the\ngeographic, cultural or\
    \ socio-economic distance between system designers and the intended user\ncommunity.\
    \ Cost is an important limiting factor in the implementation of such systems.\
    \ The cost\ndepends to a great extent on the quality of the materials and the\
    \ topology of the network.\n10. Conclusions\nThis paper proposes the architectural\
    \ components of a smart farming monitoring system, based on\nmodern IoT communication\
    \ technologies and WSN capabilities, in cooperation with energy-saving\nprotocol\
    \ schemes. A use case study based on the DIAS project is also presented, enhancing\
    \ the reliability\nand contribution of our model. The IoT agricultural applications\
    \ enable farmers to collect and analyze\nmeaningful data. Large landowners and\
    \ small farmers should welcome the potential of IoT market\nfor agriculture by\
    \ installing smart technologies to increase competitiveness and sustainability\
    \ in their\nproductions. The rapid growth of population forces farmers to meet\
    \ the demand by implementing\nagricultural IoT solutions in a prosperous manner.\
    \ In the future, an in-depth study will be carried out\nregarding the real-time\
    \ performance of the proposed model in the DIAS project.\nInformation 2019, 10,\

    ABSTRACT\nIncreased awareness of the economic and social effects of aging, deterioration\
    \ and\nextreme events on civil infrastructure has been accompanied by recognition\
    \ of the need for\nadvanced structural health monitoring and damage detection\
    \ tools. A number of new\nresearch projects have been funded to improve the damage\
    \ detection methods including the\nuse of innovative signal processing, new sensors,\
    \ and control theory. Moreover, due to the\ndynamic nature of structures and their\
    \ environment, creating and implementing the perfect\nsensors and their corresponding\
    \ systems is quite difficult. This pursuit has been quite\nchallenging for a multitude\
    \ of reasons, which will be examined in this paper along with\ndifferent types\
    \ of sensors and preferences.\nKeywords: structural health monitoring, damage\
    \ detection, infrastructure, Sensors.\n1. INTRODUCTION:\nCivil infrastructure,\
    \ which includes bridges and buildings, begin to deteriorate once they are\nbuilt\
    \ and used. Maintaining safe and reliable civil infrastructures for daily use\
    \ is i mportant to the\nwell being of all of us. Knowing the integrity of the\
    \ structure in terms of its age and usage, and its\nlevel of safety to withstand\
    \ infrequent but high forces such as overweight trucks, earthquakes,\ntornadoes,\
    \ and hurricanes is important an d necessary. The process of determining and tracking\n\
    structural integrity and assessing the nature of damage in a structure is often\
    \ referred to as health\nmonitoring. Nowadays multiple structures worldwide are\
    \ monitored with sensor arrays to monitor\nambient vibration, strain and displacement\
    \ among other parameters.\n*\nPh. D. student, Civil & Environmental Eng. Dept.,\

    \ Eng. Dept., University of California , Irvine (UCI ), U.S.A.\n*** Egyptian Armed\
    \ Forces.\n2\nSensors require high reliability, accuracy, high dynamic range,\
    \ and immunity to\nelectromagnetic and electrical interference, resistance to\
    \ environmental conditions, such as low and\nhigh temperature, corrosion, and\
    \ expo sition to moisture, and severe shock and vibration. This\nrequires ruggedness,\
    \ durability and longevity of the sensors. [1]\nIn addition to the correct selection\
    \ of sensors to match the previous conditions, they also\nhave to be suitable\
    \ for measurement of ke y parameters that influence the performance and health\
    \ of\nthe structural system. In addition to the structural considerations, sensors\
    \ need to be chosen based\non compatibility with the materials and the range and\
    \ scope of measurements . [2]\n2. Overview\nAs discussed earlier conventional\
    \ sensor technology has a number of difficulties that must be\novercome, the first\
    \ being interference by electromagnetic fields. Generally advanced infrastructure\n\
    systems house many devices that can cause strong electromagnetic inte rference.\
    \ Also long cables can\nact as an antenna and pick up noise, generate ground loops\
    \ and are susceptible to lightning strikes.\nShielding the cables can prevent\
    \ electric interference but not electromagnetic interference.\nConventional sensors\
    \ also do not always demonstrate the ruggedness, durability and longevity\nrequired\
    \ by the hostile environmental conditions of the structures. Consistent research\
    \ has shown that\nfiber optic sensors solve these set of problems.\n2.1 Optical\
    \ fiber sensor\nSince the material of the optical fiber sensor is dielectric,\
    \ it is immune to electromagnetic\ninterference. Optical fiber sensors and cables\
    \ are lightweight, carry light for excitation and sensed\nsignal simultaneously\
    \ through the same line and can be multiplexed. Electric sho rting due to\nmoisture\
    \ does not happen to fiber optics, so they don’t have to be water -proofed. [1]\
    \ Another\ngreat attribute of fiber optic sensors is that they have a distributed\
    \ property meaning that they\nsense in two and three dimensional arrays. They\
    \ are very resistant against a range of temperatures.\nAlso because they are solid\
    \ state they are capable of withstanding extremely high levels of\nvibration and\
    \ shock. Also due to the continual exponential growth of the telecommunication\n\
    market, the projected price of fiber optics is potentially low. By using an optical\
    \ sensor in which\nthe entire length of the fiber has the capability to detect\
    \ damage, the number of sensors needed for\nthe structure is greatly reduced.\
    \ Fiber-optic Bragg grating sensors to monitor fatigue crack growth\nand delamination\
    \ within hybrid laminates, embedded Bragg grating fiber -optic sensors can be\n\
    used to monitor the strain in the layers near a fatigue crack. Fiber Bragg grating\
    \ (FBG) sensors\ncould be used for detecting transverse cracks in carbon fiber\
    \ reinforced plastic (CFRP) cross -ply\nlaminates. Because the FBG sensors are\
    \ sensitive to nonuniform strain distribution along the\nlength of the gratings,\
    \ they have the potential for detecting damage that causes such strain in\ncomposite\
    \ materials.\nProceedings of the 9th ICCAE-9 Conference, 29-31 May, 2012\nMQC\
    \ 3\n3\nThe use of the plastic optical fibers is justified because the plastic\
    \ optical fibers are much\ncheaper and easier to install than conventional silica\
    \ fiber counterparts. Also, the plastic optical\nfibers have similar coefficients\
    \ of thermal expansion and elasticity characteristics as the parent\nFRP structure,\
    \ resulting in good bondage between the parent material and the optical fibers.\n\
    However, the plastic optical fibers have much greater light attenuation than silica\
    \ fibers, limiting\ntheir use to short distance transmission. Optical waveguide\
    \ sensor with the capability to monitor\nstrains up to 2,000 microstrain that\
    \ are not affected by temperature , optical waveguide sensors are\nextremely sensitive\
    \ and have the ability to measure large deformations . [3]\nFiber-optic Michelson\
    \ interferometric sensors are used to detect failure in reinforced concrete\n\
    beams. The beams were loaded in bending until fracture occurred. It has been found\
    \ that the\nmeasurements from the fiber-optic sensors did not match the measure\
    \ ments from the electrical\nstrain gauges. However, the fiber-optic sensors were\
    \ successful in detecting the failure of the\nbeam. [3]\nFor long-term monitoring\
    \ of structures SOFO deformation sensors are used. The SOFO\noptical fiber sensors,\
    \ which are based on a Michelson interferometer, have been successful for\nmeasuring\
    \ deformations that occur slowly over time. Each sensor consists of two optical\
    \ fibers.\nOne is installed in mechanical contact with the structure to be monitored,\
    \ while the second, the\nreference fiber, is placed loose in a pipe for temperature\
    \ compensation. Deformation of the\nstructure is measured based on the difference\
    \ of length changes between the two fibers. The\nlengths of the fibers are measured\
    \ by interferometry . [2]\nAlthough fiber optic sensors provide all these advantages\
    \ over conventional sensors, fiber\noptic sensors weren’t originally designed\
    \ for use in civil infrastructures, and this posed some\nserious problems. They\
    \ were originally designed for changes in light intensity, and phase de lay\n\
    and interference in light patterns, so they were too sensitive in their measurements,\
    \ which need a\nbroad measurement range. They also measure the combined effects\
    \ of changes such as\ntemperature and strain, where in this situation we would\
    \ only need str ain. The fiber’s physical\nstrength also put a limit on the maximum\
    \ measured capacities of strain. So a newer innovation in\nfiber optic sensors\
    \ was introduced. [3]\nChanging the head to a transversely vibrating wire instead\
    \ of an optical fiber, that senses\nquantities with no interference. This increased\
    \ the sensors range and increases reliability and\nrobustness. The wire’s vibration\
    \ frequency is detected by light reflected from the optical fiber.\nThis wire\
    \ is constantly oscillated by a series of laser pulses whose frequency is automatically\
    \ and\ninstantaneously adjusted to the resonant frequency of the wire, which changes\
    \ according to wire\ntension. A PLL (Phase Locked Loop) circuit is used in order\
    \ to ensure the exciting frequency\nmatches the resonant frequency of the wire\
    \ varying with the external force. This sensor can be\n4\nmodified to appropriately\
    \ measure strain, acceleration and pressure variation. If a mass and\ndamper are\
    \ attached, it can serve as an accelerometer, if a large plate with appropriate\
    \ stiffness is\ninstalled to one of the ends of the plate of the shell, it can\
    \ be used as an anemometer, soil or water\npressure sensor. Another advantage\
    \ is the optical sensor is that a possibly a large number of these\nunits can\
    \ be combined to form a distributed senso r network, which has multiple sensor\
    \ heads but\nuses only two light sources and only two fiber optic cables. Where\
    \ one set of light source and\noptical fiber cable is for generating and transmitting\
    \ the light pulse to excite the wires of all the\nsensor heads, which possibly\
    \ all have different frequencies; while the other set of light source and\noptical\
    \ fiber cable is for sending the detecting light to and back from the wires, where\
    \ signals with\ndifferent frequencies are multiplexed into one cable. Such a sens\
    \ or network will reduce cost and\neliminate cabling problems typically associated\
    \ with conventional sensors . [1]\nThe fiber optic accelerometer is based on a\
    \ novel integration of the Moiré fringe phenomenon\nwith fiber optics. The sensor\
    \ head contains a pendulum and a pair of parallel optical gratings\npanels; one\
    \ fixed to the pendulum and the other to the sensor case.\nThe relative displacement\n\
    between the mass and the sensor case can be measured by “viewing” and counting\
    \ the number of\nmoiré fringes formed on the optical gratings using optical fibers.\n\
    By properly designing the\ndynamic parameters of the pendulum, the relative displacement\
    \ becomes proportional to the\nacceleration of the sensor case.\nCompared with\
    \ its conventional counterparts (electric sensors ), this optical fiber\naccelerometer\
    \ has total immunity to electromagnetic interference and lightning strikes due\
    \ to the\nnon-existence of electric signals or electric cables, unique safety\
    \ in dangerous environments\nwhere electric sparks causes explosion con cerns,\
    \ extremely high sensitivity, resolution, along with\na large measuring range,\
    \ particularly high performance in low frequencies, a small sensor head\nwith\
    \ a lightweight optical fiber cable, making it much easier to install on an existing\
    \ structure,\nrobustness against to environmental (temperature, moisture, etc.)\
    \ changes due to the use of the\nwell-understood and reliable measuring mechanism\
    \ of the moiré phenomena, much lower cost\nthan most of the optical fiber sensors\
    \ due to its simple signal processing, a versatility to measure\ndifferent dynamic\
    \ quantities upon simple modification . [3]\n2.2 Microwave imaging technology\n\
    Advanced composite materials are being used for seismic retrofit of reinforced\
    \ concrete\n(RC) structures designed and constructed under older specifications,\
    \ but the post-earthquake\ndamage of the concrete structure covered by the composite\
    \ jackets remains a significant concern.\nAddressing this is a microwave imaging\
    \ technology for assessing the damage of the jacketed\nconcrete structures. A\
    \ unique microwave camera consisting of antenna arrays, together with\nspecial\
    \ imaging algorithms and software packages , has recently been developed that\
    \ can take a 3D\nmicrowave image with high accuracy and speed. This technology\
    \ is applicable for quantitative\nProceedings of the 9th ICCAE-9 Conference, 29-31\
    \ May, 2012\nMQC 3\n5\ncondition assessment of concrete structures and pavements\
    \ in addition to composite -retrofitted\nstructures, thus significantly improving\
    \ the effectiveness and efficiency of the current visual -\ninspection-based maintenance\
    \ and enhancing the safety, reliability, and longevity of concrete\nstructures\
    \ and pavements. [4]\n2.3 Video monitoring\nVideo monitoring is also a tool in\
    \ monitoring structural health. A pilot technology\nintegration test bed used\
    \ a PC-based data acquisition system with live internet connectivity that is\n\
    deployed along a network camera that is used for continuous monitoring of a structure\
    \ . [3] This\nparticular configuration is used on highways. The system incorporates\
    \ a large accelerometer array\nthat synchronizes with a video monitoring system.\
    \ All senso rs and data acquisition hardware are\nplaced inside the bridge box\
    \ girder. Accelerometers are positioned to measure vertical vibration\non passing\
    \ moving loads. The camera is of course used to relate passing vehicles to sensor\
    \ output.\nImages are time stamped and sent to the image acquisition computer.\
    \ This allows for accurate\nsynchronization between the images and dynamic response\
    \ of the sensors. All systems operate\nonline via a high speed wireless internet\
    \ network, allowing real -time data transmission. Image\nprocessing for this procedure\
    \ includes background separation and vehicle detection. Background\nseparation\
    \ uses the Gaussian mixture model, and vehicle detection uses the background\n\
    subtraction method. [5]\n2.4 Soil moisture sensors\nSoil moisture sensors measure\
    \ the water content in soil. A soil moisture probe is made up\nof multiple soil\
    \ moisture sensors. One common type of s oil moisture sensors in commercial use\
    \ is\na Frequency domain sensor such as a capacitance sensor. Another sensor,\
    \ the neutron moisture\ngauge, utilizes the moderator properties of water for\
    \ neutrons. Cheaper sensors -often for home\nuse- are based on two electrodes\
    \ measuring the resistance of the soil. Sometimes this s imply\nconsists of two\
    \ bare (galvanized) wires, but there are also probes with wires embedded in gypsum.\n\
    Measuring soil moisture is important in agriculture to help farmers manage their\
    \ irrigation\nsystems more efficiently. Not only are farmers able to gener ally\
    \ use less water to grow a crop,\nthey are able to increase yields and the quality\
    \ of the crop by better management of soil moisture\nduring critical plant growth\
    \ stages. Besides agriculture, there are many other disciplines using soil\nmoisture\
    \ sensors. Golf courses are now using sensors to increase the efficiencies of\
    \ their irrigation\nsystems to prevent over watering and leaching of fertilizers\
    \ and other chemicals offsite. In urban\nand suburban areas, landscapes and residential\
    \ lawns are using soil moisture sensors to interface\nwith an irrigation controller.\
    \ Connecting a soil moisture sensor to a simple irrigation clock will\nconvert\
    \ it into a \"smart\" irrigation controller that prevents an irrigation cycle\
    \ when the soil is\nwet.[6]\n6\nFrequency domain (FD) sensor is an instrument\
    \ developed for measuring soil moisture\ncontent. The instrument has an oscillating\
    \ circuit, the sensing part of the sensor is embedded in the\nsoil, and the operating\
    \ frequency will depend on the value of soil's dielectric constant.\nThere are\
    \ two types of this sensors; 1) Capacitance probe, or fringe capacitance sensor.\n\
    Capacitance probes use capacitance to measure the dielectric permittivity of the\
    \ soil. The volume\nof water in the total volume of soil most heavily influences\
    \ the dielectric permittivity of the soil\nbecause the dielectric of water (80)\
    \ is much greater than the other constituents of the soil (mineral\nsoil: 4, organic\
    \ matter: 4, air: 1). Thus, when the amount of water changes in the soil , the\
    \ probe\nwill measure a change in capacitance (from the change in dielectric permittivity)\
    \ that can be\ndirectly correlated with a change in water content. Circuitry inside\
    \ some commercial probes\nchanges the capacitance measurement into a proportional\
    \ millivolt output . 2) Electrical impedance\nsensor, which consists of soil probes\
    \ and using electrical impedance measurement. The most\ncommon configuration is\
    \ based on the standing wave principle. The device comprises a 100 MHz\nsinusoidal\
    \ oscillator, a fixed impedance coaxial transmission line, and probe wires which\
    \ is buried\nin the soil. The oscillator signal is propagated along the transmission\
    \ line into the soil probe, and\nif the probe's impedance differs from that of\
    \ the transmission line, a proportion of th e incident\nsignal is reflected back\
    \ along the line towards the signal source . [6]\nCompared to time domain reflectometer\
    \ (TDR), FD sensors are cheaper to build and have\na faster response time. However\
    \ because of the complex electrical field around the probe, the\nsensor needs\
    \ to be calibrated for different soil types. Some commercial sensors have been\
    \ able to\nremove the soil type sensitivity by using a hig h frequency. [7]\n\
    2.5 Sensors to measure moisture in Concrete\nMoisture has an important influence\
    \ on the lifetime of concrete structures. In fact, water\nacts as a transport\
    \ agent for damaging ions such as chloride, sulfate, carbonate, and ammonium.\n\
    Corrosion of steel rebars is also an important factor in assessing the useful\
    \ life of concrete\nstructures. Fiber-optical moisture sensor had been developed\
    \ to monitor the moisture content of\nconcrete. Their measurement system consists\
    \ of a plastic optical fiber, a light source, and a high-\nresolution microspectrometer\
    \ as well as a sensor. The sensor contains a polymer matrix that is\nattached\
    \ directly to the concrete. An indicator dye is injected into that matrix, and\
    \ the water\ncontent in the matrix affects the absorp tion spectra of the dye.\
    \ As light from the source passes\nthrough the optical fibers to the sensor, the\
    \ microspectrometer determines which wavelengths of\nlight are absorbed by the\
    \ polymer matrix/dye in the sensor. In this way, the moisture content of\nthe\
    \ concrete to which the sensor is directly attached can be determined. Without\
    \ moisture, the\nsensor shows a peak wavelength in the absorption spectrum of\
    \ 602 nm. The peak wavelength is\nshifted about 40 nm to 562 nm when the water\
    \ content in the sensor matrix i s 28% by weight. The\nresearchers confirm the\
    \ long-term stability of the sensing system as well as the reproducibility of\n\
    Proceedings of the 9th ICCAE-9 Conference, 29-31 May, 2012\nMQC 3\n7\nresults\
    \ when the moisture content of test specimens is wetted and dried in a cyclic\
    \ manner. They\nalso testify that the system can monitor the drying process of\
    \ concrete. [3]\n2.6 MEMS Technology for Sensing Motion\nMicro Electro Mechanical\
    \ Systems (MEMS) are miniature electromechanical sensor and\nactuator systems\
    \ developed from the mature batch -fabricated processes of Very Large System\n\
    Integration (VLSI) technologies. Advances in MEMS technologies have led to dramatic\n\
    reductions in size, power consumption, and cost for wireless communications. Their\
    \ small size\nallows them to be used in applications where conventional sensors\
    \ and actuators woul d be\nintrusive. Because of the economies of scale achievable\
    \ from the conventional chip manufacturing\nprocesses, they can be mass produced\
    \ and copiously applied in a cost -effective manner.\nFurthermore, they consume\
    \ very little power, on the order of 500 μW to 40 μW. One example of\nMEMS wireless\
    \ sensor modules, which incorporate a wireless telemetry system, on -board\nmicroprocessor,\
    \ sensors, and batteries into a package about a cubic inch in size, is Courtesy\
    \ of\nBerkeley Sensor & Actuator Center, University of California: Berkeley. [3]\n\
    MEMS is an emerging technology through which miniature mechanical systems are\
    \ built\nmaking use of the standard integrated circuits (IC) technologies on the\
    \ same chip as the electronic\ncircuitry. The main advantage of MEMS is that,\
    \ because of the effectiveness in their fabrication\nprocess, they can perform\
    \ measurements at relatively low cost and low power consumption.  The\nﬁeld of\
    \ MEMS has been developed since the end of the 1980s while, in comparison silicon-based\n\
    sensors and actuators go back to the 1970s. Currently, MEMS are used for many\
    \ applications such\nas communications (mobile phones), ﬁnding industrial, automotive\
    \ industrial, medical, and\nsecurity purposes. For dynamic monitoring of civil\
    \ engineering structures, mechanical micro -\nsensors (micro-accelerometers) are\
    \ the most appropriate. [8]\nIt should, however, be noted that reliability and\
    \ measurement accuracy are still problems\nthat must be addressed for successful\
    \ implementation of MEMS technologies to SHM. While\nMEMS sensing technologies\
    \ are appropriate for local SHM applications, such as those that\nidentify crack\
    \ initiation, propagation, and corrosion, deploying a large number of MEMS devices\n\
    over a large area in a cost-effective manner is a difficult problem. MEMS technologies\
    \ can make\nthis type of SHM system possible. A reduction in the signal processing\
    \ load and power\nrequirements is the main advantage of such a sensor. [3]\n2.7\
    \ Wireless sensor network (WSN)\nAnother sensor has recently been introduced in\
    \ sensor health monitoring; these are\nwireless sensors. They obviously have the\
    \ distinct advantage of using no wiring. A large\ndeployment of these wireless\
    \ sensors is a very effective method of structural health monitoring.\n8\nBesides\
    \ offering a low cost relative to traditional cable based monitoring system, a\
    \ wireless sensor\nnetwork offers a distributed computing paradigm that allows\
    \ sensor s to self-interrogate structural\nresponse data. Furthermore, wireless\
    \ sensors utilize an implementation of the IEEE 802.15.4\nwhich is standard for\
    \ wireless networks to participate in scalable communication this makes it\nadaptable\
    \ to network changes without requiring reprogramming. [3] This is very efficient\
    \ for\ndistributed sensor systems because it utilizes true ad -hoc peer-to-peer\
    \ communication.\nA wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of spatially distributed\
    \ autonomous sensors to\nmonitor physical or environmental conditions, such as\
    \ temperature, sound, vibration, pressure,\nmotion or pollutants and to cooperatively\
    \ pass their data through the network to a main location.\nThe more modern networks\
    \ are bi-directional, also enabling control of sensor activity. The\ndevelopment\
    \ of wireless sensor networks was motivated by military applications such as\n\
    battlefield surveillance. Today such networks are used in many industrial and\
    \ consumer\napplications, such as industrial process monitoring and control, machine\
    \ health monitoring, etc. In\ncomputer science and telecommunications, wireless\
    \ sensor networks are an active research area\nwith numerous workshops and conferences\
    \ arranged each year. The WS N is built of \"nodes\" –\nfrom a few to several\
    \ hundreds or even thousands, where each node is connected to one (or\nsometimes\
    \ several) sensors. Each such sensor network node has typically several parts:\
    \ a radio\ntransceiver with an internal antenna or connection to an external antenna,\
    \ a microcontroller, an\nelectronic circuit for interfacing with the sensors and\
    \ an energy source, usually a battery or an\nembedded form of energy harvesting.\
    \ A sensor node might vary in size from that of a shoebox\ndown to the size of\
    \ a grain of dust, although functioning \"motes\" of genuine microscopic\ndimensions\
    \ have yet to be created. The cost of sensor nodes is similarly variable, ranging\
    \ from a\nfew to hundreds of dollars, depending on th e complexity of the individual\
    \ sensor nodes. Size and\ncost constraints on sensor nodes result in corresponding\
    \ constraints on resources such as energy,\nmemory, computational speed, and communications\
    \ bandwidth. The topology of the WSNs can\nvary from a simple star network to\
    \ an advanced multi-hop wireless mesh network. The\npropagation technique between\
    \ the hops of the network can be routing or flooding . [9]\nArea monitoring is\
    \ a common application of WSNs. In area monitoring, the WSN is\ndeployed over\
    \ a region where some phenomenon is to be monitored. As a military example, with\n\
    the use of sensors they can detect enemy intrusion. A civilian example is the\
    \ geo -fencing of gas or\noil pipelines. When the sensors detect the event being\
    \ monitored (heat, pressure), the e vent is\nreported to one of the base stations,\
    \ which then takes appropriate action (e.g., send a message on\nthe internet or\
    \ to a satellite). Similarly, wireless sensor networks can use a range of sensors\
    \ to\ndetect the presence of vehicles ranging from motor cycles to train cars.\
    \ For water monitoring, there\nare many opportunities for using wireless sensor\
    \ networks within the water industries. One\nexample is to detect the moisture\
    \ and water levels in the soil. Facilities not wired for power or\ndata transmission\
    \ can be monitored using industrial wireless I/O devices and sensors powered\n\
    Proceedings of the 9th ICCAE-9 Conference, 29-31 May, 2012\nMQC 3\n9\nusing solar\
    \ panels or battery packs. Also, they are used in pollution control boards. For\
    \ structural\nmonitoring, wireless sensors can be used to monitor the movement\
    \ within buildin gs and\ninfrastructure such as bridges, flyovers, embankments,\
    \ tunnels etc.  This enabling engineering\npractices to monitor assets remotely\
    \ without the need for costly site visits, as well as having the\nadvantage of\
    \ daily data, whereas traditionally this da ta was collected weekly or monthly,\
    \ using\nphysical site visits, involving either road or rail closure in some cases.\
    \ It is also far more accurate\nthan any visual inspection that would be carried\
    \ out . [10]\nSeveral standards are currently either ratified or under development\
    \ for wireless sensor\nnetworks. There are a number of different standardizations\
    \ in the field of WSNs. The\nIEEE\nfocuses on the physical and MAC layers; the\
    \ Internet Engineering Task Force works on layers 3\nand above. In addition to\
    \ these, there is the International Society of Automation which provides\nvertical\
    \ solutions, covering all protocol layers. Finally, there are also several non\
    \ -standard,\nproprietary mechanisms and specifications. Standards are used far\
    \ less in WSNs than in other\ncomputing systems which make most systems incapable\
    \ of direct communication between\ndifferent systems. However predominant standards\
    \ commonly used in WSN communications\ninclude: Wireless HART, ISA100, IEEE 1451,\
    \ and ZigBee/802.15.4. [11]\nThe main features of a WSN include: The ability to\
    \ cope with node failures, the mobility\nof nodes, dynamic network topology, communication\
    \ failures, heterogen eity of nodes, scalability\nto large scale of deployment,\
    \ the ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions, ease of use,\nunattended\
    \ operation, and power consumption.  Although power consumption constrains for\n\
    nodes using batteries or energy harvestin g is limited. Wireless sensors are usually\
    \ powered by\ntheir own local battery. Since this power supply is limited relative\
    \ to wire based systems, they\nshould operate on low power circuits and have well\
    \ programmed power efficient algorithms . [12]\nFor peer-to-peer programming the\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 (LR-WPAN) is good. The features of a\nLR-WPAN utilizing this standard\
    \ are wireless connectivity over short ranges, low cost to build,\neasy installation,\
    \ reliable data transfer, and efficient use of battery power. The LR-WPAN\nprotocol\
    \ is concentrated in the bottom two layers of the communication protocol stack,\
    \ namely the\nPHY (physical access) layer and the MAC (medium access control)\
    \ layers. The PHY layer is\nintended to coordinate the physical radio to modulate\
    \ and demodu late data upon carrier radio\nfrequencies. The MAC layer offer standard\
    \ packet structures for data transmission as well as\nprocedural rules for autonomous\
    \ users to share the common bandwidth . [13]\nSensor nodes can be imagined as\
    \ small computers, extremely b asic in terms of their\ninterfaces and their components.\
    \ They usually consist of a processing unit with limited\ncomputational power\
    \ and limited memory, sensors or MEMS (including specific conditioning\ncircuitry),\
    \ a communication device (usually radio transceivers or alternatively optical),\
    \ and a\n10\npower source usually in the form of a battery. Other possible inclusions\
    \ are energy harvesting\nmodules, secondary ASICs, and possibly secondary communication\
    \ devices (e.g. RS-232 or\nUSB). [11]\nThe base stations are one or more components\
    \ of the WSN with much more\ncomputational, energy and communication resources.\
    \ They act as a gateway between sensor nodes\nand the end user as they typically\
    \ forward data from the WSN on to a s erver. Other special\ncomponents in routing\
    \ based networks are routers, designed to compute, calculate and distribute\n\
    the routing tables. Many techniques are used to connect to the outside world including\
    \ mobile\nphone networks, satellite phones, radio modem s, long-range Wi-Fi links\
    \ etc. Many base stations\nare ARM-based (Advanced RISC Machine) running a form\
    \ of Embedded Linux. [14]\nIf a centralized architecture is used in a sensor network\
    \ and the central node fails, then the\nentire network will collapse, however\
    \ the reliability of the sensor network can be increased by\nusing distributed\
    \ control architecture. Distributed control is used in WSNs for the following\n\
    reasons: Sensor nodes are prone to failure, for better collection of data, and\
    \ to provide nodes with\nbackup in case of failure of the central node. There\
    \ is also no centralized body to allocate the\nresources and they have to be self-organized.\
    \ The data gathered from wireless sensor networks is\nusually saved in the form\
    \ of numerical data in a central base station. Additionally, the Open\nGeospatial\
    \ Consortium (OGC) is specifying standards for interoperability interfaces and\
    \ metadata\nencodings that enable real time integration of heterogen eous sensor\
    \ webs into the Internet,\nallowing any individual to monitor or control Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks through a Web Browser.\n[15]\nTo reduce communication costs\
    \ some algorithms remove or reduce nodes redundant\nsensor information and avoid\
    \ forwarding da ta that is of no use. As nodes can inspect the data they\nforward\
    \ they can measure averages or directionality. For example, in sensing and monitoring\n\
    applications, it is generally the case that neighboring sensor nodes monitoring\
    \ an environmental\nfeature typically register similar values. This kind of data\
    \ redundancy due to the spatial\ncorrelation between sensor observations inspires\
    \ the techniques for in -network data aggregation\nand mining. By taking into\
    \ account the spatial correlation between data sampled by different\nsensors,\
    \ a wide class of specialized algorithms can be used to implement more efficient\
    \ spatial\ndata mining algorithms, as well as more efficient routing in the network.\
    \ [14]\nIn wireless sensor networks, information fusion, also called data f usion,\
    \ has been\ndeveloped for processing sensor data by filtering, aggregating, and\
    \ making inferences about the\ngathered data. Information fusion deals with the\
    \ combination of multiple sources to obtain\nimproved information: cheaper, greater\
    \ quality or gre ater relevance. Within the wireless sensor\nnetworks domain,\
    \ simple aggregation techniques such as maximum, minimum, and average, have\n\
    been developed for reducing the overall data traffic to save energy. [12]\nProceedings\
    \ of the 9th ICCAE-9 Conference, 29-31 May, 2012\nMQC 3\n11\nVisual sensors are\
    \ much more costly and time con suming than wireless sensors.\nTraditional wire\
    \ based systems are also much more expensive than wireless systems. In the year\n\
    2000, an inspection of the Golden Gate Bridge wired system cost $226,900 [7].\
    \ A large part of\nthis cost is due to the wires needed to cover the entire bridge.\
    \ Wireless sensors are economic and\nwork autonomously. Another special attribute\
    \ of wireless sensors is their ability of collocation of\ncomputing power with\
    \ the sensor, meaning that data can be analyzed and processed in the sensor ,\n\
    rather than it being used as a raw instrumentation tool. Several custom -based\
    \ algorithms have\nbeen designed for the sensors for damage detection and system\
    \ identification . [16]\nThe best damage detection wireless systems are those\
    \ that involve peer to pe er\ncommunication and distributed in network computation.\
    \ As long as it is taken into consideration\nthat the optimal spacing between\
    \ sensors must be met. Also communication between the sensors\nshould be kept\
    \ minimal as radio waves because this is the greate st consumer of power in the\n\
    sensor. The wireless sensor network also should be scalable so that it is not\
    \ limited to size or\nnumber of wireless nodes. A lot of research is geared towards\
    \ improving circuit environment to\nimprove fidelity, using low powered radio\
    \ and a better communication protocol for accurate time\nsynchronization and network\
    \ scalability. [15]\n3. CONCLUSION:\nVarious sensors are used to monitor structural\
    \ health as examined in this paper. The most\nefficient sensors for structural\
    \ health monit oring are Moiré fringe-based fringe optical fiber sensors\nand\
    \ wireless sensors. Moiré fringe-based fringe optical fiber sensors are preferred\
    \ due to their\nrobustness, reliability, and ability to adapt to dynamic structures.\
    \ Wireless sensors are used due to\ntheir economic feasibility, and increased\
    \ accuracy via distributed networking. MEMS sensing\ntechnologies have the advantage\
    \ of being able to reduce the signal processing load and power\nrequirements.\
    \ While MEMS  are appropriate for local SHM applications,\nreliability and\nmeasurement\
    \ accuracy are still problems that must be addressed for successful implementation\
    \ of\nMEMS technologies to SHM. In my opinion, the optimal use of network for\
    \ SHM would be the\nintegration of both Moiré fringe-based optical fiber sensors\
    \ with a wireless system in order to get\nthe advantages of both systems.\nREFERENCES:\n\

    data for maize SMC prediction was evaluated. • Three machine learning algorithms
    were tested to choose the best method for SMC estimation. • Mild to modest deficit
    irrigation treatments are more conducive to soil moisture monitoring. • RFR provide
    promising results across growing seasons, stages, and water status. Abstract Timely
    and accurate estimation of soil moisture content (SMC) is essential for precise
    irrigation management at the farm scale. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote
    sensing with a high spatiotemporal resolution has become a promising method for
    SMC monitoring. Many existing SMC models have only been tested at a specific crop
    growth stage using a single type of sensor, and the effects of growth stage and
    irrigation variation on SMC estimation accuracy remain unclear. To address these
    limitations, this study used UAV-based multimodal data to quantify SMC in a maize
    field under various levels of irrigation over two years using three machine learning
    algorithms (MLA): partial least squares regression (PLSR), K nearest neighbor
    (KNN), and random forest regression (RFR). The results demonstrated that multimodal
    data fusion improves the SMC estimation accuracy regardless of the MLA, especially
    the joint use of thermal and multispectral data. Among three SMC regression models,
    the RFR model produced the most accurate SMC estimation for the two growing seasons
    regardless of sensor combinations. The RFR model using all three types of data
    generated the most accurate and robust SMC estimation at the vegetative stage
    with R2 of 0.68 and 0.78, and rRMSE of 20.82% and 19.36% for 10- and 20-cm soil
    depths, respectively; it also produced the best SMC estimation accuracy under
    well-watered and mild to modest deficit irrigation treatments for both soil depths.

    stagesDeficit irrigation 1. Introduction Soil moisture content (SMC) plays an
    important role in agricultural, meteorological, climatological, and hydrological
    applications. A proper decision for precision irrigation is facilitated by accurate
    information about the SMC at an appropriate spatial and temporal scale. It is
    difficult to obtain spatially continuous observations using conventional in-situ
    methods of SMC measurement, such as the drying method (O’Kelly and Sivakumar,
    2014), time domain reflectometry (Robinson et al., 2003), neutron probe measurements
    (Evett and Steiner, 1995), and heat pulse measurements (Agliata et al., 2019),
    owing to discrete sampling points and high cost (Guo et al., 2022). With significant
    advances in remote sensing technology, satellite data have been widely applied
    to SMC estimation, particularly the optical (Serrano et al., 2019), thermal (Sohrabinia
    et al., 2014), and microwave (Chen et al., 2018) observations. Nevertheless, the
    application of satellite data for SMC estimation is limited by the low resolution
    and near-surface depth of the measurements. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology
    provides high spatio-temporal resolution data for estimating SMC (Hill et al.,
    2017). Several studies have successfully used UAV-based optical remote sensing
    for SMC estimation, mainly in the near-infrared and visible bands, to establish
    vegetation indices (VIs) (Kogan, 1990, Ge et al., 2021). Moreover, UAV-based thermal
    remote sensing has been shown to accurately predict farmland moisture (Li et al.,
    2022). Recent studies have shown that integrating multi-source remote sensing
    data can be effectively used for SMC estimation. For example, Wigmore et al. (2019)
    used multispectral (MS) and thermal (TIR) data from UAV remote sensing to calculate
    the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI), which was applied to predict
    surface SMC within mountain environments and obtained results with R2 = 0.55–0.76.
    Cheng et al. (2022) combined UAV-based multimodal data to estimate the SMC under
    high maize canopy coverage and obtained results with R2 = 0.78. Guo et al. (2022)
    combined microwave remote sensing and UAV multispectral remote sensing to monitor
    SMC in a winter wheat planting area and obtained results with R2 = 0.92. Nevertheless,
    microwaves cannot penetrate dense fields with tall plants such as maize. Therefore,
    UAV-based optical and thermal sensing has been widely used in current research
    on SMC estimations (Cheng et al., 2022). Because of the correlation between vegetation
    spectrum and SMC under agricultural crops, various parametric and non-parametric
    regression models have been implemented to monitor SMC (e.g., machine learning
    algorithms (MLA)) (Chen et al., 2021, Döpper et al., 2022). To improve the performance
    of SMC estimation in saline soils, partial least squares regression (PLSR) with
    thermal infrared data was used to build the SMC prediction model (Xu and Wang,
    2015). Ge et al. (2019) applied the random forest regression (RFR) algorithm to
    predict the SMC in winter wheat using UAV-based hyperspectral imagery. Consequently,
    choosing a proper regression algorithm is essential for achieving accurate SMC
    predictions for dense vegetation. Generally, most approaches to estimating SMC
    using a combination of UAV remote sensing and MLA have been applied at a specific
    growth stage or a single growth day (Cheng et al., 2022, Guo et al., 2022). However,
    the dynamics of VIs and SMC continuously change over time. Additionally, one SMC
    value may correspond to multiple VIs and thus may affect the performance of the
    SMC estimation. However, only a limited number of studies have been conducted
    to monitor SMC using UAV remote sensing and MLA during the entire crop-growing
    season. Furthermore, SMC estimation models were only tested and trained for one
    year, and several samples (Seo et al., 2021). Crops are susceptible to changes
    in SMC and spectral reflectance of maize canopy varies with growth stage and soil
    water content. Although UAV remote sensing has been applied to SMC prediction
    at arid and semi-arid sites (Babaeian et al., 2021), the irrigation regimes are
    the same; therefore, verification of SMC is limited. Few studies have focused
    on different water treatments for crops. Thus, the performance of SMC estimation
    using VIs and MLA at different growth stages of crops under different water treatments
    is still unclear. Based on the above analysis, this study used the SMC under the
    maize planting area as the research object and acquired RGB, MS, and TIR data
    at different growth stages of maize under different irrigation treatments for
    cross-year SMC estimation. The specific objectives were to 1) compare the potential
    of UAV multiple types of sensors in the SMC prediction model by MLA during the
    whole growing season, and determine an optimal model, 2) evaluate the robustness
    of SMC estimation using the optimal model for different irrigation treatments,
    and3) examine the performance of SMC estimation using the optimal model at different
    growth stages. 2. Material 2.1. Field site description The field site was located
    in Ordos, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. The climate is semi-arid, with
    an elevation of 1010 m. Maize (cv. ‘Junkai 918’) was planted in May, tasseled
    in July, and harvested for silage in September 2018 and 2019. The soil type was
    loamy sand (80.7 % sand, 13.7 % powder, and 5.6 % clay) with a field capacity
    of 20.3 % and a soil bulk density of 1.56 g cm−3. The row and planting spacing
    were 0.58 m and 0.25 m in 2018, and 0.40 m and 0.25 m in 2019. The entire field
    was irrigated with a center pivot sprinkler system (Valmont Industries, Inc.,
    Nebraska, USA) and divided into five regions with different irrigation treatments
    throughout the growing seasons (May to September) of 2018 and 2019 (Fig. 1a).
    Each irrigation treatment included three replicated individual plots (6 m × 6
    m) (Fig. 1b). Deficit irrigation was applied independently during the vegetative
    (V), reproductive (R) and maturation (M) stages. The treatment was named based
    on the target percentage of evapotranspiration of non-stressed crops during each
    growth stage. For example, a treatment (40/100/80) indicated the treatment received
    irrigation of 40 %, 100 %, and 80 % of maximum evapotranspiration during the V,
    R, and M growth stages, respectively. Here we use TR1-TR5 to represent treatments
    at five different irrigation levels (from maximum to minimum irrigation amounts),
    respectively (Table 1). The amount of irrigation and precipitation (Table 1) were
    measured using a flowmeter and rain gauge cylinders with three replications. Download

    Field measurements A soil auger was used to collect soil samples which were then
    used to measure gravimetric SMC (SMCg) at depths of 10 and 20 cm. To ensure accurate
    measurements, each plot was divided into 30 equal subplots. Each time, three subplots
    were randomly selected among the 30 subplots to measure SMC data to avoid repetition,
    as shown in Fig. 2. The average of the three measurements was the in-situ measured
    SMC for a given plot. SMC measurements were performed after the UAV flight campaign
    in the field. A total of 300 in-situ measured SMC for a given plot were collected
    from 2018 to 2019. The volumetric soil moisture content (SMC, cm3cm−3) was calculated
    as follows: (1) Where ρ represents soil bulk density (g cm−3). Undisturbed soil
    samples at 0–20 cm were collected using a cutting ring (diameter, 5 cm; height,
    5 cm). The samples were then dried to a constant weight in an oven at 105 ℃. The
    measured weight was converted into standard units (g cm−3). For example, the measured
    soil moisture at two soil depths along with the rainfall/irrigation in 2018 TR1
    were shown in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (217KB) Download : Download

    (DJI, Shenzhen, China) platform was developed to carry UAV high-resolution RGB
    (DJI Technology Co., Shenzhen, China), MS RedEdge (MicaSense Inc., USA), and TIR
    (FLIR Systems, USA) sensors (Fig. 4). The details of each camera are listed in
    Table 2. The UAV was used to capture images between 11:00 and 14:00 under low
    wind speeds and clear sky conditions during the entire maize growing season in
    2018 (10 d) and 2019 (10 d) (Table 3). The flight heights were set at 70 m and
    the flight path resulted in 85 % front and side overlap. The spatial resolutions
    of RGB, MS and TIR images were 3, 5, and 9 cm, respectively. During the UAV flights,
    a MicaSense (MicaSense, Seattle, WA, USA) calibrated reflectance panel and the
    temperatures of ground objects (e.g., black and white cotton fabric pieces, wet/dry
    soil, crop canopy, water, etc.) collected simultaneously were used for radiometric
    correction of the MS and TIR imagery, respectively. Six ground control points
    (GCPs) were placed for georeferencing imagery from UAV multi-sensors. Download

    were preprocessed into orthomosaic maps using the Pix4Dmapper software (Pix4DInc.,
    Lausanne, Switzerland). The digital numbers of the raw multispectral images were
    later converted to reflectance values. During post-processing, the parameters
    of the thermal images were adjusted according to the environmental conditions,
    such as air temperature and humidity, to conduct radiometric conversion. The ground-measured
    temperatures were compared with the corresponding temperatures from the UAV thermal
    imagery, which were converted using a linear model (Fig. 5). Download : Download

    are listed in Table 4 and in the subsequent sections 3.2.1 to 3.2.3. To relate
    different types of data with corresponding soil moisture content, the average
    pixel values for each of the RGB, MS, and TIR features listed in Table 4 were

    3.2.1. RGB features Fractional vegetation cover (FVC), the proportion of green
    vegetation on the ground surface, was extracted from the RGB imagery using the
    Otsu (maximum between-class variance) method (Otsu, 1979, Zhang et al., 2019).
    The classified maize pixels were divided by the total pixels for a given plot,
    and the formula for the FVC calculation is presented as follows: (2) In addition,
    the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) (Haralick et al., 1973) was employed
    to extract texture features from the RGB in this study and then used as input
    data for SMC prediction. The GLCM-based texture information, that is, variance
    (VA), contrast (CO), entropy (EN), correlation (COR), mean (ME), homogeneity (HO),
    dissimilarity (DS), and second moment (SM), was computed using the ENVI 5.3 software
    (Table 4). 3.2.2. Multispectral features A set of UAV-based VIs, previously used
    to estimate the SMC, was extracted from the raw spectral bands and is listed in
    Table 4. Additionally, GLCM was extracted from the NIR and red edge bands using
    the same methods as described above. 3.2.3. Thermal features Normalized relative
    canopy temperature (NRCT) was derived from UAV thermal infrared imagery. The NRCT
    was used to assess crop water status (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020). The detailed
    formula for NRCT is as follows: (3) where Ti represents the UAV-based temperature
    of the i-th pixel and Tmin (Tmax) represents the lowest (highest) UAV-based temperature
    in the entire field. Moreover, we applied the TVDI to predict SMC, which is based
    on the simplified surface temperature-vegetation index (Ts-NDVI) space method
    (Fig. 5) and has been commonly implemented to characterize water status and SMC
    (Sandholt et al., 2002, Liu et al., 2008). TVDI is calculated as follows: (4)
    (6) where Tsmax (Tsmin) is the highest (lowest) Ts observation and adry, awet
    bdry, and bwet are the intercept and slope of the dry (wet) edge (Fig. 6), respectively.

    from the thermal-based NRCT using the methods described in Section 3.2.1 and Section
    3.2.2. 3.3. Soil moisture content prediction model 3.3.1. Modeling methods All
    the input features in Table 4 were extracted for the 15 sampling plots (Fig. 1,
    Fig. 2) and then matched to the in situ measured SMC of each plot. A total of
    300 in-situ measured SMC for a given plot were collected during the UAV flights
    from 2018 to 2019 and used for training and testing the performance of the model
    developed in this study. SMC estimation models were developed using MLA: PLSR
    (Rischbeck et al., 2016), K nearest neighbor (KNN) (Shahabul Alam and Elshorbagy,
    2015), and RFR (Cheng et al., 2022). The RFR algorithm for SMC estimation was
    compared with the PLSR and KNN algorithms to select an optimal SMC prediction
    method. The MLA was implemented using Python with the Scikit-learn library. For
    a fair and uniform comparison of machine learning methods, 80 % of randomly selected
    input features and SMC data (240 SMC measurements) were used as training samples,
    and the remaining 20 % (60 SMC measurements) were used as unseen samples to test
    the performance of the prediction algorithms. 3.3.2. Validation methods The accuracy
    of the SMC estimation algorithms was verified by fivefold cross-validation; therefore,
    240 SMC measurements were used independently for model validation. Then, the average
    accuracy was obtained. The model performance was evaluated using the coefficient
    of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative root-mean-square
    error (rRMSE). The detailed workflow, from feature extraction to model building
    and validation, is shown in Fig. 7. First, different features were extracted from
    three types of imagery, such as FVC, GLCM, and vegetation indices. Then, three
    machine learning methods with the above features as inputs were used to establish
    SMC prediction models and the measured SMC data were used for model training and
    testing. Finally, the applicability of the SMC prediction models under different
    growth stages (V, R, and M) and irrigation levels (TR1–TR5) was analyzed. Download

    Workflow of multimodal data extraction and modeling. 4. Results 4.1. Estimation
    accuracy of soil moisture content As shown in Table 5, generally, RFR exhibited
    the highest estimation accuracy compared to PLSR and KNN, with R2 ranging from
    0.42 to 0.61 for 10-cm soil depth, and 0.41 to 0.65 for 20-cm soil depth, respectively.
    The best SMC prediction was observed in the case of using the combination of RGB,
    MS, and TIR data, with R2 = 0.61 and 0.65, RMSE = 1.9 % and 2.1 %, as well as
    rRMSE = 23.4 % and 26.3 % for 10- and 20-cm soil depths, respectively. When using
    data from a single sensor, the multispectral sensor produced better accuracy in
    SMC prediction than the thermal and RGB sensors did. Table 5. Validation of different

    The best result in terms of R2, RMSE and RMSE% values through different sensors
    with various modeling methods are boldfaced. Generally, all MLA produced a gradually
    increasing R2 and a decreasing rRMSE with an increasing number of sensors (Table
    5). This is because all the methods can effectively fuse information from multimodal
    data. The accuracy of the SMC estimation model based on MS sensors, a combination
    of MS and RGB sensors, or a combination of RGB and TIR sensors was similar at
    both soil depths (R2 = 0.3–0.57, rRMSE = 25.3–34.8 %). The joint use of TIR and
    MS data showed a higher estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.41–0.64), making it more suitable
    for SMC prediction (Table 5). However, the combination of RGB and TIR data had
    a relatively higher accuracy, regardless of the MLA (Table 5). The inclusion of
    RGB data in the combination of MS and TIR data slightly increased the estimation
    accuracy, With PLSR, R2 increased only by 0.02 for 10-cm soil depth while using
    KNN, R2 increased by 0.08 for 20-cm soil depth. Fig. 8, Fig. 9 show the observed
    and estimated SMC using the RFR for various combinations of UAV data for both
    10- and 20-cm soil depths, respectively. The estimation result of the 20-cm soil
    depth was slightly better than that of the 10-cm soil depth regardless of the
    combination of sensors, indicating that the estimation accuracy of SMC was similar
    at the two depths during the entire growth period. Download : Download high-res

    shows the performance of the RFR model at V, R, and M stages. The SMC at the V
    stage was the most accurate estimation in both 2018 and 2019, regardless of the
    soil depth. For the 10-cm depth SMC estimation model, R2 and rRMSE were 0.68 and
    20.82 %; for the 20-cm depth SMC estimation model, R2 and rRMSE were 0.78 and
    19.36 %, respectively. At the R stage, the RFR model exhibited the poorest performance,
    with an R2 of 0.37. Moreover, the SMC estimation accuracies at each stage for
    the two depths were similar and comparable. Among them, the estimation model overestimated
    under low SMC and underestimated under high SMC in both years. Therefore, the
    differences in irrigation amount and meteorological conditions, especially precipitation,
    may decrease the accuracy of SMC estimation using the RFR model and UAV-based
    multimodal data. Download : Download high-res image (204KB) Download : Download

    prediction for different water treatments Fig. 11, Fig. 12 show the performance
    of the RFR model across different irrigation treatments. In this study, we divided
    the irrigation treatments into five levels (TR1-TR5 from high to low). The optimal
    estimation using the RFR algorithm was achieved for TR1 with R2 and rRMSE of 0.65
    and 21.33 % at 10-cm soil depth, and R2 and rRMSE of 0.76 and 18.61 % at 20-cm
    soil depth, respectively. This indicates that the RFR model based on UAV-based
    multimodal data can provide a comparable estimation of SMC for different soil
    depths throughout the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. Furthermore, the accuracy
    of the SMC prediction model under the severe-stressed irrigation treatment (TR5)
    was relatively low (R2 = 0.35–0.41, rRMSE = 21.22 %–33.26 %) compared to TR2–TR4
    irrigation levels. It can be inferred that the RFR model utilizing multimodal
    information is more applicable to mild water stress treatments. Generally, the
    rRMSE for the 20-cm depth SMC estimation had an average value of 25.40 %, which
    was slightly greater than the corresponding value of 24.38 % for the 10-cm depth
    SMC estimation. At a depth of 10 cm, the SMC estimation had an R2 = 0.41–0.65
    with an average value of 0.53, and at 20 cm depth, R2 = 0.35–0.76 with a mean
    value of 0.56. Therefore, the SMC estimation exhibited similar performance at
    both depths. Download : Download high-res image (144KB) Download : Download full-size

    irrigation treatments when irrigation regimes were different, especially for the
    10-cm depth SMC maps on 23 Aug 2018 (the average of TR1 = 11.39 % and TR5 = 9.33
    %) and 20-cm depth SMC map on 26 Jul 2019 (the average of TR1 = 12.21 %, TR2 =
    10.35 %, and TR5 = 9.24 %). Meanwhile, the SMC values for the different treatments
    were similar when irrigation regimes were the same, for example, the 10-cm depth
    SMC on 26 Jul 2018 (the average of TR1–TR5 = 10.35 %–10.77 %). Generally, the
    RFR model with the fusion of RGB, TIR, and MS data can be used to characterize
    the spatial distribution of the SMC, which provides a reference for precision
    irrigation. Download : Download high-res image (521KB) Download : Download full-size

    Several studies have already shown that UAV remote sensing can be effectively
    employed to predict SMC at a farmland scale (Table 6), but most experiments had
    only focused on a single day or specific growth stage in the growing season (Cheng
    et al., 2022, Ge et al., 2021). In this study, UAV-based multimodal data were
    used to build an SMC prediction model throughout the growing season. The fusion
    of multimodal data (RGB, MS, and TIR) produced the best accuracy regardless of
    the modeling method, with significant accuracy of approximately 2 % RMSE. These
    results agree with those of previous studies, such as Cheng et al. (2022), who
    also found that texture, temperature, and spectral information offered unique
    and complementary information conducive to SMC prediction. The joint use of TIR
    and MS data showed a higher estimation accuracy, making it more suitable for SMC
    prediction (Table 5). This may be because the thermal-based temperature data can
    solve asymptotic saturation problems of MS data at maturity stages (Rischbeck
    et al., 2016). However, the inclusion of RGB data in the MS data slightly improved
    the estimation accuracy of the PLSR, KNN and RFR algorithms. These results indicate
    that the MS and RGB data exhibit information overlap and homogeneity (Pelizari
    et al., 2018). Because of its indirect linkage with soil moisture under vegetation
    conditions, optical and thermal observations are suitable for fitting nonlinear
    models to retrieve soil moisture, particularly MLA (Ge et al., 2019, Guan et al.,
    2022). Consequently, we tested three MLA to estimate the SMC throughout the growing
    season for two years. The results showed that the RFR model is more robust for
    multiple sensors at both 10- and 20-cm depths, compared to the other MLA (Table
    5 and Fig. 8, Fig. 9). Consistent with previous research, the RFR method can overcome
    redundant information and overfitting (Chen et al., 2019, Hu et al., 2018). Table

    2022 Owing to vegetation interference, especially in conditions of dense vegetation
    coverage, optical and thermal infrared remote sensing may not be able to obtain
    soil status. However, the severe water stress at any crop growth stage of maize
    directly affects crop physiology, growth, and developmental processes (e.g., leaf
    curl and senescence, increased canopy temperature, and decreased chlorophyll content),
    resulting in phenotype, spectral and temperature variations of the canopy (Kullberg
    et al., 2017). The above changes provide a theoretical basis for indirect monitoring
    of soil moisture distribution. In this case, the SMC has generally been estimated
    based on status of vegetation (Zhang and Zhou, 2016, Cheng et al., 2022). Thus,
    this approach bypasses the uncertainty in describing the physical process, which
    makes this method simple and feasible. The RFR-based multimodal model performed
    robustly in the cross-year soil moisture estimation at the V stage for both depths
    (Fig. 10). This is because the growth characteristics (such as canopy structure,
    greenness, and plant water status) that are highly correlated with VIs are sensitive
    to soil moisture at the V stage (Ma et al., 2018). Conversely, the RFR-based multimodal
    method produced a relatively low accuracy in the cross-year SMC estimation at
    the other stages (Fig. 10). This is because high vegetation coverage may lead
    to saturation of the optical sensors (Wallace, 2013), resulting in an overall
    bias in the estimation. Previous studies have shown that UAV thermal imagery can
    be used to detect crop water stress (Zhang et al., 2019) that responds to insufficient
    soil moisture in the root zone (Sampathkumar et al., 2012). However, optical and
    thermal-based indices may be conservative indicators under high vegetation coverage
    and not able to detect the droughts caused by water stress or rainfall anomalies
    immediately. Consequently, the top layer of the soil profile had the greatest
    error in estimating soil moisture at the R stage. The accuracy at the M stage
    was lower than that reported by Cheng et al. (2022) with R2 = 0.78. This difference
    is related to climate, water stress, irrigation method, cultivar, and planting
    density. Further research regarding the impact of climatic and field management
    conditions on SMC predictions should be conducted for different crop species.
    Deficit irrigation has been proposed as a strategy for maintaining yield while
    reducing agricultural water use (Al-Ghobari and Dewidar, 2018). The results showed
    that the RFR-based multimodal method performed robustly throughout the growing
    season under well-watered and mild to moderate-stressed irrigation treatments,
    indicating that the model built using UAV multimodal data is feasible and effective
    for estimating SMC (Fig. 11, Fig. 12). However, under the full-irrigation treatment,
    there was an underestimation under wet conditions (high SMC) for both years. This
    is because the meteorological conditions and the increase in canopy coverage may
    decrease the SMC estimation accuracy when using multimodal data (Cheng et al.,
    2022). Furthermore, under the severe-stressed irrigation treatment, the SMC was
    overestimated in the low-SMC region for both years. This is because of the VI-saturation
    issue and underestimation of the water stress status (Vergara-Díaz et al., 2016,
    Virnodkar et al., 2020). Additionally, the estimation accuracy of SMC by the RFR-based
    multimodal model at the 20-cm depth was similar to that at the 10-cm depth under
    different irrigation treatments, indicating that the estimation method is effective
    in utilizing multimodal information for both soil depths. The results showed that
    the RFR-based multimodal method outperformed the other regression methods under
    different irrigation treatments across the years. The model using RFR with combined
    RGB, TIR, and MS data can be used for SMC estimation under well-watered and mild
    to moderate deficit irrigation treatments; therefore, this SMC map can be applied
    to design optimal regulated deficit irrigation strategies because maize productivity
    is improved by moderate deficit irrigation (Zou et al., 2021). Meanwhile, in agricultural
    production, farmers are most concerned about soil moisture status in the days
    after irrigation/rainfall. Our study has proven the potential of the RFR-based
    multimodal method to improve irrigation scheduling by precisely evaluating the
    SMC. Further work is suggested to investigate other soil types, which may determine
    the applicability and transferability of the method. However, the high deficit
    irrigation treatment led to low accuracy of the prediction model owing to optical
    saturation issues and redundant datasets. Recently technologies have been used
    to extract related information from UAV-based images for crop yield prediction
    using deep-learning algorithms (Ma et al., 2021). For instance, Maimaitijiang
    et al. (2020) reported that UAV-based multimodal data using deep learning methods
    improved yield prediction model accuracy compared to MLA, such as RFR and PLSR.
    Therefore, further work should investigate the generality of deep learning-based
    methods for SMC estimation. The application of our technique and prediction models
    to other climatological conditions should be investigated further. 6. Conclusions
    The ability of fused multimodal data (RGB, MS, and TIR data) derived from UAV-based
    multi-sensors for SMC estimation by MLA was investigated under different levels
    of irrigation. The major conclusions are as follows: 1. MS data outperformed RGB
    and TIR data for single sensor-based SMC prediction during the entire growing
    season. The joint use of TIR and MS data showed great potential for SMC prediction
    with higher estimation accuracy. Generally, the combination of all types of sensors
    using the RFR algorithm exhibited the most accurate estimation of the SMC, regardless
    of the modeling method. 2. The RFR method generated the most accurate and robust
    SMC estimations at the vegetative stage, followed by the maturation stage. However,
    they produced less accurate SMC estimation under high vegetation coverage during
    the reproductive stage. Additionally, the RFR method exhibited strong adaptability
    to the two soil depths (10- and 20-cm) with similar prediction accuracy. 3. The
    RFR method produced the best estimation accuracy under well-watered and mild to
    modest deficit irrigated treatments. However, they produced less accurate SMC
    estimation under severe deficit irrigated treatments. CRediT authorship contribution

    Location: Giza, Egypt SECTION I. Introduction Drought, issues with crop quality
    and production, and challenges with yield forecast [1] are just some of the issues
    that modern agriculture must contend with. According to United Nations'' Food
    and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates, the global population will reach
    8 billion by 2025, an increase of three people per second (or 250,000 people per
    day), and rise to an estimated 9.6 billion by 2050 [2]. Farmers need to drastically
    expand food production while protecting the environment and efficiently using
    natural resources to keep up with the growing global population. Still, they can
    not achieve this independently, and traditional farming methods are not equipped
    to handle the task. To that end, technological advancements are crucial in meeting
    the global population’s expanding dietary requirements. Farmers need to know how
    much water their crops will use, when that water will be used, and how much water
    will evaporate from the surface of lakes and dams for free [3]. The ultimate goal
    of smart irrigation management is to achieve efficient and effective water use,
    making it an increasingly significant administrative activity. Good irrigation
    management aims to apply the appropriate amount of water at the appropriate time.
    New and improved technologies are helping the vast majority of people in many
    different ways. The Internet of Things (IoT) and data analysis through machine
    learning [4] significantly enhance people’s ability to shape their environments
    in their daily lives. IoT and machine learning are widely used in the agro-industrial
    sector for diagnosing and managing smart irrigation systems, both of which supply
    crucial data for successful farming. Smart irrigation that efficiently uses water
    could benefit from IoT-based solutions, which have already proven useful in many
    areas of the agricultural environment [5]. An intelligent irrigation system must
    consider soil moisture, precipitation, and evaporation. A smart irrigation system
    is proposed in this paper, which would utilize machine learning algorithms and
    the IoT to conserve water and power. Soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    rainfall are just some variables the system’s array of sensors may track. A machine
    learning system is fed data from these sensors about the crop moisture level to
    formulate an ideal irrigation schedule. In addition, the system incorporates IoT
    devices, which provide full transparency by enabling remote user control and system
    monitoring. The smart irrigation system is effective because it uses machine learning
    algorithms to analyze crop data in real time and predict plant development and
    harvest. The benefits of the smart irrigation system are discussed in this study
    as well, including decreased water consumption, increased crop production, decreased
    energy consumption, and decreased operational expenses. The rest of this paper
    is organized in the following manner. Section 2 reviews the related work and section
    3 presents the proposed methodology in detail. While section 4 presents the experimental
    evaluation, section 5 presents the system prototype. Finally, the paper is concluded
    in section 6. SECTION II. Related Work IoT, machine learning capabilities, data
    analytics and mining [6], and wireless technologies [7] contribute to developing
    smart agriculture management. Many works presented a lot of suggestions as well
    as several approaches to general agricultural activities that make use of this
    new technology. In [8], an overview of agricultural irrigation systems that use
    the Internet of Things is presented. In their literature study, the authors analyze
    wireless technologies, sensor nodes, and IoT systems alongside the most important
    indicators for characterizing water quality in irrigation, soil, and weather situations
    [9] and discuss the methods used to monitor and manage automated watering systems
    like sprinklers. In order to attain precision irrigation for increased food safety
    and water conservation, the authors offer new insights into how existing monitoring
    and advanced control systems might be developed. Critical agricultural applications
    are identified and examined, and the potential of IoT technology, practices, and
    future research are all explored in [10]. The research projects reviewed the state
    of the art in smart agriculture monitoring in both laboratory and field settings.
    In [11], a mathematical model was provided for corn tempering drying that considers
    the thermo-physical heterogeneity of the kernel’s components. In [12], an infrastructure
    for implementing smart irrigation systems was presented, utilizing LoRaWAN and
    fog computing. In order to determine when to irrigate, the proposed system exploited
    IoT nodes that communicate with nearby fog computing nodes and a distant cloud.
    No system has been proposed where data can be stored and tracked locally. According
    to the results of their analysis, cloud computing is more expensive. In [13],
    a Windows GUI program was described for multifractal analysis of soil and plant
    structures. In [14], a user-friendly smartphone app, REUTIVAR-App, was introduced
    for fertigation scheduling in olive trees with recycled water. Farm-scale irrigation
    and fertilization recommendations are also tracked daily in real-time as part
    of their research. However, the study did not focus on IoT uses. In proposing
    an IoT platform, the authors in [15] showed how to collect, analyze, and visualize
    sensor data for use in smart farming. In [16], a proposal was made for monitoring
    environmental parameters in chicken farms using inexpensive gear and software.
    Several experiments were also conducted to contrast the proposed prototype with
    existing commercial options. Intending to realize long-term and cost-effective
    monitoring, the authors in [17] proposed a soil environment monitoring system
    based on RFID sensors and LoRa for tracking soil’s temperature, moisture level,
    and chloride ion concentration. The authors of [18] present a method for recommending
    when and how much water should be used for irrigation by combining agglomerative
    clustering with machine learning methods like regression trees and support vector
    machines. The recommendation system did well on its collected data set and the
    publically available agricultural data set. The authors of [19] created an IoT
    and a data-driven irrigation system. Predictions of soil moisture content are
    performed using this method and compared to those made using alternative state-space
    models. Results show that the suggested strategy outperforms the status quo, and
    predictions for soil moisture content are positive. Since a water resource is
    most misused in irrigation, monitoring and controlling the agricultural field
    or irrigation are key factors to be met in an efficient, smart irrigation system
    [20]. The widespread availability of mobile phones makes this possibility possible.
    For off-site, real-time field data monitoring, an IoT-based strategy was developed
    and operated [21]. In [22], the authors proposed a system that used the ThingSpeak
    cloud platform based on the IoT to enable remote monitoring and control of the
    irrigation system. By allowing for remote monitoring and control, the system made
    the farmer’s job easier in terms of optimizing the irrigation system. Incorporating
    foresight utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence is a hot topic
    of study. Modern irrigation techniques are necessary to prevent water shortages
    [23]. The next section details the suggested methodology and the basic prerequisites
    needed to implement it. In order to predict the agronomist’s irrigation suggestions,
    this study [24] set out to establish a model that incorporates his irrigation
    planning process. Machine learning techniques applied to an integrated dataset
    from multiple sources allowed us to accomplish our goal. The dataset included
    agronomist-determined irrigation levels and sensor-based characteristics, weather-based
    features, and features describing plots. Three machine learning techniques, the
    standard linear regression, the nonparametric gradient boosted regression trees,
    and the nonparametric boosted trees classifiers, were used to build various irrigation
    recommendation prediction models utilizing this comprehensive dataset. Eight distinct
    feature subsets were used to train the models. Predicting agricultural yields
    and water availability using a hybrid of the wrapper feature selection methodology
    and the PART classification technique is offered [25], called WPART. There are
    four phases to the proposed system: the first is data collection, wherein environmental
    indicator data is gathered via the IoT system; the second is data preprocessing;
    the third is feature selection, wherein the wrapper feature selection approach
    is used to analyze environmental indicators and select the effective indicators
    of the farming system; and the fourth is drought prediction, wherein PART supervised
    machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the selected indicators. SECTION
    III. The Proposed System Architecture Figure 1 depicts the proposed system’s design.
    There are three phases: Data collection, ML model building, API integration, and
    irrigation scheduling. The watering scheduler is improved by the data fusion model
    used in the cloud service. The data model can be customized for various use cases
    by selecting and feeding in data from specialized domains of knowledge. In addition,
    the watering schedule may be monitored and adjusted remotely using a web interface.
    Fig. 1. The proposed system architecture Show All A. Data collection The smart
    irrigation system comprises various components for efficient data collection.
    Sensors such as a soil moisture sensor and a DH11 sensor for temperature and humidity
    air measurements are deployed in the field. These sensors are connected to an
    Arduino Uno microcontroller, which serves as the central control unit. The microcontroller
    collects real-time data from the sensors, facilitating data processing and communication
    with other system components. A Node MCU is also utilized to establish an internet
    connection, enabling data transmission to the cloud. The collected sensor data,
    including soil moisture levels, temperature, and humidity, is stored in a database
    server, providing a reliable and scalable solution for data management. B. ML
    model building Once the data is collected from the sensors and stored in the database
    server, it is transmitted to the cloud for processing and analysis. In the cloud-based
    environment, data undergoes rigorous preprocessing to ensure its optimal quality
    and relevance, a crucial step given the significance of smart irrigation systems.
    The initial phase involves addressing missing values, often a result of intermittent
    connectivity or sensor malfunctions. To achieve uniformity in the disparate measurements,
    data such as temperature and humidity are standardized using Min-Max scaling.
    Further, categorical variables, like soil types, undergo a transformation process
    called one-hot encoding, making them digestible for machines without implying
    any ordinal significance. A pivotal step in the preprocessing journey is the partitioning
    of data into training and test subsets. This division is paramount to avert overfitting,
    a situation where a model might excel on its training data but falter drastically
    with unfamiliar data. By training the model on one subset and testing it on an
    unseen one, a more realistic gauge of the model’s performance in real-world scenarios
    is achieved. Once preprocessed, the data is utilized to train a machine learning
    model hosted in the cloud, with the test data serving the purpose of model evaluation.
    The cloud platform also hosts an API for users to access system functionalities.
    It stores and manages the system’s data, ensuring scalability, reliability, and
    security. Additionally, it enables integration with other services and applications,
    acting as a centralized hub for data processing, analysis, and decision-making
    in the smart irrigation system. Once the collected sensor data goes through a
    comprehensive analysis process in the cloud platform, the smart irrigation system
    leverages the power of machine learning to ensure accurate and efficient irrigation
    decisions. A labeled dataset is then prepared, incorporating historical sensor
    data and corresponding irrigation procedures, providing valuable insights into
    when to activate or deactivate irrigation based on sensor readings. The machine
    learning model is trained to capture the intricate relationships between sensor
    readings and irrigation requirements using sophisticated machine learning algorithms
    such as decision trees (DT), support vector machines (SVM), or logistic regression
    (LR). Once trained, the model is deployed in the cloud platform, enabling real-time
    inference for predicting optimal irrigation actions based on the learned patterns
    and relationships. This intelligent decision-making significantly improves water
    efficiency and empowers farmers with precise and timely irrigation strategies.
    C. API integration API integration is critical in enabling real-time decision-making
    for irrigation control in a smart irrigation system. By integrating machine learning
    models with a cloud server through APIs, the system can harness the power of data
    analysis and predictive algorithms to optimize irrigation operations. Users can
    retrieve sensor readings, watering recommendations, and system configurations
    through an API. It allows users to access real-time data, monitor sensor readings,
    configure irrigation settings, and switch between manual and automatic modes.
    The API provides a unified interface, enabling seamless integration with external
    services or applications. This integration allows users to interact with the system
    and make informed decisions. The API serves as a key component to share data,
    control the system, and facilitate smart irrigation system integration with other
    systems or applications. D. Irrigation scheduling The smart irrigation system
    works automatically by harnessing the power of machine learning. By integrating
    machine learning models with the system, it is automatically decides to pump or
    not without user intervention. In addition to its automatic capabilities, the
    smart irrigation system also provides manual control through an IoT cloud Arduino
    service, such as a web application. Users can access the web application interface,
    which allows them to monitor sensor readings, adjust irrigation settings, and
    manually control irrigation actions. By selecting the manual mode and using the
    web application, users can override the automatic irrigation decisions made by
    the machine learning models. They have the flexibility to customize irrigation
    parameters based on their preferences or specific crop needs. For instance, users
    can choose to activate or deactivate the irrigation system, adjust the watering
    duration, or set specific irrigation schedules. The manual control feature provides
    users with a higher level of control and adaptability, allowing them to fine-tune
    the irrigation process to suit their specific requirements or respond to unexpected
    environmental changes. SECTION IV. Results and discussions A. Dataset profiling
    The dataset consists of six attributes; CropType, CropDays, SoilMoisture, Temperature,
    Humidity, and Irrigation. The dataset attributes description is depicted in Table
    1. The dataset \"Crop Irrigation Scheduling,\" used in this work, was downloaded
    from Kaggle [26]. TABLE 1. The dataset attributes description Irrigation decisions
    are crucial in agriculture to ensure that crops receive the right amount of water
    at the right time. This attribute may contain data or actions related to irrigation
    management. These attributes collectively provide essential information for managing
    and optimizing crop cultivation, irrigation, and overall agricultural practices.
    They are valuable for making data-driven decisions in agriculture and optimizing
    crop yield and quality. B. Results When comparing the results of decision trees,
    logistic regression, and vector machine support models, their performance based
    on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and accuracy are analyzed. The experimental evaluation
    method is the confusion matrix shown in Fig. 2 for the classifier decision tree,
    as an example. The mentioned evaluation measures are computed from the confusion
    matrix [27]. Fig. 2. The confusion matrix of the decision tree classifier Show
    All The values of computed evaluation measures, accuracy, precision, recall, and
    f1 score are depicted in Table 2. Table 2. The performance measures of different
    classification model Based on these comparisons, the DT model performs better
    overall, achieving high precision, recall, and F1-score for the results as shown
    in the Fig. 3. In the development of our smart irrigation system using IoT and
    machine learning techniques, the Decision Tree classifier played a pivotal role
    in decision-making processes, achieving the highest performance. While various
    training parameters can be adjusted to refine the performance of Decision Trees,
    for the scope of this study, we relied on the default parameters to ensure consistency
    and replicability. Specifically, the criterion for the quality of a split was
    set to \"gini\" which measures the impurity of the data, the maximum depth of
    the tree was left undefined allowing the tree to expand until all leaves are pure,
    the minimum samples split was set to 2, and the minimum samples leaf was set to
    1. By employing these default values, a foundational benchmark for the system’s
    performance is established, which can serve as a reference point for future iterations
    and optimizations. C. Comparison with literature This section presents and discusses
    a comparison with work in the literature that is related to our proposed method.
    In the realm of agri-tech, our work underscores the promise of combining IoT with
    machine learning. Iorliam et al. [28] tested various models on IoT-based irrigation
    data, where logistic regression reached 71.76% accuracy, and the support vector
    machine achieved 90.21%. Interestingly, our decision trees model’s 89.68% accuracy
    is nearly on par with their SVM results. Tas et al. [29] crafted a versatile,
    efficient irrigation system. Using sensors to track soil humidity, temperature,
    and rain, they tested several models. The KNN model was most impressive, with
    a 98.3% accuracy and 0.12 RMSE. Notably, their dataset differs from ours. Research
    [30] proposed an advanced Irrigation Water Quality Prediction (IWQP) model utilizing
    convolutional neural architectures. When stacked against Logistic Regression (LR),
    Support Vector Regression (SVR), and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), their approach
    leaned more towards traditional machine learning, aligning with low-capability
    IoT devices. Mishra and Somkunwar [31] advocated for logistic regression in smart
    irrigation, considering various parameters. In comparison, our various models,
    including logistic regression, could be marginally (0.0553%) more precise. Fig.
    3. The comparison between DT, SVM and LR Show All SECTION V. System Prototyping
    As shown in Fig. 4, a system prototype is presented that synergizes IoT technology
    and machine learning to optimize water usage and augment crop yield. By seamlessly
    integrating sensors, a microcontroller, and cloud connectivity, the prototype
    continuously monitors and analyzes environmental data to generate adaptive irrigation
    schedules. Through real-time decision-making and remote control functionality,
    the objective is to enhance sustainability and efficiency in agricultural practices.
    The prototype of the smart irrigation system was meticulously implemented in a

    conditions, including temperature and humidity. These sensors provided essential
    information for determining optimal watering requirements based on prevailing

    harnessed advanced machine learning algorithms to effectively analyze sensor data
    and make accurate predictions and decisions regarding irrigation schedules. These
    algorithms were meticulously trained using historical data to discern irrigation
    patterns and optimize watering schedules based on the unique requirements of different
    crop types. Arduino IoT Cloud: The Arduino IoT Cloud platform served as the central
    hub for efficient data management and seamless system control. It empowered users
    with real-time monitoring capabilities, robust data storage, and remote access
    to system configurations through an intuitive user interface. API Integration:
    To enhance system flexibility and enable seamless interaction with external systems,
    we developed a custom API. This API facilitated effortless customization, scalability,
    and potential integration with other agricultural management systems. Its functionality
    included facilitating the retrieval of sensor readings, configuration of irrigation
    settings, and real-time interaction with the system. During the development of
    the prototype, we meticulously integrated the hardware and software components
    to create a cohesive and seamlessly functioning system. The microcontroller served
    as the intelligent core, effectively receiving data from the sensors and executing
    the irrigation control algorithm based on the trained machine learning models.
    IoT connectivity enabled robust communication between the microcontroller and
    the cloud platform, facilitating uninterrupted data transmission and remote access
    to the system. The software components, comprising machine learning algorithms
    and the Arduino IoT Cloud, worked synergistically to analyze sensor data, make
    real-time decisions, and provide users with a user-friendly interface for monitoring
    and controlling the irrigation system. The seamless integration of the hardware
    and software components ensured the smooth operation of the prototype. Sensor
    data collected by the hardware components served as critical input for the machine
    learning algorithms, which generated precise irrigation schedules tailored to
    the specific requirements of different crop types. The Arduino IoT Cloud platform
    facilitated real-time monitoring, data storage, and remote access, empowering
    users to interact with the system and make necessary adjustments as per their
    needs. The API integration further enhanced system flexibility and potential for
    integration with other agricultural management systems. Fig. 4. The prototype

    India SECTION I. Introduction Water is a scarce and valuable natural resource
    and especially an essential component, it needs to be developed, planned, managed,
    conserved, and in particular, effectively utilized [1]. Optimum management of
    presented water resources in the agriculture sector is obligatory because of limited
    resources and increasing demands. It is vital to rise agricultural yield under
    limited water resources for optimum agricultural crops to satisfy upcoming food
    production requirements [2]. The constraint water supply must be efficiently utilized
    for irrigating additional areas with a similar quantity of water [3]. Lately,
    various research workers have employed the Internet of things (IoT) and artificial
    intelligence (AI) to manage irrigational problems accurately via linear models.
    Precision irrigation scheduling is directed towards effectual water usage for
    all the plants, when and where it is essential, to reimburse for water loss over
    evapotranspiration, deep percolation, or erosion when preventing over- and under-irrigation
    [4]. With appropriate irrigation management through and optimum control efficient
    monitoring, water could be saved, along with providing a reduction in other indirect
    costs experienced from energy usage through fossil fuel or electricity for pumping,
    for optimum cost-efficiency [5]. Fig. 1 depicts the overview of IoT-based smart
    irrigation system. Fig. 1. Iot-based smart irrigation system Show All More recently
    used irrigation system is depends on cyclic water application notwithstanding
    the plant''s real requirement for irrigation water, which is a bigger problem
    [6]. An appropriate irrigation schedule helps to produce better crop production.
    But while surface irrigation system is employed, it is impossible to change the
    frequency and depth of irrigation water because of the implementation complexity.
    Variations in irrigation depth are quite unclear for the producer to diverge the
    irrigation scheduling [7]. Defining the optimal quantity of water isn''t an easier
    task; it relies on several factors namely wind speed, air temperature, average
    relative humidity, solar radiation, and sun hours. Consequently, the irrigation
    depth is unevenly projected to save the interval constant and the irrigation depth
    over the rising period [8]. The precise description of irrigation scheduling is
    a time-consuming and challenging method. The computer program has made it more
    available, and now it is likely to irrigation scheduling the water quantity exactly
    based on the water essential for crop production [9]. Sensor-based irrigation
    schedule system is an effective tools personalized to field characteristics that
    could considerably facilitate irrigation scheduling decisions [10]. Because of
    the development of sensors and the massive revolution of IoT for smart agriculture,
    the application presents a substantial helpful effect on irrigation water conservation
    and plants. Khan et al. [11] examine a new integration of optimizing intelligent
    smart irrigation methods for improving efficiency of the energy management. At
    this point, an optimum CH formation and selection were carried out by Hierarchy
    Shuffled Shepherd Clustering (HSSC) approach. Besides, the finest routing path
    and energy regulation are offered by the projected Emperor Penguin Jellyfish Optimized
    (EPJO) approach. In [12], a new method “Enhanced CH based Data gathering” (ECHGS)
    was projected to effort the energy and delay in IoT related smart irrigation methods
    for cultivation. During this presented method, the CH for the set of sensor nodes
    is chosen dependent on the residual energy (RE) and workload. The node is a higher
    RE and lesser workload was chosen as a CH for collecting and delivering the data
    to server node efficiently. Ullah et al. [13] projected an energy-efficient water
    management platform (EEWMP), an enhanced version of SWAMP. Quimbita et al. [14]
    examine a smart irrigation method energized by microgrid. The suggestion comprises
    2 steps namely the primary creates the daily irrigation profile dependent upon
    an adept method for sufficient utilization of water. Afterward, assuming the irrigation
    profile, the power needed for the water pump was measured-an optimum daily profile
    of current demand was defined in the second step. The microgrid is handled through
    the energy managing scheme that depends on prediction control model. Sangeetha
    et al. [15] include the smart agriculture management method for producing crop
    production and agricultural benefits. The hybrid remote-controlled device utilized
    the Global Positioning System (GPS) with Radial Function Network (RFN) has been
    introduced for controlling the irrigated scheme, forecasting the temperature,
    reducing the humidity in water content, and maintaining the air pressure. It employs
    the Internet of Everything (IOE) environmental factor and IoT sensors for monitoring
    and managing irrigation systems. This study develops an Arithmetic Optimization
    Algorithm with Machine Learning based Smart irrigation system (AOAML-SIS) technique
    in an IoT environment. Initially, the AOAML-SIS technique exploits the IoT sensors
    for data collection process. For determining the need for irrigation, the AOALM-SIS
    technique utilizes multilayer perceptron (MLP) classification model. Since the
    MLP parameters play a vital role, the parameter tuning process is carried out
    by the AOA algorithm. The experimental assessment of the AOAML-SIS technique takes
    place on agriculture data. The simulation values inferred the effectual irrigation
    classification efficacy of the AOAML-SIS technique over other models. SECTION
    II. The Proposed Smart Irrigation System In this study, an automated smart irrigation
    system using AOAML-SIS technique has been developed in IoT environment. Initially,
    the AOAML-SIS technique exploits the IoT sensors for data collection process.
    For determining the need for irrigation, the AOALM-SIS technique utilized the
    MLP classification model. Since the MLP parameters play a vital role, the parameter
    tuning process is carried out by the AOA algorithm. A. Irrigation Classification
    Using MLP In this work, the MLP model is applied to irrigation management. ANN
    is non-parametric method that consists of a sequence of processing components
    named neurons [16]. The feedforward neural network is a class of supervised ANN
    that usually has 3 layers of nodes, such as hidden, input, and output layers.
    The MLP is the more common and well known feedforward network. The MLP node was
    arranged hierarchically in various FC layers. Especially, MLP has input, output,
    and hidden layers (HLs) that reside among the input and output layers. In this
    work, the HL provides the processing and computation power for producing the network
    output. The connection is characterized using the network weight that is are real
    number within[1, 1.]. In this work, two stages are implemented for yielding the
    output value of all the nodes in every layer. Initially, the weighted sum of the
    input value is evaluated by: S j = ∑ i=1 n ( w ij I i + β j ) (1) View Source
    In Eq. (1), l i indicates the i−th input parameter, n indicates the overall amount
    of nodes (neurons) from the input layer w ij shows the weight connection amongst
    the hidden nod j and I i and β i indicates the bias (threshold) weight of i th
    hidden nodes. Next, the resultant value of every node in the HL was calculated
    according to the weighted sum. Here, activation is utilized for triggering the
    output according to the value of summation function. Then, distinct kinds of activation
    function are stored. The sigmoid activation function is widely employed for mapping
    the HL outcome value that is evaluated by: f j (x)= 1 1+ e − s j (2) View Source
    Lastly, the network output is attained by the following expression: y ^ k = ∑
    j=1 m ( w kj f i + β k ) (3) View Source The MLP performance depends on the value
    of weight and biases connection determined in the trained stage. Thus, the major
    aim of trained MLP is to discover a collection of optimum connection weights and
    biases for minimizing predictive error. B. AOA Based Parameter Tuning For tuning
    the parameters of the MLP model, the AOA is used. AOA primarily imitate the usage
    of numerical operator in the numerical problem-solving technique [17]. Arithmetic
    is the previous part of mathematics which is used to deal with the properties
    of the function and numbers. The arithmetic operator is an operation symbol that
    implements necessary arithmetic, viz., a symbol exploited to 4 techniques. During
    the optimization, this operator was exploited to select the better solution for
    the candidate. At first, the searching range of candidate outcomes was widely
    secured for breaking the deadlock of method falls into searching stagnation. Next,
    enhance the search efficiency of solution through the deep search. The sequence
    of feasible solutions has been randomly produced at the earlier step of optimized
    technique of AOA, as follows. X=[ χ N−1,1 χ N,1 χ 2,… 1 χ 1,1 χ N−1,j χ N,j χ
    2,j χ1,j χ N,n−1 χ 1., ′ n−1 χ N−l,n χ 1,n χ N,n χ 2,….n ′ ] X= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢

    ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ (4) View Source Formerly, the AOA implements the optimization
    technique, it is essential to resolve the search technique according to the values
    of Math Optimizer Accelerated (MOA) method that is evaluated using the subsequent

    Conclusion In this study, an automated smart irrigation system using AOAML-SIS
    technique has been developed in loT environment. Initially, the AOAML-SIS technique
    exploits the loT sensors for data collection process. For determining the need
    for irrigation, the AOALM-SIS technique utilized the MLP classification model.
    Since the MLP parameters play a vital role, the parameter tuning process is carried
    out by the AOA algorithm. The experimental assessment of the AOAML-SIS technique
    takes place on agriculture data. The simulation values inferred the effectual
    irrigation classification efficacy of the AOAML-SIS technique over other models.
    In future, computer vision approaches can be designed to improve productivity
    and reduce crop loss in agricultural sector. Authors Figures References Citations

    consumes an important ratio of the water reserve in irrigated areas. The improvement
    of irrigation is becoming essential to reduce this high water consumption by adapting
    supplies to the crop needs and avoiding losses. This global issue has prompted
    many scientists to reflect on sustainable solutions using innovative technologies,
    namely Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), Machine Learning (ML), and the Internet
    of Things (IoT). This article aims to present an overview of the use of these
    new technologies in the analysis of the water status of crops for better irrigation
    management, with an emphasis on arboriculture. The review demonstrated the importance
    of UAV-ML-IoT technologies. This contribution is due to the relevant information
    that can be collected from IoT sensors and extracted from UAV images through various
    sensors (RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal), and the ability of ML models
    to monitor and predict water status. The review in this paper is organized into
    four main sections: the use of UAV in arboriculture, UAV for irrigation management
    in arboriculture, IoT systems and irrigation management, and ML for data processing
    and decision-making. A discussion is presented regarding the prospects for smart
    irrigation using geospatial technologies and machine learning. Keywords: irrigation;
    UAV; IoT; machine learning; arboriculture 1. Introduction The last 60 years have
    seen remarkable developments in the use of water resources in agriculture in response
    to population growth and the increased demand for food. The world’s population
    has grown from 2.5 billion in 1950 to 7 billion today, the area under irrigation
    has doubled, and water withdrawals have tripled due to the massive development
    of water infrastructure [1]. In recent years, most countries in the world have
    suffered from water stress and drought. Due to the huge lack of precipitation
    and the high demand, water resources are decreasing dangerously, endangering the
    food security of many countries. The World Resources Institute has recognized
    Morocco as one of the countries most affected by water stress, such that by 2040
    the level of water stress will reach 80%, which is too high for an agricultural
    country for which the agriculture consumes 73% of its water resources [2]. Improved
    irrigation scheduling—which involves determining the appropriate time to irrigate,
    the amount of water to apply, and the duration of the irrigation process to ensure
    a balance between water use and crop response [3]—is becoming essential to reduce
    the very high consumption by matching supplies to crop needs and avoiding losses.
    This problem at the global level has led many scientists to think about sustainable
    solutions to improve irrigation water consumption through innovative technologies,
    including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), as well as two interesting concepts
    for more flexibility and automation, namely Artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet
    of Things (IoT) [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]. UAVs in agriculture are not only capable
    of filming to perform a visual field inspection to identify weeds or pest damage
    but also have the ability to be equipped with various sensors that facilitate
    the analysis of a complete dataset: nitrogen level, chlorophyll, biomass, and
    moisture, etc. Artificial intelligence, in this role, is a huge and constantly
    evolving field. The abilities to predict, estimate, and train decision-making
    systems make it a practical solution for complex phenomena such as irrigation
    scheduling. The focus is currently on Machine Learning (ML), which allows for
    the optimization of certain human activities through soil and crop monitoring,
    and predictive analysis. In order to feed these algorithms, the process consists
    in collecting data, thanks to soil mapping performed with UAV, or thanks to cameras
    and sensors planted in the ground or installed on tractors. Due to the development
    of wireless sensors (such as thermal sensors, moisture sensors, and light sensors)
    used in agriculture and the development of transmission technology, the concept
    of the Internet of Things has generated a lot of interest in data collection and
    irrigation automation. The UAV-ML-IoT combination has allowed us to talk today
    about connected and smart agriculture. In this context, the objective of this
    article is to provide an overview of the progress made in the use of these three
    innovative technologies in irrigation management, with a focus on arboriculture.
    The review includes a survey of the published papers and existing solutions. Irrigation
    management is discussed in detail based on three major components: water requirement
    estimation and crop water status assessment, UAV and IoT for data collection,
    and ML for data processing and analysis. In addition, the benefits, challenges,
    and trends are discussed. The article is organized as follows: In Section 2, a
    general overview of the use and applications of UAVs in arboriculture is given.
    Section 3 discusses the factors related to crop water status and their relationships
    with the different indices extracted from UAV images. Section 4 covers the potential
    and architecture of IoT systems in irrigation management by presenting a set of
    examples in order to arrive at a general structure, as well as looking at trends
    in combined UAV-IoT usage. Section 5 is dedicated to ML algorithms for data processing,
    focusing on the algorithms recently used to link the indices extracted from UAV
    images to the factors affecting the crop water status, and furthermore to the
    usefulness of dashboards and geographic information systems (GIS) in data visualization
    and decision support through examples. Section 6 examines the benefits, challenges,
    and trends in a discussion format. Section 7 concludes the paper. 2. Use of UAV
    in Arboriculture The important distinction in the use of UAV is between the UAV
    itself (the platform) and the equipment carried (the payload). This is the purpose
    of the study, along with the characteristics of the area that dictate the type
    of sensors, the platform to be used, and the methodology to be adopted. The types
    of UAV used can be divided into three main categories: rotary-wing, fixed-wing,
    and VTOL (Vertical Take-off and Landing) (see Figure 1). For fixed-wing UAVs,
    the gravimetric lift is provided by the presence of one or more hard wings. The
    specific shape of the wings generates lift when the aircraft is subjected to relative
    wind. In addition, their takeoff requires an initial horizontal speed, such that
    it is necessary to initiate them to start their flight. Rotary-wing UAVs are a
    subset of rotorcraft. The term rotorcraft is used in aviation to define aircraft
    that use rotating wings to generate lift. Rotorcraft can have one or more rotors.
    UAVs using rotary systems are almost always equipped with several small rotors,
    which are necessary for their stability, hence the name “rotary-wing system”.
    Typically, these UAVs use at least four rotors to keep them in flight [12]. The
    VTOL UAVs were developed to combine the benefits of both rotary-wing and fixed-wing
    craft. A rotary-wing can perform vertical takeoff and landing, but its wing rotor
    cannot pass the velocity of sound [13]. The choice of a type depends on several
    important criteria, such as hovering and vertical takeoff, the difficulty of piloting,
    mechanical and electronic complexity, the cost and difficulty of repairs, and
    finally the flight distance and autonomy [12]. Figure 1. (a) Fixed-wing Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAV) (Tuffwing Mapper) [14]; (b) rotary-wing UAV (quad-rotor
    Parrot Anaf) [15]; (c) VTOL UAV (Tron) [16]. Regarding sensors, the most commonly
    used examples for agricultural purposes are the following: hyperspectral, multispectral,
    RGB, and thermal sensors (see Figure 2). The hyperspectral imaging sensors are
    indeed able to capture more details in a large number of narrow and contiguous
    bands, which should be preferred when detecting the chemical and physical properties
    of the objects of study [17]. The multispectral imaging can capture both spectral
    and spatial data in a few spectral bands. The RGB imaging can provide spectral
    information in all three spectral bands of the visible spectrum. Thermal sensors
    measure the radiation emitted by the surface of an object and convert it into
    temperature [18]. Figure 2. (a) Thermal camera (Flir vue pro) [19]; (b) multispactral
    camera (Parrot sequoia) [20]; (c) heperspctral camera (Rikola hyperspectral imager)
    [21]; (d) RGB camera (Sensfly S.O.D.A) [20]. The images from these sensors are
    then processed for analysis using photogrammetry techniques, which involves the
    precise reconstruction of a scene or object from several images, or through the
    calculation of vegetation indices (VI), which use different combinations or mathematical
    transformations of at least two spectral bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.
    They are designed to maximize the contribution of vegetation characteristics,
    and they can provide reliable spatial and temporal information about crops. The
    choice of the sensor, particularly for UAV applications in arboriculture and irrigation
    management, is more related to the choice of indices to be retrieved. RGB, multispectral,
    and hyperspectral sensors are commonly used to calculate canopy reflectance indices.
    The length and number of bands used to generate these indices favor one over the
    other. Thermal sensors are more suited for indices depending on the temperature
    of the leaves/canopy. More information on these indices will be provided in the
    sections that follow. The diversity of platforms and sensors discussed above (See
    Figure 1 and Figure 2) has motivated many research groups to explore and adopt
    UAVs into their agricultural practices in order to meet specific needs [22,23,24,25,26].
    UAVs have found applicability in a variety of agricultural study areas, one of
    which is arboriculture, where there is growing interest in this segment of technology,
    particularly because of the high-resolution data that can be collected flexibly
    in a short time and for a relatively low price. In addition, UAVs have an important
    role to play in filling the gaps in the data collected using manned aircraft (airplane,
    or helicopter) or satellite remote sensing, whilst having many advantages both
    in research and in various practical applications, especially in arboriculture,
    as well as in agriculture in general. Table 1 summarizes the main research works
    in the last decade dealing with the use of UAV in arboriculture for various purposes.
    All of the indices used in the cited works are mentioned in Table 2, according
    to the type of sensor operated. Table 1. Examples of studies addressing the use
    of UAV in arboriculture. Table 2. Calculated indices in each study according to
    sensor type. The analysis of all of the studies cited in Table 1 shows a description
    of the state of the art of UAVs’ applications in arboriculture. It proves that
    UAVs are increasingly being adopted in agricultural practices, particularly in
    arboriculture. The adoption of this technology has contributed significantly to
    the treatment of several problems, which have targeted several types of fruit
    trees (citrus, sweet cherry, almond, peach, pomegranate) and have been conducted
    in different regions in America, Asia, and Europe (USA, China, Spain, Italy, Brazil,
    and Turkey, etc.), related to different aspects: The detection of plant diseases
    and their physiological problems [22,24,26]. Traditional methods of detecting
    disease and stress in many crops rely on human screening, which is time-consuming,
    expensive, and in some cases impractical or prone to human error. The analysis
    of vegetation indices (see Table 2), from low-altitude, high-resolution aerial
    imagery taken by UAV, can potentially be used for stress detection in different
    crops. It can also help in the detection of new diseases at an early stage that
    cannot be detected by human scouts. The principle is based on the fact that leaves
    reflect a lot of light in the near-infrared (IR) range. When the plant becomes
    dehydrated or stressed, the leaves reflect less IR light, but the same amount
    in the visible range. As such, the mathematical combination of these two signals
    can help differentiate a plant from a non-plant, or a healthy plant from a diseased
    plant [34]. The early detection of disease could be a major application of pilotless
    systems. The counting, height, and classification of trees [23,25,35]. UAV RGB,
    multispectral and hyperspectral imagery helps to create index maps, which can
    differentiate the ground from grass or forest, and can detect plants. It can also
    perform the construction of digital surface models and digital terrain models
    (DTM) through these images. They will allow us to obtain information on the height
    of the trees by obtaining the model of the height of the canopy by applying CHM
    = DSM − DTM (1) Yield monitoring [35]. There are strong correlations between the
    crop yield and vegetation indices measured at certain stages of the crop. Therefore,
    monitoring crop growth at key stages will help us to provide an accurate estimate
    of the crop yield, and help to solve problems that hinder normal crop growth (water
    stress, diseases, physiological problems, etc.) quickly. Tree risk assessment/management
    [23]. The integration of UAV imagery can greatly enhance a decision-making system
    (DMS) aimed at managing tree risk, especially in extensive settings. The DMS is
    indeed called upon to identify the most critical situations, allowing the optimization
    of ground surveys. Information from UAV images and existing maps can be considered
    as the main inputs. A tree risk index (TRI) map is the expected outcome. A tree
    risk index (TRI) can be obtained using the QTRA (Quantified Tree Risk Assessment)
    method, which uses tree risk components reported from the best practices defined
    by the International Society of Arboriculture—Quebec [36]. Tree risk is made up
    of the probability of failure (stability index), potential impact, and target
    exposure. The system quantifies the independent probabilities of the three components,
    calculating their product for comparison with a generally accepted level of risk.
    Irrigation management and crop water status [4,5,6]. This aspect will be analyzed
    in detail in the next section. This wealth of applications in arboriculture confirms
    that UAVs are indispensable in modern agriculture. While the potential for UAV
    use is significant, there are still several notable barriers to their advancement,
    such as the cost of acquisition and the quality of the data captured. Data quality
    is crucial, and should be the priority for UAV use decisions and other aspects,
    such as the speed and flexibility of a UAV. Finally, the widespread adoption of
    new technologies is forcing farmers to adapt and modernize their production practices
    to obtain the best returns on these investments. 3. UAV for Irrigation Management
    in Arboriculture Irrigation management involves the determination of the proper
    time to irrigate and the amount of water to apply, as successful irrigation depends
    on a delicate balance between water application and crop response [3]. The water
    supply must be accurately calculated as well, in an attempt to match the water
    demand with any amount. The operation of defining the irrigation schedule and
    the amount of water to be applied is based mainly on the spatial and temporal
    monitoring of the water status of crops. Currently, the use of imagery acquired
    by UAV represents one of the most common methods used. The vast majority of methods
    based on UAV-acquired imagery and dealing with water status monitoring attempt
    to train models by transforming the information contained in the imagery into
    a variable that is highly correlated with well-established ground measurements.
    The main measurements discussed in the literature (see Table 3) are evapotranspiration
    [5], water potential, and stomatal conductance [4,7,8,37,38,39]. In addition to
    these measurements, the contribution of other factors should be considered—such
    as the local weather patterns, soil types, estimated root depth, and irrigation
    method [3]—in order to arrive at models with a correlation coefficient (R2) close
    to 1. Evapotranspiration. The term “evapotranspiration” was coined to represent
    the combination of the two phenomena of evaporation and transpiration. The evaporation
    is the phenomenon of water changing from a liquid state to a vapor state. The
    evaporation of a water surface, a pond or a lake, or the surface of soil are examples.
    Transpiration is the phenomenon of evaporation of water by trees through stomata
    [40]. The water requirement of a tree is the amount of water needed to make a
    tree mature. A tree requires between 400 and 1000 kg of water to produce one kg
    of dry matter [40]. These water requirements and the actual evapotranspiration
    are identical under standard conditions [3]. The actual evapotranspiration of
    a crop is calculated as follows [41]:  ET c = k c × ET 0   (2) where k c is the
    single-crop coefficient, ET c is the actual crop evapotranspiration, and ET 0
    is the reference evapotranspiration, i.e., the evapotranspiration of an ideal
    plant stand with water available at will. Leaf water potential and stomatal resistance.
    Leaf water potential and stomatal resistance are important traits that influence
    tree–water relationships. They in turn depend on the relative fluxes of water
    through the tree in the soil-tree-atmosphere environment [42]. The two gradients
    can be defined as follows: The water potential (Ψ) represents the potential of
    water to leave a given compartment. In plant physiology, it is used to determine
    the direction of the water exchange between different parts of the tree (organs,
    cells …), and between the tree and its environment (soil and atmosphere). It is
    the physiologically relevant integrator of the drought effects of plant tissues
    [43]. The stomatal conductance (g) is the measure of the rate of passage of carbon
    dioxide into or out of water vapor through leaf stomata. The indices derived from
    the UAV images represent the second input of the models (see Table 3). These indices
    are classified into two categories: the reflectance indices and the indices based
    on the leaf/canopy temperature. 3.1. Reflectance Indices The reflectance indices
    processed are in the form of two categories: Vegetation indices (NDVI, NDRE, SR,
    OSAVI …) [4,5,7,39]. Generally, these are related to tree structural traits and
    vegetation characteristics. They can provide reliable spatial and temporal information
    about crops. These indices showed a clear correlation with variables such as crop
    factor, stomatal conductance, and water potential in most of the studied crops
    (see Table 3). Photochemical reflectance index and the normalized photochemical
    reflectance index (PRI and PRI norm ) [39,44,45,46]. PRI= R 550 − R 531 R 550
    + R 531 ;  PRI norm = PRI RDVI× R 700 R 670 (3) PRI is an index that takes into
    account changes in xanthophyll concentration due to water stress. The PRI norm
    is an improvement of the PRI index over water potential and stomatal conductance;
    it not only takes into account changes in xanthophyll concentration due to water
    stress (PRI) but also generates a normalization considering the chlorophyll content,
    sensitivity to chlorophyll, and stress-induced reduction in the canopy leaf area
    [46]. The PRI norm showed an improved ability to detect water stress compared
    to other greenness and structure indices [46]. 3.2. Indices Based on Leaf/Canopy
    Temperature The extraction of the temperature of the leaves/canopy, through thermal
    sensors, can have an observable effect on the estimation of the water status of
    crops, especially in arboriculture. This effect has been observed through several
    studies that have collected thermal indices for different crops, such as peach,
    vineyard, olive, and almond, etc. On the other hand, the Crop Water Stress Index
    (CWSI) represents the most widely used index. Following Idso et al., 1981 [33],
    the CWSI ranges from 0 to 1 (values close to 1 are related to high stress levels).
    This index showed better agreement with Ψ and g on most of the studied fruit trees
    (see Table 3) [8,47,48]. CWSI= T canopy −  T wet T dry −  T wet / (4) where T
    canopy is the surface temperature of the canopy and reference surfaces, and T
    wet and T dry are completely wet or dry in order to simulate the maximum and minimum
    leaf transpiration under the exposed environmental conditions. Table 3. Examples
    of studies addressing water status monitoring using UAV imagery in arboriculture.
    The indices presented in Table 3, in general, provide valuable information, but
    they require further processing to quantify the information to be managed. The
    digital mapping information on the crop water status allows spatial and temporal
    statistics to be calculated and stress levels for each crop to be determined,
    allowing the assessment of the average stress values and average water requirements.
    This is particularly important for the management of irrigation systems. 4. IoT
    Systems and Irrigation Management The common definition of the IoT is defined
    as follows: the Internet of Things is a network of physical objects interconnected
    via the Internet. A unique identifier connects the objects so that the data can
    be transferred. The basic goal of an IoT system can be divided into four sections:
    the identification, detection, processing, and transmission of information. The
    key technologies in each section are, respectively, radio frequency identification
    (RFID), sensors, a smart chip, and a wireless telecommunications network. The
    design of IoT systems varies from system to system based on the intended application
    of the system, and the level of efficiency and security to be achieved. The most
    basic architecture is a three-layer architecture: The perception layer: this layer
    gives each object a physical meaning. It consists of data sensors in various forms,
    infrared (IR) sensors, or other sensor networks (temperature, humidity, etc.).
    This layer collects useful information about objects on devices and converts them
    into digital signals that are then transmitted to the network layer for further
    action. The network layer: the purpose of this layer is to receive useful information
    in the form of digital signals from the perception layer, and to transmit it to
    the processing systems through transmission technologies such as WiFi, Bluetooth,
    WiMaX, Zigbee, GSM, and 3G, etc., with protocols like MQTT, IPv4, IPv6, and DDS,
    etc. The application layer: this layer is responsible for the IoT application
    for all types of fields according to the processed data [50]. 4.1. Architecture
    of IoT-Based Irrigation Systems Presently, IoT is becoming established as a new
    industrial revolution in all sectors of agricultural activity, especially in irrigation
    management, while remote monitoring systems have been proposed to manage irrigation
    in an optimized way by applying the right dose at the right place at the right
    time. In this paragraph, we present examples of systems with the proposed composition
    [51,52,53,54,55,56] (see Table 4) that will provide a comprehensive view of smart
    irrigation management systems based on IoT technology, and will arrive at a generalized
    structure of its systems. Table 4. Examples of irrigation management systems based
    on Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Analyzing the different examples cited
    in Table 4, generally, the architecture of irrigation systems based on IoT technology
    takes the structure detailed in Figure 3. Figure 3. Generalized structure of the
    architecture of IoT-based irrigation management systems. An irrigation management
    IoT solution is based on three levels of components that include the sensors/actuators,
    the gateway, and Cloud computing: Sensors and actuators—all of the systems mentioned
    include sensors to collect data on physical quantities such as luminosity, temperature,
    and soil moisture. The actuators remain a complementary technology to the sensors;
    they convert electrical energy into motion or mechanical energy, which is used
    to control the water pump. A microcontroller (Arduino, in most systems) includes
    a processor, memory, input, and output devices on a single chip. The role of a
    microcontroller is to process the raw data captured by the sensors and extract
    useful information. The gateway—gateways have the role of connecting sensors or
    sensor nodes with the outside world, and have the ability to perform local processing
    on the data before transmitting it to the Cloud. The data can be transmitted between
    all of the processing system counterparts via transmission media such as WiFi,
    Bluetooth [50], WiMaX, Zigbee [57], GSM [54], and 3G [55], with protocols such
    as IPv4, IPv6, MQTT, or DDS, etc. Cloud computing—three forms of IoT cloud are
    available: the cloud infrastructure, cloud platform, and software cloud. Some
    systems have used a cloud [52,55], while other systems are based totally on local
    processing [51,53,54]. Regarding cloud computing, it is an optional choice that
    may be used to lighten the load of work for the cloud. This processing can be
    performed at the local nodes before relaying the information to the cloud (Fog
    Computing); at the network edge, at gateways, or at intermediate nodes (Edge Computing);
    or can be performed locally in the sensor node (Mist Computing). 4.2. Combination
    UAV and IoT in Irrigation UAVs have the potential to be part of an IoT solution
    for irrigation management by performing several tasks [9,58,59,60,61]. The tasks
    in which these aircraft can intervene are classified into two categories according
    to the communication between the UAV and other system parts. Tasks with direct
    communication with the system include real-time communication between UAV and
    sensors, which is now available with the development of federated wireless smart
    sensors (WSN) which communicate with the UAV. The use of UAVs with intelligent
    ground-based WSNs is proven to be a robust and efficient solution for data collection,
    monitoring, and analysis. The advantage lies in online data collection and relaying
    to a central monitoring point, while effectively managing the network load and
    latency through optimized UAV trajectories [58]. The GS-UAV-SC (GS for ‘Ground
    Sensors’, and UAV-SC for ‘Unmanned aerial vehicle small cells’) model, proposed
    by Duangsuwane et al. 2020 [9], represents a perfect example. The GS-UAV-SC (Figure
    4) is a soil moisture-monitoring sensor, which is connected to the UAV to stream
    data over the Internet in order for the data to be stored and calculated on the
    cloud platform. The farmer/user can further control the UAV in its movements around
    the field to collect all of the data from each sensor. Figure 4. Illustration
    of UAV and WSN [9]. On the other hand, a UAV can function as an energy controller.
    Especially with the fact that most wireless sensors in the IoT environment are
    facing the limited energy problem, the way in which to provide sustainable energy
    to these sensors has become a challenge. In this context, Liu et al. 2019 [59]
    presented a UAV to swap energy among wireless sensors by adapting the optimal
    resource allocation approach based on dynamic game theory (Figure 5). Figure 5.
    Illustration of the system proposed by [59]. In tasks with non-direct communication
    with the system, a UAV can play the role of a versatile sensor for an IoT system
    by providing it with a set of external data extracted from UAV images after treatments.
    Data such as the plant height [60] can be used by the system to estimate the growth
    phase of the fields, and to provide them with the doses that suit with this phase.
    The advantage lies in the use on large farms. The acquisition of several interesting
    data in the monitoring of the water status of crops (temperatures, humidity, ETc,
    water potential, etc.) requires the use of several sensors to cover the whole
    area, while a UAV has the potential to replace some sensors, and to provide the
    IoT system with these data after extracting them from the processed images. 5.
    Machine Learning for Data Processing and Decision-Making Machine learning has
    emerged, along with the techniques of Big Data and high performance computing,
    to create new opportunities in the field of agrotechnologies through the implementation
    of systems that can support decision making in issues such as irrigation management.
    In this section, we present a general overview of machine learning and a specific
    overview of its use in irrigation management. 5.1. Machine Learning (ML) “Learning
    is any process (algorithm) by which a system (model) improves performance (accuracy)
    from experience (data). The data may include hidden knowledge that explains the
    laws/rules/logic of some complex phenomenon” said Herbert A. Simon. By analyzing
    this definition, we can say that machine learning is about automatically extracting
    relevant information from data through advanced analysis. ML has seen a vast development
    recently through its use in several fields and applications (media, marketing,
    medicine, scientific research, agriculture, etc.). This multiplicity refers to
    the multiplicity of algorithm models and approaches. These algorithms are classified
    mainly according to the nature of the training data [62]: supervised learning,
    unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Supervised
    learning is used to estimate an unknown (input, output) from known samples (input,
    output), where the output is labeled; obviously, the machine will learn faster
    with known samples. There are two types of such tasks: classification for the
    category prediction of an object, and regression for the prediction of a specific
    point on a numerical axis. Regression is essentially classification where we predict
    a number instead of a category. The most commonly used algorithms are Naive Bayes,
    Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, and the Support Vector
    Machine. In unsupervised learning, unlike supervised learning, only input samples
    are given to the learning system. The data are not labeled. The goal is to model
    the observations in order to better understand them. This is often referred to
    as clustering, dimensionality reduction or generalization. The most popular algorithms
    are k-means clustering, mean-shift, DBSCAN, Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
    Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Reinforcement
    learning is based on feedback. Training data is given only as feedback to a system
    in a dynamic environment. This feedback between the learning system and the interaction
    experience is useful to improve the performance in the task to be learned. The
    performance evaluation of the models obtained by these ML algorithms is essential.
    These performances can be evaluated by several analysis techniques, such as the
    confusion matrix, the bias-variance trade-offs of the correlation coefficient
    (R2), the mean square error (MSE), and the error rate. 5.2. Neural Networks (ANN)
    Machine Learning algorithms are in continuous development with the emergence of
    neural networks (ANN) and Deep Learning, which are inspired by the human brain,
    and are composed of interconnected artificial neurons capable of certain calculations
    from their inputs. The input activates the neurons of the first layer of the network,
    the output of which is the input of the second layer of neurons in the network.
    Similarly, each layer passes its output to the next layer, and the last layer
    produces the result. The layers between the input and output layers are known
    as hidden layers. The term Deep Learning refers to multi-layer artificial neural
    networks (ANNs). It is considered one of the most powerful tools, and has become
    very popular in the literature, as it is capable of processing a huge amount of
    data. The value of having deeper hidden layers has recently started to outperform
    conventional methods in different domains, especially in pattern recognition [63].
    The two popular architectures today are [63] convolutional neural networks (CNN),
    which are widely used in all cases involving images and videos, and recurrent
    neural networks (RNN), which are best for sequential data such as voice and text.
    5.3. ML-UAV and Irrigation in Arboriculture Irrigation automation faces many implementation
    problems, notably due to the lack of reliable and inexpensive sensors for important
    quantities (temperature, humidity, etc.), the non-linear nature of the simulation
    models, and the non-stationary dynamics of crop water requirements. The use of
    UAV and ML algorithms, and neural networks in particular, along with their ability
    to describe non-linear dynamic phenomena, offer very interesting prospects for
    making indirect measurements of water requirements and predictions of their evolution.
    ANN is the most adopted approach [5,7,37] to the development of models that can
    predict values of other data or that propose descriptions of data related to the
    water status of crops. The popular use of ANN in the literature can be explained
    by the fact that a well-trained neural network can simulate the work of any of
    the algorithms described in this section. This universality is what has made them
    very popular in moving beyond classical ANN to Deep Learning that works more accurately,
    e.g., in order to solve increasingly complex problems such as crop water status.
    It is not enough to add more and more layers because the huge issue of neural
    networks, which might cause the problem of the difficulty of learning, is the
    growing computational complexity with the number of layers. This provides evidence
    of the importance of a well-established architecture. Speaking of architectures,
    among the ANN architectures adopted in crop water status analysis are multilayer
    perceptron (MLP) [37], with a backpropagation process for weight calculations.
    A two-layer feedback network with ten hidden neurons, and a standard two-layer
    feedforward network has a sigmoid transfer function in the hidden layer and a
    linear transfer function in the output layer structure [7]. A deep stochastic
    configuration network (DeepSCN) [5], which was first proposed by Wang et al. in
    2017. Compared to other random learning algorithms, DeepSCNs randomly assign the
    input weights and biases of hidden nodes. The output weights are evaluated analytically
    in a constructive method. This performs better than other random neural networks
    in terms of rapid learning, the scope of random parameters, and the human intervention
    required [64]. It presented good results in building a model that links Kc and
    NDVI in a pomegranate orchard. The performance of the model was evaluated with
    the RMSE during training, which was close to 0 (0.046), with a correlation coefficient
    R2 close to 1 (0.999) during the model validation [5]. This provided evidence
    that NDVI variations from UAV imagery can be used to globally explain the utility
    of ML algorithms in addressing complex issues such as crop water status. 5.4.
    Dashboard and GIS: Approaches to Decision Making Real-time data representation
    and the coordination of information from multiple sensors allow decision-makers
    to adjust irrigation management strategies in near-real time and can provide farmers
    with emergency awareness. Dashboards are frequently used to monitor and depict
    this data, either in a general way (mobile application, online platform) or in
    a specific way (mobile GIS, web GIS). Focusing on irrigation management, there
    are several examples to cite: IRRIX is a web-based platform for irrigation monitoring
    that consists in the estimation of crop water requirements using the water balance
    method [41] and using sensor feedback to empirically adjust the irrigation rates
    for each sector [65]. IMO was developed by Oregon State University and the Natural
    Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). It explicitly analyzes irrigation efficiency,
    accounts for spatial variability in soil properties and irrigation uniformity,
    performs simultaneous scheduling for all of the fields on the farm, accounts for
    energy consumption and associated costs, and uses both ET and soil moisture measurements
    to improve irrigation accuracy. IMO was developed specifically to support irrigation
    management when water supply or distribution system capacity is limited [66].
    The Irriga System is a mobile application that recommends the depth of water to
    be applied to each crop field throughout the harvest season [67]. IrriFresa is
    a mobile application that was developed for mobile devices (smartphones and tablets).
    This application was developed to update the irrigation schedule in real time,
    and to facilitate access to daily irrigation schedules for farmers. The mobile
    application is connected to the nearest farm weather station, and then the ET
    0 values are downloaded from this weather station to update the initial irrigation
    schedule based on the differences between the real-time ET 0 values and the historical
    average of the time series ET 0 over the period considered [68]. RIMIS can provide
    information on the uniformity of water distribution, its lack or excess, which
    decisions to adopt for the next day, the equitable irrigation supply of tertiary
    canals, and the characterization of their irrigation distribution performance
    over the season. RIMIS dynamically links a field irrigation demand-forecasting
    model for the area irrigated by a canal network into the GIS, as developed with
    the VBA programming language in ArcGIS software [69]. SIMIS is intended for irrigated
    area management, and was designed to assist in planning and operations. It was
    based on a water balance model covering different modules to model a root zone
    water balance that was performed in daily time series steps [70]. AFSIRS is a
    GIS and database management system for the authorization and scheduling of irrigation
    water demand [71]. Water resource management decision making requires crucial
    knowledge, wisdom, and critical thinking, as well as interdisciplinary techniques
    to identify alternative courses of action and evaluate their effects. The combination
    of technology and the physical and life sciences helps managers to understand
    environmental problems. A dashboard or GIS system will not guide us to a good
    decision; it is a whole process. In other words, a decision-making system (a Dashboard
    or GIS system, etc.) is still an interactive computer system designed to help
    decision-makers use communication technologies, data, documents, knowledge, and
    models to accomplish the tasks of the decision-making process. 6. Discussion The
    use of new technologies, UAV, IoT sensors, and ML algorithms as data processing
    approaches, in precision agriculture and irrigation management particularly, offers
    a better vision with the possibility to link information to very specific crop
    locations. In irrigation management, spatial representation through maps of water
    stress distribution, evapotranspiration, and humidity, etc., allows the management
    of crop water requirements in a precise way, such that irrigation operations can
    be conducted by taking into account the variability and spatial and temporal distribution
    of these factors (Kc, Ψ, g, T, H, etc.). The way in which satellites help people’s
    daily lives is just as important, and the scope of information that satellites
    can provide is indispensable. Drones have been proven to be a reliable alternative
    when it comes to the collection of information that would otherwise be provided
    by satellites more quickly and less expensively. Typically, platforms collect
    information in very different ways, at completely different scales. Ultimately,
    using one or both depends on the tasks and the specific data to be obtained. In
    arboriculture, UAVs are a very practical tool presenting a medium-to-high performance
    for multiple applications [4,5,6,22,23,24,25,26,35,72]. With the high spatial
    and temporal resolutions that can be achieved, they allow the characterization
    of entire fields with high-quality images to analyze individual trees. Moreover,
    they offer the possibility of flying over the fields at the right time to perform
    various kinds of experiments. UAVs associated with the relevant sensors are powerful
    technologies to obtain accurate information about the spatial and temporal variations
    in the soil moisture and vegetation status in order to optimize irrigation system
    management. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of UAVs encourages their adoption
    by farmers because of economic advantages, including rapid and high-quality data
    collection. UAVs provide more suitable details on soil and orchards compared to
    satellite imagery and direct field inspection methods, which are tedious, costly,
    and time-consuming. The selection of the appropriate UAV platform depends on the
    type of application and the characteristics of the study area. More efforts are
    needed in the future to encourage end-users in arboriculture to incorporate UAVs
    into agricultural operations. Although UAVs have advantages over other technologies,
    and although their potential in arboriculture is huge, several challenges and
    limitations affect their adoption by farmers. It is a challenging decision to
    make, as it involves technical, agronomic, and economic factors. Many UAV platforms
    and onboard sensors are available in the market. Moreover, UAVs collect a huge
    amount of data. Advanced data analytics tools are required to extract and interpret
    information from the collected data. Therefore, an investment in time and money
    is necessary to learn the required skills for the suitable use of UAVs. Consequently,
    farmers require specific information on the technical and economic benefits of
    UAVs in arboriculture before adopting them. The issue of training is important
    in order to identify the compatibility of UAV technology with the actual practices
    of the farmers, to ensure the effective monitoring of the farm, reduce the production
    costs and provide suitable information from the UAV to improve the decision making.
    The automation of processes is also a requirement to guide the users through all
    of the steps of flight planning, data collection, data analysis, and interpretation.
    More efforts are needed in the future to encourage end-users in arboriculture
    to be more open to the use of UAVs. The adoption of ML algorithms, as a method
    of processing data extracted from UAV imagery, comes down to the fact that ML
    techniques are capable of handling optimization problems, in addition to handling
    multidimensional and multivariate data, and extracting implicit links within huge
    datasets in a complex environment, such as the relationship between water requirements
    and the physical and biological morphology of trees [5,7,37]. In order to identify
    a ML solution for data processing, especially in irrigation water management,
    several factors must be considered, e.g., the physical and biological morphology
    of the trees, their dynamic environment (where several factors can intervene such
    as land and atmosphere), and the non-linear and non-stationary dynamics of crop
    water demand. All of these considerations lead to the use of ANN techniques, particularly
    deep learning, which can be explained by the fact that a well-trained deep neural
    network can have the ability to describe non-linear dynamic phenomena and provide
    very interesting prospects for making indirect measurements of water requirements
    and forecasting their evolution. With the availability of a huge amount of labeled
    data, deep ANN is the most often-used method in many recent studies. However,
    the common challenges of ML applications are the acquisition of relevant data,
    the availability of existing data, and the quality and description of the data
    (metadata, labeled data). Furthermore, the data may have a high level of irrelevant
    and redundant information, which might influence the efficacy of the learning
    algorithms. On the other hand, the ability to collect and transfer data, over
    a real-time network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction,
    positions the IoT as an innovative technology for automated and smart irrigation
    [51,52,53,54,55]. For the architecture of an IoT irrigation management system,
    there are different types of sensors, such as humidity sensors, temperature sensors,
    and light sensors, etc.; various types of transmission methods, in particular
    Wifi, Bluetooth [51], WiMaX, Zigbee [57], GSM [54], and 3G [55]; and protocols
    such as IPv4, IPv6, MQTT, and DDS, etc., which can be used as discussed in Section
    4.1. The choice of sensors and or the configuration generally is directly related
    to the purpose behind the system. The method of transmission is related to the
    range and coverage of the system, as well as the nature of the transmitter and
    receiver used. The distinction is made due to the technical limitations [73] such
    as interference, such that the deployment of massive IoT devices for agricultural
    and other purposes will lead to interference issues that can result in data loss
    and reduce the IoT system’s reliability. As well as security and privacy, a lack
    of proper security can lead to data loss, privacy bridges, and access to raw information.
    Additionally, deploying IoT devices in an outdoor environment will expose the
    devices to harsh environmental conditions that can lead to the degradation of
    the deployed sensors over time, as well as communication failures. The adoption
    of the IoT has several benefits for irrigation in general, such as helping to
    promote community irrigation, especially in rural areas. The IoT may be used to
    promote services that allow the community to exchange data and information, as
    well as improving contact between farmers and agricultural specialists. In addition,
    the ability to reduce costs and reduce waste in the application of agricultural
    inputs, such as water, increases productivity. As well as the ability to remotely
    monitor devices and equipment, the ability to know when and where to irrigate
    will help save time and money in the inspection of the water status of large fields
    compared to personnel physically inspecting the field. 7. Conclusions The water
    stress that faces global agriculture requires a scientific intervention to develop
    solutions to this problem in order to ensure food security and sustainable development
    by making irrigation management one of the priorities. The papers treated have
    shown a significant contribution of UAV-ML-IoT technologies in irrigation management
    and the analysis of the water status of crops. This contribution is due to the
    relevant information that can be extracted from UAV images through the different
    sensors (RGB, multispectral, heperspectral, and thermal), and due to the ability
    of ML algorithms to define models for the estimation of water and other requirements
    by linking ground and aerial measurements, as shown by the medium-to-high correlation
    coefficients and the important role of wirelessly connected sensors in the implementation
    of smart systems. The challenge of water scarcity, combined with the utility of
    these technologies, has made the development of an integrated Drone-IoT-ML approach
    to irrigation management an absolute necessity. Focusing on Morocco and developing
    countries in general, the usefulness of these technologies can be emphasised in
    the face of a set of challenges such as the difficult financial situation of many
    farms and the inability of the farmer to use the information if human interventions
    are not available. Those challenges are likely to hinder the widespread adoption
    of these new technologies by farmers in order to adapt and modernize their production
    practices to obtain the best returns on these investments. Those facts suggest
    two perspectives for our next works, which are the estimation of water needs in
    the case of arboriculture, and the implementation of a system of which the role
    will be to balance the estimated water needs and the water provisioning, based
    on the Drone-IoT-ML approach. Author Contributions Conceptualization, Y.A., M.B.,

  description: 'Irrigation is critical to sustain agricultural productivity in dry
    or semi-dry environments, and center pivots, due to their versatility and ruggedness,
    are the most widely used irrigation systems. To effectively use center pivot irrigation
    systems, producers require tools to support their decision-making on when and
    how much water to irrigate. However, currently producers make these decisions
    primarily based on experience and/or limited information of weather. Ineffective
    use of irrigation systems can lead to overuse of water resources, compromise crop
    productivity, and directly reduce producers'' economic return as well as bring
    negative impacts on environmental sustainability. In this paper, we surveyed existing
    precision irrigation research and tools from peer-reviewed literature, land-grant
    university extension and industry products, and U.S. patents. We focused on four
    challenge areas related to precision irrigation decision-support systems: (a)
    data availability and scalability, (b) quantification of plant water stress, (c)
    model uncertainties and constraints, and (d) producers'' participation and motivation.
    We then identified opportunities to address the above four challenge areas: (a)
    increase the use of high spatial-temporal-resolution satellite fusion products
    and inexpensive sensor networks to scale up the adoption of precision irrigation
    decision-support systems; (b) use mechanistic quantification of ''plant water
    stress'' as triggers to improve irrigation decision, by explicitly considering
    the interaction between soil water supply, atmospheric water demand, and plant
    physiological regulation; (c) constrain the process-based and statistical/machine
    learning models at each individual field using data-model fusion methods for scalable
    solutions; and (d) develop easy-to-use tools with flexibility, and increase governments''
    financial incentives and support. We conclude this review by laying out our vision
    for precision irrigation decision-support systems for center pivots that can achieve
    scalable, economical, reliable, and easy-to-use irrigation management for producers.'

    Abstract Agricultural decision-making is crucial for future yields. In the context
    of smart farming, grower combine information from sensors located close to their

    Keywords Smart irrigationFeature selectionMachine learning 1. Introduction Developments
    in agricultural technologies are leading to its fourth revolution. The latter
    puts forward four essential requirements: increasing productivity, allocating
    resources reasonably, adapting to climate change, and avoiding food waste (Montesano
    et al., 2015, Zhai et al., 2020). One of the main challenges is to improve water
    resources management (Francesco et al., 2015). Smart irrigation directly affects
    crop performances and can lead to qualitative and quantitative improvements in
    vegetable production (Dukes et al., 2010). In the context of large scale agriculture,
    sprinkler irrigation (water cannon) remains the most widespread method of irrigation
    (FAO). Unfortunately, this technique is expensive, time-consuming and water-consuming.
    Nowadays, growers need to capitalize as much information as possible in order
    to better understand their environment, and, to be able to be advised in their
    decision-making process. Two aspects are essential: first, knowledge of the current
    soil moisture is the most critical element in this process (eos, 2019). This value
    is dynamic, which means that daily monitoring is required to analyze global trends.
    One of the indicators used to conduct a cultivation campaign is the Soil Water
    Potential (SWP). This metric corresponds to the effort that the plant must develop
    in order to extract water from the soil. The higher this value is, the more difficult
    it is for the plant to extract water and therefore the risk of hydric stress occurs.
    Cultivators can directly used this information to manage their campaign (Kassaye
    et al., 2020) or can be transformed into Soil Water Content (SWC) using Van Genuchten’s
    equation (Van Genuchten, 1980), if the soil characterisation is well known. This
    value is acquired via a tensiometer implant at the depth where you wish to observe.
    Generally sensors are located at the root level. From this value, thresholds can
    be established and characterize the soil water status (saturation, comfort, vigilance
    and stress) depending on the soil type. From there a grower can have a knowledge
    about the water reserves currently present in his soil. Second, being able to
    predict short-term evolutions of this information with a weekly vision is a major
    benefit for planters, since they can planning more efficiently their irrigations
    in terms of water input quantity or number of irrigations. Concerning soil moisture
    data acquisition, numerous methods have been proposed to acquire these information:
    • Direct measurement or gravimetric method (Erbach, 1987) remains the most reliable
    way to obtain these data and it is therefore essential for calibrating instruments
    used in the indirect methods. However these methods are extremely expensive, require
    numerous batteries of laboratory tests and destructive measurements taken in the
    field which lead to a high manpower cost, time consuming and potential handling
    problems. • Indirect or sensor measurement methods are good alternatives, allowing
    measurements without sampling (Erbach, 1987). Many sensor models exist (tensiometer,
    capacitive, resistive, hygrometric, …), their measurement methods differ but also
    allow to access to the knowledge of the soil moisture. However, the quality of
    the measurements is highly dependent on the quality of the sensors used. Indeed
    the sensors are subjected to climatic conditions (wind, rain, temperature) for
    a period of several months in the open field, which can lead to a degradation
    in their accuracy and reliability (Zazueta and Xin, 1994). Tensiometers are often
    preferred to other types of substrate moisture sensors due to their low cost,
    simplicity of use, and direct measurement of matric potential, and also, they
    are not influenced by temperature and soil osmotic potential (Montesano et al.,
    2015, Thalheimer, 2003). In a context of connected agriculture, the methods of
    data acquisition by sensor benefit from the advantages of IoT and can therefore
    upload data frequently in order to allow a monitoring up to a quarter of an hour.
    The proposed methodologies to make forecasts are based on the previously collected
    data. Latter are used as inputs into mathematical models, for instance: Jhonson
    (Johnson et al., 1986), STIC (Brisson et al., 2003), AQUACROP (Raes et al., 2009),
    WEEDRIQ (Ramat and Vandoorne, 2002), water balance (Allen et al., 1998), Penman
    (Howell and Evett, 2004). This approach has proved its relevance and robustness,
    unfortunately mathematical models introduce biases and biological simplifications.
    Moreover, they are parametric which means they have to be calibrated in order
    to use them optimally (Chen and Ma, 2006, Sorooshian et al., 1993, Dubois et al.,
    2019). The natural or biological phenomena under study involves features with
    a relationship among them that may be non-linear. Moreover, when the conditions
    of the phenomenon change, the relationships may also be modified. However, collected
    data may include similarities, natural symmetries, patterns and thus; designing
    a data-driven model able of approximating the relationships between the different
    elements is suitable. One way to deal with the data-driven approach is the Machine
    Learning (ML). In recent years, Machine Learning methods have been successfully
    applied to many real world applications, and in particular (Chen et al., 2020,
    Feng et al., 2017, Kumar et al., 2002) demonstrate the relevance of modeling complex
    biological phenomena such as evapotranspiration by transformation into a supervised
    learning problem solved by algorithms as Neural Network (NN), Random Forest (RF)
    or Support Vector Machine (SVM). Ali et al. (2015) pointed out that ML approaches,
    in most cases, outperformed parametric approaches for the prediction of biomass
    and soil moisture from satellite data. In the context of agriculture, Torres-Sanchez
    et al. (2020) successfully applied machine learning approach to predict weekly
    evapotranspiration for orchards crop and therefore the water needs. On the subject
    of potato cultivation in farmland, various topics are highlighted and well-documented.
    Methods using machine learning algorithms are successfully applied to provide
    a solution on these topics such as predicting leaf water potential (Zakaluk and
    Ranjan, 2006), modeling root development (Delgoda et al., 2016), tuber growth
    (Fortin et al., 2010), daily evapotranspiration prediction (Sabziparvar and Tabari,
    2010, Tabari et al., 2013, Yamaç and Todorovic, 2020), etc. The issue of evapotranspiration
    prediction is well documented, however concerning the SWP, to our knowledge, a
    methodology for weekly prediction of this indicator using a connected sensor-powered
    ML approach has not been proposed. In most studies involving sensors inserted
    in the ground, only one depth is considered. However, observing at several depths
    allows us to capture information relating to water exchanges between the different
    layers, for instance: percolation, capillary upwelling, etc. In most cases, the
    proposed resolution methods are developed with small experimental plots, and because
    of this, they are given for a particular climatic, geographical and soil type
    context. Thus they may not be applied directly in commercial agricultural fields
    (Filgueiras et al., 2020). Thus, it is still necessary to develop simple models
    that are executable in the practice of irrigated agriculture and at the same time
    are developed for large areas of agricultural crops (Filgueiras et al., 2020).
    There are many approaches but 2 main approaches are used: • model-based, in this
    case a reference model (e.g. Penman-Monteith Yamaç and Todorovic, 2020, Chia et
    al., 2020 or AquaCrop Raes et al., 2009, Linker et al., 2016, Delgoda et al.,
    2016, …) are used, generally an optimization is performed to improve the quality
    of predictions. • Data-driven approach uses, as described above, machines learning
    algorithms to generate models from observations obtained directly on fields (Tabari
    et al., 2013). These approaches have shown their relevance and robustness. The
    literature is very well documented on the methods and possible approaches for
    solving the above mentioned problems. In this study we have chosen to follow one
    of the methodologies commonly used to solve learning processes. Initially, features
    are defined either by experts in the field or by biological model equations. These
    characteristics represent the data necessary for learning the phenomenon or for
    its use in the equations. Then, data are collected through the use of sensors,
    and sometimes data sampling, allowing the collection of several historical campaigns
    aggregated together in order to generate the observation base. In the learning
    stage, the latter is then divided into 2 parts: learning and validation database.
    A strong constraint on the creation of the bases is the non division of a campaign.
    Indeed, if data from a campaign in the validation database are available for learning,
    then the model has a knowledge of the validation data and therefore loses its
    relevance. Eventually, the validation of the method consists in comparing the
    predictions made with a model (already existing reference model or generated by
    a learning algorithm previously learned on the learning database) with the response
    of a comparison model or with a validation database (unknown observations) made
    with the collected data. In this paper, we are interested in potato cultivation,
    for which irrigation plays a crucial role to avoid water stress (negative balance
    of water supply compared to plant transpiration). This can lead to a collapse
    of yields (van Loon, 1981). Using quality sensors can be a limiting factor for
    a large majority of farmers due to their expensive prices. In order to democratize
    these techniques we propose in this paper the use of low-cost sensor sets. Using
    affordable tensiometers is a good compromise between the accuracy of the measurements
    and the feasibility of being used by a large number of farmers. Moreover, it becomes
    possible in the long term to generate a database that is certainly inaccurate,
    but which can cover different types of soil, crops, climatic conditions, etc,
    which is crucial for a production start-up. Finally, it is possible to install
    sensors at different depths and thus modeling the evolution of the SWP at several
    layers as well as possible capture exchanges between them. We model the problem
    of predicting water potential as a learning problem. Since real data are difficult
    to obtain, we propose to aggregate the values of several type of sensors (tensiometer,
    rain gauge, temperature) into inputs. We take into account the values of the tensiometers
    at 3 depths. We design the inputs for use in the learning process. The water potential
    value will be used as a label (output) in order to solve this problem by supervised
    learning algorithms like NN, RF and SVM. The learning process does not necessarily
    need all the features to find a relationship that best explains the phenomenon.
    Thus, judiciously choosing the most proper features leads to a model that may
    be easier and faster to learn, more robust and/or more explicable. In addition,
    later on, if other features are used to improve the existing model, the feature
    selection method will be able to keep them or reject them automatically if they
    are not relevant. The novelty of this work is to propose a methodology to forecast
    SWP trends at several depths up to week (which is a important metric for crop
    management and decision-making,), thanks to a learning process in a potato growing
    context fed by remote sensors. we also propose to use feature selection method
    to automatically design models. To our knowledge there is no similar work. Contributions
    of this work can be summarized as follows: • We model the soil water potential
    prediction problem as a learning problem solved by supervised learning approach
    and low-cost sensors for data collection. • We predict the water potential of
    a potato crop farmland for up to a week at 3 different depths. • We use feature
    selection methods, in order to automatically design model with the most relevant
    features. • We compare performances of models (with and without feature selection)
    of different machine learning algorithms under different climatic conditions.
    The scope of this contribution is limited for the moment to one type of soil:
    ”sandy clay loam”. The goal is indeed to put aside, for this study, the influence
    of the soil composition on the evolution of the soil water potential. The rest
    of the paper is organized as follow: Section 2 detail the study area and data
    and explains the different supervised learning methods used in this work. Section
    3 explains the feature selection used in this work. Section 4 details the methodology
    used to address the issue. Then, we present performance evaluation and experimental
    results in Section 5. Finally we conclude and present our future work in Section
    6. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area and data The predictive model is built
    using sensor data from historical potato growing campaigns. The test crops used
    are close to each other and are located in the north of France, on the seafront.
    The climate is oceanic, which characterizes variable, windy weather, moderate
    summer temperatures, prominent humidity, and abundant but low precipitation. We
    assume from experts that crops have the same type of soil. Soil moisture acquisition
    is carried out by tensiometers. In this study 3 depths are considered: 20, 30
    and 40 cm depth. As, in general, potato’s roots depth do not exceed 35–40 cm in
    this region. These depths are appropriate in order to predict the water potential,
    since it is at these depths that the plant collect the water it needs. We use
    3 measurement points per depth (i.e. 9 measurements) since the sensors are not
    accurate (because we used cheap sensors, see Section 1), the average of 3 measurement
    points is an acceptable compromise. The weather is provided by weather stations
    which are located less than 5 km away from the crops. The measurement campaign
    covers a period of 3 years (2016, 2018 and 2019) over the months of April to September.
    The year 2016 is characterized by heavy precipitation and 2019 by low precipitation.
    Over these 3 years, we have data from 3 or 4 crops per year, resulting in 10 time
    series in total. Each day of measurement is considered as an independent observation
    and are our learning database. The growing time for potato cultivation is short,
    averaging 90 days, however we had to remove the days where sensor values are not
    usable. There are different reasons why values are not correct, for instance,
    during the sensor calibration period, or because of technical problems or sensor
    displaced due to tractors passing…. After this preprocessing, the number of measurement
    points is about 750. A measurement point corresponds to the information provided
    by the sensors for a given day. All the characteristics to be taken into account
    in this phenomenon have been provided by the agronomists and are listed in Table
    1. Table 1. The 5 features we used in the experiments presented in this paper.

    a plant expressed in degree Celcius per day resulting from the sum of degrees

    water pressure is above 140 kPa For each example, we have the weather of the past
    3 days and the weather forecast of the next 7 days. The total number of features
    is then 45. The database includes the daily average values of the tensiometer
    at 3 depths of the different crops, from planting to defoliating, as well as water
    inputs, irrigation, rainfall and temperature for the weather. the input data are
    normalized in order to remove the scaling effect of raw data. The normalization
    process can be done by applying Eq. 1 on the raw data. (1) where is the normalized
    data, x is the raw data, is the maximum value of input vector and is the minimum
    value of the input vector. Fig. 1 shows the correlation matrix of the different
    features at our disposal. We have the 5 previously defined features among the
    time range studied: • Water pressure: P1, P2, P3 and P_day_∗ or all previous and
    next days. • Mean temperature: T_mean_∗ for all previous and next days. • Rainfall:
    Rainfall_∗ for all previous and next days. • Age: Age_day_∗ or all previous and
    next days • Dry: Dry_P1, Dry_P3, Dry_P3 binary value that states whether the sensor

    full-size image Fig. 1. Correlation matrix of the 5 features used in this study,
    among the time period studded (see text). Some features are more correlated than
    others: rainfalls and irrigations forecast (i.e. water inputs) have a serious
    negative correlation with the water Pressure (P1, P2 and P3), which is expected
    since water inputs is in this study the only, a priori, possible way for this
    value to decrease. However, these features have a stronger influence on the upper
    ground layer than the others, which seems expected, since the water input will
    reach the first layer first. Age and Temperature also seems to have an impact,
    which is also expected. 2.2. Neural network A neural network (Werbos, 1994) is
    a computational system inspired by biological neural networks. It is able to learn,
    without the need of prior knowledge, specific tasks using examples. Fig. 2a represents
    a neural schema. A network is made up of neurons. Each neuron is defined by several
    weighted inputs, and a bias. Eq. 2 explains the neuron computation. The sum of
    inputs multiplied by their corresponding signals , including the bias , is given
    to a transfer function which can be for example a sigmoid, a relu, or a hyperbolic
    tangent function. Formally, the final output value y of the neuron with p inputs
    is computed following: (2) Download : Download high-res image (378KB) Download

    methods with Random Forest Regressor learning algorithm according to several metrics.
    The higher the k parameter (RFE), the more parameters per output are retained.
    A high Threshold (FM) indicates that only parameters with a significant contribution
    score per output will be retained. Except for , lower is better. Neurons are often
    grouped into layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers and an output layer.
    Thus, neurons of the same layer share the same inputs but there are not connected
    to each other. The output values of the neurons in one layer are used as inputs
    to the neurons in the next layer. In this paper, the considered neural network
    is a feed-forward fully connected, which means that every unit belonging to each
    layer is connected to every unit belonging to the adjacent layer without any loop
    or cycle. Thus the information is transferred from input layer to output layer
    through each hidden layer (see Fig. 2b). The output layer consists of several
    neurons representing the different desired predictions (see Section 2.1), and
    the transfer function used for this layer is a simple linear function. Predicting
    with a neural network involves a learning phase. During this phase, the learning
    process is supervised. Thus, thanks to a set of examples with expected output
    information (predictions), the model can be trained using an optimization process.The
    more various examples there are, the better the prediction of the model may be.
    In our case study, we predict the soil moisture, that is a continuous value. This
    problem is known as a regression problem. During the learning stage,its ability
    to generalize is tested on a test base, i.e. an unknown set of examples (see Section
    5). We use a standard backpropagation algorithm (Werbos, 1974). The error between
    predicted value and the sensor value is back propagated to the input layer adjusting
    the weights and biases in each layer thanks to an optimization algorithm. In the
    context of low data there is a risk of overfitting: the model can learn the statistical
    noise of small data set, which leads to poor performance in generalization (i.e.
    on unseen examples). Combining many networks with different topologies on the
    same database reduces this problem but in practice it is quite difficult to use.
    One regularization method to prevent overfitting is the dropout (Srivastava et
    al., 2014). The idea behind this approach is to simulate many network topologies
    from a single network. 2.3. Random forest A Decision Tree is a machine learning
    algorithm which is invariant under scaling and various other transformations of
    feature values. It is robust to inclusion of irrelevant features, and produces
    understandable models. However, they are rarely accurate, and if the decision
    tree grows too much and there is a risk of overfitting. The first designation
    of the Random Forest (Breiman et al., 1984) is a combination of Breiman’s bagging
    idea and random selection of features introduced by Ho (Ho, 1995). Random Forest
    is an ensemble learning which combines the concepts of random subspaces and bagging.
    The random forest algorithm performs training on multiple decision trees trained
    on different subsets of data in parallel. The construction of decision trees is
    done using the boostrap method to randomize the use of variables and data. In
    the context of regression, the prediction of unseen samples is made by the mean
    of the output. This approach improves the performance of decision trees because
    it decreases the variance of the model, without increasing the bias. RF algorithm
    can be defined as described in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Random Forest This algorithm
    has several parameters. The 3 main parameters free to be tuned in our implementation
    are: • Minimum sample leaf • Number of decision trees • Maximum feature attributes
    In this study we use the scikit-learn (scikit learn, 2020a) library to implement
    RandomForest. 2.4. Support vector machine Originally developed for classification
    tasks (Vapnik, 1995), this algorithm is used for regression (Drucker et al., 1997)
    (called Support Vector Regression or SVR). This algorithm can be applied for many
    machine learning problems and can, depending on the data, have performance similar
    or superior to the Neural Network and RandomForest. Its advantage is to be able
    to work with large data sizes while having a low number of hyperparameters to
    tinned and it is known to have good results in practice. The concept of its approximation
    function is based on the Statistical Learning Theory (Vapnik, 2013) plus a set
    of normalized input/output examples. In context of regression, let be a training
    sample , the goal is to find an as close as possible using the form given in Eq.
    3 (Lin et al., 2006): (3) where is a matrix with high-dimensional space. To estimate
    coefficients W and b a regularised risk function is used (Li et al., 2009). Although
    we consider that if the loss is zero it implies that explains . SVR assumes that
    we can accept a maximum ∊ deviation between and y. The underlying idea is to avoid
    overfitting by accepting an error’s margin. Thus, SVR calculates the loss when
    the absolute value of the difference between and y is greater than ∊ . During
    the training, if a point is predicted within an area centered on y and with width
    of ∊ then the point is considered correct. The impact of the error margin is therefore
    a crucial parameter to tune in order to have good performance in generalization:
    a too small margin allows a better learning at the risk of over-learning while
    a too large margin can have poor performance in generalization. To implement the
    SVR, we use the scikit-learn library1. 2 parameters are free for adjustment: •
    ∊ , which is the width of the acceptance band. • C, a regularization parameter.
    The strength of the regularization is inversely proportional to C. It must be
    strictly positive. 3. Feature selection Feature selection is a preprocess method
    of dimensionality reduction. Its objective is to generate a lighter model by excluding
    some of the features that contribute the least to explaining a phenomenon while
    limiting the degradation of model performance. In context of several outputs to
    predict, each output must be considered independently, since it is impossible
    that the same features contribute the best to all outputs. In this case the resulting
    lightweight models can be seen as a unique collection of features from the list
    of selected features for each output (possibility of features redundancy). From
    a set of examples containing inputs and outputs, the algorithm uses a metric using
    the correlations/relationships between features to establish a ranking order based
    on their contribution to explain the output. There are several methods of feature
    selection with different strategies such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
    or Filter Method (FM), Forward Selection (FS), …. Each method needs a metric to
    classify the features in order of importance. Thus a estimator is used to provide
    them with this information. All algorithms that can generate this metric can be
    used, for instance, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear
    kernel, LASSO, …. One of the advantages of these methods is that they do not require
    any prior knowledge to select the features that best explain the problem. However,
    a major drawback of this approach is the weighting issue. Indeed, the ranking
    of features is established prior to the training based on the available data (train
    database). If an unknown observation disagrees with the learning base, then the
    ranking can be questioned and may lead the algorithms to exclude one or more relevant
    features and thus penalize the generalization of the light model. In this study,
    2 methods of features selection are studied: • Filter method (scikit learn, 2020b,
    Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003): A estimator is used to assign a score for each feature
    and rank them in order of importance. The selection of the best a priori parameters
    is made according to a threshold. All features with a score greater than or equal
    to the threshold are preserved. The value of the threshold is a hyper parameter
    which is provided by the user. Higher the threshold is, the fewer features are
    kept. • Recursive Elimination Feature (scikit learn, 2020c): From the available
    set of features and a Given external estimator that assigns weights to features
    (e.g., the coefficients of a linear model), the goal of recursive feature elimination,
    is to recursively pruned a feature that contributes the least to the explanation
    of the output. First, the estimator is trained on the initial set of features
    and the importance of each feature is made. The feature which contribute the least
    is pruned and this procedure is recursively repeated on the pruned set until K
    best features is eventually reached. The value of the hyper parameter K is provided
    by the user. Feature selection strategies can therefore be very different. For
    example, RFE uses an iterative process while FM uses a one-shot approach. When
    the number of features to be estimated is important, RFE can take more time to
    calculate than FM. In case of several output to consider, the process cannot be
    directly applied to all of them. Indeed the methods are used to capture the relationships
    between the inputs and 1 output. In order to tackle this problem, it is necessary
    to decompose the problem with X outputs into X problems with 1 output. Each of
    them has the same inputs. In this way the feature selection methods are able to
    select specific features for each output. Algorithm 2, Algorithm 3 describe the
    feature selection methods used in this study. Here again we have used the scikit-learn
    library for both these approaches. Algorithm 2 Filter Method Algorithm 3 Recursive
    Feature Elimination. 4. Processing modeling The problem of soil water potential
    prediction is similar to the problems described in Section 1, and recently in
    Yamacc (Yamaç and Todorovic, 2020) which proposes a comparison of different learning
    algorithms to estimate the daily evapotranspiration value for the potato crop
    over 4 scenarios against an FAO equation. Thus the methodology used in this work
    follows the same principles: • All available features used for the learning process
    are given by agronomists. • Data collection is carried out using sensors. • Historical
    campaigns are divided into 2 databases (learning and validation) without introducing
    knowledge of one into the other. • Models are generated using supervised learning
    algorithms. • Validation is carried out by measuring the model prediction error
    on test campaigns. Moreover, like (Yamaç and Todorovic, 2020, You et al., 2020,
    Chia et al., 2020) we compare different learning algorithms, in our case NN, RF
    and SVR which have proven their relevance for solving similar problems (see Section
    1). However, we choose to predict SWP and not evapotranspiration and those over
    a larger time window, namely 7 days (like in (Torres-Sanchez et al., 2020)) in
    the future in our study compared to 1 day proposed in most of the studies mentioned
    above, which is important to note. Compared to other studies, we assume that the
    sensors used here are not necessarily very accurate, because the objective is
    to be able to test the relevance of their use to collect data to learn the phenomena
    in a production context (i.e. with all sources of uncertainty, technical problems,
    …).Moreover, the choice of features is an important point to take into account
    in learning problems (Löw et al., 2013, Chu et al., 2012, Zhao and Magoules, 2011).
    Therefore,we add to our methodology a feature selection step, with the intention
    to automatically generate lighter or robust models but also to select the most
    suitable features and thus make the models resistant to the insertion of non-essential
    features as they will be automatically excluded. Indeed, it is possible that not
    all features are necessarily useful to the algorithms to explain the observations.
    Thus, we investigate 2 approaches of feature selection: Recursive Feature Elimination
    (RFE) (Granitto et al., 2006, You et al., 2020) and Filter Method (FM). To the
    best of our knowledge, this work is new in the field of potato cultivation. In
    this study, we assume the weather forecasts are correct, and with a perspective
    to a production release, we limit the forecast to 7 days due to the reliability
    of our current weather models. The data set is divided into 2 parts: • the training
    set, which is the available data to design a predictive model. • the test set,
    that corresponds to an entire growing campaign on a crop that is not in the training
    set. This is the cleanest way to have a independent test set, and to be sure not
    to introduce any bias. Indeed, since the data are from a few time series, using
    random sampling on all of them may lead to testing the forecasting on points close
    to those it has already learned (i.e. not be fully independent). We perform a
    leave-two-out cross validation: two crop are removed from the available data set
    to serve as the test set and the others 8 crops corresponds to the current the
    training set, and then, we loop on all fields. This design choice is a compromise
    between the low amount of learning data, and the statistical accuracy to be able
    to interpret the results. Thus, the number of test folds in cross-validation method
    becomes where since we have which is large enough to be statistically significant.
    Our problem is not trivial as there are 21 outputs to predict, i.e. 3 depths to
    predict over 7 days. Thus, we design 2 sets of experiments: • For the first experiment,
    we are interested in the impact of the feature selection method in the creation
    of lighter model as well as their performances. As these methods need a estimator
    to generate a metric for scoring the contribution to the output, we are also interested
    in the influence of the algorithm used. Finally we study the importance of the
    threshold value. • For the 2nd experiment, we compare both the best lightweight
    models for each algorithm and models with all available features. We are interested
    in the global performances as well as in the evolution of the error according
    to the i-th day to be predicted in front of different metrics. Additionally, we
    present the predictions of our decision support tool on particular test campaigns.
    The interest here is to provide readers with a visual of what will be proposed
    for tiller as well as difficulties related to this issue. The weather (in particular
    the precipitation) and the irrigations have a strong impact on the soil moisture
    between the depths of 0 and 20 cm, corresponding to the area above the upper sensor.
    It is important to keep in mind that it is difficult to model what happen between
    the ground surface and the measure of the upper sensor (the same difficulty appears
    between where the water is directly usable by the roots. The unit used by sensors
    is the kPa and the range of values stands between 0 kPa (rainoff soil) and 200
    kPa (drought). It should be noted that values between 0 and 20 kPa (soil saturated)
    and above 150 kPa (soil very dry), can not be measured accurately by sensors.
    In this work, the proposed neural network consists of a feed forward neural network
    developed thanks to the Keras library.2 The network is composed of 1 hidden layer
    of 600 neurons using a sigmoid activation function and 1 output layer of 21 outputs
    using a linear activation function. The reason for the number of output is explained
    in the Section 2.1. In addition, we use a dropout at 0.2 in order to avoid overfitting.
    The proposed topology is the result of an empirical study of different topologies.
    We present here the one that has obtained the best results at the moment. For
    Random Forest, after a grid search study we set the number of decision trees to
    500 and the number of maximum attributes for a tree equal to the number of available
    features, which gives experimentally the best results. All other parameters are
    the default ones in the scikit library. For SVR, we use the ’linear’ kernel, other
    kernels were tested but this one had best results the C-value is set to 5, and
    ∊ -value to which gives experimentally the best results. 5. Results and discussion
    This section presents the different experiences that have been made as well as
    an interpretation of the results. 5.1. Performances evaluation To evaluate the
    accuracy of our models, we consider the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (see Eq. 4),
    the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (see Eq. 5) and the R squared (R2) (see Eq.
    6). (4) (5) (6) where n is the number of examples, the real tensiometer value
    for the day i at depth average of the measurements and the model prediction for
    the day i at depth j. Since we have 3 depths to consider each day, for a given
    day the MAE, RMSE and criteria to minimize, is then average the errors over the
    3 depths: Please note that for the models resulting from the feature selection
    stage are grouped together and their performance is thus measured in the same
    way as for global models, i.e. with all outputs to be considered at the same time
    5.2. Feature selection comparison For the first experience, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig.
    4 show the impact of the hyper parameter of the two feature selection methods
    (Threshold for Filter method (FM) and k, the number of features to keep, for RFE)
    in front of different metrics defined by Eqs. 5.1 after a leave-two-out cross-validation
    has been performed. As explained in Section 4 using a leave-two-out cross validation
    allows us to have statistically significant performances and so we can compare
    the means. Download : Download high-res image (387KB) Download : Download full-size

    the feature selection methods with Neural Network learning algorithm according
    to several metrics. The higher the k parameter (RFE), the more parameters per
    output are retained. A high Threshold (FM) indicates that only parameters with
    a high contribution score per output will be retained. Except for , lower is better.
    For the FM, on the x-axis, high threshold values mean that a small number of features
    are selected. On the opposite, for the RFE, high values mean that a large number
    of features are retained. On these graphs are represented the various estimators
    used to select the features: SVR with a linear kernel (SVRL), LASSO with cross
    validation (LASSO) and Random Forest Regressor (RF). Other estimators can be considered.
    Concerning the results, first, the performances of the feature selection methods
    are quite similar between the learning algorithms. The rapid decrease of the error
    (MAE and RMSE) when the hyper parameter is low (up to 10 for LASSO and 15 for
    RF and SVRL) for RFE indicates that from this value the models have enough feature
    to be able to learn the phenomenon properly. According to the results, LASSO is
    able to select the most relevant parameters when the hyper parameter is very low
    whatever the learning algorithm. Then its performance is comparable to SVRL. about
    RF, for the Feature Selection, According to the results, for RFE, higher the k
    parameter is, the better the prediction is. Indeed, both the MAE and the RMSE
    are decreasing while slightly increase which is expected. Concerning the estimator,
    although the performances of RF and SVRL are equivalent, Lasso with cross validation
    has a better dynamic. We can notice that LASSO find a consistent set of parameter
    with which is much better than RF and SVM whatever the metric. Beyond this value
    the MAE and RMSE performances converge but the score remains slightly higher than
    SVRL and higher than RF. This suggests that LASSO has succeeded in selecting the
    most important features. It can also be argued that the resulting model has lower
    extreme deviations (lower RMSE) than the other methods, which should also explain
    the higher correlation coefficient. As explained in Section 3, since several outputs
    have to be taken into account, there are k features selected per output, but since
    these outputs are not identical, the combination of all these outputs forms a
    larger set. For instance, for RF using a RFE method with LASSO as an estimator
    with hyper parameter . the resulting models so use 10 features by output but the
    overall unique collection set is 30 features, i.e. about 25% less than the model
    with all features. On his side, for FM, the strategy is different. Higher the
    threshold is, lower the number of feature is kept. But Only those with an importance
    score greater than or equal to the threshold are retained. Thus there is no guarantee
    about a constant number of features per output. Here, LASSO and SVRL have similar
    performance while RF shows a degradation from . This suggests that RF score less
    effectively the features. Here, the best setting of the hyper parameter is reached
    for LASSO and SVRL when for these value, the number of unique feature is then
    43 (up to 33 features by output). As SVR’s performances are identical, the conclusions
    are therefore the same. The number of features per output depending on the selection
    method and the estimators are the same. Finally for NN, for RFE, according to
    the errors, MAE is higher than for RF or SVR. But RMSE and are better, with respective
    values of 13.7 and 0.78 achieved with SVRL as estimator and . The resulting models
    use 20 features by output and the unique collection set of features is then 33.
    These results indicate that on average NN has lower extreme errors. About the
    estimators, RF has the worst performances whatever the feature selection method.
    This echoes what has been said before. For the FM, Apart from RF, SVRL and LASSO
    also have similar performances. Since the impact of the threshold and estimator
    is low, if we look at , then the number of features per output is at most 29 for
    a total of 35 unique features. Discussion. For feature selection method, first,
    at that point, reformulate a problem with several outputs into several problems
    with 1 output using a feature selection method allows us to automatically design
    models with the most pertinent features for each output. The estimator used to
    score features have a significant impact on the resulting model in terms of performances,
    while the feature selection method impact the number of features kept. For RF,
    SVR using RFE as feature selection with the LASSO method with cross validation
    as estimator offers the most interesting models, a priori, since it has a low
    error while maintaining a higher than the other methods. For NN, usign RFE with
    SVRL provides the best results in terms of and RMSE. Common features between the
    different methods tested and the different estimators used. The values of the
    tensiometers and the future precipitation are always selected. This seems obvious,
    but it is interesting to note that these feature selection methods validate these
    features as values that are crucial for learning process. Then, come the temperature
    values and the age of the plant. The Age feature was not necessarily expected,
    but indeed, there is a correlation between the age of the plant and the increase
    in Water Pressure (the greater the age, the more developed the plant is and the
    greater its water needs). These observations matches with the correlation matrix
    1. Performance comparison. The Fig. 5 shows the boxplots colorized according to
    the machine learning algorithm used (RF, SVR and NN) and grouped according feature
    selection method. Each boxplot of a group corresponds respectively to: • Without
    a selection method, i.e. using all available features (None). • Recursive Feature

    parameters for each method. Except for , lower is better. The best set of parameters
    of each feature selection method according to the metrics has been used. For RF
    and SVR for RFE, the k parameter is 10 and for FM the Threshold parameter is 16.
    Both of them use LASSO as estimator. For NN, for RFE the k parameter is 20 and
    for FM the Threshold parameter is 25. The estimator used for RFE and FM is SVRL
    First of all, within a learning method (with or without feature selection), apart
    from SVR, the means are quite similar whatever the metrics. For MAE and RMSE,
    maximum errors are lower (which is especially the case for NN) when the feature
    selection is used. In contrast, the minimum values of are higher. This is an interesting
    point since it shows that the lighter models are able to do as well than the model
    with all feature. In addition, SVR’s performance is significantly improved when
    the feature selection is used. Now, If we compare machine learning algorithms
    with each other, when no feature selection is used RF has the best average performance.
    NN, however, has a higher minimum value. But when the feature selection is used,
    SVR has similar performance to RF. NN has a higher mean error, but lower maximum
    values for MAE and RMSE. Dispersion is also lower. For , the minimums are higher
    for NN, than RF. Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 details respectively the performance
    of Fig. 4, Fig. 2, Fig. 3.The results confirm the analysis of the boxplots. Table

    overall performance in order to detail the evolution of the error according to
    the number of days to be predicted for each depth (P1, P2 and P3), Fig. 6, Fig.
    7, Fig. 8 show this evolution according the same metrics (MAE, RMSE and ). Here,
    The same hyper parameters are kept. Thus the graphs show another point of view.
    For RF, SVR and NN, predict 1 day ahead achieve great performance with score above
    0.92 whatever the feature selection method used. This accuracy is equivalent to
    the performance of other studies on evapotranspiration (Soil Water Potential here).
    When the number of days to be predicted increases the performance remains correct
    up to 4 days and then deteriorates beyond that. At 7 days the error increases
    sharply, but remains correct. However the score collapses, which indicate that
    the prediction seems more uncertain. If we focus on the different depths, we notice
    that the evolution of the error is not the same according to the depth. At 20
    cm the error increases faster than for 30 and 40 cm. This can be explained by
    a greater water dynamic at 20 cm than at 30 and 40 cm. Another possible explanation
    is that both the learning and test base has few number of observation with severe
    tensiometer values (close to 200 kPa) at these depths. Eventually if we focus
    on feature selection method, the different algorithms have similar performances
    when the feature selection is used but different from the model with all features
    (NONE). It is noticeable that the latter learns the first depth (P1) better than
    the other two (P2 and P3) regardless of the number of days to predict, unlike
    models with feature selection which learns the different depths more equally.
    The scores are significantly less spread with the selection method (and better
    for P2 and P3) than with the none feature selection. This behaviour is confirmed
    with the other metrics. So if we take into account all depths, up to 5 days, it
    is preferable to use the model with feature selection (RFE or FM). Beyond that,
    if we are interest only by P1, it is more appropriate to use the all feature (NONE).
    These results are interesting since it highlights the fact that the global model
    (NONE) can focus on 1 depth (rather than the others) while the feature selection
    is able to efficiently select the most important features for each output since
    each output have the most relevant ones. Download : Download high-res image (488KB)

    as they show that feature selection methods are suitable to generate such high-performance
    models. More, the automatic lightweight model design process is relevant in view
    of the encouraging results since the differences are (at least) quite small compare
    to the model with all feature, more the spread out is lower. It is also interesting
    to point out that the models have less discrepancies regarding performance between
    depths (whatever the metrics). 5.3. Short-term weekly soil moisture predictions
    Irrigation tool. Since NN is the learning method with the lowest extreme errors
    (max bound), we will select it. Indeed, on land of several hectares, the variation
    of the SWP between 2 areas of the plot can then be higher than 10 kPa (i.e. higher
    than the error made by the algorithms). Thus it is preferable to choose an algorithm
    that behaves better when the prediction conditions are unfavourable i.e. to predict
    global trends as accurately as possible and with reduced extreme errors. Fig.
    9, Fig. 10, Fig. 11 show some output of our predictive tool, representing a complete
    test campaigns using neural network learning algorithm. These curves represent
    a solution proposed to grower to address the problem of weekly SWP prediction.
    The black line illustrates the tensiometer values while the black dotted line
    represents the 7th-day forecast values by our neural network, in other words the
    most difficult long range prediction. Fig. 9 is the field corresponds to the campaign
    on which our model had the best performances. Here, visually the 7-th Day forecast
    over the whole campaign is very close to the ground truth. Fig. 10 represents
    a campaign where rainfall was abundant. On the first 2 depths (20 and 30 cm) the
    performances are also more than correct. The predictions at the last depth seem
    more chaotic but one must take into account the scale of the graph. Indeed here,
    the error is about 5 kPa, which is not significant for field areas of several
    hectars. Eventually, Fig. 11 correspond to the field with the worst performance.
    These campaigns are affected by dry spell and the soil was often drought. The
    learning databases include few samples covering these conditions. This explain
    the relative poor forecasting, in extreme conditions, in particular at the beginning
    (before 20 days) and at the end (after 70 days) of the campaign. The fall of kPa
    that occurred around day 64 was due to the rain that the rain gauge measured but
    the sensors in the ground did not see it. One possible explanation is that the
    rain sensor was located at a certain distance from the plot, so rain could have
    really happened but outside the plot. Download : Download high-res image (139KB)

    (neural network here) is able to learn the trends of each campaign, even if the
    prediction quality can be heterogeneous. These figures provide a visualization
    of the prediction model. Eventually the proposed tool will present this type of
    information to the planter in order to give them a trend for the coming days.
    6. Conclusion In this paper, we model the problem of Soil Water Potential into
    a supervised learning problem. The problem is not trivial since there 21 outputs
    to predict (3 depths for each day and 7 days to predict) In addition, we use feature
    selection methodology in order to automatically design lighter models using the
    most suitable features. This work is a step forward, as we directly work with
    farmers, and the goal is to help them in decision making process, in an economical
    and ecological points of view. We use the information provided by low-cost tensiometers
    in order to make its use as democratic as possible. As a result, the leave-two-out
    cross validation, allows us to present statistically significant results. The
    similar performance between the feature selection methods indicates that a lighter
    model can achieve close performance, which is an important point. In addition,
    if new features are introduced this method will automatically reject the least
    significant features and therefore be more robust. However, these methods require
    the tuning of the hyper parameters. About the methods, using a machine learning
    approach is relevant. With a larger database we will be able to improve the performance
    of algorithms. For future work, we will increase the number of fields monitored
    and thus increase the current database. Few shot learning algorithms are also
    a way to explore since they are able to learn from a (very) limited number of
    examples. The interest of this approach is a good compromise compared to parametric
    models, or expensive destructive sampling. However, there is still room for improvements,
    with more data we could test current and new approaches on other type of soil,
    kind of crops or other weather. Since feature selection methods have an important
    impact on the model’s design process, it would be pertinent to explore other approaches.
    Using a time series approach such as recurrent networks (RNN) or Long Short Time
    Memory (LSTM) could also be convenient too (Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018).
    Their ability to learn from natural symmetries, patterns or other similarities
    related to temporal phenomena should improve current performance. In these case,
    a performance comparison with other temporal approach like ARIMA (the next value
    is predicted using previous values an autoregressive model, and a moving average
    model) method could also be investigated. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    site-specific irrigation in ‘VARIwise’. • MPC accommodated both short-term (in-season)
    and long-term performance objectives. • MPC delivered the best performance when
    optimising crop yield. • MPC resulted in higher (simulated) yield than sensor-based
    strategies. • MPC required extensive data to accurately calibrate crop model.
    Abstract Model-based control strategies applied to irrigation make decisions (on
    water application and/or timing) using a crop and/or soil production model. Decisions
    are made with respect to an optimisation objective which, for irrigation, can
    be either short-term (e.g. achieving/maintaining a set soil–water deficit) or
    predicted end-of-season (e.g. maximising final yield) by predicting how the crop
    will respond at the end of the season. In contrast, sensor-based irrigation strategies
    rely on achieving a performance that is measurable during the crop season to provide
    the feedback control, and may not necessarily optimise overall crop performance.
    Model-based control potentially avoids this limitation. This paper describes the
    application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) methodology to the feedback control
    of irrigation via a model-based irrigation strategy implemented in the irrigation
    control simulation framework ‘VARIwise’. The requirement to also accommodate spatial
    and temporal differences in crop water requirement across a heterogeneous field
    is met by defining management ‘zones’ according to differing soil and crop properties
    across the field and separately applying the control algorithm for each of these
    zones. Case studies were conducted to evaluate MPC for a centre pivot irrigation
    machine-irrigated cotton crop (under typical Australian growing conditions) with:
    (i) different in-season performance objectives (maintaining soil–water deficit;
    maximising square count); (ii) different predicted end-of-season performance objectives
    (maximising yield; maximising water use efficiency); and (iii) maximising yield
    with different field data inputs for model calibration. The Model Predictive Control
    strategy produced significantly higher simulated yields and water use efficiency
    than an industry-standard irrigation management strategy; and (in most but not
    all situations) direct sensor-based adaptive control strategies. Previous article

    moveSchedulingIrrigation automationModel Predictive Control 1. Introduction The
    development of the control simulation framework ‘VARIwise’ has enabled the evaluation
    of site-specific, spatially-variable irrigation control strategies on field crops
    (McCarthy et al., 2010a). VARIwise permits spatially and temporally varied simulation
    and accommodates sub-field scale variations in all input parameters down to metre-scale
    zone size. Simulations of ‘sensor-based’ strategies showed potential improvements
    in yield and water use efficiency (McCarthy et al., 2014). These strategies compared
    the field measurements with a desired response (e.g. soil–water deficit) and adjusted
    the irrigation volume applied according to the difference. 1.1. Model Predictive
    Control (MPC) applied to irrigation In contrast, an alternative ‘advanced process
    control’ approach to irrigation uses crop production models to aid the irrigation
    decision making process. These ‘model-based’ control strategies use the available
    field measurements to calibrate the crop model. The model is then repeatedly executed
    to determine the optimal irrigation volume and timing that will achieve the desired
    performance objective (e.g. predicted end-of-season yield). The methodology of
    Model Predictive Control (MPC) involves using a model to predict the optimal input
    signal at the current time considering future events over a finite time period
    (Kwon and Han, 2005). This is referred to as a ‘control horizon length’. Only
    the first optimal control action is implemented after each time step. MPC is applicable
    to irrigation since a soil-plant-atmosphere model may be used to evaluate the
    application of various irrigation volumes on a fixed number of consecutive days.
    For example, the model may be used to, firstly, determine the best irrigation
    volume to apply on each zone for each of the next three days; and, secondly, determine
    which day resulted in the best overall performance. The future process outputs
    used to evaluate the irrigation scheme may be predicted daily with measurements
    of crop response (e.g. for cotton, square/boll count, leaf area index) or soil–water.
    Alternatively, the simulated final crop yield or water use efficiency may be used
    to evaluate the various irrigation schemes. From the control perspective, the
    ‘process model’ evolves during the growth of the crop such that the control must
    be adaptive. This requirement means that the model used by the MPC strategy must
    be continuously re-calibrated using the currently available field data. The plant
    growth and soil–water dynamics in the cotton model OZCOT (Wells and Hearn, 1992)
    implemented within VARIwise, can be accurately calibrated (McCarthy et al., 2011).
    The calibrated OZCOT model has also been found to accurately simulate yield (Richards
    et al., 2001). Using one season’s field experiment data McCarthy et al. (2011)
    found that OZCOT was most effectively calibrated (and therefore able to predict
    the soil and crop response to irrigation application) using full data input, whilst
    for situations where only two data inputs were available, the simulations suggested
    that either weather-and-plant or soil-and-plant inputs were preferable. Park et
    al. (2009) developed two MPC systems for centre pivot irrigation which both used
    measured soil and weather inputs to calibrate a soil–water model. Their first
    implementation used the calibrated model to determine the irrigation volumes which
    would fill the soil profile for irrigation events on fixed days; whereas their
    second implementation used the calibrated model to determine the irrigation timing
    for a fixed irrigation volume application which would fill the soil profile. Neither
    implementation incorporated the crop growth response. 1.2. MPC and crop production
    models The performance objectives set for MPC applied to irrigation can range
    from a short-term objective such as achieving a preset soil–water deficit following
    each irrigation to a ‘whole season’ objective such as maximising predicted end-of-season
    yield. In addition, crop production models (such as OZCOT for cotton, discussed
    below) have sophisticated prediction capabilities which may be utilised in the
    implementation of MPC. For example, a performance objective to maximise the number
    of plant fruiting sites during growth should maximise potential predicted end-of-season
    yield. This additional crop response capability typically requires measurements
    of the plant to calibrate the crop production model according to the measured
    plant growth parameters (e.g. fruiting), which in turn requires infield plant
    sensors to provide calibration data. To maximise uptake of the site-specific irrigation
    control system by growers it is desirable to minimise the sensor requirements.
    A reduction in measurements could be achieved by using only the data types that
    are more influential in the model calibration or by reducing the spatial or temporal
    resolution of data. However, the data used to calibrate the model should still
    enable sufficient accuracy of the model. An insufficient range of measurements
    to calibrate the model used by MPC will influence the accuracy of the model and
    the model’s ability to predict irrigation and crop performance. Hence, this paper
    aims to: • identify the optimal combination of performance objective and data
    input combination amenable to practical MPC strategies; and also • explore the
    impact of different control horizon lengths (period of time for forecasting future
    events) on the performance of MPC. The strategies simulated in this paper explore
    the viability of the use of MPC in the simulation of a ‘realistic’ irrigation
    situation with spatial and temporal variation across a heterogeneous field. Accordingly,
    this paper details the implementation of the MPC methodology in VARIwise and,
    for the example of cotton grown in Australia, presents results for a range of
    simulations having different performance objectives. The results are presented
    as three case studies, A, B and C, which, in order, evaluate the potential of
    MPC to optimise: A. short-term responses of square count or soil–water; B. predicted
    end-of-season crop yield or water use efficiency with (i) low and high soil nitrogen
    content, and (ii) crop seasons with and without rainfall; and C. predicted end-of-season
    crop yield with different combinations of sensory input data to calibrate the
    model. A comparison is then made between the MPC strategies and simulations of
    ‘sensor-based’ strategies for adaptive irrigation control (McCarthy et al., 2014).
    2. Implementation The simulation framework ‘VARIwise’ (McCarthy et al., 2010a)
    was created to develop, simulate and evaluate site-specific irrigation control
    strategies for centre pivot and lateral move irrigation machines on non-uniform
    (spatially and temporally varied) fields. The framework enables evaluation of
    strategies with different sensor data availability (both spatial and temporal);
    for example, the performance of the control strategies with spatial gaps in measured
    response is explored in McCarthy et al. (2010b). In addition, the framework can
    provide evaluation of different irrigation system capacity constraints and when
    supplied with real-time weather and/or other field data, the framework will provide
    direct machine actuation. For the simulation (and management) of cotton irrigation,
    the cotton production model OZCOT (Wells and Hearn, 1992) was used by VARIwise
    and was automatically and continuously calibrated according to the currently available
    weather, soil and plant data. Details are set out in McCarthy et al. (2011). To
    illustrate the VARIwise configuration used to evaluate MPC a general schematic
    is presented in Fig. 1, in which the central blocks and data flows are explained
    in the following sections. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. The simulation
    framework VARIwise configured to evaluate (in simulation mode) the model-based
    adaptive control strategy Model Predictive Control (MPC). In this mode, the block
    ‘AcModel’ (also an OZCOT formulation) has replaced the field data measurements
    which would normally update ‘RefModel’. (This diagram is adapted from the full
    VARIwise flowchart presented as Fig. 2 of McCarthy et al., 2010a, McCarthy et
    al., 2010b). The MPC algorithm predicts how much each output (e.g. soil–water,
    fruit load) will deviate from a time series trajectory within the prediction horizon.
    A MPC cost function J(k) is calculated for each possible set of input actions
    in the current time step k using a least squares algorithm of the following form
    (Maciejowski, 2002): (1) where J(k) is the cost function at instant k, C the length
    of prediction/control horizon, N the number of system outputs, wj the weighting
    coefficient for output j, rj(k + i) the predicted value of jth output at future
    instant k + i, and xj(k + i) is the target value of jth output at future instant
    k + i. The control action that minimises the cost function (i.e. that produces
    the smallest deviation in performance from the desired trajectory) is implemented.
    This optimisation is repeated at each sample time step to update the optimal input
    trajectory after a feedback update. Hence, this MPC algorithm calculates the sequence
    of control action adjustments over a specified future time interval. In an irrigation
    context, the system outputs used to calculate the cost function will typically
    have different units and magnitudes, and the same percentage change in variables
    of different units and magnitudes may cause unintentional bias toward variables
    that are generally larger in magnitude. For example, a particular percentage difference
    in soil–water will produce a larger cost function than the same percentage difference
    in leaf area index. Hence, the MPC algorithm was modified (Eq. (2)) to calculate
    a performance index that represents a percentage difference in the predicted outputs
    rather than a least squares objective function (Eq. (1)). The control action that
    maximises the performance index PI(k) is then implemented in each time step, and
    is calculated using the equation: (2) The MPC methodology was implemented to determine
    irrigation timing and site-specific irrigation volumes on a daily basis by means
    of the following four-step procedure: 1. Update measured and forecast weather
    data. 2. Calibrate crop model. 3. Optimise irrigation volume for each zone. 4.
    Optimise day of next irrigation. The details of each step in relation to the following
    case studies are set out below. This procedure is independently applied to each
    ‘management zone’, where each zone in the field is defined according to differing
    soil and crop properties across the heterogeneous field. 2.1. Step 1: updating
    measured and forecast weather data For each day of the crop season, the meteorological
    data input file for the integrated crop model was updated to include the previous
    day’s weather and the updated weather forecast for the farm’s location. In a field
    implementation of MPC, the ‘previous day’s weather’ could be obtained from an
    on-site weather station and the ‘updated weather forecast’ could be obtained from
    the Bureau of Meteorology. However, to simulate the performance of MPC for a whole
    season (where there was no field implementation) both ‘previous day’s weather’
    and ‘updated weather forecast’ had to be obtained from historical data. Because
    of the high variability of Australian climate and the difficulty in picking a
    ‘typical’ year, an artificial daily meteorological dataset was created by averaging
    the day-to-day data of the five years (1999–2004 inclusive) appropriate to the
    location of Dalby (Latitude −28.18°N, Longitude 151.26° E), a major cotton-growing
    region of south-east Queensland, Australia, and this dataset was used for all
    simulations. Daily data comprised maximum and minimum temperature, solar radiation
    and rainfall, and was sourced from Australian Bureau of Meteorology SILO patched
    point environmental dataset (QNRM, 2009). SILO is an enhanced climate database
    containing Australian climate data from 1889. Forecast weather data, to be used
    predictively during the simulations, was created by imposing a Gaussian distribution
    of variability on the daily values of the five-year-averaged dataset using standard
    deviations of ±5 °C, ±5 °C, ±5 W h/m2 and ±50% for maximum temperature, minimum
    temperature, daily solar radiation and rainfall, respectively; i.e. for any given
    day, the forecast one, two and three days ahead, then values for each variable
    randomly generated within each distribution by taking that day’s values as the
    mean. For each day, only three days of the forecast weather data were used. This
    is because the two Australian short-term numerical weather prediction models forecast
    three and seven days ahead and are combined to improve the prediction accuracy
    (Ebert, 2001). The three-day forecast would be more accurate than one model on
    its own because both models could predict weather to three days. A three-day forecast
    would ensure short-term prediction accuracy in the predictions, particularly as
    regards rainfall in south-east Queensland, Australia, where the summer rainfall
    is dominated by frontal bands of isolated cumulo-nimbus storms. 2.2. Step 2: calibrating
    the crop model – ‘actual’ and ‘reference’ models The crop model OZCOT is utilised
    by VARIwise and can be automatically and continuously calibrated according to
    the ‘currently’ available weather, plus soil and plant data, using the procedure
    set out in McCarthy et al. (2011). The procedure for calibrating the production/growth
    model OZCOT in a real-time implementation, i.e. for actual irrigation machine
    control, involves automatically and iteratively adjusting the parameters used
    to predict soil water status and plant growth until the difference between the
    predicted and sensed variables reached a minimum. For the cotton model OZCOT,
    the plant variables (leaf area index, boll count, square count), soil variables
    (soil moisture content and plant available water capacity) and weather variables
    (daily minimum and maximum temperature, rainfall and solar radiation in weather
    input file) are interdependent. The plant behaviour can be calibrated by adjusting
    parameters in a crop properties file, whilst the soil moisture behaviour was calibrated
    by adjusting parameters in a soil properties file. These parameters were adjusted
    between the minimum and maximum values of the corresponding parameters in the
    predefined soil properties and crop variety parameter profiles. The parameters
    adjusted in the crop properties file included squaring rate (the rate of new flower
    buds being produced), growth rate of leaf area and plant population constant;
    whilst the parameters adjusted in the soil properties file were the initial soil
    moisture content and drained upper limit in each soil layer. A ‘reference’ model,
    labelled ‘RefModel’, is used to provide the crop growth prediction scenario for
    MPC. However, for the present case studies there was no measured field data input
    to calibrate the model. To overcome this, a second OZCOT model of the cotton crop
    was used in place of ‘actual’ field conditions. This model is referred to as the
    ‘actual crop’ model, labelled ‘AcModel’ and the parameters were different to those
    in RefModel to emulate RefModel not exactly following the field conditions. In
    a field implementation the AcModel is not required as field measurements would
    be used. AcModel was then used to calibrate RefModel (Fig. 1). The crop and soil
    properties of AcModel were obtained from the user-specified soil and plant measurements
    (and these varied between simulations, as set out below). Within RefModel the
    crop variety was specified by the user at commencement. Likewise the soil properties
    of RefModel were user-specified, with the addition of areal variation in available
    soil–water imposed via a Gaussian distribution of variability having a standard
    deviation of ±25 mm (water depth equivalent). 2.3. Step 3: optimising irrigation
    volumes for each zone Optimal irrigation volumes were determined by iteratively
    simulating the daily application of sixteen different irrigation volumes at 1
    mm increments between 0 and 15 mm on each zone in the field. For each irrigation
    volume applied (for management zone k), a performance index PI(k) was calculated
    using Eq. (2). For variables that are maximised to achieve the optimal irrigation
    strategy (e.g. square count, yield, crop water use efficiency), the target value
    is taken to be the maximum realistic commercially attainable value (e.g. 15 bales/ha
    for cotton yield, 3 bales/ML for crop water use efficiency). The predicted process
    outputs used to calculate the PI were taken one day after the irrigation application.
    The optimal irrigation volume for each zone was the irrigation volume with the
    highest PI; however, if more than one irrigation volume had the same PI then a
    water-efficient approach was taken and the optimal irrigation volume was the lowest
    quantitative volume that achieved the maximum PI. The irrigation volume was then
    calculated for each zone in the order in which the irrigation machine was to pass
    over the field. 2.4. Step 4: optimising the timing (day) of the next irrigation
    The optimal day for the next irrigation event was determined using the calibrated
    RefModel. This involved performing the irrigation volume optimisation of the previous
    step for an arbitrary number of days (i.e. to a fixed horizon) and contained the
    assumption that the irrigation event could occur on only one of the days. The
    maximum horizon length was set to three days since three days of predictive weather
    were used. The sixteen irrigation volumes tested on each zone depend on the irrigation
    day being tested. This is because, unless rainfall occurs, it was assumed that
    the crop water requirement (and hence irrigation application volume) increases
    for each day the irrigation event is delayed. For the first day irrigation volumes
    of 0–15 mm were tested with increments of 1 mm; for the second day 0–31 mm were
    tested with increments of 2 mm; and for the third day 0–47 mm were tested with
    increments of 3 mm. A PI is calculated for each irrigation day by summing the
    individual PI values for each zone. The day with the highest total PI is taken
    to be the optimal day for the next irrigation event. The irrigation event is scheduled
    if the first day in the horizon had the highest PI and there are a minimum number
    of zones requiring irrigation greater than 0 mm. This ensures that the irrigation
    application is practical and irrigations are not initiated for only a small number
    of zones in the field. The threshold, i.e. the minimum proportion of zones requiring
    irrigation, was arbitrarily selected to be 15% for the case studies presented.
    2.5. Subsequent iteration After the optimal irrigation action – which may, of
    course, be a ‘nil irrigation’ action – was determined for the user-specified first
    day, the procedure described in the four subsections above was repeated every
    day throughout the crop season, with the irrigation events ending on a day specified
    by the user. 3. MPC Case Study A: optimisation of short-term responses using different
    combinations of daily input data The MPC strategy was evaluated with daily input
    data to predict and control irrigation applications to achieve either a short-term
    soil (e.g. deficit) or plant growth (e.g. leaf area index) target. A range of
    combinations of input variables for control were used to determine which input
    data stream was most useful for MPC. 3.1. Methodology for Case Study A The field
    was automatically divided into 44 zones, each of area approximately 0.3 ha, and
    the irrigations occurred daily. This number of zones enabled the simulations to
    be executed in a timely manner with spatially variable soil properties across
    the field. The MPC strategy was evaluated for ten combinations of data input (Table
    1). The input data combinations represent the data used both as input variables
    to calibrate RefModel and the variables used for control. For the simulations
    using both soil and plant data, the weighting on each variable was set to be 0.5.
    The strategies with soil data input aimed for soil–water deficit equal to 10%
    of the plant available water capacity in each zone. Table 1. Simulations (identified

    underlying variability in plant available water capacity (PAWC) and starting soil–water
    deficit as set out in Fig. 2. The starting soil–water deficit map was generated
    by assigning a starting soil–water deficit value of 30 mm across the field and
    imposing a Gaussian distribution of variability with standard deviation ±10 mm
    on each zone. The PAWC map was generating by assigning PAWC values of 60, 150
    and 200 mm on three zones of the fields, spatially interpolating the PAWC using
    ordinary kriging and by similarly imposing a Gaussian distribution of variability
    with standard deviation ±10 mm on each zone. The PAWC ranges from 60 to 200 mm
    in the simulated field to ensure the control strategies could deal with the different
    soil types that often exist within fields. Download : Download full-size image

    whilst Sicot 73 is a full season cotton variety with high yield potential (CSD,
    2009). The prediction horizon was one day and it was practical for irrigation
    events to occur daily. 3.2. Case Study A – results and discussion Table 2 sets

    of the control strategies are compared based on the average and variability of
    the yield, irrigation applied, Irrigation Water Use Index (IWUI) and Crop Water

    in yield response according to spatially variable irrigation application. The
    strategies that use weather-soil-and-plant data to calibrate and target a fixed
    soil–water (simulation #19) and maximise square/boll count (simulation #20), are

    soil–water deficit (simulation #19); and set (b): maximising square count (simulation
    #20). The simulated yield and water use efficiency increased as more data streams
    were included in the input data combination. This is shown in Table 2 as the single-input
    simulations produced the lowest yields and water use efficiencies (simulations
    #11 and #12) while the three simulations having three data inputs (simulations
    #18, #19 and #20) performed better than all of the five simulations having two
    data inputs (simulations #13 to #17 inclusive). The data combinations with soil
    data and no plant data (simulations #11 and #13) resulted in higher yields than
    those with plant data and no soil data (simulations #12 and #14). This result
    suggests that if only one data input is available then soil data input is most
    effective for calibrating RefModel and for irrigation control. The simulations
    using combinations of soil and plant data input to determine the irrigation volumes
    (simulations #15 and #18) generally produced lower yields and water use efficiencies
    than those using only plant data input to determine the irrigation volumes (simulations
    #17 and #20) with the same data available for RefModel calibration. For example,
    for the strategies with soil and plant data available to calibrate RefModel, a
    higher yield was simulated when the strategy maximised the square/boll count (simulation
    #17) than when the strategy attempted to both maintain soil–water and maximise
    square count (simulation #15). Hence, in this case there was no obvious benefit
    in the using multiple variables to determine the application volumes. The MPC
    strategy accurately maintained the soil–water deficit threshold during low rainfall
    periods of the crop season for simulation #19 (63 to 85 days after sowing, Fig.
    4(a)). For the MPC strategy that maximised square/boll count (simulation #20),
    the soil–water deficit was always higher than the soil–water deficit threshold
    that was approximately maintained in simulation #19 throughout the crop season
    (Fig. 4(b)). The soil–water deficit was also lowest in the sand zone (with the
    lowest plant available water capacity) and highest in the clay zone (with the
    highest plant available water capacity) throughout the crop season for the strategy
    optimising square count. This indicates that to maximise the square count, the
    soil–water deficit should be reduced in proportion with the plant available water
    capacity of the soil. The highest yield was achieved using weather-soil-and-plant
    input and maximising square count (simulation #20). The square count was higher
    throughout the crop season for this simulation compared with that for MPC maintaining
    soil–water deficit (simulation #19) (Fig. 5). Hence, the implemented MPC strategy
    successfully increased the simulated square count and improvements in yield (by
    14%) and crop water use efficiency (by 30%) were observed by maximising square
    count instead of targeting soil–water. 4. MPC Case Study B: optimisation using
    a predicted end-of-season yield or water use efficiency target The MPC strategy
    uses RefModel to forecast the response of cotton crop with specific environmental
    conditions and soil and crop properties; hence, the irrigation volume/timing may
    be adjusted to achieve a desired predicted end-of-season output, in this case
    a final yield or water use efficiency. This is in contrast to Case Study A in
    which the MPC strategy used daily input data (e.g. square count, soil–water) to
    predict the best short-term response to a range of irrigation volumes. 4.1. Methodology
    for Case Study B The field was automatically divided into 44 zones as per the
    previous case study and the irrigations could occur daily. The MPC strategy was
    evaluated for crop seasons with and without rainfall and with two levels of initial
    nitrogen content (120 kg/ha and 250 kg/ha). The same weather dataset was used
    for both these sets of simulations; however the daily rainfall was set to zero
    for the simulations without rainfall. In the simulations with rainfall there was
    high rainfall during days 63–85 after sowing. The MPC strategy was used to optimise
    the predicted Irrigation Water Use Index (IWUI), Crop Water Use Index (CWUI) and
    yield assuming the machine capacity enabled the machine to traverse the field
    once every day. An algorithm maximising IWUI or CWUI may decide to apply no irrigation
    to minimise the irrigation volume but would also produce low yield. Hence, to
    ensure that the IWUI and CWUI optimisation would irrigate the crop, the minimum
    acceptable yield was arbitrarily set at 5 bales/ha in all optimisations. 4.2.

    applied to sand, clay loam and clay zones for simulations #25 and #28 to evaluate
    effect of nitrogen content; the Model Predictive Controller optimised yield for
    crop season with no rainfall and available nitrogen of: set (a) 120 kg/ha; and
    set (b) 250 kg/ha. For each set of field conditions (i.e. starting nitrogen content
    and in-season rainfall), the simulated yield was highest for the MPC strategy
    that optimised yield (simulations #21, #23, #25 and #28). Similarly, the strategies
    optimising IWUI (simulations #27 and #30) and CWUI (simulations #26 and #29) produced
    the highest respective IWUI and CWUI of the simulations with the same field conditions.
    This indicates that MPC strategy could adjust the irrigation application to improve
    either yield or water use efficiency. Increasing the starting nitrogen content
    significantly improved the simulated yield and water use efficiency. This is shown
    in Table 3 as the yield for the no-rainfall simulation with the higher nitrogen
    content of 250 kg N/ha (e.g. 17.9 bales/ha for simulation #23) was nearly double
    that of the simulation with the lower nitrogen content of 120 kg N/ha (e.g. 9.0
    bales/ha for simulation #21). Since the irrigation volumes applied were similar
    for these two simulations (Fig. 8), the CWUI and IWUI of the higher nitrogen content
    simulations were also nearly double that of the lower nitrogen content simulations.
    Hence, nitrogen application had a significant effect on the final yield without
    greatly affecting the irrigation volume required to be applied. Rainfall significantly
    affected the simulated yield and CWUI (Table 3). Table 3 shows that the yields,
    irrigation applications and CWUI of simulations #21−#24 (without rainfall) are
    higher than those of simulations #25−#30 (with rainfall). This suggests that the
    crop is easier to control with less rainfall in the season. The difference in
    yield and CWUI is most noticeable for simulations with high nitrogen content (e.g.
    simulation #28 with rainfall and simulation #23 without rainfall) because the
    simulated yields are higher and the differences between the yields are more apparent.
    It follows that during the period of the crop season with high rainfall (63–86
    days after sowing), lower irrigation volumes were applied compared to the periods
    of no rainfall (87–105 days after sowing) (Fig. 7). The rainfall did not generally
    affect the IWUI for the simulated set of field conditions (e.g. simulation #21
    with no rainfall versus simulation #25 with rainfall). This is because more rainfall
    caused both the yield and irrigation application (which are used to calculate
    the IWUI) to decrease by approximately the same proportion. 5. MPC Case Study
    C: optimisation using a predicted end-of-season target, with limited calibration
    data The MPC simulations of the Case Study B assumed that the full data input
    of weather, soil and plant information was available for RefModel calibration.
    However, all three data streams may not be available in a field implementation.
    Case Study C evaluates the usefulness of different data streams to calibrate RefModel
    in a MPC strategy with a predicted end-of-season target. 5.1. Methodology for
    Case Study C The seven possible input data combinations (Table 2) were separately
    evaluated as input for RefModel calibration. The datasets were obtained daily
    from the cotton model Sicot 71B and used to calibrate the Siokra V16RR cotton
    model. The field and weather conditions were as used in the earlier case studies,
    the MPC strategy optimised yield and the irrigations occurred daily. 5.2. Case
    Study C – results and discussion Table 4 and Fig. 9 set out a comparison of an
    MPC strategy that maximises yield with different combinations of input data to
    calibrate RefModel. The use of more information in the input data combination
    generally increased the average yield and water use efficiency (Table 4). Table
    4 shows that MPC performance with all three input variables (simulation #37/#28)
    was superior to that with any two variables (simulations #34−#36); and similarly
    performance with two input variables was superior to that with any single input
    variable alone, except plant input (simulation #33) versus soil-and-plant input
    (simulation #36). This suggests that the MPC calibration performs better with
    soil data input than plant data input. Table 4. Performance of the Model Predictive

    #371 is a duplication of simulation #28 for comparison (numerical data for simulations
    #31−#37 are in Table 4). The lowest yields and water use efficiencies were simulated
    with only weather data input (e.g. simulations #31). This is because the weather
    data (without field-specific soil or crop data) provides no information to adequately
    parameterise the crop model used by the MPC strategy. This could lead to insufficient
    model calibration and sub-optimal irrigation volumes being determined. The irrigation
    water use efficiency was higher using the weather and plant combination (simulation
    #35) than using the full data input (simulation #37/#28): this is because the
    yield was maximised rather than the water use efficiency in this case study. 6.
    General discussion A Model Predictive Control strategy was successfully implemented
    in VARIwise. The controller uses currently available field data to calibrate the
    OZCOT cotton production model and then evaluates a range of irrigation volumes
    and timings in each zone. The controller then implements the site-specific irrigation
    volumes on the day that achieves the highest water use efficiency or yield averaged
    over the field, as user specified. Three alternative optimisation possibilities
    were identified and explored, and the conclusions for each, and their comparison,
    are as set out below. In each case the MPC strategy performed successfully in
    the (simulated) task of controlling an automatic irrigation machine applying spatially-varied
    irrigation amounts. For convenience, Table 5 gathers together the particular simulation
    outputs referred to in this section. Table 5 also compares results of MPC with
    two sensor-based control strategies, namely Iterative Learning Controller (ILC)
    and Iterative Hill Climbing Controller (IHCC), simulated on fields with PAWC varying
    between 60 and 200 mm with 1266 zones, and the same weather profile and crop variety
    (as detailed in McCarthy et al., 2014). These sensor-based strategies refine the
    estimate of each successive irrigation volume applied by: Table 5. Control strategy

    [ILC] – iteratively adjusting the irrigation volume applied in each zone of the
    field using the incremental response, i.e. the OZCOT-determined plant growth arising
    from the change in particular field sensor information which has resulted from
    the previous water application, in each zone; or [IHCC] – similarly adjusting
    the irrigation volumes, but based on multiple sensor increment information, using
    a range of irrigation volumes applied within a group of homogenous zones. The
    performance of the MPC strategy was also compared with an industry-standard irrigation
    strategy (first line of Table 5). This strategy applied a uniform irrigation treatment
    (25 mm) across the field and initiated irrigation events when the soil–water deficit
    reached a set amount (30 mm) in one point in the field (in the cell with sandy
    soil). The soil–water deficit was taken in the cell with the lowest plant available
    water capacity, as this is the most limiting soil. To ensure validity of the comparison
    this simulation was executed using the same weather conditions and spatially variable
    plant available water capacity and starting soil–water, and crop variety as the
    reference model. The nitrogen content was set to 250 kg/ha. The MPC strategy was
    evaluated with different combinations of input data (Section 3 above). The predicted
    yield and water use efficiency were highest when the strategy maximised the square
    count and calibrated the model using all three streams of data input (weather,
    soil and plant, simulation #20). The yield and water use efficiency were also
    higher than those of the industry-standard irrigation management strategy (McCarthy
    et al., 2014), and also ILC (simulation #1) and IHCC (simulation #9) with either
    weather-soil-and-plant, weather-and-soil or weather-and-plant data input available
    (likewise refer McCarthy et al., 2014). However, the MPC (optimising daily input
    data) performed worse than the ILC and IHCC where there was only either soil input
    (simulation #11) or weather-and-plant (simulation #14) input data available. The
    controller successfully adjusted the irrigation to improve the yield, CWUI or
    IWUI, as appropriate (Section 4). The yield was higher with high nitrogen content
    (e.g. simulation #28) than with low nitrogen content (simulation #25) and with
    no rainfall during the crop season (simulation #23) compared with high rainfall
    (simulation #28). This is because the control strategy could better control the
    water applied in response to the other environmental factors. The simulated average
    yields and water use efficiencies were significantly higher than the industry-standard
    irrigation management strategy, ILC strategy (simulation #1) and IHCC strategy
    (simulation #9) (McCarthy et al., 2014). MPC was evaluated with different combinations
    of input data available to calibrate the model (Section 5). The controller performed
    best with input of weather-soil-and-plant data (simulation #28), but still produced
    higher yields and water use efficiencies with weather-and-soil (simulation #34)
    or weather-and-plant (simulation #35) input than the irrigation-standard irrigation
    management strategy, and ILC (simulation #1) and IHCC (simulation #9) case studies
    (McCarthy et al., 2014). Higher yields and water use efficiencies were produced
    for MPC optimising predicted end-of-season data (simulation #28) than for MPC
    using daily input data to maximise square count (simulation #20). However, both
    of these control strategies required either the full data input, weather-and-soil
    or weather-and-plant data input to obtain yields higher than the ILC or IHCC strategies.
    7. Conclusion The Model Predictive Control strategy implemented in the control
    simulation software VARIwise performed successfully in the task of controlling
    an automatic irrigation machine applying water to a simulated cotton crop grown
    in typical conditions for south-east Queensland, Australia. In all simulations
    the MPC strategy specified ‘sensible’ irrigation amounts typical of irrigation
    practice in this region. Simulations using the MPC strategy indicated that the
    MPC strategy could be successfully used to either maximise crop yield, or crop
    and irrigation water use efficiencies. The MPC strategy produced significantly
    higher yield and crop water use efficiency than the sensor-based strategies for
    the same (simulated) field conditions (similarly simulated in VARIwise and reported
    in McCarthy et al., 2014). However, MPC required weather-soil-and-plant, weather-and-soil
    or weather-and-plant information to accurately calibrate the crop model. This
    indicates (for cotton grown as stated) that whilst the MPC-based strategies are
    potentially superior, sensor-based strategies may be more appropriate for field
    implementations where there is limited data availability. Finally, we note here
    that direct field evaluation is particularly challenging, because direct comparison
    requires replicated plots having the same soil types and distributions, and with
    simultaneous operation such that each experiences the same weather conditions.
    In principal at least, an alternative to achieve such a comparison would be to
    determine variability of soil properties under an irrigation system, a priori,
    and then define plots of the same soil type such that the irrigation application
    could be adjusted according to different MPC strategies, and in comparison with
    industry-standard control (e.g. calculated using evapotranspiration or soil–water).
    Field evaluations would enable the sensing and control hardware requirements and
    performance of autonomous, adaptive control strategies to be compared with industry-standard
    irrigation. These control strategies would determine irrigation application and
    timing using a black-box control system based on sensed inputs and sends control
    signals to irrigation actuation hardware. This will potentially lead to the optimisation
    of irrigation water use and yield under different climate scenarios and water
    availability situations. Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to the Australian

    941 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract [1] The “Millennium Drought” (2001–2009)
    can be described as the worst drought on record for southeast Australia. Adaptation
    to future severe droughts requires insight into the drivers of the drought and
    its impacts. These were analyzed using climate, water, economic, and remote sensing
    data combined with biophysical modeling. Prevailing El Niño conditions explained
    about two thirds of rainfall deficit in east Australia. Results for south Australia
    were inconclusive; a contribution from global climate change remains plausible
    but unproven. Natural processes changed the timing and magnitude of soil moisture,
    streamflow, and groundwater deficits by up to several years, and caused the amplification
    of rainfall declines in streamflow to be greater than in normal dry years. By
    design, river management avoided impacts on some categories of water users, but
    did so by exacerbating the impacts on annual irrigation agriculture and, in particular,
    river ecosystems. Relative rainfall reductions were amplified 1.5–1.7 times in
    dryland wheat yields, but the impact was offset by steady increases in cropping
    area and crop water use efficiency (perhaps partly due to CO2 fertilization).
    Impacts beyond the agricultural sector occurred (e.g., forestry, tourism, utilities)
    but were often diffuse and not well quantified. Key causative pathways from physical
    drought to the degradation of ecological, economic, and social health remain poorly
    understood and quantified. Combined with the multiple dimensions of multiyear
    droughts and the specter of climate change, this means future droughts may well
    break records in ever new ways and not necessarily be managed better than past
    ones. Key Points Drivers and impacts of Australia''s record drought were analyzed
    Impacts accumulated and propagated through the water cycle at different rates
    Future droughts may not be managed better than past ones. 1. Introduction 1.1.
    Millennium Drought [2] In the years before 2010, southeast Australia suffered
    the driest period since 1900 by several measures, with consequences for ecosystems,
    economy, and society. Published drought assessments used different criteria to
    determine the start and end of the drought and accordingly found different periods:
    the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) [2010]
    found that the period 1997–2009 had the lowest average rainfall since 1900 (but
    with some above-average precipitation years), whereas Van Dijk and Renzullo [2009]
    found that surface water resources scarcity already started to develop around
    1994. Here, we define the Millennium Drought as the period 2001–2009: the longest
    uninterrupted series of years with below median rainfall in southeast Australia
    since at least 1900 (Bureau of Meteorology data; http://www.bom.gov.au/cgi-bin/climate/change/timeseries.cgi).
    The end of the drought is less ambiguous: a strong La Niña event in early 2010
    brought very high precipitation and large-scale flooding to many parts of southeast
    and east Australia [Beard et al., 2011]. (However, 2010 was also the driest year
    on record in southwest Australia, which is little affected by El Niño Southern
    Oscillation (ENSO); continuing more than three decades of strong rainfall decreases
    in its coastal regions [Ryan and Hope, 2006]). [3] Australia''s instrumental record
    is sparse before 1940 and few locations have continuous rainfall measurement before
    1900. Combined with rainfall that is highly variable at seasonal, annual, and
    decadal time scales [e.g., Kiem and Franks, 2004; Verdon-Kidd and Kiem, 2010],
    this makes it difficult to determine how unusual the Millennium Drought was in
    a long-term context. Palaeoclimate records show that long dry periods have occurred
    in the past [Verdon-Kidd and Kiem, 2010; Verdon and Franks, 2006], although recent
    analyses calculated a 97%–98% probability that the recent drought was the most
    severe since 1783 (i.e., around European settlement) and could have a return period
    of as much as 1500 years—at least if climate can be assumed stationary over this
    time scale [Gallant and Gergis, 2011; Gergis et al., 2012]. 1.2. Drought Impacts
    [4] Particularly severely hit by the Millennium Drought were river ecosystems
    and irrigated and dryland agriculture in Victoria and the Murray-Darling Basin
    (MDB), Australia''s largest river system [Leblanc et al., 2012]. Drought also
    contributed to the enforcement of water restrictions in most major cities, to
    increased electricity prices, and to major bushfire events in 2003 and 2009. At
    a global scale, Australia''s drought was the main cause of an apparent reversal
    in water cycle intensification [Huntington, 2006] observed in previous years,
    raising questions about the likelihood of further intensification in future [Jung
    et al., 2010]. [5] Droughts and their impacts can be categorized as meteorological,
    hydrological, agricultural, and socioeconomic [Mishra and Singh, 2010; Thomas,
    1965]. The contributions of climate change, water management, and other natural
    or human factors to these impacts need to be understood to guide our expectations
    about, and response to, future droughts. For example, if some part of drought
    impacts can be attributed to global warming, more frequent and more severe events
    may be expected in future [Milly et al., 2008]. Where human actions have contributed
    to drought impacts, this suggests opportunities to adapt and prepare for future
    events [Vörösmarty et al., 2000]. [6] Unambiguous isolation of the factors contributing
    to drought and its impacts is difficult. The short record and variable climate
    was already mentioned. In addition, hydrological processes can respond in a highly
    nonlinear and delayed way to meteorological conditions due to storage effects
    and losses that accumulate along water transport and distribution networks. Finally,
    natural climate, water cycle, and vegetation processes interact with water resources
    management, agriculture, economy, and society in a myriad of ways. 1.3. Objective
    [7] Our main objective was to isolate and quantify anthropogenic and natural contributions
    to the Millennium Drought and its impacts. Because of the complexity of the causes
    of the meteorological drought, its propagation through the water cycle and its
    impacts on ecosystems, agriculture, economy, and society, we explored multiple
    lines of observational evidence, connecting drought impacts to their causes and
    amplifying factors where possible. We compared the observations with expectations
    based on hydrological process models and simple statistical models and discussed
    our findings in the context of previously published analyses. We focused on three
    questions: [8] (1) What were the main climatological causes of the meteorological
    drought and can a human influence be detected, or be expected in future droughts?
    [9] (2) How did the meteorological drought propagate through the water cycle and
    impact on ecosystems, agriculture, economy, and society? [10] (3) What are the
    implications for adaptation to mitigate the impact of future droughts? [11] Data
    analyses were performed to address questions (1) and (2) and these are the focus
    of sections 5 and 11. For readability, some of the details are provided in the
    supporting information. In section 16, the results of the analysis are discussed
    in the context of published studies. Finally, in section 23 a synthesis is provided,
    in which the range of observed impacts and processes is put within a conceptual
    framework, and the implications of our results for managing and mitigating future
    droughts are discussed. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Causes of the Meteorological
    Drought [12] It is common practice to evaluate plausible linkages between observed
    regional rainfall anomalies and any skewness or changes in large-scale modes of
    variability previously identified to influence interannual rainfall patterns [Nicholls,
    2006]. While such analyses are not attribution studies in any strict sense, they
    can help to interpret observed rainfall anomalies. Following this approach, the
    anomalously low rainfall conditions in southeastern Australia during the Millennium
    Drought have been linked to a combination of intensification of the mean sea level
    pressure across southern Australia [Hope et al., 2010] and particularly the subtropical
    ridge, a belt of high-pressure systems that expresses the descending branch of
    the Hadley cell [Timbal et al., 2010], as well as to ENSO [e.g., Verdon-Kidd and
    Kiem, 2009b]. An influence of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) has been proposed
    [Cai et al., 2009; Ummenhofer et al., 2009] but also questioned [Smith and Timbal,
    2012; Timbal and Hendon, 2011]; the same is true for the Southern Annular Mode
    (SAM) [Hendon et al., 2007; Meneghini et al., 2007; Nicholls, 2010; Verdon-Kidd
    and Kiem, 2009a]. To a considerable extent, different conclusions about the relative
    importance of different drivers appear to be a result of methodological differences:
    in the analysis method; in the metrics (indices) used to describe each phenomenon;
    in the region, time period, and time scale of variability considered; and other,
    more subtle choices made in the analysis. [13] We examined if stronger inferences
    could be made if both predictand and predictors were averaged over larger areas
    and periods. This should reduce random components and noise in the data and allow
    for lagged correlations due to landscape hydrometeorological memory and any delayed
    atmospheric response to ocean circulation indices [Koster et al., 2004; Timbal
    et al., 2002]. We compared our statistical results based on indices with published
    research on the drivers of Australian rainfall in general, and during the drought
    in particular. [14] Daily rainfall estimates for the Australian continent were
    derived by interpolation of daily rainfall gauge readings to a 0.05° grid [Jeffrey
    et al., 2001]. The gridded data were combined with a vector map showing 245 river
    basins identified by the Australian Water Resources Council (Map 5) [AWRC, 1975].
    For each AWRC basin, a time series of basin-average annual rainfall was calculated
    for 1900–2009. A matrix of fraction covariance (squared correlation coefficient,
    R2) between each time series pair was calculated. The software package MultiDendrograms
    2.1 [Fernández and Gómez, 2008] was used to cluster basins by interannual rainfall
    patterns. As a distance measure, the fraction of uncorrelated variance (1 − R2)
    was used. Seven metaclusters were derived from the cluster dendrogram, and these
    were merged into six large, contiguous regions through minor editing (see supporting
    information). [15] For each of the six regions a time series of annual average
    rainfall was calculated. These time series were compared to time series of nine
    predictor indices describing six candidate phenomena: the ENSO (Nino3.4 [Kaplan
    et al., 1998] and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)); IOD mode index and the classification
    of Ummenhofer et al. [2009]; Pacific decadal Oscillation (PDO) [Zhang et al.,
    1997]; SAM [Marshall, 2003; Visbeck, 2009]; global mean temperature (GMT); Hansen
    index); and the intensity and location of the Southern Hemisphere Subtropical
    Ridge (STRI and STRL) [Drosdowsky, 2005]. Full details and data sources are listed
    in the supporting information. Where monthly or seasonal predictor data were available,
    these were used to first calculate mean seasonal values (December-February and
    so on) as well as annual average values, producing five candidate predictor variables.
    All resulting climate predictor time series were normalized by their mean and
    standard deviation and any missing values replaced by the mean (i.e. zero, after
    normalizing). [16] Five-year rolling averages were calculated for the predictors
    (x1..n) as well as the regional rainfall averages (y1..6) for the period 1900–2009
    (shorter and longer integration periods were also tested, with very similar results).
    For each region, a multivariate model was fitted by regression against residuals
    in four steps: (1) where indices x1..4 were selected at each respective step as
    those having the greatest correlation with the residual unexplained variance (i.e.,
    the highest partial correlation). The coefficients c0..4 were found through linear
    regression. From the associated fraction of variance explained (R2), we calculated
    Akaike''s information criterion (AIC) [Akaike, 1974] to decide whether to accept
    the four-variable model or whether to select one with fewer predictors: (2) where
    k is the number of free parameters (c0..ci; 2 to 5) and n the number of independent
    observations. Although the total number of years was 110, the 5 year averaging
    would have introduced autocorrelation; therefore, we conservatively estimated
    n as 22 (110 years divided by 5). It is noted that the assumption of n = 110 for
    the original time series should be considered a rough estimate only: effective
    sample size could potentially be further reduced by serial correlation in the
    original time series [Yue and Wang, 2004], and calculating the 5 year rolling
    averages may not have removed all of that serial correlation. [17] The contribution
    of each of the climate phenomena to the meteorological drought was estimated by
    multiplying the observed 2001–2009 anomaly in x1..4 by the sensitivity of rainfall
    to x1..4, defined by the slope c1..4 of the regression model (equation 1). [18]
    To assess whether the drought reflected a gradual change, linear trends and associated
    significance were calculated for each region using annual rainfall data for 1950–2009.
    The contribution to each identified driver to rainfall trends was estimated as
    (3) [19] That is, the contribution of each phenomenon to observed rainfall trends
    (dP/dt) was estimated as the product of the trend in the index (dxi/dt) and the
    sensitivity ci. It should be emphasized that the calculation of linear trends
    is inevitably contingent on the period chosen, regardless of statistical significance.
    For example, in southeast Australia 1950 marks the start of a comparatively wet
    period (see section 11); therefore, choosing an earlier or later start date would
    likely have led to a diminished and enhanced trend, respectively. 2.2. Hydrological
    Drought Impacts [20] Due to nonlinearity in catchment hydrological functioning,
    relative changes in annual rainfall are typically amplified a few times in streamflow
    generation during nondrought years [Budyko, 1974; Chiew, 2006]. To determine the
    amplification of rainfall deficits in streamflow during the drought, we used observed
    catchment streamflow data as well as two alternative modeling approaches. [21]
    Daily streamflow data was obtained from government agencies in New South Wales,
    Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, and West Australia. Out of the available streamflow
    data, initially data was selected for 466 gauged catchments in the five drainage
    divisions most affected by the drought: Southeast Coast, Tasmania, MDB, South
    Australian Gulf, and Southwest Coast. All data were quality controlled and any
    interpolated data were removed. Terrain analysis was carried out using a digital
    elevation model to determine the catchment area of each of the catchments. Each
    individual catchment was visually assessed against topographic maps and satellite
    photography to ensure it was not affected by significant irrigation, impoundments,
    or other forms of regulation. For each catchment, streamflow (Q in mm) was aggregated
    from daily to monthly totals (by multiplying mean daily Q by the number of days
    in the month, provided more than 70% of days had data) and subsequently to annual
    totals. Missing months were gap-filled by considering the runoff coefficient (rc,
    that is, the ratio of total streamflow Q over total rainfall, P, for the year)
    and subsequently multiplying rc with P for the missing months. Gaps were filled
    only if less than 4 months were missing for a given year. Out of the 466 gauged
    catchments, 126 catchments were selected that had 30 or more years of observations
    before the drought and at least three years during the drought (2001–2009). Annual
    rainfall for the same catchments and years was derived by overlaying the catchment
    map with the rainfall grids. [22] To determine to what extent streamflow reductions
    during the drought were different from those that could be expected in normal
    dry years, the observed relative streamflow declines were compared to predictions
    by two alternative modeling methods: a simple conceptual/statistical model that
    ignores temporal correlation or subannual rainfall patterns, and a daily time
    step process model. [23] The simple model was a two-parameter rational function
    fitted to predrought annual rainfall and streamflow data. The nonlinearity between
    rainfall and streamflow expected under stationary conditions was estimated by
    fitting the model: (4) [24] This model is mathematically near identical to the
    model proposed by Zhang et al. [2001] based on Budyko [1974] theory, where a would
    represent potential evapotranspiration (PET) and b a fitting parameter. For each
    catchment, we fitted values for both a and b rather than prescribing a value.
    Hence, the resulting estimate represents the influence of rainfall changes, but
    potentially including any covariance between P and PET. The model was fitted to
    the rainfall and observed streamflow data before 2001. Subsequently, the fitted
    model was used to predict streamflow for the drought years. For most catchments,
    records before 2001 did not include a drought as severe as the Millennium Drought
    and this could influence the fitted model. This was indeed the intention: comparing
    observed and model-predicted impacts should indicate to what extent catchment
    behavior during the drought was different from normal dry years. [25] The process
    model used is the landscape hydrological model of the Australian Water Resources
    Assessment (AWRA) system [AWRA-L version 0.5; Van Dijk, 2010; Van Dijk and Warren,
    2010; Van Dijk and Renzullo, 2011]. It considers catchment storage dynamics and
    observed weather patterns, including the potential role of increased radiation
    or temperature [e.g., Cai and Cowan, 2008; Potter and Chiew, 2011]. AWRA-L may
    be described as a hybrid between a simplified land surface model and a lumped
    catchment model. Grid resolution, domain, and the number of subgrid land cover
    classes are not prescribed but defined by the model inputs. The model evolves
    on a daily time step, and for each cover class simulates the water balance of
    a top soil, shallow soil, and deep soil compartment as well as vegetation phenology
    in response to water availability; whereas groundwater and surface water dynamics
    are estimated at grid resolution. It considers two land cover classes (deep- and
    shallow-rooted vegetation). Forcing was from the daily rainfall grids (section
    5) and similarly interpolated grids of shortwave radiation and minimum and maximum
    temperature [Jeffrey et al., 2001]. The model was run for the period 1895–2010
    with default parameterization [Van Dijk, 2010], that is, the model was not optimized
    to reproduce the streamflow observations used in the analysis. The daily streamflow
    grids were combined with the catchment map and time series of catchment average
    streamflow (in millimeters per day) were calculated for each catchment. [26] For
    each catchment, the observed and predicted reductions were estimated as the relative
    difference between the streamflow observed or predicted for the drought years
    (2001–2009) and the predrought years. In each case, only those years for which
    observations were available were selected. A test was done to assess the differences
    in model-estimated and observed runoff declines against those predicted for normal
    dry years: for each catchment the pre-2001 years with rainfall in the lowest quintile
    were selected, and the relative reductions in rainfall, model-estimated streamflow,
    and observed streamflow were compared. [27] To help interpret the AWRA streamflow
    estimates, we compared model estimated total water storage with satellite observations.
    Satellite terrestrial water storage (TWS) data were available from the Gravity
    Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite mission (GRACE) [Tapley et al., 2004].
    GRACE provides integrated estimates of variations in total TWS based on precise
    observations of Earth''s time variable gravity field. We used the 1° resolution
    gridded estimates provided by the GRACE Tellus website and produced by the University
    of Texas Centre for Space Research (CSR). The data preprocessing and analysis
    was described in Van Dijk et al. [2011]. 2.3. Ecological Drought Impacts [28]
    We considered impacts on dryland and riverine ecosystems separately. Apart from
    the impacts of the drought on dryland agriculture (section 8), we did not attempt
    to quantify impacts on dryland ecology. Judging by the impact on living biomass,
    they are likely to have been widespread, however (Figure 1a; see section 16).
    Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint (a) Map of the difference between mean
    remotely sensed vegetation water content (VOD, in dimensionless units) for 2001–2009
    and 1978–2000. (b) Location of the intensive cropping (green) and irrigated agriculture
    (blue) zones, the MDB (red) and the Murray River at Wentworth (star symbol). [29]
    The impacts of drought on ecosystems are diverse [Bond et al., 2008] and an integrated
    measure of drought impacts on riverine ecosystems is therefore hard to define
    [Vörösmarty et al., 2010]. In the MDB, the impacts that attracted most media attention
    included toxicity in the lakes at the end of Murray River due to low river inflows
    and large scale floodplain forest mortality throughout the basin due to lacking
    flood events [Leblanc et al., 2012]. In this study, we used total flows and the
    occurrence and level of flooding in the Lower Murray River as indicators of those
    respective drought impacts. [30] Measured river flow in the Lower Murray River
    was compared with estimates from a digital model of the MDB river system (explained
    below) from which all regulation infrastructure and extractions were removed.
    Daily streamflow data for the Lower Murray at a location for which streamflow
    was simulated by the river model (gauge 425010 at Wentworth, near the confluence
    with the Darling River, Figure 1b) were available from 1968 onward from New South
    Wales Department of Natural Resources. [31] The river model was developed as part
    of a large project commissioned by the Australian Governments [CSIRO, 2008a].
    Daily time series of flows in the absence of regulation were reconstructed for
    the period 1895–2006 using a comprehensive set of models simulating flows, losses,
    and diversions in the various individual rivers contributing to the MDB, as a
    function of tributary inflows and operation of the storages and infrastructure
    in the river system. Tributary inflows were observed streamflow records wherever
    available, missing data were interpolated using rainfall-runoff models or regression
    models based on observed data. It is noted that the unimpeded scenario is not
    equal to a scenario without any development; the tributary inflows are the same
    in both scenarios and reflect historic land use changes and smaller structures
    such as private farm dams [CSIRO, 2008a]. From the observed and modeled data,
    the average observed and reconstructed unimpeded flows for the available drought
    years were calculated. The observed and modeled time series of annual flow volumes
    and annual maximum flood were compared. 2.4. Agricultural Drought Impacts [32]
    In economic terms, half of Australia''s agricultural production is from irrigated
    agriculture (28%) and grain cropping (22%) [Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS),
    2011], and therefore, data for these crops were analyzed in more detail. The impact
    of water resources availability on irrigated agriculture was comparatively straightforward
    to determine using ABS data on crop production. The impact on dryland grain production
    is more difficult to estimate and attribute for several reasons, including the
    ongoing improvement in crop water use efficiency (WUE) due to agricultural innovation
    (e.g., see Nicholls [1997] and published comments). Details follow below, but
    in brief, we compared 33 year time series of wheat production, crop area and yield
    [ABS, 2011] with three crop growth indicators: (1) vegetation water content derived
    from passive microwave remote sensing (vegetation optical depth, VOD, an indicator
    of living biomass) (Figure 1a), (2) crop greenness (normalized difference vegetation
    index, NDVI, responding to canopy cover and leaf chlorophyll content); and (3)
    crop water use (transpiration) estimated by the AWRA model. A map of intensive
    cropping areas [National Committee for Land Use and Management Information (NCLUMI),
    2009] (Figure 1b) was used to calculate annual mean NDVI, VOD, and crop water
    use over the wheat cropping areas. For each of these growth indicators, a model
    was constructed that predicted wheat yield by multiplying a linear response to
    the indicator by an annually increasing conversion efficiency. Drought impact
    was estimated by comparing actual wheat yields to potential yield estimated from
    average predrought indicator values. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    (blue) and values from a regression model (red) based on indices of the phenomena
    shown in Figure 2a. (c) Same but for north and west Australia combined. [33] We
    used the VOD product of Liu et al. [2007, 2009, 2011], developed by blending VOD
    retrievals from a series of passive microwave satellites (SSM/I, SMMR, TRMM, and
    AMSR-E). NDVI data were available from five partly overlapping time series: one
    derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, product
    MOD13C2.005) [Huete et al., 2002] and four data sets derived from the advanced
    very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) (known respectively as PAL [Agbu and James,
    1994]; FASIR [Los et al., 2000]; LTDR (version 3) [Pedelty et al., 2007]; and
    GIMMS [Tucker et al., 2005]). These time series were blended after linear adjustment
    using the MODIS NDVI as the reference [Beck et al., 2011; see supporting information
    for details]. The AWRA model includes a simple model to predict vegetation phenology
    and water use in response to soil water availability. Remotely sensed vegetation
    data were deliberately not assimilated into the AWRA system for this application:
    our motivation for including the model estimates is that they will be exclusively
    climate driven; whereas by contrast observed vegetation dynamics may also have
    been affected by other processes not necessarily drought related (see section
    16). Daily time series of rainfall, radiation, and minimum and maximum temperature
    are input to the model, and therefore trends in these variables are considered;
    the influence of atmospheric CO2 concentration is not considered. The model separately
    estimates transpiration and several evaporation components (rainfall interception
    loss, soil evaporation, open water evaporation, evaporation from groundwater saturated
    areas) and does this separately for areas covered by seasonal and perennial vegetation.
    We estimated crop water use as the transpiration of seasonal vegetation simulated
    by the model. [34] Monthly time series of crop growth indicators averaged across
    all wheat-growing areas were calculated. For the NDVI products, it was investigated
    whether the various original and blended time series had different trends. For
    the blended data set, this was done by assessing any trend in the residuals between
    the original and blended data set. This was done to reduce the effect of interannual
    variability on the calculated trends, since different data sets were available
    for different periods. [35] We fitted a simple multiplicative model estimating
    annual wheat yields (Y, tonnes per hectare) as the product of a time-invariant
    prediction of yield (Y0) based on each of the three crop growth indicators (x)
    and a linearly increasing term ε that represents the effect of increasing conversion
    efficiency on the relationship between Y0 and actual yield Y: (5) where t is the
    number of years since the 1977/1978 financial year (starting July in Australia),
    and k, a, and b are empirical coefficients. The impact of the drought on yield
    was estimated using each of the crop growth indicators by inserting the predrought
    average value of the indicator and t = 28 (representing 2005/2006; the middle
    of the drought) into the fitted model. This produced an estimate of potential
    yield given predrought climate conditions. Actual yields were compared to these
    values to estimate the drought impact. The resulting impact on total production
    was estimated by multiplying with cropped area. This may underestimate the influence
    of the drought on production, because cropped areas also decreased during the
    drought years 2002/2003 and 2006/2007, mainly because planting decisions were
    to some extent influenced by the drought. 2.5. Economic and Social Drought Impacts
    [36] A comprehensive study of the propagation of the impacts of the Millennium
    Drought on the Australian economy and society has not yet been undertaken. We
    did not have the necessary expertise or access to economic and social data to
    perform new analysis. Instead, we reviewed published studies on the economic and
    social impacts to obtain, at least in a conceptual sense, a more comprehensive
    picture of the way in which the (bio-)physical drought impacts propagated through
    the economy and society. 3. Results 3.1. Causes of the Meteorological Drought
    [37] Six rainfall regions were distinguished following cluster analysis based
    on correlation between 1900 and 2009 annual rainfall patterns in 245 river basins
    (Figure 2). Optimal regression models that used up to four predictors were derived
    using 5 year rolling average time series of regional rainfall and candidate predictors.
    It is emphasized that this produced statistical results only, which need to be
    interpreted using climate process knowledge (see section 16). [38] Three to four
    phenomena could explain (in a statistical sense) most of the variance in 5-year
    rolling average patterns (53%–73%; Figure 2; for details see Table 2 in the supporting
    information). An ENSO index (winter Nino3.4) explained 44% of variance in east
    Australia, with some of the residual variance explained by STR (18%) and PDO (6%).
    In south Australia, PDO explained 40% of the observed variance, with some of the
    remaining variance explained by IOD (13%), ENSO (9%), and STR (6%). In southwest
    Australia, STR explained 45% of variance, with smaller parts explained by global
    temperature (6%) and IOD (2%). The remaining regions did not experience a drought,
    but it is noted that in north and west Australia, GMT explained 42–43% of variance
    in rainfall (Figure 2; but see supporting information for caveats). [39] Combining
    the regression model parameters with predictor anomalies for 2001–2009, the contributions
    of different drivers to the meteorological drought were estimated (Table 1). The
    ENSO appeared to explain most of the 2001–2009 rainfall deficit in east Australia
    (−8.1 out of −12.3%) and a smaller part in south Australia (−3.2 of −13.3%; Table
    1), while smaller contributions were made by PDO in both regions (−0.7% and −1.7%,
    respectively) and, in south Australia only, IOD (−1.7%). STR was estimated to
    contribute a −1.7% reduction in east Australia, but a counterintuitive +2.7% in
    south Australia. In northeast Australia, ENSO was also estimated as the main cause
    of the small rainfall deficit but was counteracted by a seemingly positive influence
    from STR. In southwest Australia, GMT (−4.7%) and STR (−4.0%) together appeared
    to explain the −8.6% rainfall deficit. Table 1. Estimated Contributions of Each

    and 1900–2000 mean rainfall (%). [40] Statistically significant (P < 0.1) drying
    trends (1950–2009) in annual rainfall were found for east (−0.36% per year) and
    south Australia (−0.26% per year) (Figure 2). Combining the regression model parameters
    with 1950–2009 trends in predictor variables produced estimates of their potential
    contribution (Table 3 in the supporting information). Overall, results were similar
    to the estimation of drought contribution. In east Australia, drying appeared
    due to trends in ENSO, STR, and PDO in approximately similar parts. In south Australia,
    PDO appeared to explain a large part of the observed rainfall decline, with smaller
    contributions from ENSO and IOD. Strong (P < 0.01) wetting trends were calculated
    for north (+0.69% per year) and west Australia (+0.68% per year) and were correlated
    to a similar trend in global temperature. No significant trend was calculated
    for southwest and northeast Australia. 3.2. Hydrological Drought Impacts [41]
    We analyzed streamflow data from the headwater catchments that were located in
    the three rainfall regions affected by the drought (East, South, and Southwest
    Australia, N = 126) and found that the median rainfall reduction during the drought
    (11%) was amplified 4.1 times in streamflow (−46%; Figure 3). The simple nonlinear
    model was fitted to 30–87 (mean 40) years of observed data and could explain 35–91%
    (mean 73%) of the observed variance in annual streamflow. It predicted a 25% decrease
    in streamflow, which equates to an amplification of 2.21 times relative rainfall
    decrease. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint (a) Map showing the model-estimated
    reduction in streamflow generation during the drought, and the reductions observed
    in 126 upland catchments used in the analysis; (b) Comparison of relative decreases
    in rainfall and estimated and observed streamflow in the 126 catchments for the
    driest 20% years occurring before 2001 (light shaded), and the average flows during
    the 2001–2009 drought (dark shaded). Error bars show interquartile range. [42]
    The AWRA process model suggested a 37% reduction or 3.19 times amplification.
    Figure 3b demonstrates that for the driest pre-2001 years, the models predict
    streamflow declines that are much closer to observed declines, although the AWRA
    process model predicts a slightly lesser decline than observed (54% versus 62%).
    These results suggest that there has been a cumulative drying effect on streamflow
    during the prolonged 2001–2009 drought. 3.3. Ecological Drought Impacts [43] During
    the drought years, the average observed flows were 2445 gigalitres (GL) per year,
    whereas the reconstructed unimpeded flows were 7568 GL per year (Figure 4a). Average
    reconstructed unimpeded flows for the period 1900–2000 were 13,830 GL per year.
    It follows that 2001–2006 actual river flows were 82% less (2445/13,830) than
    estimated long-term average flows without regulation (i.e., impoundment, release
    and extraction of flows). This 82% represents the combined impacts of drought
    and regulation. By comparison, flows during the drought would have been expected
    to be reduced by 45% (7568/13,830) in the absence of any regulation. In other
    words, low inflows are estimated to be responsible for 45% of the decrease, and
    regulation for the remaining 37% reduction. Given the basinwide rainfall decline
    of 18.4%, this implies an amplification of 4.47 times with and 2.46 times without
    regulation, respectively; apparently, river regulation amplified “natural” flow
    reductions by another 1.8 times. The annual maximum observed daily flows in most
    years was considerably lower than was estimated to have occurred under unimpeded
    conditions (Figure 4b). Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint (a) Annual total
    flow and (b) annual maximum daily flow in the Murray River at Wentworth (see Figure
    1b for location) as observed and as estimated to have occurred in the absence
    of river regulation. 3.4. Agricultural Drought Impacts [44] Rice and cotton are
    two important irrigated annual crops and are grown predominantly in the MDB when
    there is sufficient water stored in the supplying reservoirs. Total MDB water
    diversions fell from an average 11 km3/yr (1993–2002) to 8 km3/yr in 2002/2003
    and 4 km3/yr in 2008/2009. The consequences for rice and cotton production were
    considerable: between 2002 and 2009 irrigated rice and cotton production fell
    by 99% and 84%, respectively (Figure 5) [ABS, 2011], despite simultaneous increases
    in WUE. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Production of two major irrigated
    annual crops in the MDB [ABS, 2010]. [45] Dryland wheat production increased during
    the drought years in terms of production volume, but only because a −12% yield
    per unit area decline (comparing drought and predrought years) was compensated
    by a +22% increase in cropping area (Figure 6). The three tested indicators of
    wheat production could each explain 66%–68% of the recorded variations in crop
    yields, but crop water use and VOD required an annual 1.3% increase in WUE to
    be taken into account, whereas NDVI did not (Figure 6, Table 2). Using each of
    the three indicators, it was estimated that yields during the drought (July 2002–June
    2009) were 18%–22% lower than would have been achieved under average conditions;
    an amplification of 1.5–1.7 times the rainfall decline (Figure 6, Table 3). Table

    of the precipitation data analysis was to quantify the potential contribution
    of known climate phenomena to the Millennium Drought. We did not use prior knowledge
    to preselect from the full complement of candidate predictor variables, as this
    would have introduced a greater degree of subjectivity. An obvious downside is
    that it can cause counterintuitive analysis results. Potential causes of erroneous
    variable selection include spurious correlation and interactions between climate
    phenomena. To mitigate these uncertainties, we interpreted our statistical results
    along with evidence from published climate process studies and data on covariance
    between indices. A detailed discussion is provided in the supporting information,
    but the main points are summarized below. [47] Statistically, ENSO explained 44%
    of the rainfall variance in east Australia, two thirds of the 2001–2009 rainfall
    deficit, and about a third of the 1950–2009 rainfall trend. It also explained
    most of the rainfall deficit in northeast Australia and a minor part of the variance,
    rainfall deficit, and long-term drying trend in south Australia. The importance
    of ENSO on rainfall along the eastern seaboard is well published, but its influence
    is normally considered strongest in spring in south Australia and summer in east
    Australia [Risbey et al., 2009]. However, in both regions, most of the rainfall
    deficit during 2001–2009 occurred in the cooler months (autumn and spring in east
    Australia, and autumn and winter in south Australia), whereas summer rainfall
    was above average [CSIRO, 2010]. This suggests that while the interannual ENSO
    influence may be strongest in the spring-summer season, its influence on the drought
    and on long-term trends may be stronger in winter. Alternatively, there may be
    a global warming signal embedded in the Nino3.4 index that was selected by the
    model. [48] PDO seemed the strongest 5 year average rainfall predictor in south
    Australia, making an important contribution to the long-term rainfall decline
    and a small contribution to the 2001–2009 rainfall deficit. The importance of
    PDO as a low frequency influence has been described [Power et al., 1999], but
    its possible role in the decadal drying trend in south Australia has been less
    commented on. The estimated small contribution of PDO to the 2001–2009 rainfall
    deficit suggests that PDO was not a major factor in the Millennium Drought, however.
    [49] The intensity and to a lesser extent location of the STR have been proposed
    as an important predictor of cool season rainfall in southwest and south Australia
    [Hope et al., 2010]. Our statistical results with regard to the influence of STR
    on rainfall in the southern half of Australia appeared partly contradictory. We
    hypothesize that this may have been due to covariance between the PDO and STR
    indices or indicative of a relationship both have with global warming [cf. Timbal
    et al., 2010], at least when averaged over 5 years (see supporting information
    for details). [50] Previous studies on the importance of the IOD and SAM in the
    Millennium Drought have been contradictory (section 5). Our analysis provided
    some support for a role of IOD on the Millennium Drought in south Australia, but
    we were unable to identify any influence of SAM on the 2001–2009 drought or long-term
    trends. [51] Overall, our results confirm that that ENSO was the most important
    driver of the Millennium Drought in east Australia and explained a small part
    of the rainfall deficit in south Australia. Our data analysis proved inconclusive
    with regard to the main causes of the drought in south Australia. Correct attribution
    is particularly important to anticipate any systematic changes in future drought
    characteristics. Different phenomena are anticipated to be affected by global
    climate change to different degrees. For example, STR shows a long-term trend
    consistent with changes in the Hadley circulation expected from global warming
    [Hu et al., 2011, and references therein; Kent et al., 2011; Nicholls, 2006].
    On that basis, global warming has been hypothesized as a factor contributing to
    the drought. The sensitivity of other drivers to global warming is much more tenuous.
    There appears little agreement among global climate models about the influence
    of global warming on ENSO [Van Oldenborgh et al., 2005], even though Power and
    Smith [2007] noted that many existing ENSO indices attained unprecedented values
    during the period 1977–2006. Similarly, a mechanism by which global climate change
    influences PDO has so far not been established. Regardless, the apparent importance
    of PDO as a low-frequency driver of decadal precipitation trends suggests a potential
    source for climate nonstationarity that warrants further research in its own right
    [cf. Speer et al., 2011]. 4.2. Hydrological Drought Impacts [52] A simple statistical
    model that ignores temporal correlation or subannual rainfall patterns predicted
    an amplification of rainfall deficit in streamflow of 2.2 times (Figure 2b) based
    on the streamflow data from the 126 catchments in east, south, and southwest Australia.
    One reason for this amplification is likely to be that autumn and to a lesser
    extent winter rainfall were reduced considerably more than rainfall during the
    other seasons [Chiew et al., 2011; Potter and Chiew, 2011]. The daily time step
    model considered such weather patterns as well as catchment storage dynamics and
    predicted an amplification of 3.2 times. This still leaves a 1.3 times amplification
    unexplained. [53] In southwest Australia, greater than expected reductions in
    catchment streamflow during a sequence of dry years were associated with the decline
    of groundwater tables below the river streambed, causing a loss in hydrological
    connectivity and resilience [Petrone et al., 2010]. TWS observations by the GRACE
    satellite measurements [Tapley et al., 2004] suggest that increasing water-storage
    deficits occurred across southern Australia during the drought and were not fully
    reproduced by the AWRA model (Figure 7). This unexplained trend has been attributed
    to groundwater depletion [Leblanc et al., 2012, 2009; Van Dijk et al., 2011].
    Total storage did not recover until the unusually wet period in early 2010 (Figure
    7) suggesting that catchment function required above-average rainfall conditions
    to be restored. This has implications for the accumulative impact of future droughts
    on streamflow generation and subsequent recovery of catchment function; it suggests
    that drought conditions may linger until there is a particularly wet period. Figure
    7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Satellite-observed (black) and model-estimated
    (gray) total water storage over regions east, south, and southwest (cf. Figure
    2a) combined. Data shown is 3 month rolling average for figure clarity. 4.3. Propagation
    Through the Hydrological Cycle [54] Understanding and describing droughts is complicated
    by the way in which impacts propagate through the water cycle. For the MDB, time
    series of several relevant observation-based estimates were available to illustrate
    this. Already introduced were precipitation, remotely sensed total terrestrial
    water storage, and downstream Murray River flows. Additional available data include
    estimates of total storage in the basin''s public reservoirs (data from Leblanc
    et al. [2012]) and in the combined groundwater stores (using groundwater level
    data and methods in Tregoning et al. [2012]). [55] The propagation of the drought
    throughout the hydrological cycle caused observable differences in the timing
    of the worst drought impacts by up to several years (Figure 8). For example, 6
    month average precipitation anomalies reached a minimum in January 2003 and a
    second, slightly less low value in January 2007. By contrast, the first total
    water storage minimum coincided with the first precipitation minimum but recovered
    rapidly afterward, whereas the second minimum occurred in October 2009; more than
    2 years after the second precipitation minimum. Combined public water storage
    achieved a temporary minimum in April 2003 before dropping further until May 2007.
    Downstream peak flows in the Murray River remained low throughout the drought,
    although data were missing during most of 2008 and 2009; understood to be a result
    of gauging problems due to the unusually low flows. Finally, groundwater storage
    showed a different pattern again, remaining in apparent dynamic equilibrium until
    the end of 2006 and then steadily decreasing until the beginning of 2010 (individual
    bore data suggest that widespread recovery occurred after this). The varying response
    of different hydrological variables can be attributed to a combination of natural
    hydrological processes (e.g., slow groundwater losses to vegetation water uptake
    and capillary rise) and human influences (e.g., reservoir operation and river
    water diversion) and illustrate the potentially complex interactions during multiyear
    hydrological droughts. This complexity affects our ability understand, describe,
    monitor, and explain the hydrological impacts of long droughts. Figure 8 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Propagation of the meteorological drought through
    the hydrological cycle in the MDB: (a) monthly rainfall anomalies (dotted) and
    6 month running average (solid); (b) GRACE satellite-observed average monthly
    terrestrial water storage; (c) combined storage in public reservoirs; (d) daily
    peak flow by for each month in the Murray River at Wentworth; and (e) estimated
    MDB groundwater storage. [56] While our case study has some unique local features,
    it is obvious that a single drought index can never be expected to describe the
    multitude of impacts during multiyear droughts. A wider set of drought indicators
    is needed, going beyond precipitation and (shallow) soil moisture and describing
    gradually accumulating impacts. Ultimately, human and instrumental observation
    networks on the ground probably remain the only reliable way to monitor drought
    impacts, but there are many opportunities to move beyond the current generation
    of simplistic rainfall-based drought indicators and develop a more sophisticated
    drought monitoring capability. As a case in point, satellite and biophysical model
    data identical or similar to those used in the current case study are all available
    with global coverage. International collaborative initiatives are underway to
    develop these data sources into useful information services [e.g., Pozzi et al.,
    2013]. 4.4. Ecological Impacts [57] The amplified impact of the drought on riverine
    ecosystems was caused by a combination of the natural amplification that occurs
    moving down a river system (e.g., due to evaporative and riparian losses on the
    way) exacerbated considerably by extractions and the operation of river infrastructure
    to supply water users. River regulation was identified as the leading cause for
    the strongly reduced frequency of medium size floods and associated decline in
    health of the vast riparian River Red Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) forests even
    before the onset of the drought [Davies et al., 2008; Gehrke et al., 2006]. Our
    results confirm that in the absence of regulation, at least partial flooding would
    still have occurred during the drought. [58] Comparing observed flow patterns
    with modeled scenarios, we estimate that without river regulation the basinwide
    2001–2006 rainfall deficit of 18% would have led to a 45% reduction in total flow
    (an amplification of 2.46 times), whereas the observed reduction was 82% (4.46
    times). It follows that river management almost doubled the reduction of average
    river flows. It also caused an absence of flood events (Figure 4b). The river
    flow range over which increasingly large areas of floodplain are inundated has
    been estimated at 36.7–140 GL per day [CSIRO, 2008b]. Comparing this to modeled
    and observed maximum flows shows that, prior to 2010, development increased the
    number of years without a major flood event from 15 to 18 years, and was also
    responsible for the absence of smaller flood events since 2000 (Figure 4b). [59]
    Inevitably, there is some uncertainty in modeling the hypothetical unregulated
    flows. The river model uses observed data on tributary river inflow and therefore
    the biases in catchment models estimating streamflow generation (section 17) are
    less of a concern. There are additional sources of potential bias however, particular
    with regard to the estimation of river losses (e.g., to groundwater, off-channel
    wetlands, and floodplains). As part of a previous implementation of the same model,
    a detailed analysis of model performance against river flows observed before and
    during the drought was performed [Van Dijk et al., 2008]. A number of instances
    of river model bias were identified, but most affected low flows rather than peak
    or total flows. The results obtained here would appear to be fairly robust therefore.
    [60] We did not quantify drought impacts on dryland ecosystems (other than agricultural
    crops) but they were widespread (cf. Figure 1a). Increased tree mortality has
    been observed well away from rivers [Semple et al., 2010] and fire activity was
    strongly increased during the drought with large tracts of native and plantation
    forest being burnt. Further research would be needed to quantify the immediate
    and long-term impacts of the Millennium Drought on these ecosystems. 4.5. Agricultural
    Drought Impacts [61] The observed reduction in irrigated agriculture during the
    drought can be attributed directly to the decline in river inflows and consequent
    declines in reservoir storage and released volumes. Water sharing rules meant
    that initially, reduced water allocations mainly affected the irrigation of annual
    crops such as rice and cotton (Figure 5), as well as irrigated pasture (for which
    production impacts are not readily assessed using sector production data). As
    the drought intensified, however, crops relying on more secure water rights ultimately
    were also affected. For example, the production of summer-bearing oranges—an important
    perennial crop under irrigation—was 32% lower in 2003–2007 than during 1999–2002
    (data from Citrus Australia). [62] In dryland agriculture, rainfall declines were
    amplified 1.5–1.7 times in wheat yield declines but the impact on long-term trends
    was counteracted by increased crop WUE. The three indicators of dryland wheat
    production all had interannual patterns that were very similar to those observed
    in wheat yields, but long-term trends varied. On the basis of modeling, we expected
    a reduction of NDVI in line with reduced rainfall, but the observations show no
    such response to rainfall decrease. Our interpretation is that NDVI observations
    embody the long-term increase in WUE, whereas the other two indices do not. To
    test this, we compared the monthly time series of blended satellite NDVI with
    NDVI estimated from AWRA model output. NDVI is estimated using a linear relationship
    with modeled canopy cover that was calibrated against MODIS NDVI data for 2000–2006;
    AWRA canopy cover and NDVI estimates have been evaluated previously against satellite-observed
    vegetation products, showing good agreement for annual cropping regions [Van Dijk
    and Warren, 2010]. The observed and modeled NDVI are shown for monthly and annual
    data in Figures 9a and 9b, respectively. Despite good correlation (R2 = 0.79),
    there is a clear difference in linear trends. Keeping in mind that the model NDVI
    was calibrated for MODIS NDVI (2000 onward), it can be concluded that the model
    estimated NDVI reduced over time (due to reduced rainfall), whereas the observations
    show no such response. Two explanations for this phenomenon may be considered:
    Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint (a) Monthly and (b) annual time series
    annual blended NDVI for the intensive cropping zone (Figure 1b) and NDVI estimated
    from modeled canopy cover (years ending June). [63] First, the lacking trend in
    AVHRR NDVI might have been an artifact of the satellite data or their processing.
    The original AVHRR NDVI products were produced using different approaches and
    assumptions to correct for the lack of onboard calibration of the AVHRR instrument
    [Beck et al., 2011]. If this explanation was correct, some of the products might
    be expected to show a declining trend. Table 4 shows that all data sets show similar
    (small) positive trends. Thus, while we cannot completely exclude this explanation,
    the evidence appears to be against it. Table 4. Trend Calculated for the Different

    that the available months vary somewhat between data sets. [64] Second, the AWRA
    model may have wrongly predicted a negative trend. Conceptually, if the relationship
    between water availability and vegetation density is stationary, we would expect
    a reduction in vegetation growth if water availability diminishes in an already
    water limited environment. This is indeed what the model predicts; there was a
    negative rainfall trend over the analysis period. [65] In reality, there are reasons
    to doubt a constant relationship between water availability and vegetation density,
    particularly for crops. Such a constant relationship requires that the conversion
    efficiency (WUE) from transpiration via carbon assimilation to produced crop yield
    is constant overall. Instead, long-term increases in conversion efficiency are
    known to have occurred; due to crop breeding, increased nutrient inputs and improved
    cropping practices, potentially enhanced by anthropogenic CO2 fertilization [Turner
    and Asseng, 2005]. Conversion of vegetation (within what was designated as cropping
    area in Figure 1b) to wheat crop may also result in greater NDVI per unit VOD
    or water use, depending on prior vegetation. Fertilization with anthropogenic
    atmospheric CO2 could have further contributed to increasing WUE: average concentrations
    during the drought (2002–2008) were 7.1% higher than on average during the period
    1980–2001. Over the period 1981–2007, global atmospheric CO2 concentrations have
    grown at 0.46% per year, which in a water limited environment could theoretically
    be expected to result in corresponding increase in WUE, if not necessarily expressed
    in increased growth [Peñuelas et al., 2011]. Over the same period, model estimated
    crop water use decreased by 0.44% per year (−2.4 mm per year, period average 540
    mm) due to rainfall patterns. Overall, it appears plausible and indeed likely
    that WUE has increased over time, but our data do not provide conclusive evidence
    for a CO2 fertilization effect in addition to agricultural improvements. 4.6.
    Economic and Social Drought Impacts [66] The contribution of agricultural production
    to Australia''s economy fell from 2.9% (financial years ending 1997–2002) to 2.4%
    of GDP (2003–2009), contributing only 2.1% in the peak drought years ending in
    2003 and 2007 [ABS, 2011]. This 16% difference in GDP contribution is 1.25 times
    the relative rainfall difference of 13% between the two periods. Such a calculation
    is obviously a simplified one; for example, the drought impacts are superimposed
    on a long-term slow decreasing trend in the overall importance of agriculture
    for Australia''s GDP. Other studies estimating the impact of the drought are restricted
    to one of the drought years: Horridge et al. [2005] estimated that the drought
    lowered national GDP in 2002 by 1.6%, whereas the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)
    [2006] estimated that the 2006–2007 dry year reduced GDP by almost 1%. [67] Arguments
    can be and have been raised against GDP as an appropriate measure of economic
    health. For example, while contributing less than 3% to GDP, agriculture represents
    a fifth of Australia''s export value and is the primary source of income for many
    rural communities inhabiting a large part of the country. In the drought-affected
    areas the economic impacts were obviously larger than at national level: for the
    worst affected regions within the MDB, Horridge et al. [2005] estimated that gross
    regional product (GRP) in 2002 was reduced by more than 15% and employment by
    3%, and for the Murray River region Wittwer and Griffith [2011] estimated that
    during 2006–2009 about 6000 jobs were lost. [68] The earlier studies focused on
    economic impacts through agriculture, but the drought also affected other sectors.
    Forestry is one example: between 2003 and 2009 more than 57,000 ha of planted
    forests were lost in southeast Australia, representing about 3% of the national
    plantation estate [Stewart, 2009]. Tourism, of similar importance to agriculture
    in terms of GDP, export value, and employment, is another example. National level
    estimates of the impact of the drought do not appear to exist, but for the Murray
    River region alone, it was estimated that the drought reduced tourism GRP by 5%
    in 2008 (equivalent to 0.7% of the GDP contribution of tourism [ABS, 2011]) with
    600 jobs being lost [Tourism Research Australia (TRA), 2010]. Virtually all economic
    activities will have been affected to some degree by the reduced availability
    and greater costs of utilities. For water, this includes the direct impacts of
    household and industrial water restrictions and costs, and the indirect costs
    from infrastructure investments (e.g., desalination plants). Electricity prices
    were also driven up by the drought, particularly in 2007, when surface water availability
    reduced hydroelectric and coal power generation and hot conditions increased demand
    [Plumb and Davis, 2010]. The overall impact of these factors on the economy does
    not appear to have been estimated, however. [69] Reports on the social impacts
    of the drought paint a picture of rural communities suffering unemployment and
    loss of household income, local businesses and services, recreational opportunities,
    and social cohesion [e.g., Drought Policy Review Expert Social Panel, 2008, and
    references therein]. Combined with the harsh weather and desiccated landscape,
    they increased psychological health problems [e.g., depression, substance abuse,
    and suicide; Nicholls et al., 2006]; the impacts on physical health do not appear
    to have been studied. [70] A key challenge for both economic and social drought
    impact studies is to identify and control for the often rather wide range of other
    drivers beyond the drought. Important among these is the undercurrent of steady
    decline that many of Australia''s rural communities have been experiencing over
    recent decades. [71] The institutional and political impacts of the drought may
    be considered a subset of social impacts. They are partially reviewed by Leblanc
    et al. [2012] (for the case of water management policy) and the Productivity Commission
    [2009] (for the case of government drought policy). It is clear that the drought
    catalyzed a number of permanent reforms in water and drought policy and institutional
    arrangements. Equally, however, it is not difficult to find evidence that the
    sudden end of the drought, combined with unfavorable political factors (e.g.,
    budget pressures and polarized federal-state relations) has slowed down progress
    on remaining, often more contested and uncertain decisions (e.g., environmental
    flow provision and its merits). 5. Synthesis [72] Although ENSO was found to play
    a role in the Millennium Drought, we could not unambiguously identify the other
    drivers of the meteorological drought. This is perhaps not surprising given the
    challenges in attribution and the contradictory results of previous studies. In
    addition to this attribution challenge, another problem remains that for many
    of the candidate drivers the likely future trajectory and the way it may be influenced
    by global warming cannot currently be predicted with confidence. Therefore, we
    are left unable to anticipate whether future droughts will likely be systematically
    different from past ones (although with the noteworthy exception that they can
    be expected to be accompanied by increasingly high temperatures due to global
    warming). The synoptic conditions during the drought (i.e., the STR) were consistent
    with the poleward expansion of the Hadley circulation expected under global warming,
    which should be a cause for concern and further investigation. Other research
    priorities would appear to be the potentially changing behavior of ENSO under
    global warming, and the trajectory of future PDO conditions. [73] We demonstrated
    that the propagation of meteorological drought conditions through the hydrological
    cycle during this multiyear drought involved several nonlinear responses and accumulating
    impacts. As a result, the timing and duration of impacts on soil moisture, river
    flows, reservoir storage, and groundwater levels varied by months to years. It
    follows that simple rainfall-based indicators should not be relied upon to characterize
    drought. Fortunately, a wider set of observation-based drought measures has become
    available from improved remote sensing and model technologies and can be used
    in future droughts. [74] Total storage did not recover until the unusually wet
    period in early 2010, suggesting that catchment function required above-average
    rainfall conditions to be restored. This has implications for the accumulative
    impact of future droughts on streamflow generation and subsequent recovery of
    catchment function. It suggests that drought conditions linger until there is
    a particularly wet period, supporting social perceptions about drought commonly
    found in rural Australia [McKernan, 2005]. [75] Wheat production continued to
    increase during the drought only because cropped area increased and because water
    deficiencies were partly mitigated by ongoing increases in crop WUE (including
    a potential CO2 fertilization effect). This emphasizes that there are ways by
    which the impacts of future droughts can be mitigated. However, it would seem
    an inevitable consequence that total wheat production has become more sensitive
    to drought in terms of total production volume. This is likely to contribute to
    volatility in a global wheat market that appears increasingly sensitive to variations
    in supply. [76] River regulation clearly provided a highly effective means to
    manipulate and distribute the impacts of drought on riverine ecosystems and communities,
    mitigating the impacts for some by exacerbating them for others. Water sharing
    rules and trading favored users reliant on continued supply, including irrigation
    of perennial high value crops and water utilities, while lower security water
    users and riverine ecosystems wore the consequences [CSIRO, 2008a; Van Dijk et
    al., 2008]. The MDB surface water system appears fundamentally overdeveloped and
    adaptation appears no longer possible without incurring considerable costs. Williams
    [2003] argues that current water management is based on the optimistic myth that
    it is possible to “drought-proof” Australia''s agriculture and advocates instead
    that Australia be “myth-proofed.” We would include, as part of this myth, the
    notion that Australia''s riverine ecosystems can be restored without incisive
    changes in water extraction and regulation. The current political process reflects
    this dilemma. An added complication is that the negative outcomes (e.g., less
    and more expensive irrigation water resources and associated community impacts)
    are more predictable and more acutely felt than the intended positive outcomes
    of increasing the resilience of riverine ecosystems and communities. [77] As much
    as the impacts of the meteorological drought on water resources, ecosystems and
    agricultural production were confounded, the more diffuse impacts on economy and
    society appeared even more complex and hard to quantify. There appears to be a
    general lack of systematic studies categorizing, quantifying and attributing the
    economic and social impacts of drought and the dominant causative processes involved.
    For example, most studies appear to focus on agricultural production and rural
    farming communities, whereas some of the examples discussed illustrate that the
    drought impacts went well beyond these. The conceptual diagram in Figure 10 illustrates
    this lack of knowledge: apart from its impact via crop production, we were unable
    to identify the main pathways by which the meteorological and hydrological drought
    impacted economic and social wellbeing. This would seem a major gap in our understanding
    that makes it unlikely that future droughts can be managed more successfully than
    historic ones. Further studies, arguably best working backwards from the main
    impacts experienced, would seem essential. A similar argument holds for the health
    of dryland ecosystems (inc. groundwater dependent ecosystems) and, to a perhaps
    slightly lesser extent, riverine ecosystems. Figure 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Diagram illustrating how the meteorological drought propagated through the hydrological
    cycle and had ecological, economic, and social impacts. The diagram is not complete,
    showing only key impacts and dominant links identified and discussed in the text
    (e.g., social impacts are understood to be the combined result of several of the
    impacts shown, but dominant pathways could not be identified). [78] Our results
    illustrate the complex nature of multiyear droughts, when compared to seasonal
    drought. The long duration provides much opportunity for cumulative impacts, interactions
    and feedbacks and complex interactions with other changeable external factors
    to occur. Severe droughts are by definition rare events and each historic multiyear
    drought has had different characteristics [Verdon-Kidd and Kiem, 2009b]. There
    appears to be a tendency for each drought to be perceived as “the worst on record”
    [McKernan, 2005]. Precisely because of the low frequency, the different nature
    of each drought, and the different dimensions of drought (extent, severity and
    duration) it is indeed likely that each new severe drought will have unique features,
    have unexpected impacts, and be “the worst on record” in some aspects. For the
    Millennium Drought, some of the uniquely severe impacts appeared to have been
    “primed” by the relatively dry years before 2001, in combination with the rapidly
    increased level of urban and irrigation water resources use. [79] Previous authors
    have noted a gradual change and broadening in public discourse in Australia, from
    considering drought primarily as a natural disaster to including an additional
    view that recognizes drought as a recurrent feature of the Australian climate
    and therefore a predictable risk [e.g., Leadbeater, 2007; Stehlik, 2005]. The
    latter view has been used to argue that drought risks should be anticipated and
    carried by those directly impacted. However, this presumes that our historic record
    is sufficiently long and that climate conditions are sufficiently stationary for
    such planning to occur. With each successive severe drought having unique features,
    with the presence of naturally unstable climate drivers (e.g., PDO), and with
    the specter of global climate change, this may prove to be an unrealistic expectation.

    The Internet of Things (IoT) has found its application in several areas, such
    as connected industry, smart-city [1], [2], smart-home [3] smart-energy, connected
    car [4], smart-agriculture [5], connected building and campus [6], health care
    [7], logistics [8], among other domains. IoT aims to integrate the physical world
    with the virtual world by using the Internet as the medium to communicate and
    exchange information [9]. IoT has been defined as a system of interrelated computing
    devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, or people that are
    provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network
    without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. A key area
    of interest in this paper is the application of IoT in agriculture. The world
    population is estimated to be about 9.7 billion in 2050, as such there will be
    great demand for food. This coupled with the diminishing natural resources, arable
    land, unpredictable weather conditions make food security a major concern for
    most countries. The world is turning to the use of IoT combined with data analytics
    (DA) to meet the world’s food demands in the coming years [10]. It is predicted
    that IoT device installations in the agriculture sector will increase from 30
    million in 2015 to 75 million by 2020. The use of IoT and DA will enable smart
    agriculture which is expected to deliver high operational efficiency and high
    yield [11], [12]. Over the years, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has been deployed
    for smart agriculture and food production with a focus on environmental monitoring,
    precision agriculture, machine and process control automation and traceability
    [13]–[18]. The capability of WSN to self-organize, self-configure, self-diagnosis,
    and self-heal has made it a good choice for smart agriculture and the food industry.
    The WSN is a system that comprise of radio frequency (RF) transceivers, sensors,
    microcontrollers and power sources [13]. However, with the emergency of IoT there
    has been a paradigm shift from the use of WSN for smart agriculture to IoT as
    the major driver of smart agriculture. The IoT integrates several technologies
    that already exist, such as WSN, RF identification, cloud computing, middleware
    systems and end-user applications [19]. The application of IoT in agriculture
    is about empowering farmers with the decision tools and automation technologies
    that seamlessly integrate products, knowledge and services for better productivity,
    quality, and profit. Recent surveys on the IoT in agriculture have focused on
    the challenges and constraints for large-scale pilots in entire supply chain in
    the agrifood sector [5], [20]. Some of the key issues addressed are the need for
    new business models, security and privacy, and data governance and ownership solution.
    Other related survey on smart agriculture have largely focused on the use of WSNs
    [21]. While these survey papers deal with the application of sensor technology
    and challenges in the application of IoT to the food supply chain, the communication
    technology were limited to conventional methods which employs low range communication
    technologies. In this paper, an extensive review of IoT in agriculture is carried
    out. The review includes a survey of published articles, white paper and existing
    solutions. The IoT ecosystem for agriculture is discussed in detail based on four
    major components which are IoT devices, communication technology, Internet, data
    storage, and processing. The application of IoT and DA and how it is enabling
    smart agriculture is presented. Furthermore, the benefits, challenges, open issues,
    future trends and opportunities are discussed. The organization of this paper
    is presented as follows. In Section II, the IoT ecosystem for agriculture, which
    consist of four major components: a) IoT devices; b) communication technology;
    c) Internet; and d) data are presented. Section III covers the classification
    of IoT application in agriculture. Key areas are considered: a) monitoring; b)
    tracking and tracing; c) agricultural machinery; d) precision agriculture; and
    e) greenhouse production. Section IV discusses the importance of IoT and DA. Six
    key areas are considered which are: a) prediction; b) storage management; c) decision
    making; d) farm management; e) precision farming; and f) insurance. In Section
    V, the benefits are highlighted. These include the use of IoT to promote community
    farming, safety and fraud prevention, competitive advantages, wealth creation,
    cost reduction, operational efficiency, awareness, and asset management. Section
    VI discusses several open issues and key challenges in the adoption of IoT in
    agriculture. The issues are identified and discussed under three main categories:
    a) business; b) technical; and c) sectoral. Section VII takes a look at the future
    trends and opportunities. Section VIII finally concludes this paper. SECTION II.
    IoT Ecosystem In this section, an overview of the IoT ecosystem for agriculture
    is presented. It consists of four major components which are: 1) IoT devices;
    2) communication technology; 3) Internet; and 4) data storage and processing.
    Fig. 1 illustrates the IoT ecosystem. The four major components are essential
    for any IoT application. The description of the IoT components as it relates to
    agriculture is provided as follows. Fig. 1. Illustration of IoT ecosystem for
    agriculture. Show All A. IoT Devices The IoT devices consist of embedded systems
    which interacts with sensors and actuators and requires wireless connectivity.
    These IoT devices are sometimes referred to as IoT sensors. Throughout this paper
    it is referred to as IoT device. The architecture of a typical IoT device for
    agriculture is shown in Fig. 2. The embedded system consists of field programmable
    gate arrays or microprocessor, communication modules, memory and input/output
    interfaces. Fig. 2. Architecture of IoT device. Show All The sensors are used
    to monitor and to measure different farm variables (example soil nutrients, weather
    data) and factors that affect production. The sensors can be classified into location
    sensors, optical sensors, mechanical sensors, electrochemical sensors, and airflow
    sensors [22]. These sensors are used to gather information, such as air temperature,
    soil temperature at various depths, rainfall, leaf wetness, chlorophyll, wind
    speed, dew point temperature, wind direction, relative humidity, solar radiation,
    and atmospheric pressure. Table I provides a summary of some of the sensors and
    their applications. There are key characteristics of IoT device that makes them
    suitable for agriculture purposes. They are: 1) power efficiency; 2) memory; 3)
    computational efficiency; 4) portability; 5) durability; 6) coverage; 7) reliability;
    and 8) cost. TABLE I Summary of Agriculture Sensors B. Communication Technology
    The communication technology plays a key role in the successful deployment of
    IoT systems. The existing communication technology can be classified based on
    standards, spectrum, and application scenarios. The communication standard can
    be grouped into short-range communication standard and long-range communication
    standard. The communication spectrum can be grouped into licensed and unlicensed
    spectrum. The IoT devices application scenarios can be based on sensors or backhaul
    network, and deployment scenarios [23]. 1) Spectrum: The unlicensed spectrum makes
    use of industrial scientific and medical RF band known as ISM band. The drawback
    to the use of the unlicensed spectrum are security issues, cost of infrastructure,
    and interference. Electromagnetic interference is generated by ISM IoT devices
    that interrupts radio communications that use the same frequency. On the other
    hand, the licensed spectrum which are allocated to the cellular network offers
    more efficient traffic management, less interference, better reliability, increased
    quality of service (QoS), high level of security, wider coverage and lesser cost
    of infrastructure to the users. The drawback to the use of licensed spectrum is
    cost of subscription for data transmission and transmit power consumption on the
    IoT devices. 2) Standard: There are so many existing standards for wireless communications,
    some of which have been listed in Table II. They can be classified into short-range
    and long-range communication standards. Examples of the short-range standards
    are near field communications-enabled devices, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, passive
    and active radio frequency identification (RFID) systems. The short-range standards
    can cover distances within 100 m. The long-range communication standards can cover
    distances up to 10 s of kilometers. The long-range communication standards are
    classified as the low power wide area (LPWA) (examples are LoRa, Sigfox, NB-IoT).
    The LPWA makes use of low power and can cover wide area [24], [25]. TABLE II Communication
    Technology 3) Application Scenario: The choice of communication technology also
    depends on applications of the IoT device. The communication technology can either
    be used for IoT devices that acts as nodes or as backhaul networks. The nodes
    transmit low data and cover very short distances with low power consumption. The
    backhaul network supports high data rates and can be used for very long distances.
    Some of the communication technologies support bi-directional link. The bi-directional
    link allows for forward error correction, handshaking for data reliability, encryption
    of data, over-the-air firmware updates, and communication between devices. In
    [26], the comparison of LoRa and NB-IoT shows that each technology has its advantages
    and disadvantages hence the most appropriate technology depends on the application.
    Furthermore, the choice of communication technology for the IoT device also depends
    on the type of topology to be deployed. There are different types of topology,
    such as peer-to-peer (P2P) or line, star, mesh, ring, tree, and bus topology.
    In each of these topologies, an IoT device plays different roles and different
    functions.1 The role can either be a personal area coordinator (PAN) or as an
    end device. The functions can be full function device (FFD) or a reduced function
    device (RFD). Fig. 3 illustrates two types of topologies and roles played. In
    the P2P topology, the PAN functions as FFD and starts the communication while
    the end devices can either function as an FFD or RFD. The end device which acts
    as FFD can have multiple connections while the end device that acts as RFD can
    only connect to one FFD and cannot connect to another RFD. The star topology consists
    of PAN that initiates the communication and accepts connection from other devices.
    The end devices can only establish connections with the PAN coordinator. Fig.

    in the field of wireless communication systems, mobile devices, and ubiquitous
    services has paved way for massive connectivity to the Internet. According to
    Machina research report, the number of connected agricultural devices is expected
    to grow from 13 million at the end of 2014 to 225 million by 2024 [27]. The Internet
    forms the core network layer, where paths are provided to carry and exchange data
    and network information between multiple subnetworks. The connection of IoT devices
    to the Internet enables data to be available anywhere and anytime. However, the
    transfer of data via the Internet requires adequate security, support of real
    time data and ease of accessibility. The Internet has paved way for cloud computing,
    where large data are gathered for storage and processing. Cloud computing involves
    the management of user interface, services, organizing and coordinating of network
    nodes, computing, and processing data [28]. To achieve the connectivity of heterogeneous
    systems and devices over the Internet, IoT middleware and connectivity protocols
    are being developed. Examples of the IoT middleware is the service-oriented architecture
    (SOA), cloud-based IoT middleware and actor-based IoT middleware which have been
    applied to support IoT [29], [30]. The SOA for IoT consist of multilayer architecture.
    Some of the proposed IoT architecture consist of the following layers: sensing,
    accessing, networking, middleware, and application layers. We refer readers to
    [29], [31], and [32] and the references therein for more details on the IoT architecture
    and technology. D. Data Storage and Processing Units Data driven agriculture involves
    the collection of enormous, dynamic, complex, and spatial data, which requires
    storage and processing [33]. The complexity of the data can range from structured
    to nonstructured data [11], [34] which can be in the form of text, images, audio,
    and video. The data can range from historical data, sensor data, live streamed
    data, business, and market related data. The use of cloud IoT platforms allow
    for big data collected from sensors to be stored in the cloud. This includes hosting
    of application that are critical in providing services and to manage end-to-end
    IoT architecture. Recently, edge or fog computing is advocated, where IoT devices
    and gateways carry out computation and analysis in order to reduce latency for
    critical applications, reduce cost and promote QoS [35], [36]. There are several
    agriculture management information systems that have been developed to manage
    the various forms of data [33]. Examples of some of the commercially available
    platforms are Onfarm systems, Farmobile, the silent herdsman platform, Cropx [37],
    Farmx [38], Easyfarm [39], KAA [40], and Farmlogs [41]. This platforms provide
    data storage, data management, and DA. Table III provides a summary of IoT solutions
    for agriculture. TABLE III Examples of IoT Solutions for Agriculture E. Summary
    In the deployment of IoT device, there are key technical parameters that needs
    to be considered. For wireless connectivity, the following parameters should be
    considered: the range of communication distance, data rate, battery life, mobility,
    latency, security and resilience, and cost of gateway modems. Among the communication
    technology, the LPWA is attracting so much interest [47] especially with the emergence
    of NB-IoT. The NB-IoT promises interesting features which include low device power
    consumption, ultralow device cost, simpler to implement, support of a massive
    number of low-throughput devices, long distance coverage and can support upload
    and download of data [48], [49]. There are several use cases of IoT in agriculture
    which have adopted the use of the IoT ecosystems discussed in this section. Some
    of these applications are discussed in Section III. SECTION III. Application of
    IoT in Agriculture There are several examples of application of IoT in agriculture.
    Examples of such use case are crop and livestock [50], [51], machinery [52], irrigation
    and water quality monitoring [53]–[60], weather monitoring [61], soil monitoring
    [61], [62], disease and pest control [63], [64], automation and precision [65].
    The application of IoT is discussed based on the following functions: monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, precision agriculture, and greenhouse
    production. A. Monitoring In agriculture several factors can be monitored, these
    factors depend on the sector of agriculture under considerations. The key factors
    to be monitored are highlighted and discussed as follows. 1) Crop Farming: In
    crop farming, there are several environmental factors that affect farm produce.
    Acquiring such data help to understand the patterns and process of the farm. Such
    data includes, the amount of rainfall, leaf wetness, temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, salinity, climate, dry circle, solar radiation, pest movement, human
    activities, etc. [66]. The acquisition of such detailed record enables optimal
    decision making to improve the quality of the farm produce, minimize risk, and
    maximize profits. For instance, the solar radiation data gives information about
    the plants exposure to sunlight from, where the farmer can identify if the plants
    are properly exposed or over exposed. The soil moisture content gives information
    on the dampness of the soil which can help in controlling soil conditions and
    reduce the risk of plant diseases. Furthermore, timely and accurate weather forecasting
    data, such as, climatic changes and rainfall, can improve the productivity level.
    In addition, such data can help farmers in the planning stage and reduce the cost
    of labor. The farmers can also take corrective and preventive measures in advance
    based on the data provided. The pest movement data can be collected and remotely
    fed live to the farmers for pest control or used to provide advice to the farmers
    based on record tracking of pest attacks [67]. 2) Aquaponics: Aquaponics is the
    combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, where fish wastes are fed into plant
    farms to provide the essential nutrients required by the plants. In such farms,
    it is important to constantly monitor the water quality, water level, temperature
    levels, health of the fishes, salinity, pH level, humidity, and sunlight [68].
    The accurate data can improve the fish and plants yield as it allows nutrients
    transfer between the plants and fish. The data can also be used for automation
    purposes with less human intervention. 3) Forestry: Forestry plays an important
    role in the carbon cycle, and also harbor over two-thirds of world known species.
    The factors to be monitored in a forest includes; soil and air temperatures and
    humidity, and the different levels of gases, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
    toluene, oxygen, hydrogen, methane, isobutane, ammonia, ethanol, hydrogen sulphide,
    and nitrogen dioxide [69]. These parameters can provide early warning and alert
    systems against veld fire in the forest and also help to monitor against diseases.
    4) Livestock Farming: The factors to be monitored in livestock depends on the
    types of animals under consideration [70]. For example, the conductivity of milk
    from buffaloes and cows can give information about the health state of the animals.
    Other factors are temperature, humidity, yield, pest attack, and water quality.
    The deployment and implementation solution also allow farmers to track and query
    the location of their livestock by tagging individual animal with RFID device,
    thereby preventing animal theft. Other areas, such as storage monitoring which
    includes water, fuel, and animals feeds can also be monitored, and the data can
    help the farmers to plan ahead and save cost. While several solutions have been
    provided in the area of monitoring, the adoption in small and medium scale farms
    are very much limited especially in developing countries due to lack of awareness
    and deployment cost. The potential to develop cost effective agricultural base
    IoT solutions is still a very open area. B. Tracking and Tracing IoT can also
    be applied in asset tracking to improve companies supply chain and logistics.
    IoT can provide data to enable agricultural companies to make better decisions,
    planning, intelligently connect with business partners, and save time and money.
    Information, such as location, asset identification can be tracked using RFID
    and cloud-based global positioning system (GPS) [8]. Tracking and tracing of agricultural
    product chain allows the consumer to know the complete history of the product,
    thereby improving the consumer’s trust on the product safety and health related
    issues. While tracking is the ability to capture, collect, and store data related
    to the supply chain from upstream to downstream, tracing allows the product to
    be distinguished from downstream to upstream. Tracking and tracing allows several
    data to be collected along the supply chain such that the consumer and other stakeholders
    are guaranteed on the origin, location, and life history of a product [71], [72].
    There are several factors that can be tracked which include the growing environment,
    production conditions, pest factors, management factors, storage conditions, transportation,
    and time to market. These factors can also pose direct or potential health risk
    to consumers. The significant factors which affects the growing environment are
    the soil, air, and water. The production conditions are influenced by the application
    of herbicides, fertilizers, pesticides. In addition, the type of feeds and vaccines
    administered to livestock can be tracked since they could directly cause health
    safety issues. Agricultural products can generally be affected by pest along the
    entire process, which could affect the quantity and quality of the product, tracking
    the products can help the farmers to improve the production and supply chain.
    A tracking and tracing systems should basically include: information input, storage,
    transfer, process, and output. The input information includes the data of the
    entire life cycle of the product, the geographical origin, the current position,
    destination, and the stakeholders involved in the entire supply chain [73]. The
    systems should also include memory to store the information over a period of time
    for research and development purposes. The information transfer refers to the
    process of unifying and standardizing the entire information. The tracking and
    tracing system should also be able to process the data collected and finally output
    it to everyone involved along the supply chain. The use of RFID in tracking from
    the production stage, processing, transportation, storage, distribution, sales
    and after sales services is highlighted in [74]. It provides the ability to collect,
    store, and analyze data over a long distance at a quick speed. C. Agricultural
    Machinery IoT-based agricultural machinery can help improve crop productivity
    and reduce grain losses. By proper mapping, use of GPS and global navigation satellite
    systems (GNSSs) the machinery can be operated in autopilot mode [52], [75]. The
    machines which include vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and robots can
    be remotely controlled based on the available information collected via the IoT
    system for precise and efficient application of resources to required farm areas
    [76]. The machinery can also collect data and such data can help farmers in mapping
    their field for planning programs, such as fertilizing, irrigation, nutrition
    [77]. For example, CLAAS, an agricultural machinery manufacturer has implemented
    IoT on their equipment, enabling their machinery to be operated in auto pilot
    mode [78]. Another solution is the Precisionhawk’s UAV sensors, which can provide
    farmers information, such as wind speed, air pressure, among other parameters
    [79]. The solution can also be used for imagery and mapping of agricultural plots.
    D. Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture can simply be defined as the collection
    of real-time data from farm variables2 and use of predictive analytics for smart
    decisions in order to maximize yields, minimize environmental impact, and reduce
    cost [80]. Precision agriculture relies on various technology, which include sensor
    nodes [81], [82], GPS and big DA to achieve improved crop yield. The smart decision
    achieved from the DA also results in less waste of resources, such as water in
    irrigation systems, fertilizer, pesticides, etc. Precision agriculture presents
    new challenges for researchers in the area of robotics, image processing, meteorological
    data sensing, etc. With the GPS and GNSS, farmers are able to locate precise location
    and map sites with several data variables, which are then used by variable rate
    technology to optimally distribute farm resources, such as seeding, spraying,
    and other services. Although precision agriculture technology can improve yield,
    it is essential to provide solutions that are easy to use by the farmers and also
    provide training to enable small and medium scale farmers benefit from the systems.
    E. Greenhouse Production Greenhouse also known as glasshouse technology is a technique,
    where plants are grown under controlled environment. It offers the benefit of
    growing any plant in any place at any time by providing suitable environmental
    conditions. Several studies have been carried out on the application of WSNs in
    greenhouse to monitor environmental conditions [83]–[85]. Recent works have shown
    how IoT can be applied to greenhouse in order to reduce human resource, save energy,
    increase efficiency in greenhouse-site monitoring, and direct connection of greenhouse
    farmers to customers [61], [66], [86]. SECTION IV. IoT and Data Analytics in Agriculture
    Accurate data analysis in farming plays a major role in improving the operational
    efficiency and increasing productivity. DA has been categorized into types based
    on requirement of IoT applications [87]. This includes real-time analytics, off-line
    analytics, memory-level analytics, business intelligence level analytics, and
    massive analytics [87]–[89]. The data consist of sensor data, audio, images, and
    video. Image processing has been extensively used in agriculture for various purposes
    ranging from detection of disease in leaf, stem, and fruit [90], quality of fruits
    [91], and weed detection and irrigation [76], [90], [92]–[94]. Recently, the combination
    of image processing and IoT in agriculture is being carried out to achieve higher
    quality produce and reduce crop failure. This involves the use of drones to capture
    aerial images at regular interval as well as monitoring of environmental factors
    using the IoT devices [76], [92], [94]. There are several DA methods which has
    been discussed in detail in [95]. The methods are categorized into classification,
    clustering, prediction, and association rule. The discussion of these methods
    is outside the scope of this paper. We discuss the importance of DA in agriculture
    and how DA can help in insurance, prediction, storage management, decision making,
    farm management, and precision farming. A. Prediction IoT provides big data that
    can be studied over time to estimate the present environmental conditions. The
    data collected across different types of networks sensors can be studied using
    DA and smart algorithm can be developed to predict the environmental changes and
    provide data driven solutions. Although IoT data can help in controlling various
    aspects of a farm, such as the irrigation systems, the data can also be used to
    predict and warn farmers against disease or extreme weather conditions, such as
    flood or drought [64]. For instance, in forestry, the sensors can be used to monitor
    fire outbreak or predict the region in a forest that provides high risk of fire
    outbreak. This information can help the firefighters to take preventive measures
    on the exact location. Other area of prediction includes early warning against
    natural disasters to improve emergency response [96]. B. Storage Management A
    large number of agricultural products are usually lost due to poor storage management
    system. While temperature, moisture and other environmental factors greatly affect
    the contamination of food products, insects, microorganism, rodent, etc. can affect
    the quality and quantity of the food products [97]. The use of IoT and DA in storage
    management systems can help to improve agricultural product storage [98]. Sensors
    can be deployed to monitor the storage facilities and environmental conditions.
    The data are sent to the cloud and analyzed. A self-automated decision system,
    which relies on the analyzed data can be deployed to adjust the environmental
    conditions. Moreover, a warning alert can be initiated to farmers when extreme
    conditions are reached or if pest are reported in the storage facility. In India,
    it is reported that about 35% to 40% of the fresh product are lost after harvesting
    due to several factors which includes spoilage or pest [97]. In [99], a cold storage
    management system is designed based on IoT technology, where the storage facility
    is operated at a controlled temperature. Although IoT can improve the agricultural
    storage facility, security should be embedded into such system to avoid product
    theft in case of power outages. C. Decision Decision making requires reliable
    information which can be obtained from sensors data. The large data obtained from
    sensor offers learning opportunities to improve decision making in constantly
    changing environmental conditions, such decision making can be over a short, medium,
    or long term. Automated decisions can be made from the IoT system when certain
    conditions are reached, therefore requiring less or no human interventions. Such
    automated decision could range from regulating the temperatures to the control
    of water supply from an irrigation system. For instance, in greenhouses the use
    of machine learning can help determine optimal conditions under which to grow
    a certain crop by observing the data acquired from sensors relating to nutrients,
    yield, growth, transpiration, color, taste, and retransplantation, light temperature
    pest levels and air quality. Policy making decision by government and all the
    stakeholders can also be enhanced by the amount of information obtained from DA,
    therefore it is important that the data is accurate, concise, complete, and in
    time. Several agricultural decision-making systems have been developed to enable
    farmers to make informed decision regarding their farms and livestock [100]. The
    DA provides decision on technical guidance to farmers, pests and diseases control
    and recommendation from remote expert guidance systems. D. Farm Management Integrated
    farm management system allows an entire farm to be monitored. Data are collected
    through a network of sensors including the on-body sensors in animals with a sole
    purpose of driving productivity. Three key factors which include risk management,
    cost, and productivity yield need to be managed with real time information and
    properly optimized to maximize productivity [13]. DA plays a major role to present
    the farmers and stake holders with large data that can be carefully studied to
    avoid unnecessary risk or implement preventive measures to improve productivity.
    DA also allow various farms to be connected and managed on a single platform,
    where information on scientific advances, production, marketing, farm management,
    recommendations and other related topics are disseminated to maximize productivity,
    yield, and revenue. E. Precise Application DA using measured data from sensors
    can enable precise application of chemicals and fertilizers to specific areas
    of the farm, this can improve the productivity while reducing the farming cost.
    Although precision farming systems have been deployed in farms in advanced countries,
    developing countries are beginning to adopt the technology especially in research
    farms [14]. However, the deployment cost, technology and awareness still limits
    the deployments of IoT-based precision farming systems in developing countries.
    In addition, most of the farms in developing countries are small scaled farms
    as such, most farmers do not see the need to apply such technology. Developing
    appropriate precision farming solutions for small farms still remains an open
    area for researcher and designers. Another advantage of DA in precision farming
    is its application in steering machinery using GPS and location data to precise
    locations in the farm thereby improving the farming efficiency when compared with
    human driven machines. This can save time, fuel and operational cost. F. Insurance
    Farmers are usually exposed to extreme weather conditions which could lead to
    poor harvest. However, with the implementation of IoT technology farmers can be
    insured with their crops and livestock. A network of sensors can be deployed,
    and monitoring can be achieved by remote unmanned stations. The data can be sent
    to the cloud and analyzed. The insurance policy can be embedded with a warning
    systems, where extreme weather conditions are predicted and the insured farmers
    are alerted by text messages. This can enable the farmers take precautionary approach
    to protect their farms. An added advantage of DA in insurance is the fact that
    the insurance companies have access to the data from the remote farms and can
    initiate an automated payout thought the IoT mobile payments systems when extreme
    conditions are observed. This can eliminate the need for lengthy claim process,
    where the insurance company needs to ascertain the extent of damage by visiting
    the farms. SECTION V. Benefits There are several benefits that can be derived
    from the use of IoT in agriculture. Some of the benefits have been mentioned in
    the discussion of application of IoT in Sections III and IV. However, we reiterate
    and summarize some of the benefits as follows. Community Farming: The use of IoT
    can help promote community farming especially in the rural areas. The IoT can
    be leveraged to promote services that allows the community to have a common data
    storage, share data and information, increase interaction between the farmers
    and agriculture experts [101]. Also, through the use of mobile apps and IoT facilities
    equipment can be shared within the community via free or paid services. Safety
    Control and Fraud Prevention: The challenge in the agriculture sector is not just
    limited to sufficient production but also the ability to ensure safe and nutritious
    food supply. There have been several reports in food fraud which includes adulteration,
    counterfeit, artificial enhancement [102]. This fraud poses health challenge and
    can have negative economic impact [103], [104]. Some of the components of food
    fraud discussed in [104] are product integrity, process integrity, people integrity,
    and data integrity can be addressed using IoT technology. IoT can be used to provide
    logistics traceability and qualitative traceability of food [105]. Competitive
    Advantages: The increase in demand for food and the use of innovative technology
    is expected to make the agriculture sector very competitive. Also, the enabling
    of data driven agriculture using IoT will open new direction in trading, monitoring,
    and marketing. The ability to lower costs, reduce wastage in application of farm
    inputs, such as fertilizer and pesticides increase productivity. The use of real-time
    data for decision making will provide the competitive advantage needed for farmers
    who adopt the IoT ecosystem. Wealth Creation and Distributions: The deployment
    of IoT will provide new business models, where the single farmers can avoid the
    exploitation of “middle men” and can be in direct relationship with the consumers
    [10] leading to higher profit. Cost Reduction and Wastage: One of the perceived
    advantages of IoT is the ability to monitor remotely devices and equipment [106].
    The application of IoT in agriculture will help to save time and money in inspecting
    large fields compared to personnel physically inspecting the field either via
    use of vehicles or walking. The ability to know when and where to apply pesticides
    or insecticides using IoT will reduce cost and wastage. Operational Efficiency:
    The operational efficiency not only relates to farmers but to decision makers
    related to agriculture sector, such as government and nongovernmental agencies.
    Data gathered from agriculture surveillance schemes via IoT can serve as a guide
    in agriculture interventions. Such interventions can be prevention of spread of
    diseases, veld fire outbreaks, compensation schemes and resource allocations.
    In addition, farmers can take advantage of IoT and DA to take accurate and timely
    decisions in terms of farm management and farm processes. The ability to automatically
    document health status of livestock or crop will provide efficient and effective
    diagnosis and prescription of medicine by veterinary or agriculture officer to
    farmers. This will help reduce loss. Also, with the use of IoT, supply chain of
    agri-food can be optimized. The use of the IoT in the supply chain will help to
    provide real time balancing between the demand and supply. Awareness: IoT is expected
    to drive low cost applications and access to wireless network services in the
    agriculture sector. To this end, information on markets, prices, services can
    be accessed via mobile apps. Also, government services and regulatory standard
    regarding different farm produce can be made readily available. In addition, consumers
    who are interested in organic products and fresh products can easily locate farmers
    or be alerted when fresh products are available. Asset Management: IoT will enable
    real time monitoring of farm assets and machinery against theft, replacement of
    parts, and for timely routine maintenance. SECTION VI. Open Issues and Key Challenges
    There are several challenges that are associated with deployment and application
    of IoT. Some of the challenges identified in the literature are security and privacy,
    data convergence and ownership, lack of interoperability, heterogeneity of IoT
    devices, uncertainty in business models [5], [107]. We discuss issues under three
    main headings which are business, technical, and sectoral issues. A. Business
    Issues The profit margin in the agriculture sector is very thin and as such there
    is the need to balance the tradeoff between the deployment of IoT enabling technology
    versus the potential profits. Hence, we discuss business issues related to the
    IoT deployment by considering cost and business models. 1) Cost: There are several
    cost associated with the deployment of IoT in agriculture which can be categorized
    into setup cost and running cost. The setup cost includes purchase of hardware
    (IoT devices, gateways, base station infrastructure). The running cost involves
    continuous subscription for use of centralized services or IoT platforms which
    provides data collection, management of IoT devices, sharing of information among
    other services. Other additional running cost are cost incurred from exchange
    of data between IoT devices, gateway and cloud server, energy, and maintenance.
    According to Turgut and Boloni [108] the success of IoT has to satisfy two conditions
    which are: 1) the customers are persuaded that the IoT devices provide a value
    that exceeds their physical and privacy costs and 2) the businesses involved in
    IoT will successfully make money. The first condition can be expressed as ( V
    s − C pri − C user h − C pay )>0 (1) View Source where V s is the perceived value
    of the user, C pri is the cost of loss of privacy, C user h cost of hardware and
    associated services and C pay is the payment for service charge and the second
    condition can be expressed as ( V info + R pay − C business h )>0 (2) View Source
    where V info is the value of information received, R pay is the direct payment
    received, and C business h is the business’s share of hardware and maintenance
    costs. From (2) while the value of information received is meant for provision
    of the services needed by the user, this can be commercially exploited by the
    service provider in the course of service provision. Although some of the IoT
    platform providers provide free subscription services with limited functionality,
    limited number of IoT devices that can be connected and limited amount of data
    that can saved. More functionality and services attract higher subscription fees.
    2) Business Models: Farmers would be interested in business models that supports
    revenue generation from the data accumulated from their farm using IoT technologies.
    Most of the existing IoT platforms service providers, provide free limited services
    and full services with different level of subscriptions. The data provided are
    exploited by the IoT service providers and this remains an area of contention
    by farmers for control and ownership of their data. 3) Lack of Adequate Knowledge:
    The lack of adequate knowledge of IoT and its application especially among farmers
    located in rural areas is a major factor slowing the adoption of IoT in agriculture.
    This is common in the developing countries where majority of the farmers are often
    found in the rural areas and are mostly uneducated. The farmer’s inability to
    use information could be a major barrier if human interventions are not available
    [12]. B. Technical Issues 1) Interference: The deployment of massive IoT devices
    for agricultural and other purposes will cause interference problems especially
    with the IoT devices using the unlicensed spectrum, such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Sigfox,
    and LoRa (see Table II). The interference caused can lead to loss of data and
    reduce the reliability of the IoT ecosystem. The technology to make IoT devices
    using the unlicensed spectrum interference proof will add to cost of the device.
    On the other hand, the use of IoT devices operating with licensed spectrum is
    expected to eliminate unnecessary interference. However, due to limited pilot
    assignment in the cellular band, the reuse of nonorthogonal multiple access scheme
    or frequency reuse can still cause interference amongst IoT devices using cellular
    licensed spectrum. 2) Security and Privacy: There are several security issues
    that needs to be addressed at different level of the IoT ecosystem. The lack of
    adequate security may lead to loss of data, bridge of privacy, and access to raw
    information about on-field parameters and other sensitive intellectual properties.
    This can compromise the competitive advantages of private farm owners. The IoT
    security and privacy issues have been discussed extensively in [106], [109], and
    [110]. According to the interview-based studies carried out by Asplund and Nadjm-Tehrani
    [106] on the attitudes and perception of IoT, security was considered a major
    obstacle in the deployment of IoT. There are several security issues that needs
    to be addressed at different level of the IoT ecosystem. In agriculture, the IoT
    devices are vulnerable to physical tampering, such as theft or attacks by predators
    and animals, change of physical address or link [110], [111]. In addition, for
    the IoT devices, it is difficult to implement complex and sophisticated algorithms
    due to limited memory, communication capabilities, and low energy consumption.
    The gateway can be prone to congestion attack, denial of service (DoS), and forwarding
    attacks. The security and position of location information and IoT enabled location-based
    service which are used for precision farming are exposed to attacks, such as device
    capture attack [109], [110], [112]. In the device capture attack, an attacker
    captures the IoT device and extracts cryptographic implementations and enjoy unrestricted
    access to the information stored in the device’s storage. Other higher communication
    layers can be vulnerable to DoS attacks, wireless signal jamming, and man in the
    middle attack [110]. In addition, the cloud servers can be prone to data tampering,
    unauthorized services which can affect automated processes in the farms. Other
    security treats that can affect the cloud infrastructure are session hijacking,
    cloud access control and database issues, hijacking attacks, logon abuse, and
    DoS [110]. 3) Choice of Technology: There are several IoT technologies that have
    been developed recently, some of which are still going through pilot test. The
    right choice of IoT technology is a big challenge because a lot of investment
    is required for deploying new technologies. Currently, it is difficult to tell
    which of the new IoT technologies will dominate the market. Many factors need
    to be considered, such as support for roaming, suitability of technology to small-scale,
    medium-scale and large-scale, suitability to different geographical location,
    soil types and climatic conditions. 4) Reliability: The IoT devices are expected
    to be deployed in out-door environment. This will expose the devices to harsh
    environmental conditions which may lead to degradation of deployed sensors with
    time as well as communication failures. The physical safety of the deployed IoT
    sensors and systems must be ensured in order to protect the costly equipment from
    severe weather conditions, such as flood and hurricanes. 5) Scalability: Billions
    of IoT devices are expected to be deployed in the agriculture sector. Existing
    gateways and protocols will need to support large number of IoT devices/nodes.
    For example, the Sigfox gateway can support up to 106, Ingenu 104, and LoRa 104
    nodes, respectively. This will require intelligent IoT management system for each
    node and identification numbers. 6) Localization: There are several factors that
    needs to be considered for deployment of IoT devices. Such factors include the
    ability for the IoT device to support place and play functionality, i.e., be placed
    anywhere and connected to the rest of the world with no (or minimal configuration
    or deploying additional devices, such as gateways) [113]. Other factors are the
    best position to place the IoT device that will provide adequate information and
    reliability without causing interference (or minimal interference). In addition,
    the ability to support IoT device roaming for nomadic IoT devices and deployment
    of static IoT devices in location without prior knowledge of the mobile IoT technology/infrastructure
    needs to be considered. 7) Optimization of Resources: Farmers need resources optimization
    mechanism to determine how many gateways, IoT devices, amount of transmitted data,
    size of cloud storage are needed in order to have a breakthrough in profit margins.
    This is particularly challenging due to different farm sizes and different type
    of sensors needed to monitor farm variables for specific crops or livestock. This
    will require development of complex algorithm and mathematical models to be able
    to determine optimal resource allocation while minimizing cost and maximizing
    agriculture produce and profits. C. Sectoral Issues 1) Regulatory Challenges:
    Regulation and legal frameworks regarding the control and ownership of farm data
    between farmers and data companies needs to be sorted out. The regulations may
    differ from countries to countries in terms of resource allocation (i.e., spectrum
    for cellular IoT), technical challenges, competition, data privacy, and security.
    Different regulations across regions or countries may affect the application of
    IoT in use cases, such as tracking and agri-food supply. 2) Interoperability:
    There are ongoing works on protocols and standards needed for billions of IoT
    devices to interoperate. This involves technical, syntactic, semantic, and organization
    interoperability [5], [9], [114]. The technical interoperability involves the
    development of protocols and infrastructure that enables the IoT devices to communicate
    [115]. It is usually associated with the hardware/software components of the IoT
    ecosystem. The syntactical interoperability is associated with data formats, such
    as extensible markup language (XML), java script object notation (JSON), comma
    separated variables, electronic data interchange as standard syntax for data sharing
    [5]. The semantic interoperability deals with the interpretation of contents exchanged
    between human. The organizational interoperability is the ability to effectively
    communicate and transfer data successfully across different infrastructure, geographic
    region and cultures. Thus, a key requirement here is that all systems provide
    export facilities or API access that return standard formats, typically XML or
    JSON, and where possible legacy systems are provided with appropriate interchange
    gateways. According to [116], interoperability can be achieved using three methods
    which are: 1) partnerships among product and service developers; 2) open and close
    standards, and 3) adaptors and mediator services. In order to achieve interoperability,
    groups, such as openconnectivity [117] are promoting interoperability in IoT.
    In addition, the use of adapter services, such as if this then that [118] that
    allows users to create powerful connections and chains of simple conditional statements
    are currently being used. It is important to note that some of these methods may
    not provide widely enabled interoperability among IoT devices due to scalability.
    More work is expected in promotion of open standards to achieve greater operability
    among billions of IoT devices and services. D. Summary The open issues and challenges
    discussed in this section can serve as a factor for the slow adoption of IoT in
    the agriculture sector if not well addressed. More reports are needed on the monetary
    benefits of adopting IoT in agriculture. The issues of privacy and security will
    continue to remain a top priority for farmers, although this is expected to change
    over time as people become use to IoT and its services. Also, as the cost of IoT
    devices and cost of data storage, processing, and transfer reduces with time small
    and medium scale farmers will be able to deploy the IoT systems. SECTION VII.
    Future Trends and Opportunities From our studies and review of current trends
    in the application of IoT in agriculture, we present the future trends based on
    the following areas: 1) technological innovations; 2) application scenarios; and
    3) business and marketability. A. Technological Innovation More and more IoT solutions
    will continue to emerge and this will introduce new and disruptive technologies
    especially in the agriculture sector. Some of the areas identified are discussed
    as follows. 1) Deployment of LPWA Technologies: The LPWA is expected to dominate
    the agriculture sector as this offers so many advantages, such as low power and
    long-range communication. The release of the 3GPP NB-IoT standard and adoption
    by many telco operators will attract many research interests in investigating
    the use of NB-IoT communication technologies. This will enable large-scale pilot
    test of IoT in agriculture [5]. 2) Universal Platform: The development of IoT
    platform for agriculture purpose will shift from just specific crops or livestock
    to a universal platform (also known as generic platform) that can support any
    kind of crop and livestock. This will allow a system that can be easily modified
    to support a variety of applications ranging from managing and monitoring of crops
    and livestock to selling of products to local stores and consumers. Such system
    will be free of any geographical and regional limitations and can serve as the
    enabler for many IoT in agriculture. 3) Security: The security of IoT device and
    end-to-end data security will continue to attract more research interest. More
    research work is needed in the development of IoT device that can support new
    security schemes, such as advanced signcryption algorithm [119]. The signcryption
    combines digital signature and data encryption to prevent eavesdropping and unauthorized
    modification on sensitive information. Security measures to prevent physical attackers
    and intruders from the IoT devices need to be investigated and new schemes developed.
    4) Spectral and Energy Efficiency: Different technologies, such as ultranarrowband
    channels (Sigfox and Telensa) and spread spectrum (LoRa and Ingenu) are adopted
    in order to achieve the LPWA requirements [120]. As more LPWA complaint solutions
    are being rolled out, new technologies that can support higher data, long distance
    coverage, high path-loss link budget, and extended battery life are required.
    Majority of the cellular NB-IoT systems currently support frequency bands which
    operates frequency division duplex modes. More work is expected in bands that
    operate the time division duplex modes. This will open up other research challenges,
    such as pilot contamination [121]. Although LPWA aims to achieve ten years battery
    life, energy efficient mechanism are still needed for IoT devices as the efficiency
    is highly dependent on the node usage [122]. There exist several algorithms that
    have been developed for energy efficiency in WSN, such as clustering and in-network
    processing algorithms [122]–[124]. Other energy efficient schemes for IoT, such
    as ability to predict the sleep interval of IoT devices-based upon their remaining
    battery level, their previous usage history, and quality of information required
    for a particular application as proposed in [125] can be further studied. The
    application of optimal wireless power transfer enabled IoT transceiver architectures,
    simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in IoT, energy harvesting
    IoT devices is expected to attract research interest. 5) Quality of Service: Existing
    study on the QoS of IoT shows that QoS is required in every layer of the IoT architecture
    [126], [127]. The ability to ensure that a device that needs to send critical
    data will be able to do so using IoT with any of the communication technology
    is still an open research area. The use of NB-IoT communication technology promises
    high QoS compared to LoRa [26]. More work needs to be done in providing mechanism
    that guarantees QoS throughout the different IoT network layers. 6) Artificial
    Intelligence and DA: More work is expected in the use of artificial intelligence
    to model crop growth and disease management based on farm data and climatic information.
    Example is the use of machine learning for recognition of disease from images
    uploaded via smartphones [128]. DA algorithms that can process large amount of
    data at a much faster rate compared to the IoT communication time are expected
    to be developed. 7) Privacy-Preservation: End-to-end privacy-preservation methods
    that allow the extraction of knowledge from data while preserving the privacy
    of individuals have been proposed to solve the issues relating to IoT data privacy
    violations [129]–[131]. Examples of the proposed methods designed to guarantee
    a certain level of privacy while maximizing the utility of the data have been
    classified based on data life-cycle phase at which the privacy-preservation is
    ensured [132]. The application of the proposed privacy-preservation methods and
    how it can further enhance the IoT penetration in the agriculture sector can be
    further researched. 8) Data Compression: As massive IoT devices are connected
    there will be need to develop advanced compressing and multiplexing techniques
    for exchange of data from hundred to thousands of sensors to a central location.
    This will be particularly needed for transmission of images and video data when
    NB-IoT cellular communication are employed. Multiplexing will also help in merging
    data from different farms to a single location providing backup, security and
    management from a single-point. 9) Real Time Monitoring: As hundreds of different
    types of sensors are to be deployed in the field for real time monitoring, a simple
    network management protocol must be devised to support communication between objects
    and server with less overhead possible. Current protocols are specially designed
    for network appliances and may cause heavy data traffic and overhead on the network
    as well as increase the power requirements for the IoT devices. B. Application
    Scenarios Currently, software platforms, IoT devices are being developed and research
    is ongoing on communication technologies that can deliver low cost IoT deployments.
    Most of the current work are on prototyping and testing based on small scale.
    Large-scale pilots are needed to evaluate the usability and usefulness of IoT
    technologies in agriculture [5]. Future work will see more of large-scale pilot
    in the entire supply chain and agri-food applications not only in the developed
    country but as well as developing countries in Asia and Africa. C. Business and
    Marketability 1) Cost Reduction: The optimized power consumption of the IoT devices,
    reduction in physical size, and massive production is expected to drop the cost
    of IoT solutions for agriculture. Future work will see development of cheaper
    sensors, research on combination of different deployment scenarios, exploring
    the use of combined licensed and unlicensed communication technology in order
    to minimize setup and operating cost. 2) Policies and Regulations: More work on
    policy enforcement and standardization in the use of IoT in agriculture are expected
    to be carried out. Involvement of government level or agriculture department must
    be ensured when working on policies and regulation regarding IoT in agriculture
    which may differ from region to region as discussed in Section VI-C. This will
    facilitate early adoption of IoT in agriculture. SECTION VIII. Conclusion An overview
    of IoT and DA in agriculture has been presented in this paper. Several areas related
    to the deployment of IoT in agriculture have been discussed in detail. The survey
    of literature shows that there are lots of work ongoing in development of IoT
    technology that can be used to increase operational efficiency and productivity
    of plant and livestock. The benefits of IoT and DA, and open challenges have been
    identified and discussed in this paper. IoT is expected to offer several benefits
    to the agriculture sector. However, there are still a number of issues to be addressed
    to make it affordable for small and medium-scale farmers. The key issues are security
    and cost. It is expected that as competition increases in the agriculture sector
    and favorable polices are being implemented the adoption rate of IoT in agriculture
    will increase accordingly. One major area that is likely to draw lot of research
    attention is the deployment of LPWA communication technology for agriculture purposes.
    The NB-IoT is expected to stand out among the LPWA technologies. This is because
    of the 3GPP open standard and adoption by the telco companies. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    chosen to parameterize and test the new FAO AquaCrop model is maize (Zea mays
    L.). Working mainly with data sets from 6 yr of maize field experiments at Davis,
    CA, plus another 4 yr of Davis maize canopy data, a set of conservative (nearly
    constant) parameters of AquaCrop, presumably applicable to widely different conditions
    and not specific to a given crop cultivar, was evaluated by test simulations,
    and used to simulate the 6 yr of Davis data. The treatment variable was irrigation—withholding
    water after planting continuously, only up to tasseling, from tasseling onward,
    or intermittently, and with full irrigation (FI) as the control. From year to
    year, plant density (7–11.9 plants m−2), planting date (14 May−15 June), cultivar
    (a total of four), and atmospheric evaporative demand varied. The conservative
    parameters included: canopy growth and canopy decline coefficient (CDC); crop
    coefficient for transpiration (Tr) at full canopy; normalized water productivity
    for biomass (WP∗); soil water depletion thresholds for the inhibition leaf growth
    and of stomatal conductance, and for the acceleration of canopy senescence; reference
    harvest index (HIo); and coefficients for adjusting harvest index (HI) in relation
    to inhibition of leaf growth and of stomatal conductance. With all 19 parameters
    held constant, AquaCrop simulated the final aboveground biomass within 10% of
    the measured value for at least 8 of the 13 treatments (6 yr of experiments) and
    also the grain yield for at least five of the cases. In at least four of the cases,
    the simulated results were within 5% of the measured for biomass as well as for
    grain yield. The largest deviation between the simulated and measured values was
    22% for biomass, and 24% for grain yield. Importantly, the simulated pattern of
    canopy progression and biomass accumulation over time were close to those measured,
    with Willmott''s index of agreement (d) for 11 of the 13 cases being ≥0.98 for
    canopy cover (CC), and ≥0.97 for biomass. Accelerated senescence of canopy due
    to water stress, however, proved to be difficult to simulate accurately; of the
    six cases, the index of agreement for the worst one was 0.957 for canopy and 0.915
    for biomass. Possible reasons for the discrepancies between the simulated and
    measured results include simplifications in the model and inaccuracies in measurements.
    The usefulness of AquaCrop with well-calibrated conservative parameters in assessing
    water use efficiency (WUE) of a crops under different conditions and in devising
    strategies to improve WUE is discussed. Abbreviations CC canopy cover CDC canopy

    productivity (for biomass) WUE water use efficiency Water has always been the
    main factor limiting crop production in much of the world where rainfall is not
    ample. With the recent increases in demand of agricultural commodities and the
    ensuing food crisis in poor developing countries, the need to improve the efficiency
    of water use in crop production is never more apparent. As a part of its efforts
    toward this goal, the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations
    developed a crop simulation model named AquaCrop. The model strikes a balance
    between accuracy, simplicity, robustness, and ease of use, and is aimed at practical
    end users such as extension specialists, water managers, personnel of irrigation
    organizations, and economists and policy specialists who use simple models for
    planning and senerio analysis. The justifications for yet another crop simulation
    model is given by Steduto et al. (2009) As the name indicates, the focus of AquaCrop
    is on water as the determinant of crop productivity. In fact, the model converts
    daily Tr directly to daily biomass production, using daily reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) and normalized WP, a conservative (virtually constant) parameter specific
    to a crop species. In the model, the effects of water deficit, quantified as fractional
    depletion of soil water relative to the water-holding capacity of the root zone,
    are manifested through four stress response functions. These are: inhibition of
    foliage canopy growth, inhibition of stomatal conductance, acceleration of canopy
    senescence, and changes in HI. More information on the conceptual basis of the
    model and its structure and algorithm are found in the companion papers (Steduto
    et al., 2009; Raes et al., 2009). AquaCrop is a general model, in that it is meant
    for a wide range of herbaceous crops, including forage, vegetable, grain, fruit,
    oil, and root and tuber crops. The goal of the FAO project is to calibrate AquaCrop
    for each important crop species with respect to all its parameters that are applicable
    across a wide range of conditions regardless of location, and hopefully, also
    not differ among most of the cultivars. The location- and cultivar-dependent parameters,
    as well as inputs such as weather data, irrigation schedule, and planting density,
    are to be supplied by the user, although default values are provided in most cases.
    When well calibrated for a crop, the model is expected to be an effective tool
    even for novice users in aiding the development of water management strategies
    to improve production and save water. During the early phase of model development,
    it was decided that the initial efforts of parameterization should focus on one
    crop first. The crop chosen is maize, one of the most extensively studied in the
    world. Being highly determinant, maize also has the advantage of being relatively
    simple. Maize has been the focus of modeling for decades. One widely known maize
    model is CERES (Jones and Kiniry, 1986), which has been inserted in the DSSAT
    (Jones et al., 2003) and APSIM (Keating et al., 2003) platforms. These models
    were designed to support management decisions and to development management strategies,
    though their calibration parameters are quite demanding. Detailed information
    such as grain number per stem or cob and the rate of grain filling in milligrams
    per day, or the phyllocron interval in thermal time are required. By comparison,
    AquaCrop is directed more at practical end-users who are not research scientists,
    by automatically providing the conservative parameters in the model. The objective
    of this study is to calibrate AquaCrop for maize in terms of the conservative
    parameters and test how the model performs with these parameters held constant.
    The model was first parameterized and tested for maize with extensive data sets
    collected in different field experiments at Davis, CA, then the preliminarily
    parameterized model was tested with data sets from Spain, Texas, and Florida.
    The climate of the latter two locations and soil in Florida are in sharp contrast
    to that of Davis. The parameters were accordingly further adjusted and used in
    the simulations reported here for the Davis data. The simulation results using
    the same values of the set of conservative parameters for the Spain, Texas, and
    Florida data are reported in Heng et al. (2009) Careful and extensive calibration
    of the conservative parameters, so far only partially achieved for maize, cannot
    be done by the FAO group alone for all important crop species, and thus requires
    collaboration with interested researchers worldwide. At this early stage, collaborative
    work has yielded preliminary calibration for some crops, including cotton (Gossypium
    hirsutum L.) (Farahani et al., 2009) and Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) (Geerts
    et al., 2009), using single location data sets. Data from other locations, of
    diverse climate and soil conditions, are needed to do more complete calibrations
    for these crops. METHODS AND DATA Measured Data and Site Characteristics Six sets
    of maize data reported in three Ph.D. dissertations (Acevedo, 1975; Steduto, 1993;
    Rojas-Lara 1999), obtained in six field experiments conducted in different years
    and with different objectives and different irrigation treatments, were used to
    calibrate and test AquaCrop. All the experiments were performed at the farm of
    the Department of Land, Air and Water Resources, University of California, Davis
    (38°32′30″ N, 121°46′ 39″ W, 18.3 m above sea level). The soil of the experimental
    areas is mostly the Yolo series, ranging in texture from loam to silt loam, very
    deep in profile and high in water holding capacity, with a layer of coarser texture
    about 0.3 m thick lying roughly 1.8 m below the surface. Field capacity (FC) of
    the loam and the coarse layer is determined to be, respectively, 33 and 20%, and
    the permanent wilting point (PWP), 13.8 and 10%, all on a volume basis (Appendix
    2 and Fig. 5–15 of Acevedo, 1975). In the simulations, the depth and thickness
    of the coarser layer were assumed to be as stated above, although in reality they
    varied to some extent from plot to plot and with changes in location on the farm
    each year. The climate is Mediterranean, with rainfall confined mostly to the
    period from late October to early May, and totaling 473 mm per year as an average
    for the past 25 yr. Most of the days of the experimental periods were sunny, with
    solar radiation of approximately 28 to 32 MJ m−2 d−1 for the first half of the
    period and falling gradually to 18 to 20 MJ m−2 d−1 near crop maturity. Generally
    the temperature regime was warm during the growing season, with large differences
    between the daily maximum and minimum air temperature. Mean daily vapor pressure
    deficit was normally high, in the 1.2 to 1.8 kPa range. The ETo was normally in
    the 6 to 7.5 mm d−1 range, but can rise to 9 or 10 mm d−1 on days of high wind
    and large scale advection from dry upwind area. Daily weather data, required as
    input for the simulation, were taken from nearby weather stations on the farm.
    Since mid 1982, a CIMIS (California Irrigation Management Information System)
    automated weather station was established on the farm, and its recorded data were
    downloaded from (http://wwwcimis.water.ca.gov; verified 18 Feb. 2009) and used
    for the 1989 and later simulations. For 1974, a weather station on the farm measured
    the required weather parameters. Direct downloading, however, was only possible
    for air temperature, rainfall, and solar radiation, from the integrated pest management
    website at Davis (http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/calludt.cgi/PCSTATIONDATA?STN=Davis_South-01.P0060&SCALE=Daily;
    verified 18 Feb. 2009). The humidity (dewpoint temperature) and wind data for
    1974 were taken from Stewart et al. (1977) AquaCrop uses daily maximum and minimum
    air temperature to calculate growing degree days, GDD (Raes et al., 2009). The
    ETo for each day of the experiments was calculated by the procedure recommended
    for AquaCrop, using the FAO Penman–Monteith equation as described in Allen et
    al. (1998), with data of daily solar radiation, minimum and maximum temperature,
    wind run, and maximum and minimum relative humidity. It is important to standardize
    this calculation because in AquaCrop, crop biomass is derived from Tr, which is
    simulated with ETo as input data. Hence, small differences in the ETo calculated
    by different procedures can cumulate and have substantial impact on the simulated
    final biomass and yield. The 6 yr of experiments involved four maize cultivars,
    obtained from commercial suppliers as suitable for Northern California. The change
    in cultivars over the years was the result of the seed company improving its material
    for the location. In the simulations it was assumed that the cultivars differed
    only in phenology, that is, time to flower, senescence and maximum rooting depth,
    and physiological maturity; however, the same stress response functions were used
    regardless of the cultivar or year of study. In all cases, plants were grown on
    beds in rows spaced 76 cm apart, and N (200 or 210 kg N ha−1) was applied to the
    soil before planting and disked in. This N level is considered to be optimum or
    slightly above for maize without water stress on the Yolo soil. Previous studies
    at the site have shown that other nutrients were ample in this fertile soil and
    no other fertilizers were required. With one exception, the crop was irrigated
    by either sprinkler or furrow 1 to 3 d after planting to ensure a good stand.
    Control treatment was irrigated at regular intervals to ensure high production
    and designated as FI, and stress treatments were either not irrigated at all afterward
    and had to rely almost completely on water stored in the soil, or were irrigated
    during a chosen period or at selected times. After emergence, the FI treatment
    was irrigated by furrow. For the stress treatments, the limited water was applied
    by sprinklers in 1994 and 1995, and by furrow in 1974, 1998, and 1999. Plants
    were sampled for leaf area and aboveground biomass from three or four replicated
    areas, as were soil water content (SWC) measurements. Decades of studies have
    shown that annual crops, when planted in spring on this soil with water content
    close to FC, would produce a reasonable grain yield without irrigation and almost
    no rain during the growing season, albeit at a substantially reduced level compared
    with the same crop under irrigation. Some uncertainties were encountered in measured
    biomass and yield for the studies of 1994 to 1996. This was suggested by the fact
    that the last biomass sample was smaller than the previous biomass sample taken
    10 to 13 d before, in all 3 yr. The yields were taken from Rojas-Lara (1999, Table
    1), and final biomass was calculated from the yield and HI given in the same table.
    Examination of the sequentially sampled biomass vs. time plots in Fig. 14 of Rojas-Lara
    revealed, however, that the final biomass could be too low due to possible loss
    of dried plant material before the final harvest. To allow for this possibility,
    the final biomass was also taken as the peak biomass for each treatment and presented
    as a second measured value, enclosed in parentheses, in Table 4 A second value
    for yield was calculated from the second biomass and also presented in parentheses

    Procedure for Parameter Valuation The objective being to calibrate AquaCrop for
    a given crop species (specifically for maize) for general use under various climate
    and soil conditions worldwide, our approach to calibrate and test the model was
    somewhat different from the common procedure. Instead of calibrating the model
    with 1 or 2 yr of measured data and then testing the calibrated model with data
    measured in other years, we tried different values of the assumed conservative
    parameters in the simulation of six or more years of Davis data. The simulations
    were mainly focused on the progression of green CC and of aboveground biomass
    with time, with some attention to evapotranspiration (ET). The likely conservative
    parameters were chosen based on our understanding of crop growth, development
    and responses, and adaptation to water deficits. By adjusting the parameters repeatedly
    after comparing the simulated with the measured results for all treatments of
    the different years, we arrived at a set of values for the conservative parameters
    which appear to be valid for most of the situation simulated. These values of
    the parameters were then used to simulate data sets from several locations in
    other parts of the world quite different in conditions from those in Davis (see
    Heng et al., 2009), and adjusted further. The conservative parameters described
    below and used for the maize simulations were all derived this way, and the model
    used is AquaCrop prototype v. 2.4. In addition to the conservative parameters,
    other required input information for the simulation runs are more particular and
    cannot be broadly applied. They include weather and soil information which are
    location- and time-dependant, plant density and irrigation which are management-specific,
    as well as the specifics of the chosen crop cultivar. For brevity, these input
    parameters are referred to as user-specific, and their valuations are described
    in the section after this one. Regarding cultivar specificity, our approach was
    to assume that the cultivars grown in a given location are locally adapted and
    their main differences are in phenology and determinancy. There are almost certainly
    other differences, especially when a cultivar is specially bred to be more tolerant
    for certain stresses. Nonetheless, these differences are usually small and we
    expect the conservative crop parameters to be widely applicable without calibration
    for each cultivar. Normalized Water Productivity As emphasized in Steduto et al.
    (2009), central to AquaCrop is the calculation of daily biomass production from
    simulated daily Tr using normalized water productivity (WP∗) and daily ETo Water
    productivity (WP) normalized for evaporative demand was derived by regressing
    biomass sampled periodically from the crop against normalized ET (Steduto et al.,
    2007) summed from emergence to the time of each biomass sampling. Five years of
    Davis maize data (1989, 1990, 1994, 1995, and 1996) were used for this purpose.
    In 1989 and 1990, cumulative ET was calculated as the sum of daily ET measured
    by the Bowen ratio/energy balance technique (Steduto and Hsiao, 1998), and in
    1994 to 1996 ET accumulated over a given interval was calculated by soil water
    balance from neutron probe data. Normalization of ET by ETo was done using Eq.
    13 of Steduto et al. (2007) Plots of biomass vs. normalized ET exhibited a portion
    of rising slope at the beginning followed by a straight line portion of near constant
    slope, and then ending with the slope being reduced for one to several data points
    sampled near the end of the crop life cycle. The middle portion of the plot, encompassing
    the data points collected from the time when the crop canopy covered more than
    about 70% of the ground to the time when about one fourth of the maximum leaf
    area index (LAI) has senesced, were fitted with a linear equation. The slope of
    this linear regression was taken to be the WP normalized for evaporative demand.
    A medium value of WP for the 5 yr was chosen for the preliminary trial runs of
    the model. After testing with the 6 yr of Davis data and non-Davis data as described
    earlier, WP was then normalized also for atmospheric CO2 concentration according
    to the procedure of Steduto et al. (2007), using the annual mean CO2 concentration
    measured at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, for each of the years. The year 2000,
    with its mean CO2 concentration of 369.5 ppm, is chosen as the reference year
    for CO2 The WP normalized for both evaporative demand and atmospheric CO2, denoted
    by WP∗, is given in Table 1 for the year 2000. The WP∗ used in the final simulations,
    differing among the six experimental years because of the changes in atmospheric
    CO2, are listed in Table 2 Table 2. Normalized water productivity (WP∗), cultivar
    and planting date, and some crop characteristics of maize in 6 yr of experiments
    in Davis, CA. For ‘DK 591’ (1994 to 1996), the start of canopy senescence and
    the time of physiological maturity, defined in GDD (growing degree days), were
    the same for the 3 yr. The days after planting (DAP) listed were the result of
    automatic conversion by AquaCrop from GDD to calendar time. Except for 1974, maximum
    rooting depth was not based on data of each year but estimated. Year WP∗ Cultivar

    feature of AquaCrop (Steduto et al., 2009) is the simulation of green crop CC
    instead of leaf area. AquaCrop runs by first calculating the crop canopy development
    with time on emergence with the conservative parameters of initial canopy cover
    per seedling (cco) (initial CC = plant density × cco), canopy growth coefficient
    (CGC), and maximum canopy cover (CCx). About 10 yr of maize canopy data obtained
    for nonstress conditions in Davis were analyzed and by trial and error, a common
    CGC in calendar time was obtained. After parameterizing the model in the calendar
    time mode, the canopy development for the 6 yr of data analyzed here were simulated
    in the GDD mode and additional adjustments were made to arrive at the CGC in terms
    of GDD. By taking overhead photographs of seedlings with the optical plane of
    the camera parallel to the ground surface a few days after emergence, an approximate
    cco was first estimated. That estimation was then refined by fitting the canopy
    growth equation to the measured CC over the first half of the canopy development
    phase. The CCx was determined as a function of plant density by pooling the CCx
    of these 10 yr, each with somewhat different plant density, with CCx converted
    from the maximum green leaf LAI found in the literature for different maize plant
    densities. Much of the data in the literature report green LAI but not CC. An
    empirical relationship between CC and LAI of maize was obtained by regression,
    plus slight adjustments at the extreme low and high end of CC values. The equation
    is (1) which gives results closely resembles that obtained with the equation developed
    by Ritchie (1975) for application to generic crops, with the C of Ritchie''s equation
    set at 0.7. Of the 6 yr of experimental data, standard deviations (SD) for LAI
    (means of replicates) were given except for 1974. These were converted to standard
    deviations for CC using the following procedures. First, values of (LAI + SD)
    and (LAI − SD) were calculated and converted respectively to (CC + SD) and (CC
    – SD) using Eq. [1] Then SD for CC was calculated as the difference between the
    two latter quantities in parentheses divided by two. As the crop matures and the
    green canopy begins to senesce, the decline in CC with time is simulated using
    the CDC. During the senescence phase, there is no simple way to measure CC since
    green and yellow leaves intermingle and many leaves can be partly green and partly
    yellow. The CC during this period was calculated from LAI using the aforementioned
    equation. By trial-and-error simulations in the calendar mode, a CDC yielding
    a good fit to the calculated CC time course was arrived at for the fully irrigated
    treatment of each year. These CDC were then expressed in terms of GDD by setting
    the crop file of AquaCrop to run in the GDD mode. After some adjustments in its
    value, a CDC in terms of GDD was arrived at that simulated fairly well the large
    majority of the fully irrigated treatment of different years. The same CDC was
    used in the simulation of water stress treatments, with the stress effect modulated
    by stress coefficients (Ks) for senescence, as given by Steduto et al. (2009)
    Water Stress Response Parameters To calibrate the threshold p (fractional available
    soil water depletion) values for the inhibition of leaf growth and stomatal conductance,
    and for the acceleration of canopy senescence, initial settings were chosen based
    on the known relative sensitivity of these three processes to water stress (Hsiao,
    1973; Bradford and Hsiao, 1982), as discussed in Steduto et al. (2009) Following
    the general valuation procedure and analogous to that described for the CGC and
    CDC calibration, the settings for the three types of water stress thresholds and
    the shape of their Ks response curves were found that permitted fair simulations
    of the large majority of the water stress situations tested. Harvest Index and
    Water Stress Effects Based on literature and our data, the reference HI was taken
    as 48%. Water stress can either enhance or reduce HI as discussed elsewhere (Hsiao,
    1993b; Hsiao et al., 2007; Steduto et al., 2009), depending on the determinancy
    of the crop, and stress timing and severity. The coefficient linking the positive
    effect of leaf growth inhibition on HI was assumed to be 7.0, and the coefficient
    linking the negative effect of stomatal closure on HI was assumed to be 3.0. The
    resultant modulation of HI was small or minimal. The HI data on hand were not
    definitive enough to test the assigned values critically. It is important to note
    that often the reduction in HI under water stress is largely due to a shortening
    of CC duration, reducing the grain filling period and stopping the increase in
    HI during yield formation prematurely, and stomatal closure plays only a minor
    role. Growing Degree Day To calculate GDD for maize, based on both published and
    our data, 8°C was chosen as the base temperature, and 30°C, as the upper temperature,
    above which there is no additional benefit for the crop development or growth.
    The temperature parameters were tested minimally because most of the measured
    data used in this study and that of Heng et al. (2009) were obtained under temperature
    regimes favorable for maize. The calibrated and assumed conservative parameters
    for maize are given in Table 1 Also included but as a separate group are parameters
    assumed to be conservative but may turn out to be cultivar-specific on further
    examination. It is important to realize that the conservative parameters may need
    to be adjusted to a limited degree as the model is tested further against additional
    data sets, and also as the model structure or algorithm is improved in future
    versions. Simulation Inputs and User-Specific Parameters As elaborated on in Raes
    et al. (2009), AquaCrop uses inputs from four files for simulation: Climate file,
    Crop file, Soil file, and Management file. The climate file is user-specific and
    consists of three subfiles: (i) minimum and maximum air temperature, (ii) ETo,
    and (iii) rainfall, all daily values. The crop file contains both conservative
    and user-specific items, some of the latter are cultivar-specific. The same conservative
    crop parameters (Table 1) are used in all simulations, regardless of the year.
    The user-specific parameters and other input data are described herein. Emergence
    Time Emergence time is provided by the user because key factors affecting emergence
    time, such as how well the seed bed is prepared, planting depth, and soil water
    conditions, are determined by circumstances. The date of 90% emergence is chosen
    as the starting time (first day of appearance) of the crop canopy. At this time,
    a first order kinetic equation is applied by AquaCrop to calculate the expansion
    of CC with time, for the first half of canopy development curve, when canopy expansion
    rate is proportional to the existing CC (Steduto et al., 2009). This is based
    on the assumption that when the canopy is autotrophic, that is, its growth is
    self-supporting and not dependent on stored reserve in the seeds, and conditions
    are favorable, the rate of growth of a plant''s canopy is proportional to the
    photosynthesis of the plant which is proportional to it canopy size. For the seedling
    population with heterogeneous emergence time, it is assumed that by the time when
    90% of the seedlings have emerged, the average seedling is autotrophic. Rooting
    Depth Rooting depth of a crop is site-specific since soil physical (mechanical
    impedance, soil temperature) and chemical characteristics can affect root deepening
    rate. Past studies in Davis at the same experimental site have shown that maize
    roots continue to deepen pass the time of anthesis (Hsiao and Xu, 2000) and reached
    a depth of about 2.8 m at the end of the season. For the simulations, the time
    for roots to reaching the maximum depth was assumed to be the same as the start
    of canopy senescence under nonstress conditions. A shape factor (see Raes et al.,
    2009) of 1.2 was used for the root deepening vs. time curve. This provides a slightly
    faster deepening rate early in the life cycle, slowing to a nearly constant rate
    in the later part. The average deepening rate was in the 2.4 to 2.5 cm d−1 range,
    consistent with previously measured values (Acevedo, 1975). Maximum rooting depth
    was assumed to be 2.6 m for the cultivar with the shortest life cycle (1974),
    and 2.8 m for the other cultivars with longer life cycles. Canopy Senescence and
    Physiological Maturity Conceptually, the starting time of canopy senescence is
    closely linked with life cycle duration (emergence to maturity) of the cultivar,
    and should be a constant for favorable conditions in a given temperature regime.
    Practically, it is difficult to know the life cycle duration of a cultivar from
    information supplied by the seed company. Either the life cycle duration is assigned
    to a general category or the degree day unit used to define the life duration
    is not designed specifically for the particular crop species. It was then necessary
    to base these parameters on experimental data. Physiological maturity was assumed
    to be at the time when CC declined to zero, extrapolated from the LAI-derived
    CC data, and senescence starting time was assumed to be the time when CC declined
    to below a value corresponding to a LAI of 4.0. Of the 6 yr of Davis data, the
    same cultivar was studied in 3 yr (1994–1996). The life cycle duration and time
    to senescence were calculated for each of the 3 yr in GDD and the mean values
    were used for simulation in each of the 3 yr. The cultivar studied each year,
    date of planting, estimated 90% emergence, start of canopy senescence, and physiological
    maturity in calendar time are given in Table 2 although the simulations were run
    in GDD. Also given are the plant density and WP∗ pertinent for each year. Initial
    Soil Water Content and Irrigation As all six experiments were conducted for purposes
    other than testing or validation of crop productivity models, not all the required
    input data were collected, and thus some had to be estimated. For the water deficit
    treatments, it was necessary to estimate the water content of the soil profile
    at planting, based on the qualitative and general description given and the soil
    moisture profiles quantified with neutron probes 1 to 2 wk after emergence. Soil
    water lost through ET from planting time to the first soil water profile measurement
    was estimated by simulation with AquaCrop. Another critical estimation was the
    amount of water applied at each irrigation for the water stress treatments. The
    initial estimate was based on neutron probe measured SWC and the estimated ET
    for the time lapse between the probe reading and the water application, combined
    with knowledge through experience of the soil water infiltration characteristics
    and of furrow application system. In the case of sprinkler irrigation (years 1994
    and 1995), the initial estimates were based on application rate calculated from
    nozzle spacing and size and total application time. The extent of uncertainty
    in these initial estimates were also assessed, providing a permissible range of
    the amount of applied water each time. The final estimated water applications
    used to run the simulations, each constrained within its own permissible range,
    were arrived at by trial and error. The estimated initial SWC and the recorded
    significant rainfall event for each year, and for the water stress treatments
    the irrigation timing and estimated amounts, are summarized in Table 3 Table 3.

    m for the other years. Data Analysis Two statistical measures of the performance
    of the model were calculated, comparing simulation results with measured data.
    One is root mean square errors (RMSE): where Si and Mi are the simulated and measured
    values, respectively, and n is the number of observations. The unit for RMSE is
    the same as that for Si and Mi; and a model''s fit improves as RMSE approaches
    zero. The other is the index of agreement (d) of Willmott (1982): where is the
    mean of the n measured values. The value of d ranges from –∞ to 1.0; and the model''s
    fit improves as d approaches unity. Both analyses were applied to the sequential
    data points collected over the season for a given treatment, that is, n is the
    number of measurements taken of the same treatment on different dates over the
    season. RESULTS As a summary of the outcome of the simulations, the simulated
    final biomass and grain yield of the different irrigation treatments are compared
    with the measured values for the 6 yr of studies in Table 4, with the deviation
    of the simulated value from the measured value expressed as a percentage of the
    measured value. For the years 1994 to 1996, there are alternative estimates of
    measured final biomass and grain yield (see Measured Data and Site Characteristics),
    enclosed in parentheses in Table 4, reflecting the uncertainties in the measured
    data. Focusing only on the values without the parentheses, it is seen that when
    simulated final biomass is compared with the measured, 8 out of the 13 values
    were within 10% of the measured values, with 5 of the 13 within 5%, and 5 out
    of the 13 deviating more than 10%, with the largest deviation of 22%. As for grain
    yields, the simulated values deviated from the measured without the parentheses
    by less than 10% in 5 of the 13 comparisons, with 4 being less than 5%, and 8
    being more than 10%, with the largest deviation of 23%. The greater deviations
    for the simulated yield compared with the simulated biomass are not surprising
    when considering the difficulties of simulating the final HI. It is particularly
    difficult to simulate HI for terminal drought conditions where accelerated canopy
    senescence often has major impact. Table 4. Simulated compared with measured values

    amount of water applied at each irrigation was not measured, but rather estimated
    with the objective of maximizing the agreement between the measured and the simulated
    values. Conversely, the estimates were bound each within its own permissible range,
    as explained in the section Initial Soil Water Content and Irrigation AquaCrop
    provides an assortment of output day-by-day from each simulation, including daily
    soil E and crop Tr, green CC, and biomass production rate and cumulative biomass.
    For a more detailed look than that of results given in Table 4 we focus on the
    progression of green CC and cumulative biomass with time over the lifecycle of
    the crop. These results are presented graphically in chronological order, starting
    with the 1974 experiment. The RMSE and index of agreement (d) for the simulated
    vs. measured values of CC and biomass over the life cycle are given in Table 5

    PI 13.59 0.957 4.80 0.915 In 1974 there were three treatments: rainfed with no
    irrigation (NI); early dry (ED) with no irrigation until 55 days after planting
    (DAP), at the very beginning of tasseling, and irrigated at intervals of 7 to
    10 d thereafter; and regularly (fully) irrigated control (FI). The simulated and
    measured CC, shown in Fig. 1, are close, with d varying between 0.983 to 0.991
    for the three treatments. It is seen (Fig. 1a, 1b, 1c) that AquaCrop simulated
    the developing phase of the canopies well, although the inhibitory effect of mild
    water deficit on canopy growth was overestimated, with the simulated CC lagging
    behind the measured by a few days in the NI and ED treatments. The simulated canopy
    decline was slightly steeper than the measured for FI and ED, but for NI the simulated
    pattern matched the measured, although canopy size was slightly underestimated
    all along. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer Simulated as compared with measured
    canopy cover progression and biomass accumulation of maize of the three watering
    treatments of 1974. Measured data, from Acevedo (1975), are means of four replicated
    plots but standard deviation is not available. Biomass accumulation in 1974 was
    underestimated in the simulation for much of the season but caught up with the
    measured value at the end of the season for the ED (Fig. 1e, d = 0.987) and NI
    (Fig. 1f, d = 0.991) treatment. The underestimation is particularly evident for
    the FI treatment (Fig. 1d, d = 0.970). The underestimation of biomass when CC
    matches the measured values points to the possibility of either the WP∗ used as
    input is too low or Tr is underestimated because the crop coefficient for Tr (1.03)
    is too low or because inhibition of stomata by water stress is overestimated.
    The last possibility is unlikely, however, because the underestimation of biomass
    seems to be more marked for the FI treatment. Note that the early dry treatment
    (Fig. 1e) produced almost as much biomass and grain as the fully irrigated treatment
    (Fig. 1d). This is the result of the Yolo soil being deep and high in water holding
    capacity, and the soil and thermal climate allow fast root deepening early in
    the season to exploit stored soil water. AquaCrop seems to have simulated this
    situation well. Fifteen years after testing the effects of early dry conditions
    on maize, experiments were conducted with late dry (LD) conditions, in 1989 and
    1990. The LD treatment was irrigated regularly until just before tasseling, but
    no water was applied subsequently. The simulated CC as compared with the measured
    are depicted in Fig. 2 and 3 For the 1989 FI (Fig. 2a), 1990 FI (Fig. 3a), and
    LD (Fig. 3b) treatments, the simulated and measured CC over time were close, with
    d values of 0.990, 0.994, and 0.994, respectively. The exception was the 1989
    LD treatment (d = 0.986), where the simulation (Fig. 2b) shows a stoppage of the
    accelerated canopy senescence (caused by water stress) for several days by a rain
    of 34 mm on 114 DAP (see Table 3), while the measured data do not suggest such
    a stoppage. This aspect of AquaCrop appears to require further development. Figure

    is SD of the last data point in (a), which should be very large but is unknown
    because it could not be calculated due to the exponential nature of Eq. [1] Figure
    3 Open in figure viewer Simulated as compared with measured canopy cover progression
    and biomass accumulation of maize of the two watering treatments of 1990. Standard
    deviations, when larger than the symbol, are represented by bars. The simulated
    biomass accumulation curves matched those measured for both treatments of 1990
    (Fig. 3c and 3d), with d = 0.999 and 0.997. However, the simulated results for
    1989 were off the mark for both treatments (d = 0.930 and 0.975) toward the end
    of the season (Fig. 2c). The data for the two treatments were plotted together
    because the measured as well as the simulated biomass showed very small differences
    between the LD and FI treatments, which would be hard to see if plotted separately.
    The measured data exhibits an anomaly, namely, the biomass accumulation appeared
    to accelerate near the end of the season to a rate higher than that at midseason.
    This contradicts what is nearly universally observed for cereal crops, that midseason
    has the highest rate of production, in agreement with theory (Hsiao, 1993b). If
    the last few measured values were assumed to have large sampling errors and ignored,
    the simulated results would match the measured biomass closer, and the % deviation
    listed in Table 1 for 1989 would be reduced. Note that the simulation also showed
    a small biomass difference between the LD and FI treatments. In 1994 and 1995,
    the stress treatment (ID, intermittent dry) received irrigation intermittently,
    as detailed in Table 3 The simulated CC as compared with the measured CC are shown
    in Fig. 4 for 1994, with d being 0.991 and 0.985 for the FI and ID treatment,
    respectively, and in Fig. 5 for 1995, with d being 0.977 and 0.986 for the FI
    and ID treatment, respectively. The relatively low d values in 1995 are due to
    senescence of the simulated CC occurring too early for the FI treatment (Fig.
    5a), and the simulated maximum CC being too high for the ID treatment (Fig. 5b).
    Conversely, AquaCrop did simulate the slight delay in canopy development and the
    early senescence induced by water deficit that year. For 1994, note that the canopy
    of the ID treatment started to senesce early due to water stress (Fig. 4b). That
    was stopped by the irrigation on 81 DAP, applying 73 mm of water (Table 3). Another
    irrigation of only 22 mm was applied on 104 DAP, but that one had little noticeable
    effect on the crop. The simulation showed these rather nuanced effects, but more
    markedly. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer Simulated as compared with measured canopy
    cover progression and biomass accumulation of maize of the two watering treatments
    of 1994. Standard deviations, when larger than the symbol, are represented by

    very large but is unknown because it could not be calculated due to the exponential
    nature of Eq. [1] Figure 5 Open in figure viewer Simulated as compared with measured

    by bars. The exception is SD of the last data point in (b), which should be very
    large but is unknown because it could not be calculated due to the exponential
    nature of Eq. [1] As for biomass accumulation, in 1994, similar to 1974, it was
    slightly underestimated for much of the season but the simulated values caught
    up with the measured ones at the end (Fig. 4c and 4d), with d being 0.983 and
    0.986 for the FI and ID treatment, respectively. In 1995, there was no clear underestimation
    of the biomass by AquaCrop (Fig. 5c and 5d). The second-to-last measured point
    of the FI treatment for that year (Fig. 5c) was substantially higher than the
    simulated value; but that point appears to be abnormally high compared with the
    general trend of the measured biomass. For 1994, both the measured and the simulated
    biomass showed a slowing down in accumulation in midseason followed by recovery
    (Fig. 4d). This obviously reflects the initial acceleration of CC senescence by
    water stress, and the amelioration of this stress effect by the irrigation on
    81 DAP. For 1996, the match between the simulated and measured CC (Fig. 6a) was
    close (d = 0.994) for the FI treatment, as was the match for biomass (Fig. 6c,
    d = 0.970). For the stress treatment that year, irrigated only at planting (PI),
    AquaCrop underestimated CC early in the season as well as late in the season (Fig.
    6b, d = 0.957). The early apparent underestimate, however, might have been caused
    by errors in the measured data. This is suggested by the fact that the first two
    measured data points for the PI treatment were substantially higher than the corresponding
    points for the FI treatment (Fig. 6a vs. 6b), when the expectation is they would
    be the same or lower. In spite of the fact that canopy senescence occurred too
    early in the simulation compared with the measured, the simulated biomass accumulation
    matched the measured data (Fig. 6d, d = 0.915). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer
    Simulated as compared with measured canopy cover progression and biomass accumulation

    than the symbol, are represented by bars. The exception is SD of the last data
    point in (b), which should be very large but is unknown because it could not be
    calculated due to the exponential nature of Eq. [1] The output of AquaCrop includes
    soil water balance. In this study, the default settings for infiltration and drainage
    according to soil texture (for details, see Raes et al., 2009) were used, with
    no additional adjustment for the local soil, because the more critical testing
    of the model is for the water-limited conditions with very little prospect of
    runoff or drainage. Regardless, it is useful to look at the simulated total water
    content in the soil explored by roots as compared with that measured by Rojas-Lara
    (1999) with the neutron probe technique. As seen in Fig. 7, the simulated general
    trends of the SWC matched the measured trends for the water-deficient treatments.
    There are two discrepancies, however. One is the simulated decline in SWC with
    time is slightly less than that measured, for all 3 yr. Because the discrepancy
    is cumulative, near the end of the season, SWC was overestimated by a significant
    amount, about 80 mm. The other discrepancy is in the comparison for 1995 (Fig.
    7b), where the irrigation water applied on 56, 57, and 58 DAP (Table 3) was obvious
    in the simulated results, as expected, but not evident in the measured data. One
    problem is the neutron probe data were not taken until few days after the irrigation,
    missing the peak of SWC. The peak might also have been obscured by random errors
    in the measurements. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer Total water content in the
    2.7 m of soil (Yolo loam) measured over the season by neutron probe as compared
    with those simulated by AquaCrop for the water-deficient treatment of the year
    1994, 1995, and 1996. The simulated results were for the total soil depth of 2.8
    m, but were adjusted to a total depth of 2.7 m to correspond to the neutron probe
    measurement depth. Bars represent standard errors. DISCUSSION Considering the
    many simplifications used (Stetudo et al., 2009; Raes et al., 2009) in the construction
    of the model, it is a mild surprise that AquaCrop simulated most of the situations
    encountered in the maize studies at Davis for the 6 yr with high d values (Table
    5). Although all the studies were at Davis, the situations were indeed diverse.
    First of all, the watering treatments involved FI, no irrigation up to tasseling,
    no irrigation from tasseling to maturity, intermittent drying, and rainfed or
    irrigated only at planting. A total of four cultivars were studied, with life
    cycles (from 90% emergence to maturity) ranging from 112 to 134 d (1465 to 1664
    GDD). Planting date for the different years varied from 14 May to 15 June, and
    the plant density varied from 7 m−2 to 11.9 m−2 for different years. Measured
    grain yield varied from 5.2 to 13.4 tons ha−1 WP∗ varied from 30.3 to 33.2 because
    atmospheric CO2 rose over time and WUE improved as CO2 increased (Hsiao, 1993a).
    Further, the weather variations from year to year and the differences in planting
    time caused substantial differences in atmospheric evaporative demand, as exemplified
    by comparing the ETo for 1974, 1990, and 1994 (Fig. 8). Not only were the overall
    ETo different for the 3 yr, there were also differences for different growth stages,
    e. g., the contrast between 1990 and 1994 at the early canopy development stage
    and between 1974 and 1994 at the tasseling stage around 55 DAP. Figure 8 Open
    in figure viewer Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) calculated as a 15-d running
    mean for the maize growing period of 1974, 1990, and 1994 at Davis, CA. Note that
    a part of the difference among the years is attributable to the different times
    of planting (see Table 2). As mentioned, the same set of conservative parameter
    values were used to test the model with maize data obtained in other locations,
    including Gainsville, Florida,where the soil is sandy and the weather rainy, and
    Bushland, Texas, where the weather is very windy with ETo higher than in Davis.
    In those tests the simulated results also matched the measured data with similar
    degree of fidelity as in the Davis study as long as water stress was not very
    severe (Heng et al., 2009). It should be emphasized that the same values for the
    conservative parameters (Table 1) were used in all simulation runs regardless
    of the irrigation treatments, and no adjustment was made in the value of any of
    those parameters and there was no separate calibration of the model for the different
    years in Davis. This also holds true for the testing with data obtained at other
    locations, where the climates, soil crop cultivars are different from Davis (Heng
    et al., 2009). On the other hand, we would expect some small adjustments in the
    value of the conservative parameters as the model is improved further in future
    versions, and as it is tested against more maize data obtained from more diverse
    climate and soil conditions. For the Davis data, the same soil water characteristics
    (FC, PWP, SWC at saturation, depth of the two soil layers differing in texture)
    were used as input for all years, although there were spatial variations of these
    characteristics in the field, leading to differences from year to year since the
    experimental areas, though within close proximity to each other, changed from
    year to year. This raises the question of whether the significant deviations between
    simulated and measured values observed in the water stress treatments of some
    years could be due to spatial variation of the soil. In spite of the demonstrated
    overall fidelity of the model, our tests revealed some limitations. One is the
    difficulties encountered in simulating water stress induced early senescence,
    elaborated on earlier regarding the 1989 (Fig. 2b) and 1996 (Fig. 6b) results.
    There are some possibilities to modify that portion of the model, but it is not
    clear that the modifications would improve the performance overall when applied
    to the wide range of situations the model is expected to simulate. The likely
    reason is that while senescence is a complex process, our simulation procedure
    (Raes et al., 2009) represents an extreme simplification of reality. Similar concerns
    can be expressed regarding the stress response functions based on the fractional
    soil water depletion (p factors). The approach employed by AquaCrop bypasses the
    process of root water uptake and transport to leaves, as well as the shoot water
    status, and instead links water stress in plant tissue directly to the total water
    content relative to the water holding capacity of the soil of the root zone. Of
    course, improvements may be sought by simulating plant stress in terms of water
    transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum and potential gradients (Campbell,
    1985; Norman and Campbell, 1983), but ultimately the decision was made to keep
    the model relatively simple and using basic parameters more familiar to nonresearch
    end users. A part of the reason for the decision is the fact that AquaCrop already
    accounts for the effect of Tr on plant water status in a limited way by adjusting
    the stress threshold p value according ETo (Steduto et al., 2009). The fact that
    the model so far has proven relatively robust and applicable to many of the situations
    tested in this and other studies (Heng et al., 2009; Farahani et al., 2009, Geerts
    et al., 2009) lends credence to the chosen approach. It was mentioned earlier
    that in some years, the simulated biomass production tended to be higher than
    the measured values. This could have been the result of the chosen WP∗ (Table
    1) being slightly too low. The WP∗ was not adjusted upward, however, because we
    also considered the result of simulation using the same set of values for the
    conservative parameters for the non-Davis maize data (Heng et al., 2009). It is
    also possible that there is a variation in WP∗ among cultivars. This idea needs
    much testing since the deviations between simulated and measured values are small
    and similar in magnitude to normal measurement errors expected in field experiments.
    As shown in Fig. 7, SWC of the water stress treatments was overestimated for 1994
    to 1996. One cause of the overestimation is the simplifying assumption in AquaCrop
    (Raes et al., 2009) that drainage is zero when SWC is at or below FC. Although
    commonly taken to be the case in irrigation considerations, this is not strictly
    true conceptually and according to experimental data. For the soil at the Davis
    experimental site, in an evaluation based on measured and estimated unsaturated
    hydraulic conductivities and locating the zero flux plane at different times,
    Acevedo (1975) calculated for the rainfed treatment a drainage totaling 20 mm
    over the growing season starting with the soil at FC. If this amount of drainage
    below FC is assumed to have also occurred in 1994, 1995, and 1996, the simulated
    SWC near the end of the season would be still 60 mm too high. It is possible that
    the crop coefficient for Tr was a few percentage points higher than the 1.03 chosen
    (Table 1) in the testing of the model, but this would only account for a part
    of the overestimation. Another possibility is that drainage is underestimated
    by the default parameters used in the simulation. Careful testing with appropriate
    ET data after local calibration of the saturated hydraulic conductivity and drainage
    coefficient τ (Raes et al., 2009) is thus needed. As already mentioned, it is
    also likely that the spatial variations in soil water characteristics may account
    for some of the discrepancies, since the same set of soil water characteristics
    was applied in all the simulations. CONCLUDING DISCUSSION The focus of this symposium
    is on modeling WUE, which has not been addressed directly up to now in this paper.
    AquaCrop displays as a part of any simulation run the estimated consumptive WUE
    for biomass production (biomass per unit ET) and for yield (yield per unit ET).
    In analyzing WUE, it is important to quantify its components. Output from AquaCrop
    simulations provide all the quantitative information to calculate the important
    efficiency steps determining the overall WUE of a crop (Hsiao et al., 2007). These
    are: irrigation application efficiency as affected by drainage; rainfall capture
    efficiency as affected by runoff and drainage; Tr efficiency or the amount of
    water transpired relative to ET; biomass efficiency, the amount of biomass produced
    per unit of water transpired; and yield efficiency, the ratio of biomass produced
    relative to the aboveground biomass, more commonly known as HI. As pointed out
    earlier, for the first efficiency step, AquaCrop does not simulate nonuniform
    distribution of irrigation water and spatial variability of the soil, but does
    provide in the output file drainage calculated by assuming uniform distribution
    and uniform soil. So in situations of heavy irrigation, the efficiency to retain
    water in the root zone would be overestimated to the extent determined by the
    lack of uniformity for distribution and uniform soil. Transpiration efficiency
    (ratio of Tr/ET) appears to be well simulated, as judged by the coincidence (d
    ≥ 0.98 for five of the total of six cases) of the simulated and measured CC, and
    by the fact that simulated biomass production is similar to the measured values
    (d ≥ 0.96 for five of the six cases), for the fully irrigated treatment. Estimates
    in the output file allow the calculation of soil E as a percentage of ET, in addition
    to Tr efficiency. Biomass efficiency can also be calculated from the estimates
    in the output file. Recalling that a cornerstone of AquaCrop is the constancy
    of normalized water (transpired portion only) productivity, the fairly realistic
    mimicking of measured results can be taken as good evidence for the validity of
    this approach. This in turn indicates that the estimated ET and biomass, especially
    those for the fully irrigated treatment, should provide creditable estimates of
    biomass WUE (ratio of biomass/cumulative Tr). Since normalized WP is conservative
    for different weather conditions, a corollary is that differences in biomass WUE
    (not normalized) of a given species in different periods of the year or in different
    years, and at different locations, are mostly the results of differences in evaporative
    demand of the atmosphere, manifested as differences in ETo By running the model
    for different planting dates and hence growing periods of different evaporative
    demand, AquaCrop provides the means to optimize biomass production while maximizing
    WUE for a particular climate. By running the model for different plant density
    and irrigation timing during the canopy development phase, soil E can be minimized
    to allow more water being productively used. By scheduling irrigation at different
    times with different amounts of water, AquaCrop provides the means to develop
    deficit irrigation schedules to save water while minimizing reduction in yield,
    mostly by saving unnecessary runoff, drainage, and soil E, and by enhancing HI.
    Taken as a whole then, AquaCrop, when properly calibrated for a crop species,
    should prove to be a powerful tool in the analysis of crop WUE and in developing
    strategies for improvement. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The work of TCH is supported in part

    L.)–wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the major cropping system occupying 13.5 million
    ha in the Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia. Conventional-tillage practices are
    resource and cost intensive. A 7-yr study evaluated six treatments (T) involving
    three tillage methods and two rice establishment methods on crop yield, water
    productivity, and economic profitability in a rice–wheat rotation. Average rice
    yields in the conventional practice of puddling and transplanting without (T1)
    and with (T2) mid-season alternate wetting-drying were highest (7.81–8.10 Mg ha−1)
    and increased with time (0.26 Mg ha−1 yr−1) in T2. Compared to T1, rice yields
    in direct drill-seeding with zero-tillage averaged 16% lower on flat (T5) and
    43% lower in raised beds (T3). Rice yield in raised beds (T3 and T4) decreased
    with time (0.14–0.45 Mg ha−1 yr−1). Conversely, wheat yielded 18% higher after
    zero compared to conventional-tillage. Treatment 2, despite low soil matric potential
    during vegetative development, had higher water productivity with 25% less water
    use compared with T1 and 19% less compared with other treatments. Conventional-tillage
    and crop establishment practices had higher net cash return in rice but in wheat
    it was higher with zero-tillage. Overall, T2 and T5 had the highest net returns
    (∼1225US$) and T3 and T4 had the lowest (747–846 US$) in the rice–wheat system.
    Zero-tillage on flat beds (T5), however, would conceivably be more sustainable
    than the conventional T2 in the long-run. Yields of zero-tillage with direct-seeding
    of rice on flat beds (T5) must improve before adoption occurs. Abbreviations AWD

    of variance TPR transplanted rice ZT zero-tillage WP water productivity The rice–wheat
    rotation, which occupies about 18 million hectares in South Asia and China, is
    of immense importance for food security (Ladha et al., 2003; Dawe et al., 2004).
    In a rice–wheat system, farmers grow at least one rice and wheat crop on the same
    piece of land each year. In South Asia, the rice–wheat region occupies nearly
    13.5 million hectares across the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of Bangladesh, India,
    Nepal, and Pakistan. This region alone is home to 1.6 billion people, nearly 40%
    of whom live in extreme poverty (FAO, 2010). Over the past 30 yr, the rice–wheat
    system has emerged as the region''s major production system, accounting for more
    than 30% of the total rice area and 40% of the total wheat area, and producing
    nearly one-third of the region''s rice and more than half of its wheat. During
    the Green Revolution era, production increases in the rice–wheat system resulted
    from expansion in area and productivity. Now, however, with little additional
    land available, future growth in demand will have to be met mainly through increases
    in yield per unit area. Further, the average 2% per year rice and wheat yield
    increases seen from 1970 to 1990 have dropped off because of a combination of
    factors including a negative change in soil health, weather parameters, pest and
    agronomic management, and reduced support for public agricultural research (Hobbs
    and Morris, 1996; Harrington, 2001; Ladha et al., 2003). Ladha et al. (2003) examined
    the possible causes of yield decline and observed that degradation of the soil
    and water resource base and inefficient nutrient management could be responsible
    for such a trend. Farmers conventionally grow wheat as an upland crop in the cool
    and dry weather from November to March/April, followed by rice as a lowland crop
    during the warm and humid/subhumid season from June to October in the rice–wheat
    system. Rice is mainly grown by transplanting seedlings into puddled soils. Puddling
    is a tillage operation, which involves repeated tillage in ponded soil, with an
    aim to create a soft mud in the tilled layer. It is therefore also known as wet-tillage.
    It results in a complete breakdown of soil aggregates, destruction of macropores,
    and formation of hard pan at shallow depths. Nevertheless, this practice provides
    many benefits to rice, such as (i) easy weed control, (ii) a reduction in deep
    percolation losses of water and nutrients, (iii) ease of transplanting, (iv) quick
    establishment of seedlings, and (v) improved nutrient availability (Sanchez, 1973;
    Sharma et al., 2003). Although puddling is known to be beneficial for growing
    rice, it can adversely affect the growth and yield of a subsequent upland crop
    (e.g., wheat) because of its adverse effects on soil physical properties, which
    include poor soil structure, suboptimal permeability in the subsurface layer,
    poor soil aeration, and soil compaction (Hobbs and Gupta, 2003; Gupta et al.,
    2003; Sharma et al., 2003; Kumar et al., 2008). In addition, intensive tillage
    and crop establishment (CE) methods require a large amount of labor and water,
    resulting in a rise in the cost of cultivation (Ladha et al., 2009). The challenges
    of the rice–wheat system are to produce more food at less cost and to improve
    water and labor productivity. Farmers need alternatives to conventional intensive
    tillage and CE practices to help them conserve water, labor, and energy; cope
    with the increasing cost of cultivation; and improve the quality of life for farm
    families. One of the strategies is to grow rice and wheat on zero or reduced-till
    land with the use of a seed drill and precision water management (Gupta et al.,
    2003; Ladha et al., 2009). The shift from puddled-transplanted rice and direct
    drill-seeded wheat with intensive-tillage to direct drill-seeded rice (DSR) and
    wheat after zero-tillage on the flat- or raised-bed system affects the productivity
    and resource-use efficiency of the rice–wheat system (Ladha et al., 2009). Therefore,
    the potential benefits and constraints of alternative tillage and CE systems need
    to be quantified on a short- to long-term basis, and optimum layouts and management
    systems need to be identified to maximize yield and input-use efficiency. A long-term
    field experiment was started in 2002 in an area representing alluvial soils of
    the IGP with the objectives to investigate the effects of different tillage and
    CE methods on crop performance, soil properties, and cost of cultivation in a
    rice–wheat system (Bhushan et al., 2007). This paper reports 7 yr results on productivity,
    water use, and economic benefits with different tillage and CE methods in an individual
    crop and system basis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Site A long-term field
    experiment established in the wet season of 2002 at the research farm (29°01’
    N, 77°45’ E, and 237 m elevation) of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel University of Agriculture
    and Technology, Uttar Pradesh, India was used in the current study (Bhushan et
    al., 2007). The experiment has been ongoing since 2002 with the same set of treatments
    and rice–wheat varieties and almost similar management practices over the years.
    The climate of the area is semiarid, with an average annual rainfall of 800 mm
    (70–80% of which is received during July–September), minimum temperature of 0
    to 4°C in January, maximum temperature of 41 to 45°C in June, and relative humidity
    of 67 to 83% throughout the year. Seasonal rainfall during the study years is
    presented in Fig. 1. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer Seasonal rainfall for 7 consecutive
    study years Soil samples were collected at the start of the experiment (2002)
    from 0 to 45-cm depth at every 15-cm depth interval using an auger of 5 cm diam.
    Each sample was a composite of three samples from three locations. The soil samples
    were air-dried, crushed to pass through a 2-mm sieve, and stored in plastic jars
    for analysis. Soil samples were analyzed for organic C (Walkley and Black), total
    N (Kjeldahl digestion), Olsen P (0.5 M NaHCO3 extractable), and 1 M neutral NH4OAC-extractable
    K (by emission spectrophotometry) using the methods described by Olsen et al.
    (1954) and Page et al. (1982). Particle-size distribution was determined by using
    the hydrometer method (Bouyoucos, 1962). Textural class was determined by the
    International Soil Science Society (ISSS) system. Water retention was determined
    on disturbed soil samples using a pressure-plate apparatus (Richards, 1965). Based
    on analysis done in 2002, the experimental soil (0–45 cm) was sandy loam in texture.
    The 0- to 15-cm soil layer had clay, silt, and sand at 19, 26, and 55 g kg−1 soil,
    respectively; pH 8.1; electrical conductivity (EC) 0.4 dS m−1; exchangeable sodium
    percentage (ESP) 13.5; total C 8.3 g kg−1; total N 0.88 g kg−1; Olsen P 25 mg
    kg−1; and 1 M NH4OAC extractable K 121 mg kg−1. The soil retained 18 and 7% water
    (mass basis) at −30 and −1500 kPa water potential, respectively. Experimental
    Details and Management Six treatments (T1–T6) involving three tillage methods
    and two rice establishment methods were evaluated in a rice–wheat rotation, replicated
    thrice in a randomized complete block design with plot size 15.0 by 6.7 m. Details
    relating to treatments evaluated in the present study are described below: Treatment
    1: Transplanted Rice after Conventional Puddling and Drill-Seeded Wheat after
    Conventional Tillage (CT-TPR/CT-DSW) After conventional puddling (2 dry-harrowing
    + 2 wet cultivator + 1 planking), rice seedlings (21-d old) were transplanted
    manually (2–3 seedlings hill−1) at 20 by 20 cm spacing; the plots were flooded
    (5 cm water submergence) initially for 2 wk to establish the seedlings, and subsequent
    irrigations (5-cm depth of standing water) were applied on the appearance of hair-line
    cracks on soil surface. Wheat was sown in rows 20 cm apart using seed with fertilizer
    drill following the conventional tillage practice (2 harrowing + 2 tillers + 1
    planking). Six irrigations (5 cm each) were applied at crown root initiation (21
    days after seeding, DAS), maximum tillering (35–50 DAS), jointing, flowering (50–70
    DAS), dough (85–100 DAS), and late dough (115–125 DAS) stages of the wheat. Treatment
    2: Transplanted Rice after Conventional Puddling with Mid-Season Alternate Wetting
    and Drying and Drill-Seeded Wheat after Zero-Tillage (CTAWD–TPR/ZT-DSW) Tillage
    operations and the transplanting procedure were the same as in T1, except irrigation
    during tillering to the onset of flowering (20–70 d after transplanting) was applied
    at 10 to 15 d intervals. Subsequent irrigations (5-cm depth of standing water)
    in rice were applied as in T1. Wheat was seeded in zero-tillage plots at 20 cm
    row spacing with zero-tillage seed with fertilizer drill. Irrigation scheduling
    was same as in T1. Treatment 3: Direct Drill-Seeded Rice and Wheat on Permanent
    Raised Beds (Bed-DSR/Bed-DSW) Plots were prepared (2 dry-harrowing + 2 cultivator
    + 1 planking) and beds made by a tractor drawn bed planter during 2002 (37 cm
    wide by 15 cm high by 30 cm wide). Two rows of rice were direct drill-seeded on
    each bed at 20 cm spacing using bed seed with fertilizer planter without reshaping.
    Light irrigation was given at 1 d after seeding, and then at 3 to 4 d interval
    for 3 to 4 wk after germination, thereafter irrigation at the appearance of hairline
    cracks at the bottom of furrow. The furrows were completely filled with water
    during each irrigation, avoiding overtopping of beds. In wheat, beds were reshaped
    and seeds were sown with bed seed with fertilizer planter in a single operation.
    Irrigation schedule was the same as in T1 avoiding overtopping of beds. Treatment
    4: Transplanted Rice and Drill-Seeded Wheat on Permanent Raised Beds (Bed-TPR/Bed-DSW)
    Raised beds were made using bed planter as in T3, and two rows of rice seedlings
    (21 d old) were transplanted manually (two to three seedlings/hill) on moist beds
    at 20 cm spacing (12 cm between hills). Irrigation was applied daily for 2 wk
    during crop establishment followed by subsequent irrigation at the appearance
    of hairline cracks at the bottom of furrows. In wheat, beds were reshaped and
    seeds were sown with bed seed with fertilizer planter in a single operation. Irrigation
    schedule was the same as in T1 avoiding overtopping of beds. Treatment 5: Zero-Tillage
    Direct Drill-Seeded Rice and Wheat (ZT-DSR/ZT-DSW) Direct seeding of rice was
    done using zero-tillage seed with fertilizer drill in zero-tillage plots at 20
    cm row spacing on the same day the nursery sowing was done for transplanted rice.
    Light irrigations were given at 1 d after seeding, and then 3 to 4 d intervals
    for 3 wk after germination, followed by subsequent irrigations (5-cm depth of
    standing water) at the appearance of hair-line cracks. Wheat was seeded in zero-tillage
    plots at 20-cm row spacing with zero-tillage seed with fertilizer drill. Irrigation
    schedule was same as in T1. Treatment 6: Zero Tillage Transplanted Rice and Zero-Tillage
    Drill-Seeded Wheat (ZT-TPR/ZT-DSW) Zero-tillage plots were flooded to make the
    soil soft 1 d before transplanting of rice seedlings. The 21 d-old rice seedlings
    were transplanted as in T1. The plots were flooded (5 cm water submergence) initially
    for 2 wk to establish the seedlings, and subsequent irrigations (5-cm depth of
    standing water) were applied on the appearance of hair-line cracks on soil surface.
    Wheat was seeded in zero-tillage plots at 20 cm row spacing with zero-tillage
    seed with fertilizer drill. Irrigation schedule was same as in T1. Seeding and
    Seed Rate Rice (NDR 359) was direct drill-seeded in the first week of June, using
    a zero-tillage seed with fertilizer drill/bed seed with fertilizer planter with
    inclined-plate seed-metering system, whereas transplanting was done manually in
    the last week of June. The seeding rate for drill-seeded rice on flat and raised
    beds was 25 kg ha−1 and in nursery for transplanted rice 15 kg ha−1. Wheat (PBW
    343) was sown in the first week of November at 90 kg ha−1 on raised beds and 120
    kg ha−1 in flat-beds. Water Application and Measurements Irrigation water was
    applied using polyvinyl chloride pipes of 10-cm diam. and the amount applied to
    each plot was measured using a water meter (Dasmesh Co., Ludhiana, Punjab, India).
    The quantity of water applied and the duration of irrigation were computed using
    the following equations: Rainfall data were recorded using a rain gauge. The total
    amount of water applied (input water) was computed as the sum of water applied
    through irrigations and rainfall. The input water productivity (WPI+R) was computed
    as follows (Humphreys et al., 2007): The soil matric potential at 15-cm soil depth
    was monitored daily using gauge-type tensiometers (Soil Moisture Equipment Corp.,
    Santa Barbara, CA) permanently fixed in the field. In case of raised beds, tensiometers
    were placed in the center of the beds. Fertilizer Application In rice, all plots
    received 150 kg N, 26 kg P, 50 kg K, and 8.75 kg Zn ha−1. Based on our earlier
    experience, we found that a DSR crop after zero-tillage suffers from N deficiency
    because of reduced soil N mineralization/supply. Therefore, a greater amount of
    N than in puddled transplanting is required (Dingkuhn et al., 1991). An additional
    rate of 22.5 kg N ha−1 at 20 DAS was applied in all DSR plots. A full rate of
    P and K and a one-fourth N rate were applied using a zero-tillage seed with fertilizer
    drill/bed seed with fertilizer planter at the time of seeding in DSR and these
    were broadcast manually at the time of transplanting in TPR. The remaining N was
    applied in three equal splits at 35 to 40, 45 to 50, and 60 to 70 DAS, respectively.
    Zinc was broadcast at seeding in DSR and at transplanting in TPR plots. In wheat,
    all treatments received 150 kg N, 26 kg P, and 50 kg K and full rates of P and
    K and a one-fourth N rate were applied using a zero-tillage seed with fertilizer
    drill at sowing. The remaining N was applied in three equal splits at just before
    first irrigation (CRI), second irrigation (tillering), and third irrigation (flowering
    initiation), respectively. Weed Management Weeds in zero-tillage plots before
    the seeding of rice and wheat were killed by spraying glyphosate at 900 g a.i.
    ha−1. In direct drill-seeded rice, pendimethalin 1000 g a.i. ha−1 was applied
    at 2 DAS, followed by one postemergence spray of chlorimuron ethyl + metsulfuron
    methyl at 4 g a.i. ha−1 at 21 DAS for broadleaf weeds. In transplanted rice, butachlor
    1000 g a.i. ha−1 was applied 2 DAT. One hand weeding was also done in transplanted
    and direct drill-seeded rice to keep the plots weed-free. For wheat, grassy and
    broad leaf weeds were controlled by spraying sulfosulfuron + metsulfuron methyl
    at 35 g a.i. + 4 g a.i. ha−1 at 25 to 30 DAS. Yield and Yield Parameters Measurements
    At maturity, rice and wheat growth and yield parameters that is, plant height,
    total number of effective panicles, panicle or ear length, number of filled and
    unfilled grains panicle−1 or number of grains earhead−1, sterility of spikelets
    and 1000-grain weight were measured. On flat beds, total number of panicles was
    recorded using 1 m2 quadrate at two places in each plot. Simultaneously 10 plants
    were randomly selected from each quadrate for measurements of yield parameters.
    On raised beds, the parameters were recorded on 1 m running beds and converted
    into 1 m2 basis by dividing with 0.67. Crop was harvested manually at 15 cm aboveground
    level. Grain and straw yields were determined from an area of 13 by 5.4 m (70.2
    m2) in flat beds and 13 by 5.36 m (69.7 m2) in raised beds located in the center
    of each plot. The rice grains were threshed manually and wheat grains were threshed
    using a plot thresher; dried in a batch grain dryer, and weighed. Grain moisture
    was determined immediately after weighing. Grain yields of rice and wheat were
    reported at 140 and 120 g kg−1 water content, respectively. Straw weight was determined
    after oven-drying at 70°C to constant weight and expressed on an oven dry-weight
    basis. Residue Management Rice and wheat were harvested manually after leaving
    15-cm anchored crop stubbles in all plots. The crop stubbles of about 1 Mg ha−1
    dry biomass per treatment were observed after each crop harvest. The crop stubbles
    were incorporated into the soil in conventional puddling/tillage plots whereas
    in zero-tillage plots, the seeding was done in the standing stubbles. Economic
    Analysis All the cost of inputs (tractor use, seed, fertilizer, fuel, biocides,
    irrigation, and labor) and the returns for outputs were used for respective years
    in the study (Jat et al., 2009). These data were obtained from current market
    price paid for inputs (Economic Survey of India, 2009; Fertilizer Statistics,
    2010). The cost of human labor used for tillage, seeding, irrigation, fertilizer
    and pesticide application, weeding, and harvesting of rice and wheat crops was
    based on person-day ha−1 (Minimum Wages Act, 1948). Time (h) required to complete
    a particular field operation in a given treatment was recorded and expressed as
    person-day ha−1, considering 8 h to be equivalent to 1 person-day. Similarly,
    time (h) required by a tractor-drawn machine to complete a field operation such
    as tillage, seeding, fertilizer application and harvesting was recorded, and expressed
    as h ha−1. Time (h) required to irrigate a particular plot and consumption of
    diesel (l h−1) by the pump was also recorded. Cost of irrigation was calculated
    by multiplying time (h) required to irrigate a particular plot, consumption of
    diesel by the pump (1 h−1) and cost of diesel (varied 0.44–0.90 US$ L−1). The
    cost of cultivation was calculated by taking into account costs of all the inputs
    and the hiring charges of human labor and machines for different purposes as stated
    above based on the current market rates (Minimum Wages Act, 1948). Gross returns
    (GR) were calculated by multiplying grain yield of rice and wheat by minimum support
    price offered by the Government of India (Economic Survey of India, 2009), and
    straw value of rice and wheat was calculated using current market rates. Net returns
    (NR) were calculated as the difference between gross returns and total cost of
    cultivation (NR = GR – TCC). System productivity was calculated by adding the
    grain yield of rice and wheat in each year, and the system net returns (SNR) were
    calculated by adding the net return of rice (NRr) and wheat (NRw) for the individual
    year. The benefit/cost ratio computed by dividing the gross returns (GR) by the
    total cost of cultivation (TCC). Data Analysis The data were subjected to ANOVA
    and analyzed using the general linear model (GLM) procedures of the statistical
    analysis system (SAS Institute, 2001). Treatment means were compared by Tukey''s
    honest significant difference (HSD) test. Linear contrasts were used to compare
    single or multiple treatments against one another. The trend analysis was done
    by simple linear regression. Multi-variate analysis of variance (MANOVA) for repeated
    measures was also done to determine the overall impact of treatments on different
    crop, economic, and water parameters across the years. Unless stated otherwise,
    differences were considered significant only when P < 0.05. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
    Rice Yield and Yield Attributes A combined ANOVA over the years showed a significant
    effect of treatments and treatment × year interaction on rice grain yield (Table
    1). Rice yield was consistently highest in puddled transplanted plots (T1) and
    lowest in bed-DSR (T3) in all years. Compared to T1, puddled transplanted rice
    with mid-season alternate wetting and drying (T2) yielded similar in all years;
    bed-DSR (T3) yielded lower in all years (13–65%); bed-TPR (T4) yielded similar
    in initial 2 yr and lower in subsequent years (26–31%); zero-tillage DSR (T5)
    yielded similar in all years except in 2004 and 2006, and zero-tillage TPR (T6)
    yielded lower (20–23%) in 2006 and 2007. Grain yields in T4, T5, and T6 were similar
    except in 2007. Table 1. Medium-term effects of tillage and crop establishment

    probability by Tukey''s HSD test. ¶ Linear contrast comparison (P value) within
    a crop for multiple treatments. Tillage had strong effects on rice yield, whereas
    crop establishment effects were inconsistent (Table 1). Rice yields on puddled
    soil (T1 and T2) were higher than on unpuddled soil (T3-T6) in all years except
    in Year 1 in which yields were similar. Zero-tillage rice on flat beds (T5 and
    T6) was more productive than zero-tillage rice on raised beds (T3 and T4). Zero-tillage
    transplanted rice (T4 and T6) yields were similar to zero-tillage direct drill-seeded
    rice (T3 and T5) in 2002, 2005, and 2007 but were higher in 2003, 2004, 2006,
    and 2008. Overall, based on a 7-yr average, rice on permanent raised beds (T3
    and T4) either direct drill-seeded or transplanted yielded 43 and 24% lower than
    conventional practice of puddled transplanting (T1), respectively (Table 1). Similarly,
    zero-tillage rice on flat beds either direct drill-seeded or transplanted (T5
    and T6) yielded lower (15%) than T1 but yielded higher (48%) than direct-seeding
    on raised beds (T3). Time trends analysis of grain yield showed an increase in
    rice yield with time (0.26 Mg ha−1 yr−1) in T2 (Table 1). In contrast, yield declined
    with time in T3 and T4 (0.45, and 0.14 Mg ha−1 yr−1, respectively). The yields
    of T1, T5, and T6 remained unaffected across years. In DSR on raised bed (T3),
    the declining trend started after three rice cropping cycles (statistics not shown).
    Crop growth parameters and yield attributes were significantly affected by tillage
    and CE methods (Table 2). Treatments 1 and 2 did not differ in any of the growth
    and yield attribute parameters. Plant height was shorter in zero-tillage rice
    (direct drill-seeded or transplanted) (T3–T6) than in puddled transplanted rice.
    Total plant biomass decreased in the following order: T1 = T2 > T5 = T6 = T4 >
    T3. Number of panicles was higher (307 m−2) in ZT-DSR (T5) compared to all other
    treatments (222–251 m−2), which did not differ among themselves. Rice on unpuddled
    zero-tillage soil (T3–T6) had higher spikelet sterility and smaller panicle length,
    which resulted in lower grain per panicle compared to rice on puddled soil (T1
    and T2). Zero-tillage direct drill-seeded rice on raised bed (T3) or flat bed
    (T5) had higher spikelet sterility than zero-tillage transplanted rice on raised
    or flat bed (T4 and T6), which resulted in a lower number of grains panicle−1
    in direct drill-seeded than in transplanted rice on zero-tillage soil. Despite
    higher number of panicles m−2, lower yields in ZT-DSR (T5) compared with CT-TPR
    (T1) suggest that higher panicle number could not compensate losses caused by
    (i) lower number of grains panicle−1 attributed to higher spikelet sterility (25.6
    vs. 14.7%), and (ii) lower 1000-grain weight (22 vs. 24 g, respectively). Direct
    drill-seeded rice on raised beds (T3) suffered more than ZT-DSR (T5) because of
    lower number of panicles per unit area. Earlier published research have shown
    higher panicles m−2 in ZT-DSR than in TPR and higher spikelet sterility in DSR
    on unpuddled soil than TPR (Bhushan et al., 2007; Choudhury et al.,2007; Saharawat
    et al., 2010). Harvest index did not differ among treatments except in Bed-DSR
    (T3) in which it was lower (9–13%) than other treatments. Table 2. Medium-term

    are not different at the 0.05 level of probability by Tukey''s HSD test. ¶ Linear
    contrast comparison (P value) for multiple treatments. Overall results indicate
    that puddling and transplanting (T1 and T2) produced the highest grain yield and
    sustained it over time. Rice on raised beds either direct drill-seeded (T3) or
    transplanted (T4) had substantial yield loss with a negative time trend. The performance
    of zero-tillage direct drill-seeded rice (T5) was inconsistent with equivalent
    yield in some years and lower in other years compared to the conventional practice
    of puddling and transplanting (T1). Other studies have also reported inconsistent
    results of direct drill-seeded rice on flat and raised beds. A field study conducted
    by Jat et al. (2009) at Modipuram, India found that compared to puddled transplanted
    rice, direct drill-seeded rice on raised beds yielded 21 to 46% lower, whereas
    on flat bed yielded similar in the first year but 25 to 26% lower in the second
    year. Based on large datasets, Kumar and Ladha (2011) reported 10 and 29% lower
    yields in ZT-DSR and Bed-DSR, respectively, compared to CT-TPR in India. Several
    explanations could account for a negative trend in rice yield with bed-planting
    including (i) higher spikelet sterility and lower 1000-grain weight, (ii) more
    moisture stress, (iii) deterioration in soil properties with time, especially
    chemical properties such as salt accumulation, rise in soil pH, and Fe deficiency,
    and (iv) higher infestation of nematodes. Rice on raised beds generally grows
    under aerobic conditions, and experiences moisture stress. Moisture stress at
    critical stages (panicle initiation and flowering) has been observed to cause
    a yield reduction in rice by lowering the number of grains panicle−1 and increasing
    spikelet sterility (Belder et al., 2002). Consequently, yield of aerobic rice
    is generally lower than submerged rice (Pinheiro et al., 2006). Higher population
    of nematodes, especially Meloidogyne graminicola and Tylenchorhynchus brevilineatus,
    and a rise in soil pH were observed in this study (data not shown). Likewise,
    other researchers have reported a rise in soil pH, salt accumulation, and Fe deficiency
    in rice grown on raised beds (Sharma et al., 2002; Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2008).
    The parameters primarily contributing to higher yield in T1 and T2 were higher
    grains panicle−1 and 1000-grain weight and lower sterility percentage than other
    treatments. Puddling and transplanting was better than zero-tillage system as
    rice grows best under reduced conditions, which are better obtained with puddling
    than with zero-tillage. Although, the yield benefit with puddling over zero-tillage
    was about 16%, zero-tillage direct drill-seeded rice has other advantages such
    as saving labor, time, water and energy, and thus cost (Kumar and Ladha., 2011).
    Direct-seeding rice has another advantage, decreased growth duration, as DSR matures
    7 to 10 d earlier than transplanted rice (Balasubramanian and Hill, 2002; Saharawat
    et al., 2010). This allows for timely planting of succeeding wheat. Direct drill-seeded
    rice, however, occupies fields for at least about 2 wk more than puddled transplanted
    rice (Rashid et al., 2009). But, in spite of that, the total water use of DSR
    is lower than that of TPR (Bhushan et al., 2007). Wheat Yield and Yield Attributes
    The tillage and CE methods adopted during the rice phase had a significant effect
    on yield and yield parameters of succeeding wheat crop, and these effects started
    showing after one cropping cycle (Table 1). Zero-tillage planted wheat after zero-tillage
    direct drill-seeded rice (T5) always produced the highest wheat yield, while bed-planted
    wheat after transplanted rice (T4) produced the lowest yield. Wheat yield in T5
    and T6 was consistently higher by 18% (7-yr average) than in T3 and T4. Treatments
    5 and 6 also produced about 9% higher yields than T1 and T2 (wheat after puddled
    transplanted rice). These results are in agreement with earlier short-term studies
    (Kumar et al., 2008; Jat et al., 2009) in which wheat yield after direct drill-seeded
    rice was higher than after puddled-transplanted rice. Kumar et al. (2008) reported
    8% higher wheat yield after DSR than after TPR. Time trend analysis did not show
    any change in wheat yield in any treatment, except T6, where the trend was positive
    (0.23 Mg ha−1 yr−1). Except for effective tillers m−2, no other yield parameter
    (ear length, grains ear−1, ansd 1000-grain weight) was affected by tillage and
    CE methods in wheat (Table 2). The zero-tillage wheat after zero-tillage rice
    (T5 and T6) had 29 to 40% higher effective tillers than wheat on bed after rice
    on beds (T3 and T5) and 19 to 25% higher than conventional tilled wheat after
    puddled TPR (T1). Saharawat et al. (2010) also reported about 15% higher effective
    tillers m−2 in zero-tillage drill seeded than in conventional-tillage drill seeded
    wheat. Total biomass of zero-tillage wheat after zero-tillage rice (T5 and T6)
    was 10 to 12% higher than conventional-tillage wheat after puddled TPR, and 10
    to 23% higher than bed planted wheat grown after bed planted rice. Harvest index
    did not differ among treatments. System Productivity The system productivity (rice+wheat)
    was influenced by tillage treatments and CE methods (Table 1). During all years,
    the system productivity of T1, T2, T5, and T6 did not differ among themselves
    but T3 and T4 had lower productivity than T1. Overall, based on the 7 yr average,
    the system productivity of T2, T5, and T6 was similar, whereas system productivity
    of T3 and T4 was 19 to 27% lower as compared to conventional practices of rice
    and wheat (T1). Bed-planted treatments 3 and 4 were similar in system productivity
    in 5 out of 7 yr and T4 was more productive than T3 in 2006 and 2008. On a 7-yr
    average, T3 had 10% lower system productivity than T4, which was primarily due
    to differences in rice yield in 2 out of 7 yr. The data indicated that ZT based
    CE methods on flat bed has potential to replace conventional practice of growing
    rice and wheat without a yield penalty on a system basis. In contrast, there is
    still a need to improve the direct drill-seeded rice planting systems to increase
    the system productivity. Bed planting may prove useful for wheat in poorly drained
    soils, as wheat is sensitive to poor soil aeration (Sharma et al., 2003). Water
    Use and Water Productivity Irrigation Water Use Seasonal rainfall during different
    years under study is shown in Fig. 1. During the rice season, years 2004, 2006,
    2007, and 2008 had relatively low seasonal rainfall, ranging between 449 and 539
    mm. Of these 4 yr, 2004 had erratic rainfall distribution; rainfall being insufficient
    during rice establishment which resulted in relatively more application of irrigation
    water in raised-bed and zero-tillage plots. The other 3 yr had evenly distributed
    rainfall during crop establishment and vegetative phases. The water requirement
    of rice decreases during the reproductive phase after grain filling is complete.
    Years 2002, 2003, and 2005 were relatively high-rainfall years, with seasonal
    rainfall of 1066, 1238, and 815 mm, respectively. But rainfall distribution was
    variable in these years that cause much difference in irrigation water use. Rice
    used more irrigation water in T1 and the least in T2 in 6 out of 7 yr (Table 3).
    Based on the 7-yr average, the irrigation water use in different treatments followed
    the order: T1 > T6 > T4 ≥ T5 > T3 > T2. Compared with T1, T3 to T6 saved 3 to
    10%, while T2 saved 25% irrigation water. Table 3. Medium-term effects of tillage

    The yearly soil matric potential at a 15-cm depth, averaged over three growth
    stages of rice, viz. crop establishment (up to 45 DAS in DSR and 20–23 DAT in
    TPR), vegetative (between 45 and 90 DAS), and reproductive (between 90 DAS and
    harvesting) are shown in Fig. 2. During crop establishment and the reproductive
    stage, soil matric potential in general remained highest in T1 and T2 (puddling)
    and lowest in T3 (bed planting). During the vegetative phase, the lowest soil
    matric potential was observed in T2 due to mid-season alternate wetting and drying.
    Figure 2 Open in figure viewer Average soil–water matric potential at different
    rice growth stages in different years under different tillage and crop establishment
    methods Seasonal rainfall during the wheat phase was 160, 53, 93, 82, 111, 32,
    and 41 mm in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively (Fig.
    1). As in rice, irrigation water use in wheat was highest in T1 (Table 3). Compared
    to conventional tillage (T1), the wheat on raised beds (T3 and T4) saved 25% and
    flat (T5 and T6) saved 6 to 9% irrigation water. The difference between T3/T4
    and T5/T6 was 19% less water use in the former than the latter. For the system,
    T1 had the highest (2525 mm ha−1) and T2 the lowest (1954 mm ha−1) irrigation
    water use (Table 3). Compared to T1, T2 saved 23%, T5/T6 saved 4 to 9% and T3/T4
    saved 11 to 12% irrigation water. Rice and wheat on raised bed (T3 and T4) had
    6% less water use than that on flat land (T5 and T6). Water Productivity Based
    on the 7-yr average, water productivity (WP) in rice, wheat, and rice+wheat was
    significantly affected by tillage and CE methods (Fig. 3). Water productivity
    of rice was highest (0.36 kg grain m−3 water) in T2 and lowest (0.17 kg grain
    m−3 water) in T3, and similar (0.23–0.26 kg grain m−3 water) in T4 to T6. In wheat,
    water productivity was highest (1.42 kg grain m−3 water) in T3 and lowest (1.15
    kg grain m−3 water) in T1, and was similar in other treatments (1.27–1.38 kg grain
    m−3 water). In the rice–wheat system, water productivity was highest (0.49 kg
    grain m−3) in T2 and lowest (0.31 kg grain m−3 water) in T3 with other treatments
    having intermediate values in the following order: T5 (0.40 kg grain m−3 water)
    = T1 (0.39 kg grain m−3 water) > T6 (0.38 kg grain m−3 water) > T4 (0.35 kg grain
    m−3 water). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer Medium-term effects of tillage and
    crop establishment methods on rice, wheat, and system input water productivity
    in rice–wheat rotation In spite of maintaining relatively low soil matric potential,
    especially during the vegetative phase (Fig. 2), mid-season alternate wetting
    and drying (T2) rice yielded similar to continuous flooding (T1) and saved about
    24% irrigation water, and hence was a better alternative to continuous flooding.
    Earlier studies have also shown that mid-season alternate wetting and drying (after
    tillering) in certain cases leads to improvement in rice yields by improving the
    oxygen status of the root zone and improving the rice root system (Uphoff and
    Randriamiharisoa, 2002). The effects of mid-season alternate wetting and drying
    on rice yield are, however, site-specific, depending on soil type, water table
    depth, and climate (Bouman and Tuong, 2001), and especially suited to excessively
    reduced or Fe-toxic soils (Bouman et al., 2002). Comparing treatments based on
    system productivity and water productivity data (Table 1 and Fig. 2), T2 was the
    best treatment, followed by T1, T5, and T6, which were similar among themselves;
    T4 was the next best and T3 was the poorest treatment. Economic Analysis The cost
    of rice and wheat cultivation was significantly affected by tillage and CE methods
    (Table 4). The cost of rice cultivation was highest in puddling and transplanting
    (T1), followed by puddling and transplanting with mid-season alternate wetting
    and drying (T2), zero-tillage transplanting (T6), transplanting on raised beds
    (T4), and zero-tillage direct-seeding (T5), and direct-seeding on permanent raised
    beds (T3). The difference between the highest and lowest cost of cultivation was
    US$122 ha−1. The cost of wheat cultivation was higher in T1 (conventional tillage)
    than in all other treatments (T2–T6) by about US$61 ha−1. The total cost of rice–wheat
    cultivation followed a similar trend to that of rice, with the highest and lowest
    cultivation costs differing by US$185 ha−1. Table 4. Medium-term effects of tillage

    The highest net returns from the rice crop were obtained with T2 (US$425 ha−1),
    followed by T1 (US$380 ha−1), T5 and T6 (US$313 and US$282 ha−1), and T4 (US$197
    ha−1). Treatment 3 had a net loss of US$10 ha−1 (Table 4). Net returns from wheat
    were highest in T5 and T6, followed by T2, T3, T1, and T4. The difference in net
    returns between the highest and lowest values was US$255 ha−1. Considering the
    rice–wheat system as a whole, the highest net returns were obtained with T2, T5,
    and T6 (US$1172–1227), followed by T1 (US$1086), and lowest were T3 and T4 (US$747–846).
    The net returns with zero-tillage (T5 and T6), puddling and transplanting (T1
    and T2), and raised-bed planting (T3 and T4) on average were US$1195, US$1157,
    and US$797 ha−1, respectively. The benefit/cost ratio in rice was highest with
    T2 and T1 (1.56), followed by T5 and T6 (1.46), T4 (1.32), and T3 (1.01). In wheat,
    the trend was T5 = T6 > T2 > T3 > T4 > T1 (Table 4). The highest benefit/cost
    ratio from the rice–wheat system was obtained with T2, T5, and T6 (2.13–2.20),
    followed by T1 and T4 (1.86–1.93), and the lowest with T3 (1.78). Hence, the zero-tillage
    system was the most profitable in the rice–wheat cropping system. The puddling
    and transplanting with mid-season alternate wetting and drying in rice followed
    by zero-tillage wheat were equally profitable, though with a higher cost. CONCLUSIONS
    Seven years of data show that the conventional practice of puddling and transplanting
    with continuous flooding (T1) or mid-season alternate wetting-drying (T2) gave
    the highest rice productivity (7.81–8.10 Mg ha−1). On the other hand, the highest
    wheat productivity (5.37 Mg ha−1) was obtained with zero-tillage (T5), which was
    followed by zero-tillage direct drill-seeded rice (T5). Rice had substantial yield
    loss with declining trends when planted on the raised beds. Due to differential
    yield responses of two cereals in rotation with tillage and CE methods, the system
    (rice–wheat) productivity average was similar with conventional (T1, T2) and zero-tillage
    practices (T5, T6). However, in overall performance parameters (grain yield, water
    productivity, irrigation water use, and benefit/cost), conventional practice with
    mid-season wetting drying (T2) was the best. Zero-tillage with drill-seeding both
    in rice and wheat (T5) was equal to that of T1 in system productivity and benefit/cost.
    Although T5 used 18% more irrigation water than T2, it had the second best water
    productivity. With T2 and T5 similar in net economic returns, most farmers would
    prefer T5 because of less dependence on labor. Furthermore, T5 is likely to be
    superior in the long-run because of gradual improvement in soil quality, especially
    physical properties (M.K. Gathala et al., unpublished data, 2011). Future work
    toward the perfection of zero-tillage, which includes improved resource management
    and the use of rice and wheat varieties specifically selected and bred for zero-tillage,
    is likely to improve the sustainability of zero-tillage and direct-seeding system.

    rights and content Highlights • AWD15 can save 24%–71% of irrigation water and
    reduce 4–5 irrigation applications without yield loss under different N levels.
    • No significant interaction effect between W and N application rates was found
    on grain yield and NUEs. • The optimal nitrogen rate was 180 kg N ha−1 under both
    water management regimes. • AWD15 can replace FP to further increase water use
    efficiency in South China. Abstract The increasing scarcity of irrigation water
    necessitates the development of water-saving technology in rice production. Our
    previous studies have shown that “safe” alternate wetting and drying irrigation
    (AWD15) can effectively save water, improve water productivity while maintain
    grain yield compared to continuous flooding (CF) and farmer''s water management
    practice (FP) under a single fertilizer-N input. The objectives of this study
    are (1) to investigate the superiority of this novel water management practice
    compared with FP; and (2) to examine whether there is an interaction between water
    and N input and whether fertilizer-N input needs to be adjusted under AWD15. Two
    field experiments were conducted during the late cropping seasons of 2014 and
    2015. A hybrid rice variety Tianyou3618 was grown under two water management (AWD15
    and FP) and four fertilizer-N rates (0, 90, 180, 270 kg N ha−1). Grain yield,
    water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency were determined. Compared to that
    of FP, irrigation water input of AWD15 was reduced by 24.1% in 2014 and 71.4%
    in 2015. The number of irrigations decreased and water productivity increased
    significantly. No significant differences existed between AWD15 and FP in grain
    yield, biomass, leaf area index and nitrogen use efficiency. Nitrogen input level
    had significant effects on yield, biomass, harvest index and nitrogen use efficiency
    in both years. Grain yield increased with N rate and the optimal N rate was 180
    kg N ha−1. No significant interaction was found between water and nitrogen rate
    regarding biomass production and grain yield. Our results demonstrated that no
    change in N input is needed under AWD15 condition and AWD15 is advantageous over
    farmer''s water management practice under all N levels investigated in South China.
    This is the first report on the performance of AWD15 under different fertilizer-N
    levels in South China. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    management 1. Introduction Water and nitrogen are important inputs for rice production.
    The scarcity of fresh water resources now threatens rice production in China (Yao
    et al., 2014). South China is one of the major rice-producing regions in the country,
    with a total planting area of 5 Mha. More than 80% of cereal food produced comes
    from rice (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2015). Two rice crops are grown
    annually under irrigation in this region. Although there is abundant rainfall
    in South China, water shortage is still a major problem for rice production because
    of the uneven distribution of the rainfall among seasons and regions (Liu et al.,
    2011). Moreover, climate change has brought an alarming situation to agricultural
    production, such as an increase in the occurrence of periods of water scarcity.
    Global warming is likely to result in a 24% greater demand for water in the double-cropping
    areas of rice in South China (Ye et al., 2015). In rice production, farmers often
    apply more N fertilizers than the minimum required for maximum crop growth to
    maximize grain yield (Peng et al., 2002). Water scarcity, environmental pollution
    caused by excessive application of fertilizers, and the high costs of irrigation
    and fertilizers, demand for greater increase than ever in grain yield of rice
    with less water and less fertilizers (N fertilizer in particular) in China (Peng
    et al., 2002, Peng et al., 2006). Thus, there is an increasing need to develop
    water-saving and N-fertilizer efficient technologies for economical and environment-friendly
    production of rice. For rice, water-saving technologies include alternate wetting
    and drying (AWD) irrigation, saturated soil culture, and aerobic rice, etc. (Bouman
    et al., 2007b). AWD has been used in many countries in Asia since being developed
    by IRRI since 1990s. The practice provides a chance of more rice production in
    water scarce areas. “Safe” AWD (AWD15), with a threshold of 15 cm in water depth
    below the soil surface, also has other potential benefits, such as (1) increase
    in farmers’ income (Lampayan et al., 2015b), (2) reduction in lodging of rice
    plants because of better rooting system and better control of some pests and diseases
    such as golden apple snail (Bouman et al., 2007b), and (3) reduction of methane
    (a greenhouse gas) emissions (Yagi et al., 1996, Liang et al., 2016). Up to now,
    AWD15 has become one of the most commonly practiced water-saving irrigation technologies
    in Asia (Tuong et al., 2005, Lampayan et al., 2015b, Liang et al., 2016). However,
    this technology was introduced by us into South China only in recent years. More
    information is needed to validate its adaptability to this region and its superiority
    over local farmers’ water management practice. Water and nutrient may interact
    with each other to produce a coupling effect. Some studies (Wang et al., 2004,
    Sun et al., 2009, Sun et al., 2010) indicated that there was a significant interaction
    between nitrogen application and water management on nitrogen absorption and utilization
    and grain yield in rice. However, other studies have found no significant interaction
    between them (Yang et al., 2008, Yao et al., 2012). Under the growing conditions
    of lowland rice in South China, the interaction between water management practice
    (AWD15 and FP) and nitrogen input has not been documented yet and needs to be
    investigated. When AWD15 is practiced, continuous standing water will not be observed
    in the field except for the first 10 days after transplanting and during the flowering
    stage. The field will alternately experience flooding and drying conditions. We
    speculate that nutrient loss (nitrogen in particular) caused by water runoff from
    the field may be reduced considerately, resulting in an indirect improvement in
    nitrogen use efficiency under AWD15. In addition, non-point source pollutants
    (nitrogen in particular) may be reduced due to less water runoff (Xue et al.,
    2013). Furthermore, if an interaction exists between water management practice
    and nitrogen rate, then the N input will have to be changed under AWD15. Water
    management with a midseason drainage is a common practice widely used nowadays
    by farmers to control the unproductive tillers in China. Continuous flooding (CF)
    was widely used by rice farmers until the 1980s but has been gradually replaced
    by the present midseason drainage (regarded as farmer''s practice or FP in this
    paper) (Zou et al., 2009, Liang et al., 2016). A direct comparison between AWD15
    and FP is more meaningful, but previous studies on AWD15 by other researchers
    were based on a comparison between AWD15 and CF. In our previous studies, we found
    that AWD15 was advantageous over both CF and FP in saving water (Liang et al.,
    2016). However, more evidences are needed to confirm the superiority of AWD15
    to FP. In the current study, we grow rice under two water management (AWD15 and
    FP) and four fertilizer-N rates (0, 90, 180, 270 kg N ha−1) to determine the effect
    of water and N input on grain yield, water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency.
    We hypothesize that rice yield, water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency
    will be higher under AWD15 and would be optimal at a certain N input level. 2.
    Material and methods 2.1. Experimental site description The experiments were conducted
    at the Baiyun Experimental Farm of Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences
    in Guangzhou (113°23′E, 23°17′N, altitude of 41.0 m), Guangdong, China, during
    2014 and 2015 late seasons (August to November). The field had been continuously
    cropped with puddled rice twice a year and was surrounded by flooded rice fields
    during the two cropping seasons. The field soil had pH of 5.5 and contained 23.1
    g kg−1 organic matter, 13.6 mg kg−1 available P, and 82.9 mg kg−1 available K.
    Mean rainfall (from 1992 to 2015) was 1106 mm in the early cropping season (April–July),
    and 577 mm in the late season (August–October). The area has a mean temperature
    of 21–23 °C, relative humidity of 75%, and solar radiation of 12.4 MJ m−2 day−1.
    2.2. Experimental treatments and design The experiment was laid out in a split-plot
    design with water regime (W) as the main plot and nitrogen (N) treatment as the
    subplot. Two W and four N treatments were tested with three replicates and 24
    subplots (4.2 m × 6.8 m) were established in the field. The W treatments were
    farmers’ irrigation practice with mid-season drainage (FP) and safe AWD at the
    −15 cm threshold level for irrigation (AWD15). The N treatments were 0, 90, 180,
    and 270 kg N ha−1, respectively. All plots were separated each other with bunds
    and had a separate draining outlet to drain water into ditches. The bunds were
    covered with plastic film (0.15 mm) which was inserted to 40 cm depth below soil
    surface to minimize seepage between plots. In order to reduce or avoid the residual
    effect of pre-cropping fertilizers, rice was grown and no fertilizers was applied
    in the same field in the previous season of both years. The field was irrigated
    with underground water which came from a depth of 126 m below ground surface and
    was pumped into a water storage tank. The water inflowed into each plot directly
    through PVC pipeline. The variety in this experiment was Tianyou3618, which is
    recognized as a super hybrid rice by the Ministry of Agriculture of China and
    has been widely planted in South China. In both water treatments, the field was
    flooded to a water depth of 3–5 cm for the first 10 days after transplanting to
    promote seedling establishment and control weeds. Two water treatments were imposed
    afterwards. In the FP treatment, field water was kept at 2–5 cm until the tiller
    number reached 80% of the expected panicle number at harvest, a midseason drainage
    (about 25 DAT) was imposed to depress excessive growth of tillers until 10 days
    after the visible panicle initiation occurred. The field was re-flooded and the
    water was kept at 2–5 cm during the entire heading stage. After heading, shallow
    wetting irrigation was carried out. Whenever the water disappeared in the field,
    2–3 cm of water was applied to re-flood the field. At 7 days before harvest, the
    field was allowed to dry. In the AWD15 treatment, timing of irrigation was based
    on the water depth in the field water tube installed in each plot (Lampayan et
    al., 2015a). Irrigation time and frequency thus varied slightly across replicates.
    The tubes were installed in the field to 15 cm depth below the soil surface. When
    the ponded water disappeared in the water tubes, then irrigation was applied to
    re-flood the field up to 5 cm above the surface. At initial flowering (when 10%
    of the panicles had fully emerged from the boot), AWD15 treatment was suspended
    and water depth was maintained at 2–5 cm depth to reduce the risk of spikelet
    sterility caused by water-deficit stress at this sensitive stage. After completion
    of the flowering stage, the AWD15 cycles were repeated until 7 days before harvest.
    Nitrogen in the form of urea was applied four times: 30% as basal, 30% at 25–27
    DAT, 30% at 40–45 DAT, and 10% at heading. Seeds were sown in the seedbed on 21
    July in 2014 and 20 July in 2015. Transplanting was done on 7 August in 2014 and
    8 August in 2015 at a hill spacing of 13.3 cm × 30 cm with two seedlings per hill.
    Potassium (135 kg K2O ha−1 as KCl) was applied in two equal splits (as basal and
    at 25–27 DAT), and phosphorus (45 kg P2O5 ha−1 as single super-phosphate) was
    applied as basal. Both basal K and P fertilizer were incorporated in the field
    one day before transplanting. Pests, diseases, and weeds were intensively controlled
    to avoid yield loss. 2.3. Measurements and calculations A network of pipes was
    installed in the experimental plots to facilitate irrigation and measurement of
    water flow. Irrigation water applied in each plot was measured using a flow meter
    attached between the pump and the distribution pipe. The seasonal water input
    per treatment from transplanting to harvesting was the sum of all irrigation water
    applied and total rainfall. Soil moisture tension at 15-cm soil depth was monitored
    using SR1075 tensiometers installed in all plots. Daily standing water depths
    (aboveground) and perched water depths (below ground) in all plots were monitored
    manually by measuring the water level inside the field water tubes (Lampayan et
    al., 2015a) with a meter stick. In FP plots, water tubes also were installed to
    monitor daily ponded water depths as done in AWD15, but its irrigation application
    followed its own mode regardless of change of water depth. Daily groundwater dynamics
    were monitored using 200-cm-long PVC pipes with a diameter of 5 cm, whose lower
    circular surface (120 cm) was perforated with 0.5 cm holes at 2 cm intervals.
    The groundwater tubes were installed in the center of the main experimental field
    to a depth of 150 cm from the soil surface (Yao et al., 2012). Water table readings
    were taken at 0900–1000 h every 2–3 days depending on weather condition and water
    depth of the field. Plant samples were taken at mid-tillering (MT), panicle initiation
    (PI), heading (HD), and physiological maturity (MAT) to determine aboveground
    biomass and leaf area index (LAI) during the season. At each sampling, a total
    of eight plants (0.32 m2) were sampled and brought to the laboratory for biomass
    and leaf area measurements. Plants were partitioned into green leaf blade, stem
    plus leaf sheath, dead leaves (if any), and panicles (if any). The area of the
    green leaves was measured using a leaf area meter (LicorTM LI3100) and the LAI
    was determined. Biomass was determined after oven-drying of plant samples at 70
    °C for 3 days. Grain yields were determined at maturity by taking 5 m2 plant samples
    at the center of each plot. Grains were separated from the rachis, filled and
    unfilled grains were separated, and the total weight of filled grains was determined.
    Filled grains were dried in an oven at 70° to a stable weight, and grain yield
    was calculated at 14% moisture content. Plant samples were taken for the determination
    of yield components (panicle density, number of spikelets per panicle, 1000-grain
    weight, and percent filled spikelets) from 12 hills (0.48 m2) adjacent to the
    harvest area. Total water productivity (WPT) was calculated as kg grain m−3 total
    water input (rainfall and the sum of all irrigations, excluding land preparation
    and water consumption during the first 10 days after transplanting). Tissue N
    concentration was determined by micro Kjeldahl protocol of digestion, and titration
    (Bremner and Mulvane, 1982) to calculate aboveground total N uptake. The various
    parameters of nitrogen use efficiency below were evaluated according to Bandaogo
    et al. (2015). Physiological N use efficiency (PE) was calculated as grain yield
    divided by total N uptake. The apparent recovery efficiency of N (ARE) was estimated
    based on the increase in plant N uptake at maturity divided by the fertilizer
    N rate. Agronomic N use efficiency (AE) was calculated as the increase in grain
    yield per kg N applied. Partial factor productivity of applied N (PFP) was calculated
    as grain yield divided by total N applied. Weather data were logged using a Vantage
    Pro2TM Weather Station (Davis Instruments, USA) throughout the year. Seasonal
    means and sums were reported over the growth duration from transplanting to physiological
    maturity. 2.4. Data analysis Data analysis was carried out using the balanced
    analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the linear mixed model of STATISTICA 9.0 (StatSoft
    Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA) for a split-plot design with water as the main factor and
    nitrogen as the sub-factor. Mean comparison among treatments was based on the
    least significant difference (LSD) test at the 5% probability level. 3. Results
    3.1. Weather The rainfall during all the growth stages of the late season rice
    was 279.6 mm in 2014 and 295.4 mm in 2015. The rainfall from transplanting to
    PI accounted for more than 85% of total rainfall during the crop growth period
    in both years. Mean daily maximum temperature was higher in 2014 than that in
    2015 (Table 1). Cumulative evaporation in 2014 was also higher than in 2015. Mean
    daily sunshine from transplanting to harvest was 6.1–6.8 h in 2014, also higher
    than in 2015 (5.3–6.4 h). Table 1. Cumulative rainfall and pan evaporation, mean

    changes In 2014, mean groundwater depth (before terminal drainage was imposed)
    was 48 cm below the ground surface, with fluctuations from 8 to 87 cm in the season
    (Fig. 1). The average groundwater in the 2015 experimental field, however, was
    shallow and the depth fluctuated from about 1 to 39 cm below the ground surface,
    with a seasonal mean depth of 20 cm (before terminal drainage was imposed). Download

    were presented for each year (Fig. 2). The water depth of the FP plots dropped
    to −10 cm below the soil surface only at mid-season in both years (Fig. 2). In
    other periods, the water level was higher than that of AWD15. As expected, more
    irrigations were needed for FP (4 more irrigations than AWD15) in both years.

    was significantly correlated with field water level dynamics. When groundwater
    level became deeper, soil water tension at 15 cm became higher (Fig. 3). In both
    years, soil water tension in the FP plots was higher than that of the AWD15 plots.
    The mean soil water tensions in 2014 were higher than those in 2015 because of

    3.3. Water consumption and productivity Total water input was higher in 2014 than
    in 2015 (Table 2). Total water input across water treatments ranged from 326.8
    to 430.8 mm in 2014 and from 54.3 to 189.2 mm in 2015. The irrigation water input
    and the total water input of FP were significantly higher than that of AWD15 each
    year. Table 2. Irrigation and total water input (irrigation plus rainfall) during

    N ha−1. In both years, there were neither significant W × N interactions nor significant
    effects of N, with respect to irrigation water input, total water input, and number
    of irrigations. Water treatments significantly affected all those parameters in
    both years (Table 2). Total rainfall from transplanting to maturity (279.6 mm
    in 2014 and 295.4 mm in 2015) represented approximately 43% and 73% of total water
    input during the same period in 2014 and 2015, respectively (Table 2). The irrigation
    water input in FP plots was 104 mm and 135 mm higher than in AWD15 plots in 2014
    and 2015, respectively. On average, AWD15 saved 24% irrigation water in 2014 and
    71% in 2015 compared with FP. In 2014, AWD15 received 5 fewer irrigations than
    FP from 10 DAT to maturity. Fewer irrigations were applied for both W treatments
    in 2015 due to more abundant rainfall for both FP and AWD15. The total water productivity
    (WPT) in AWD15 plots was significantly higher than in FP plots in both years,
    being 15.6% and 40.9% higher in 2014 and 2015, respectively. WPT was also significantly
    affected by N across the two years. Higher WPT were observed in plots that received
    more N-fertilizer (N2 and N3). The difference in WPT was not significant between
    N2 and N3. There was no significant W × N interaction on WPT in both years of
    the experiment. 3.4. Crop growth and development In general, LAI increased from
    the mid-tillering to heading stage (Table 4). In both years, there was no significant
    interaction between W and N treatments on LAI. The LAI at all measured growth
    stages was not significantly affected by W, but it was significantly affected
    by N. Across N treatments in both years, LAI tended to increase with N-fertilizer
    rate, and N3 was highest among the treatments at MT, PI and HD, although N3 was
    not significantly different with other nitrogen treatments at MT in 2015. Similarly,
    there were no significant W × N interactions for the crop growth rate (CGR). W
    treatments exerted no significant effect on CGR during MT-PI, PI-HD, and HD-MAT
    periods, but CGR was significantly affected by N in each year (Table 3). Across
    N treatments in both years, the trends of CGR values at different growth stages
    were consistent: N3 was highest among the treatments at MT-PI and PI-HD periods.
    During HD-MAT stage, N2 was highest, although the difference was not significant
    between N2 and N3. No significant interactions between W and N were found on the
    aboveground dry biomass (Table 4). Only N significantly affected the above ground
    biomass, which increased with higher nitrogen application. There were no insignificant
    differences between FP and AWD15 in aboveground dry biomass at all measured growth
    stages. Table 3. Total aboveground dry weight at mid-tillering (MT), panicle initiation
    (PI), heading (HD) and physiological maturity (MAT) under different water and

    significant W × N interactions nor significant effect of W on grain yield and
    yield components. N significantly affected grain yield, panicle number, spikelets
    per panicle, and filled spikelets in both years. However, 1000-grain weight was
    only significantly affected by N in 2015 (Table 5). Grain yield was highest with
    N3 (although not significantly different from N2) in both years, and lowest with
    N0 in both years. The number of filled spikelets was generally increased by the
    N application rate, with lowest values in N0 in both years. There was a significant
    difference between N1 and N3 in 2014, while in 2015, there were no significant
    difference among N1, N2 and N3. W had no significant effect on any yield components.

    N-use efficiency In both years, total N uptake increased significantly with increased
    N-fertilizer rates. In general, physiological N use efficiency (PE), apparent
    recovery efficiency of N (ARE), agronomic N use efficiency (AE), and partial factor
    productivity of applied N (PFP) decreased in both years as the rate of N application
    increased, but the significance of the difference was inconsistent between different
    treatments. No significant differences were observed between AWD15 and FP in both
    years in all other parameters for in total N uptake, and N use efficiencies (PE,
    ARE, AE, and PFP), except for ARE in 2015 which was significantly lower in AWD15
    than in FP (Table 6). There was no significant interaction effect between W and
    N on the total N uptake and other parameters of N use efficiencies over the two
    years of study (Table 6). Table 6. Total N uptake, physiological N use efficiency

    conditions of our experimental site are representative for many large-scale irrigated
    lowland rice areas in South China. The groundwater table of this area is comparable
    to that of other places in Hubei, Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces where relevant
    experiments were previously conducted (Cabangon et al., 2004, Yao et al., 2012,
    Liang et al., 2016). In addition, the sum and distribution of rainfall during
    the rice growing seasons in 2014 and 2015 are similar to those in the past 24
    years in Guangzhou (data not shown). So conclusions about water and N-fertilizer
    management drawn from this study are applicable for rice production in South China.
    Across the two years, grain yield in 2014 was higher than in 2015 by about 0.560
    Mg ha−1 probably due to the longer sunshine duration in 2014. Rice performs better
    when grown under longer sunshine duration and thus more solar radiation (Zhao
    and Li, 1993, Lampayan et al., 2015a). Across the two water treatments, the grain
    yield of AWD15 is comparable to that of FP in the late cropping season in South
    China. Even for super rice hybrid variety Tianyou3618, which consumes more water
    for high grain yield, AWD15 is still a better choice to save water and maintain
    high yield. Similar results of grain yield under AWD have been reported previously
    (Cabangon et al., 2004; Yao et al., 2012, Liang et al., 2016). The stability of
    yield under AWD15 may be attributed to adequate water supply even if the water
    table of field falls to −15 cm below the soil surface. At a threshold of 15 cm
    in water depth below the soil surface, the soil water potential is more than −20
    kPa, and the lower parts of the rice roots (generally extending 15–20 cm deep)
    will still be able to take up enough water from the saturated soil and the perched
    water in the root zone (Bouman et al., 2007b, Lampayan et al., 2015a, Carrijo
    et al., 2017). Our previous study similarly showed that the soil water potential
    (−20 kPa) during the rice-growing season was usually not a limitation factor for
    plant growth and yield formation when AWD15 was practiced (Liang et al., 2016).
    Positive results with increase in grain yield under AWD15 (compared with CF) also
    was reported, which was associated with an increase in panicle number, more spikelets
    per panicle or higher grain weights (Yang et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2015, Carrijo
    et al., 2017). These findings contrast with a survey on the application of AWD
    in Southeast Asian countries conducted by Bouman and Tuong (2001). They reported
    that AWD displayed yield reduction ranging from 0 to 70% in most experiments if
    compared with continuously flooded controls. The large variability in the performance
    of AWD was attributed to differences in the irrigation interval, monitoring tools
    and standards across the experiments. The use of the generic term “AWD” has led
    to the confusion that AWD reduced yields, and therefore Bouman et al. (2007a)
    suggested to emphasize the terminology of “safe” AWD. Therefore, precaution should
    be taken by properly defining the AWD being practiced. Also, other factors such
    as hydrological conditions, and weather should be considered carefully. In particular,
    strict regulations, such as maintaining the threshold of water depth, must be
    carried out to guarantee its safe use. Besides the on-station experiments for
    two years, our on-farm experiments in several areas in Guangdong province also
    demonstrated the effectiveness of AWD15 in saving water and maintaining grain
    yield (Liang et al., 2016). Although the experiments were conducted in the late
    cropping season in both years, it can be postulated that comparable or even better
    results could be obtained in the early cropping season because of more rainfall,
    more humid weather and higher groundwater table in the early season. As shown
    in this study, the AWD15 further saved irrigation water by about 20% and enhanced
    water input productivity by about 30% in comparison with FP. Up to now, all evidence
    we accumulated confirms that AWD15 is a safe irrigation regime and is appropriate
    for wide adoption in the rice-planting areas in South China. In both years there
    were neither significant W × N interaction nor significant effects of W, with
    respect to grain yield, leaf area index, crop growth rate, and biomass, implying
    that the growth and grain yield of rice plants is not impeded by water stress
    under AWD15. Application of N significantly increased both irrigation water input
    and water productivity in comparison with N0 (Table 2). Plant growth and photosynthetic
    ability have been repeatedly demonstrated to increase with N supply. The increased
    irrigation water input under higher N rate was caused by increased water absorption,
    and the increased water productivity was due to much higher grain yield under
    N application condition in rice (Ren et al., 2015). In both years, the highest
    yield was obtained when nitrogen fertilizer application was 180 kg N ha−1. We
    did not find significant W × N interaction on total N uptake at maturity (Table
    6), which is in line with previous studies (Yang et al., 2008, Yao et al., 2012).
    At the zero N level (N0), AWD15, on average, increased plant N accumulation from
    heading to maturity in 2014 and 2015 by 11% and 64%, respectively (data not shown).
    We also found that the leaves turned green unexpectedly again during late ripening
    stage under this condition. This can explain that ARE (apparent recovery efficiency
    of N) was significantly lower under AWD15 in 2015 (Table 6). This phenomenon was
    not observed under other treatments. One possible reason may be that the elongation
    of roots of rice plants and the absorption of nitrogen from soil can be promoted
    under low nitrogen and water saving conditions (Chu et al., 2014, Sun et al.,
    2014). This merits further investigation. Sun et al. (2012) found that there was
    significant interaction effect between different irrigation modes and N application
    strategies on grain yield and NUE of rice, but the grain yield and NUE were higher
    under intermitted irrigation (like AWD15) than under other water treatments. They
    also suggest that the combination of water alternation mode with application of
    panicle N fertilizer should be widely adopted in China to solve the problems of
    water shortage and low NUE in China (Sun et al., 2012). Recently, panicle N fertilization
    was recommended for rice production in China to increase grain yield and improve
    NUE in the field (Sun et al., 2012, Zhong et al., 2007). High proportion of panicle
    N fertilizer was adopted in this experiment. Under such N management strategy,
    the grain yield was not affected by irrigation mode, indicating the AWD15 water-saving
    technology can be safely used without changing existing fertilizer management
    recommendations in South China. The tool used in AWD15 is the perforated field
    water tube. It is simple and practical and it can be fabricated with cheap materials
    such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, bamboo, plastic water bottles, or even
    tin cans (Lampayan et al., 2015b). In addition to its convenience, AWD15 technology
    can be widely used in irrigated lowland soil types, such as clay (Cabangon et
    al., 2011), loam (Cabangon et al., 2003), soil clay (Lampayan et al., 2015a),
    silty clay/clay loam (Cabangon et al., 2004). In Guangdong province almost 90%
    of irrigated rice land belongs to the above soil types (Lin et al., 2005), and
    therefore, are suitable for AWD15 practices. In rice production, irrigation water
    input and the labor cost can be reduced by applying AWD15 technology. In 2014,
    the annual planting area of rice in the South China region (Guangdong, Guangxi,
    Fujian, and Hainan province) amounts to 5.04 Mha, accounting for 17% of the total
    planting area of China, and the total water consumption of rice is about 2343
    × 108 m3 in this region (Yao et al., 2014, National Bureau of Statistics of China,
    2015). If AWD15 can be widely adopted in this region, as much as 1.12 × 1011 m3
    (nearly half of water input) irrigation water could be saved annually. A 10% reduction
    in water used in irrigated rice would free up to 150,000 million m3, corresponding
    to about 25% of the total fresh water used globally for non-agriculture purposes
    (Klemm, 1999). In Asia, lowland rice is grown on more than 30% of the irrigated
    land and accounts for 50% of irrigation water (Barker et al., 1999). Freeing a
    small portion of water from rice areas can have large social and environmental
    effects if this conserved water is used for urban, industrial, or environmental
    purposes. In rice production of China, continuous flooding irrigation (CF) had
    once been widely used by rice farmers until 1980s. It was gradually replaced by
    the present farmer''s practice (FP), which keeps continuous standing water before
    heading except 15–20 days of mid-season drainage for controlling unwanted tillers
    (Zou et al., 2009). After heading, irrigation is applied when water disappears
    from the soil surface. Up to now, midseason drainage practice is still dominant
    in the lowland irrigated rice production in China. Compared with CF, FP water
    management practice can reduce irrigation water input and increase water use efficiency
    (Zou et al., 2009, Liang et al., 2016). When AWD15 is practiced, continuous standing
    water will not be observed in the field except for the first 10 days after transplanting
    and during the flowering stage. The field will alternately experience flooding
    and drying conditions. For FP, the timing of reflooding is judged with experiences.
    For AWD15, reflooding begins when water depth (monitored accurately by water table
    tubes) reaches threshold value of −15 cm. As standing water exists for shorter
    periods in the field, water loss from runoff or evaporation can be reduced under
    AWD15 regime. The advantage of AWD15 over CF in water saving has been documented
    by many researchers (Carrijo et al., 2017). However, a direct comparison between
    AWD15 and FP is more meaningful. Only if AWD15 is better than FP, rather than
    CF, will farmers be willing to adopt this new technology. In our previous study,
    we found the superiority of AWD15 over FP under a single N input level (Liang
    et al., 2016). This study demonstrated that AWD15 is advantageous over FP in a
    range of N levels. As a third generation of watering technology after CF and FP,
    AWD15 is expected to be widely applied in the rice production in China for saving
    water and protecting environment. 5. Conclusions Even compared to farmer''s water
    management practice with mid-season drainage (FP), AWD15 can still save 24%–71%
    of irrigation water and reduce 4–5 irrigation applications without yield loss
    under different N levels. No significant interaction effect between W and N application
    rates was found on grain yield and NUEs in both years. The optimal nitrogen rate
    was 180 kg N ha−1 under both water management regimes. The current recommended
    nitrogen rate under the conventional water management is applicable under AWD15
    irrigation practice and AWD15 can replace FP to further increase water use efficiency
    in South China. Acknowledgments This work is supported by the “Closing the Rice

    the 1980–2003 period, we analyzed the relationship between crop yield and three
    climatic variables (minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation)
    for 12 major Californian crops: wine grapes, lettuce, almonds, strawberries, table
    grapes, hay, oranges, cotton, tomatoes, walnuts, avocados, and pistachios. The
    months and climatic variables of greatest importance to each crop were used to
    develop regressions relating yield to climatic conditions. For most crops, fairly
    simple equations using only 2–3 variables explained more than two-thirds of observed
    yield variance. The types of variables and months identified suggest that relatively
    poorly understood processes such as crop infection, pollination, and dormancy
    may be important mechanisms by which climate influences crop yield. Recent climatic
    trends have had mixed effects on crop yields, with orange and walnut yields aided,
    avocado yields hurt, and most crops little affected by recent climatic trends.
    Yield-climate relationships can provide a foundation for forecasting crop production
    within a year and for projecting the impact of future climate changes. Article

    65 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Models that simulate the effects of water
    stress on crop yield can be valuable tools in irrigation. We evaluated the crop
    growth simulation model EPICphase and the model CROPWAT on their ability to simulate
    maize (Zea mays L.) grain yield reduction caused by water stress under semiarid
    conditions. The simulation of evapotranspiration (ET), harvest index (HI), leaf
    area index (LAI), and final biomass was also evaluated. Data from three field
    experiments were used to test the models. In one sprinkler-irrigated experiment,
    different water amounts (0–592 mm) were applied, producing a continuous water
    deficit. The other two experiments were flood-irrigated and water stress was imposed
    at given development stages of maize. EPICphase simulated the ET with a root mean
    square error (RMSE) of 40 mm. The regression of the EPICphase simulated vs. measured
    values of HI and yield had intercepts that were not significantly different from
    0 and slopes not different from 1. EPICphase overestimated the biomass in the
    more water-stressed treatments (intercept of simulated vs. measured values = 5.25
    t ha−1) due to overestimation of LAI. Modifications of EPICphase relative to the
    effect of water stress on LAI growth and on the light extinction coefficient improved
    the simulations of LAI, biomass, HI, and yield. CROPWAT calculated maize grain
    yield with a RMSE of 14% but overestimated ET in the flood-irrigated treatments
    . Better simulation of ET by EPICphase makes this model more consistent for calculating
    yield reduction due to water stress. Abbreviations BD bulk density ET evapotranspiration

    RMSE root mean square error In the semiarid areas of the world, high yields of
    field crops can be attained if irrigation water is applied properly. However,
    because of the high demand for irrigation water by crops in these areas, yields
    can be very low if water is not supplied adequately both in quantity and in time
    (Musick and Dusek, 1980; Singh and Singh, 1995), and water can be misused. This
    misuse could lead to excessive percolation, which has environmental consequences
    and diminishes water reserves. In addition, water scarcity in these areas is increasing.
    Thus, optimized use of the available water for irrigation is very important. Models
    that adequately simulate the effects of water stress on yield can be valuable
    tools in irrigation management. These models can be used to optimize the allocation
    of irrigation water between different crops and/or the distribution of water during
    the crop season (Bryant et al., 1992; Cabelguenne et al., 1995; Cabelguenne et
    al., 1997; Howell et al., 1989; Stewart et al., 1975; Wenda and Hanks, 1981).
    Complete testing of a model is needed before it can be used for irrigation planning
    in a particular area. This will ensure that the model correctly simulates the
    main physiological processes that affect crop yield under water stress. Among
    the models that can be used for this task, a distinction can be made between crop
    growth simulation models, which simulate main processes of crop growth (leaf area
    growth, biomass production and partition), such as CERES-maize (Jones and Kiniry,
    1986), CropSyst (Stockle et al., 1994), EPIC (Williams et al., 1984), GOSSYM (Reddy
    et al., 1997), and SUCROS (Penning de Vries and Van Laar, 1982), and those models
    that do not explicitly simulate crop growth but that have been developed for irrigation
    planning. CROPWAT (Smith, 1992) is the best known among the latter. In this model,
    crop potential evapotranspiration (PET) is calculated using the crop coefficient
    concept (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977). The effect of water stress on crop yield
    is considered by using the crop response factors (Stewart et al., 1975) that have
    been derived from different experiments (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979). However,
    the crop response factor can be different between locations because of different
    evaporative demand (Howell, 1990). Crop growth simulation models can be divided
    between those more mechanistic (such as SUCROS) and those more empirical (such
    as CERES-maize, CropSyst, and EPIC). However, in contrast to CROPWAT, these crop
    growth simulation models usually differentiate between the effects of water stress
    on photosynthesis (or biomass production, in the more empirical models), leaf
    area growth, and harvest index (Cabelguenne et al., 1999; Reddy et al., 1997;
    Villalobos et al., 1996). Those are the main processes affected by water stress
    (Hsiao, 1990), so if they are adequately simulated, these crop growth simulation
    models could be more universally applicable than models such as CROPWAT. In addition,
    crop growth simulation models usually provide simulated data from other processes
    (such as nitrate leaching) that can be important in the efficient management of
    water resources. Maize is one of the most important crops in irrigated semiarid
    areas of the world. It has high irrigation requirements and is very sensitive
    to water stress (Rhoads and Bennett, 1990). Recently, decreasing prices of maize
    grain in Europe have decreased the net return from this crop. Thus, adequate irrigation
    management of maize is important not only for saving water, but also for improving
    crop profitability. Our aim was to evaluate and compare a crop growth simulation
    model and the model CROPWAT in their ability to simulate maize yield reduction
    caused by water stress under different types of water stress (continuous or at
    given development stages). The simulation of evapotranspiration, harvest index,
    leaf area index, and final biomass was also evaluated. Among the existing different
    crop growth simulation models, we chose EPICphase (Cabelguenne et al., 1999).
    This model is mainly empirical and is generic, allowing simulation of different
    crops. EPICphase is a modification of the extensively tested EPIC model (Beckie
    et al., 1995; Bryant et al., 1992; Cabelguenne et al., 1990; Cavero et al., 1999a;
    Kiniry et al., 1992a), especially improved for water and N stress modeling. EPICphase
    does not use crop coefficients to calculate crop PET. The ET component of this
    model is Ritchie''s model (Ritchie, 1972). Materials and methods Field Experiments
    Three experiments were conducted at Zaragoza, Spain (41°43′ N, 0°48′ W, 225 m
    altitude) on the experimental farm of the Agronomic Research Service (SIA). The
    soil is loamy and is classified as Typic Xerofluvent. The climate is Mediterranean
    semiarid with mean annual maximum and minimum daily air temperatures of 20.9 and
    8.5°C, respectively, precipitation of 322 mm, and reference ET around 1200 mm
    (Faci and Mart ı ´ nez-Cob, 1991). Continuous Water Deficit Experiment This experiment
    was conducted in 1986 in a field with soil depth >1.5 m. Other soil characteristics
    are given in Table 1. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cv. Georgia was planted on 28
    February to dry the soil profile and was incorporated in the soil with the preplant
    tillage operations. Maize cv. Adour 640 (FAO 700) was planted on 30 April in rows
    0.75 m apart at a planting density of 60000 plants ha−1. Fertilization consisted
    of 80 kg ha−1 P2O5 and 32 kg ha−1 K2O applied preplanting and 200 kg ha−1 N applied
    sidedress. Weeds were controlled with atrazine [6-chloro-N-ethyl-N′-(1-methylethyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine]
    applied preemergence at 2 kg a.i. ha−1. Maize was irrigated with a sprinkler line
    source 50 m long located in the middle of the field and parallel to the maize
    rows. Different irrigation treatments were established as a consequence of different
    distances of maize rows from the sprinkler line source (Hanks et al., 1976). (Fig.
    1). Perpendicularly to the sprinkler line source, six plots at 3-m intervals were
    defined on both sides of the sprinkler line source. This was done at two different
    places along the sprinkler irrigation line, so there were four replications for
    each of the six water amount treatments (T1 to T6 treatments) (Fig. 1). Cylindrical
    metal cans (0.155 m in diameter and 0.165 m high) painted orange were located
    at soil level in each plot to measure the amount of irrigation water applied (Fig.
    1). Collected water was measured immediately after each irrigation event. The
    cans were raised as the crop grew, so they were always above the maize canopy.
    Thirty-nine irrigation applications were made between 9 June and 30 September,
    each 20 to 30 min in duration. The most irrigated treatment (closest to the sprinkler
    source line, T6) received a water amount (irrigation plus rain) corresponding
    to the maize ET calculated with a Class A evaporation pan using a pan coefficient
    of 0.8 (Faci, 1986) and the crop coefficients for maize (Doorenbos and Pruitt,
    1977). Volume per application was 8 to 36 mm in this treatment. Seasonal irrigation
    water amounts applied in the different plots were 0 (T1), 88 (T2), 289 (T3), 437
    (T4), 567 (T5), and 592 mm (T6). Soil water measurements were made with a neutron
    probe (Model 3320, Troxler Electronic Laboratories, Research Triangle Park, North
    Carolina1) in 16 of the 24 plots (Fig. 1) during the crop season to a depth of
    1.80 m at 0.3-m intervals beginning 0.15 m from the soil surface. The neutron
    probe was calibrated by taking 12 undisturbed soil samples at different depths
    where the volumetric water content was determined. The regression of the neutron
    probe measurements against the measured moisture content of soil samples had an
    r2 of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.016 m3 m−3. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer Experimental

    1.41 0.283 0.078 Evapotranspiration (mm) in each plot was determined from the
    soil water balance equation , where P is precipitation (mm), I is irrigation (mm),
    R is runoff/run-on (mm), SD is soil water depletion (mm), and D is drainage (mm)
    below the rooting depth considered (1.5 m). Runoff/run-on was assumed to be insignificant
    because the field was level-smoothed to zero slope and bordered with earth berms
    and irrigation volume per application was low. Soil water depletion was calculated
    as the difference between the beginning and ending total soil water contents for
    the season. Drainage below the rooting depth was not determined, so ET could not
    be calculated directly from the measurements. However, ET was estimated by using
    the drainage simulated from the EPICphase and CROPWAT models. Saad (1999) found
    good agreement between measured and EPIC-simulated drainage in a lysimeter study
    with maize in our experimental site. Nguyen et al. (1996) also reported accurate
    simulation of drainage in lysimeters with EPIC. This estimated ET will be referred
    to here as adjusted ET. Precipitation totaled 204 mm during the crop season. Crop
    phenology was monitored during the growing season. Length and maximum width of
    leaves from three plants per plot were measured at different times during the
    season and leaf area was calculated by multiplying the leaf length by the leaf
    width and by 0.75, according to Norman and Campbell (1989). LAI was calculated
    from leaf area and plant density. The aboveground biomass of plants from 5-m transects
    of the two rows on either side of the catch cans (7.5-m2 area) were harvested
    (Fig. 1). Plants were divided into leaves, stems, cobs, and grain and dried at
    70°C. Grain yield (dry matter), dry biomass and HI were determined. Experiments
    of Water Stress at Different Maize Development Phases Experiments were conducted
    in 1995 and 1996 to study the effect of water stress at different stages of maize
    development using flood irrigation. Soil depth was variable within the field due
    to a gravel layer between 0.8 and 1.7 m in depth. Mean soil characteristics are
    provided in Table 1. Maize cv. Prisma (FAO 700) was planted on 17 May 1995 and
    16 May 1996 in rows 0.75 m apart. The planting density was 80000 plants ha−1.
    Fertilization consisted of 150 kg ha−1 P2O5 and 150 kg ha−1 K2O applied preplant
    and 300 kg ha−1 N, one-third applied preplant and the rest as sidedress. Weeds
    and pests were adequately controlled. Crop phenology was monitored during the
    growing season. The maize growing season was divided into three phases: (i) from
    emergence to tassel emergence, (ii) from tassel emergence to milk stage of grain,
    and (iii) from milk stage to physiological maturity. In each of the phases, irrigation
    was supplied either in the amount necessary to meet the PET of the crop (I treatment),
    or at about one-third of this amount (0 treatment) by skipping some of the irrigation
    events or applying a lower depth (Table 2). Under water scarcity in areas that
    are surface-irrigated, water volume per application cannot be easily modified
    and water stress usually develops because the number of irrigation events is reduced.
    An additional treatment (iii) consisting of half of the water used in the fully
    irrigated treatment (III), was included. Irrigation management in the fully irrigated
    treatment was based on the common practice in the area, which consists of flood
    irrigation at 10- to 14-d intervals, with application depths ranging from 55 to
    79 mm. Irrigation amounts and timing were adjusted according to the average reference
    ET measured in a weighing lysimeter (Faci et al., 1994) and to the crop coefficients
    for maize (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977). Table 2. Irrigation water amounts applied

    66   60   255 The experimental design was a randomized block with three replicates.
    The experimental plot unit was 50 m2 and was delimited by ridges to allow the
    establishment of different irrigation treatments. Irrigation was applied from
    gated pipes with a total discharge into each plot of 3.4 L s−1. Water applied
    at each irrigation event was measured with a volumetric flow meter (MC0100, McCrometer,
    Hemet, CA). Soil water content was determined gravimetrically in each 0.2- (1995)
    or 0.3-m (1996) layer down to a 1.2-m depth at planting and at harvest. The same
    neutron probe used in the 1986 experiment was used in 1995 to measure the soil
    water content, approximately every week, during the crop season to a depth of
    1.20 m at 0.2-m intervals. The neutron probe was calibrated by taking 24 undisturbed
    soil samples at different depths where the volumetric water content was determined
    . ET in each plot was determined with the soil water balance equation as in the
    1986 experiment. The gravimetric measurements of soil water content were used
    to determine the soil water depletion. Precipitation during the crop season was
    38 mm in 1995 and 103 mm in 1996. In 1995, the aboveground biomass of maize plants
    was sampled from 0.5 m2 of each plot at different times during the crop season.
    Biomass partitioning was determined. Both years, leaf area at flowering was determined
    as in the continuous water deficit experiment. Leaf area index was determined
    for other stages of growth in 1995 by multiplying the dry weight of leaves by
    the specific leaf area using a value for maize of 15 m2 kg−1 (Cavero et al., 1999b).
    The percentage of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted by the
    crop was measured every 1 or 2 wk with a light probe (Sunfleck ceptometer, Decagon
    Devices, Pullman, WA). Fraction of PAR intercepted was calculated from measurements
    taken above and below the maize canopy at noon. The light extinction coefficient
    (k) was calculated from the intercepted PAR and the LAI data (Flenet et al., 1996).
    At harvest, the aboveground biomass from an area of 9 m2 (1995) or 15 m2 (1996)
    was collected, divided into different parts as in the 1986 experiment and dried
    at 70°C. Grain yield (dry matter), dry biomass, and HI were determined. Models
    EPICphase EPICphase was developed from EPIC to improve the simulation of the effects
    of water and N stresses in crops. Complete details can be found in Cabelguenne
    et al. (1999). The main differences between EPIC and EPICphase are that EPICphase
    incorporates division of the developmental period of the crops into physiological
    phases, crop specific-water extraction capacities, accelerated decline of leaf
    area under water stress, drought adaptation of sunflower and soybean, inclusion
    of the effects of water and N stress on the harvest index, and the possibility
    for a crop to have an ET higher than the reference ET. In EPICphase, daily actual
    ET is equal to crop PET if the available water for the crop is higher than crop
    PET, but it is equal to the available water for the crop if the available water
    is lower than crop PET. The available water for the crop depends on soil water
    content, rooting depth, rooting shape, and soil properties. EPICphase considers
    that water stress has daily effects on the LAI growth, the biomass production,
    and the HI. The model also considers that the effect of water stress on HI differs
    with the physiological phases of the crop. In the case of maize, it considers
    that HI is affected by water stress during Phase 2 (maximum LAI to end of anthesis)
    and Phase 3 (end of anthesis to pasty grain) with reductions being double for
    the same water stress intensity in Phase 2 as compared with Phase 3. A conical
    soil water extraction pattern with depth is used for maize according to its rooting
    distribution and density with depth (Cabelguenne and Debaeke, 1998). Crop parameter
    values for maize used in this study were basically the same as those that Cabelguenne
    et al. (1999) proposed for southwestern France. However, for some parameters that
    are cultivar-dependent, such as maximum leaf area index (which also depends on
    planting density [Kiniry et al., 1992b]), development of leaf area index with
    time, fraction of season when LAI declines, duration of different developmental
    phases, and harvest index, values were obtained from the experimental data (Table
    3). These values were derived from the fully irrigated treatment in the 1986 (cv.
    Adour) and 1995 (cv. Prisma) experiments, because they could be calculated from
    the measurements made (LAI, phenology, and HI). Data from the other five (1986
    experiment), eight (1995 experiment), and nine (1996 experiment) treatments were
    not used to derive those values. Table 3. EPICphase crop parameter values used

    by Cabelguenne et al. (1999) were used for some crop parameters for both cultivars.
    Base temperature was set to 8°C and maximum temperatures to 25°C as in EPIC (Williams
    et al., 1984). The light extinction coefficient was set to 0.50 according to our
    data and Cavero et al. (1999b). The water extraction beyond the wilting point
    was set to 0.8 of the wilting point according to the soil water measurements.
    The maximum rooting depth considered was 1.50 m according to the soil water measurements
    from this study. Similar maximum depths are reported in other studies (Cabelguenne
    and Debaeke, 1998; Dardanelli et al., 1997). The biomass energy conversion was
    considered to be constant for the entire period before the decline of leaf area,
    but a lower value (30 instead of the default value of 39 kg MJ−1) was used for
    Adour due to the lower biomass production. This round value, which was derived
    to fit the biomass production in the fully irrigated treatment of the 1986 experiment,
    is within the range of values found for maize (Birch et al., 1999; Kiniry et al.,
    1989) and close to those found for other cultivars at our site (Cavero et al.,
    1999b). The original Penman equation was used to calculate the PET because of
    its accuracy in our conditions (Faci et al., 1994). Dugas and Ainsworth (1985)
    have pointed out the consequences of using different methods to calculate the
    PET in crop model simulations. Daily weather data from a nearby climatic station
    was used as model input. The maximum ET of maize was allowed to be 20% higher
    than the PET according to our climatic conditions (ASCE, 1996). Cropwat CROPWAT
    5.7 was used (Smith, 1992). Default values suggested for maize were used, except
    values for phase duration (derived from the experiments’ phenological data), maximum
    crop coefficient (which was set to 1.20 as in EPICphase), and maximum rooting
    depth (set to 1.5 m) (Table 4). The crop coefficient for the initial phase was
    calculated for each experiment, considering the time interval between wetting
    events, the evaporative power of the atmosphere and the magnitude of the wetting
    events (Allen et al., 1998). (Table 4). Average monthly data of rain and reference
    ET, calculated with the original Penman equation, were used as inputs. Table 4.

    PET using crop coefficient values. The actual ET is equal to the crop PET if soil
    water depletion is below the allowable depletion limit. Above that limit, ET is
    reduced linearly as soil water depletion increases. Yield is reduced in each crop
    growth stage according to the crop response factor (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979),
    which indicates the percent of yield reduction per percent of ET reduction compared
    to PET. Main differences between EPICphase and CROPWAT are summarized in Table

    Runs Because of the nonuniform soil depth in the field used in the experiments
    of 1995 and 1996, the models were run for each individual plot, considering soil
    depth as the only soil characteristic that was different between plots. Soil depth
    in every plot was determined during the installation of access tubes for neutron
    probe soil water measurements and interpolation of those data with SURFER (1995).
    This was not done for the 1986 experiment, where soil depth was uniform. Data
    Analysis The mean measured values were compared with the mean simulated values
    of ET, yield, final biomass, LAI, and HI for each irrigation treatment. Bias and
    RMSE (calculated as described by Retta et al. [1996]) and linear regression of
    simulated vs. measured values were also used to evaluate model performance: where
    S and M are the simulated and measured values for the ith observation and N is
    the number of observations. Results and discussion EPICphase Simulations Model
    simulations indicated that there was drainage below the rooting depth in some
    treatments. Thus, the adjusted ET, which was calculated using the EPICphase simulated
    drainage values, was compared with model simulations of ET (Fig. 2). Low values
    of bias (−1.51 mm) and RMSE (39.8 mm) indicated a good agreement between adjusted
    and simulated values of ET. Saad (1999) found good agreement between measured
    and EPIC-simulated ET in maize. In our study, there was a tendency to overestimate
    the ET when the adjusted ET was low and to underestimate the ET when it was high
    (intercept > 0, slope < 1) (Table 6). Some disagreement in the 1995 and 1996 experiments
    could be due to the fact that soil water depletion was calculated to a depth of
    1.20 m, because in these experiments soil water was measured only until that depth,
    while the model considered a rooting depth of 1.5 m. However, this difference
    was not important, because in our conditions soil water depletion below 1.20 m
    in maize fields is low (Cosculluela and Faci, 1992) and because EPICphase simulates
    low water uptake below this depth due to the rooting characteristics of maize
    (Cabelguenne et al., 1999). Different studies have found that root activity of
    maize under irrigation is usually concentrated in the top soil (Dardanelli et
    al., 1997; Otegui et al., 1995) with little water depletion below 1.0 m in depth
    (Gordon et al., 1995). Figure 2 Open in figure viewer Comparison of seasonal simulated

    regression of simulated vs. measured values had intercepts not significantly different
    from zero and slopes not significantly different from 1 (P > 0.05) (Table 7).
    However, there was a tendency to overestimate the aboveground biomass in the more
    water-stressed treatments (3, 4, Table 7). This was possibly due to the fact that
    the model overestimated the LAI under water stress during the crop season (Fig.
    4). The maximum LAI was clearly overestimated in most of the treatments (Fig.
    3, Table 7). Steduto et al. (1995) reported similar problems with simulations
    of wheat LAI under water stress with EPIC. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer Comparison

    significantly different from 1 or y-intercept significantly different from zero
    at the 95% confidence level. Hsiao (1990) has indicated that although attention
    in the past has been directed to the effects of water stress on source intensity
    (rate of photosynthesis per unit of source area), source size (leaf area) is considerably
    more sensitive to water stress, and therefore would be more critical during the
    period of canopy development. Boyer (1970) pointed out that in maize and other
    crops leaf expansion is more sensitive than photosynthesis to water stress. Several
    other studies have shown the greater sensitivity of maize leaf expansion to water
    stress (Acevedo et al., 1971; Beadle et al., 1973; Tanguilic et al., 1987). In
    these studies, transpiration rate was also measured. Although previous studies
    were conducted under different conditions, a relationship between leaf photosynthesis
    or leaf elongation rate (LER), expressed as a fraction of the potential leaf photosynthesis
    or LER (without water stress), and the transpiration rate, expressed as a fraction
    of the potential transpiration rate, could be derived (Fig. 5). In EPICphase,
    water stress affects LAI growth and biomass production (photosynthesis) according
    to the ratio of actual to potential ET (water stress reduction factor). The relationship
    used in EPICphase between the water stress reduction factor and the reduction
    of biomass production is similar to the results of the cited studies for the reduction
    of photosynthesis (Fig. 5). However, the relationship used in EPICphase between
    the water stress reduction factor and the reduction of LAI growth is very different
    from the results of the cited studies for the reduction of LER (Fig. 5). This
    relationship makes model simulations of LAI growth less sensitive to water stress
    than it was found to be in the mentioned studies (Fig. 5). Figure 5 Open in figure
    viewer Relationships of the leaf photosynthesis or leaf elongation against the
    relative transpiration rate obtained from different studies with maize and the
    relationships used in EPICphase and EPICphase modified to reduce biomass production
    or LAI growth as function of the water stress reduction factor (actual ET/potential
    ET) Reduction of leaf area growth decreases the solar irradiance intercepted by
    the crop. The consequences of this reduction in terms of biomass production and
    yield will depend on the time period of crop growth when it happens and the final
    LAI attained (Bradford and Hsiao, 1982; Singh and Singh, 1995). In determinate
    species such as maize, the reduction of LAI can be irreversible (Bennett et al.,
    1989). When plants are under water stress, leaf rolling is a mechanism to reduce
    transpiration of the crop (Bradford and Hsiao, 1982; Turner, 1986). Leaf rolling
    reduces the solar irradiance intercepted by the crop because it reduces the light
    extinction coefficient (k), as was found in our experiments (Fig. 6). However,
    EPICphase does not take into account this reduction of k as leaf rolling develops.
    Figure 6 Open in figure viewer (A) Mean values of the light extinction coefficient
    (k) calculated for the different treatments in the flood-irrigated experiments
    at maize flowering. (B) Relationship between the water stress reduction factor
    (actual evapotranspiration [ET]/potential ET) and the correction factor for k
    used in the modified EPICphase model The rate of water uptake required to sustain
    normal plant growth at any given time depends not only upon soil water status
    but also upon the atmospheric conditions and properties of the plants (Ahuja and
    Nielsen, 1990). Under semiarid conditions, water stress during the vegetative
    growth phase is not uncommon. The reduction in leaf area growth leads to reduced
    PAR interception, and consequently to reduced biomass production and yield (Muchow,
    1989). In other studies, EPICphase has been tested for maize in a milder climate,
    where water stress usually develops later (Cabelguenne et al., 1999). Testing
    of crop models often does not include LAI measurements, but in the case of water
    stress this seems to be important. We made an additional run of EPICphase considering
    a modified effect of water stress on LAI growth that was intermediate between
    the measured results in the different experiments mentioned (Fig. 5). In this
    run, we also considered a reduction of the light extinction coefficient as water
    stress increases with a function derived from our experimental data (Fig. 6).
    Simulation of the effect of water stress on LAI growth during the crop season
    was improved with the modified EPICphase model (Fig. 4). Simulation of the maximum
    LAI was especially improved as shown by the lower bias and RMSE values and the
    higher r2 and lower intercept values of the regression of simulated vs. measured
    values (Fig. 7, Table 7). Simulation of ET was slightly improved (Table 6). Modifications
    of EPICphase improved the simulation of biomass (lower bias and RMSE, intercepts
    closer to 0) (Table 7) because both modifications altered the solar irradiance
    intercepted by the crop. The small improvement in HI simulation (lower bias and
    RMSE, slope closer to 1) may have been due to the slightly better simulation of
    ET (Table 6). Yield in EPICphase is calculated as the product of biomass and HI.
    Thus, simulation of yield was improved (lower bias and RMSE, slopes closer to
    1) (Table 7), mainly because of the improved simulation of biomass. In any case,
    the improvement in biomass and yield simulation was not very significant 3, 7.
    This was possibly because reductions of leaf area when LAI is >4 usually have
    small consequences for biomass production (El-Sharkawy and Cock, 1987). Considering
    only the treatments where the measured biomass reduction was higher than 25% with
    respect to the fully irrigated treatment, the RMSE for biomass was reduced by
    24% from the original EPICphase model, compared with 11% reduction when all the
    data were included. Thus, the modified model improved simulation of biomass production,
    especially when water stress was greater. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer Comparison
    of maize grain yield, aboveground biomass, harvest index, and maximum leaf area
    index (LAI) measured and simulated with EPICphase modified. Each point represents
    the mean of each treatment of the different experiments. The line represents the
    1:1 relationship To derive the relationship between water stress and reduction
    of leaf elongation, we used long-term (at least 24 h) responses of maize because
    the time step of EPICphase is 1 d. However, Acevedo et al. (1971) found very short-term
    responses of maize leaf elongation to water stress and reduction of leaf elongation
    rate when there was no apparent reduction of transpiration. They also found that
    after severe water stress, leaf elongation rate did not recover to a similar level
    as nonstressed plants. NeSmith and Ritchie (1992) have indicated that water stress
    in maize causes not only short-term effects, such as reduced daily LAI increase,
    but long-term effects, such as reduced leaf number and leaf area. The reduction
    in expansion rate of leaves while the blade is growing inside the whorl of the
    plant is ignored by the model, but it affects final leaf size and therefore LAI.
    Those effects could explain why the simulations of LAI by the modified EPICphase
    model seem to be delayed as compared with the measured values in the more water-stressed
    treatments (Fig. 4). Such effects constitute a limit to LAI modeling as it is
    done in EPICphase, even modified. Ben-Haj-Salah and Tardieu (1996) have recently
    proposed to model maize LER taking into account the reduction in LER due to evaporative
    demand. Some disagreement between measured and simulated values is expected because
    EPICphase does not consider some processes, such as the direct effect of water
    stress on root growth and the changes in biomass partitioning between shoots and
    roots as a consequence of water stress (Debaeke et al., 1996). Besides, if water
    stress is severe enough, the photosynthetic capacity of leaves can be affected
    irreversibly (Boyer and McPherson, 1975), leading to lower biomass production
    than expected. CROPWAT Model Model simulations indicated that there was drainage
    below the rooting depth, as in the case of EPICphase runs. As with EPICphase,
    the adjusted ET, calculated using the CROPWAT simulated drainage values, was compared
    with the model-simulated ET (Fig. 2). The agreement between adjusted and simulated
    values of ET was less than with EPICphase, as shown by the higher bias and RMSE
    values and the lower values for the slope and higher values for the intercept
    of the regression of simulated against adjusted ET (Table 6). CROPWAT overestimated
    ET mainly in the flood-irrigated experiments . In general, reduction of maize
    yield in the different irrigation treatments was adequately addressed by CROPWAT,
    with mean simulated values mostly within one standard deviation of the measured
    values (Fig. 8). Figure 8 Open in figure viewer Comparison of measured and simulated
    yield reduction with EPICphase modified and CROPWAT in the different experiments.
    Values are means of each treatment; error bars represent standard deviations Comparison
    of the Two Models Comparison of the models’ performance was only possible in terms
    of drainage, ET, and grain yield reduction. In the case of EPICphase, simulated
    yield reduction was calculated as a fraction of the mean yield in the fully irrigated
    treatment. In general, simulated drainage was slightly higher with the EPICphase
    model (Fig. 9). However, EPICphase simulated drainage losses at around 70 mm for
    the two most irrigated treatments in the 1986 experiment, while the CROPWAT model
    simulated insignificant losses for these treatments. As indicated, Saad (1999)
    found good agreement between measured and EPIC-simulated drainage in a lysimeter
    study with maize at our site, which suggests that drainage losses were underestimated
    by CROPWAT in these treatments. Figure 9 Open in figure viewer Comparison of the
    drainage below the rooting depth simulated with EPICphase and CROPWAT. Each point
    represents the mean of each treatment of the different experiments. The diagonal
    line represents the 1:1 relationship. Numbers inside the symbols indicate the
    number of points that are coincident The poorer simulation of ET with CROPWAT
    was possibly related to the fact that EPICphase considers water extraction from
    deep soil layers to be limited, the limitation being dependent on crop species
    due to differences in root distribution and density (Turner, 1986). However, CROPWAT
    does not consider this limitation, so it simulated higher soil water depletion,
    and consequently higher ET. This higher soil water depletion simulated by CROPWAT
    could also be responsible for the lower simulated drainage. Another reason for
    the poorer simulation of ET by CROPWAT could be that EPICphase calculates ET using
    the Ritchie model. When flood irrigation is used and a small number of irrigations
    are applied until the crop completely covers the soil, the Ritchie model could
    better calculate the ET, especially during the initial period (10% cover). The
    use of a mean value of the crop coefficient for the initial period by CROPWAT,
    even if different values were used for the experiments, led to simulated ET values
    of 51 and 92 mm for 1995 and 1996, respectively, while EPICphase simulated an
    ET of 44 and 66 mm. The interpolation of climatic data made by CROPWAT to calculate
    the daily water balance could also be responsible for the discrepancies. Both
    models followed a similar trend in yield reduction between the different treatments
    in all the experiments, which was similar to the observed trend (Fig. 8). No difference
    between model performances was found (RMSE was 16.3 % for EPICphase modified and
    14.0 % for CROPWAT). Both models underestimated maize yield when water stress
    was imposed during the vegetative phase but irrigation was applied in any of the
    subsequent phases. This could be related to the conditioning effect indicated
    by some authors (Stewart et al., 1975; Jama and Ottman, 1993), which reduces the
    consequences of late water stress if the crop has suffered water stress during
    the vegetative period. However, Garrity et al. (1983) indicated that the magnitude
    of a drought stress conditioning response will depend on the genotype used, the
    phenological timing of the treatment and the irrigation scheduling, which makes
    modeling it difficult. The poorer simulation of ET by CROPWAT in the flood-irrigated
    experiments indicates that results from this model should be considered with some
    caution. In addition, CROPWAT uses developmental time in days, whereas EPICphase
    uses degree-days, which makes calculations of development stages more accurate
    and has positive consequences for yield calculations. Conclusions Our results
    indicated that EPICphase can be used to calculate maize yield reduction under
    water stress in semiarid conditions. The model was tested under two different
    water stress experiments, where stress occurred either continuously or at given
    growth phases, which better illustrated its performance. However, the model must
    be modified to adequately address the effect of water stress on leaf area growth.
    The modified model that takes into account this question, as well as the reduction
    of the light extinction coefficient as a consequence of leaf rolling, improved
    the simulations of maize LAI, biomass, HI, and yield under water stress. Improvement
    was greatest for those treatments where LAI and biomass reduction were highest.
    The model CROPWAT adequately calculated yield reduction caused by water stress,
    which makes this model a valuable tool for irrigation planning in maize. However,
    the model overestimated ET in two of the three years, so maize yield reductions
    calculated by CROPWAT should be considered with caution. Comparison of the two
    models indicated that there is no advantage in using one or the other in terms
    of yield reduction calculation due to water stress. However, better simulation
    of ET by EPICphase makes this model more consistent, even if more input data are
    needed.SURFER 1995 Acknowledgments This work was supported by the CICYT (HID96-1380-C02-02).

    of rice intensification (SRI) techniques was conducted in Chiba, Japan during
    the 2008 rice-growing season (May–September) with eight treatment combinations
    in a split–split plot design (S–SPD) to observe the potential of SRI methods under
    the temperate climatic conditions in Japan. Intermittent irrigation with alternate
    wetting and drying intervals (AWDI) and continuous flooding throughout the cropping
    season were the two main-plot factors, while the effects of age of seedlings and
    plant spacing were evaluated as sub and sub–sub plot factors, respectively. The
    experiment results revealed that the proposed AWDI can save a significant amount
    of irrigation water (28%) without reduced grain yield (7.4 t/h compared with 7.37
    t/h from normal planting with ordinary water management). Water productivity was
    observed to be significantly higher in all combinations of practices in the intermittent
    irrigation plots: 1.74 g/l with SRI management and AWDI as compared to 1.23 g/l
    from normal planting methods with ordinary water management. In addition, the
    research outcomes showed a role of AWDI in minimizing pest and disease incidence,
    shortening the rice crop cycle, and also improving plant stand until harvest.
    Synergistic effects of younger seedlings and wider spacing were seen in tillering
    ability, panicle length, and number of filled grains that ultimately led to higher
    productivity with better grain quality. However, comparatively better crop growth
    and yields when using the same SRI practices with ordinary water management underscore
    a need for further investigations in defining what constitute optimum wetting
    and drying intervals considering local soil properties, prevailing climate, and
    critical watering stages in rice crop management. Similar content being viewed

    Challenges, and Opportunities in Rice Production Chapter © 2017 Challenges and
    opportunities in productivity and sustainability of rice cultivation system: a
    critical review in Indian perspective Article 08 October 2021 Introduction Challenges
    in maintaining the sustainability of rice farming have been increasing with the
    increased scarcity of and competition for water resources, stagnant or declining
    yield levels with low grain quality, and increasing production costs due to high
    dependence on agri-inputs. However, despite these constraints, rice production
    must rise dramatically over the next generation to meet the world’s food needs
    and especially those of the poor. Hence, producing more rice with less resource
    input is a formidable challenge for ensuring the food, economic, social, and water
    security of the Asian region. One strategy proposed is the system of rice intensification
    (SRI) as a more efficient, resource-saving, and productive way to practice rice
    farming. It involves changes in certain management practices which jointly provide
    better growing conditions for rice plants, particularly in the root zone, than
    those presently given plants grown under traditional practices. SRI is a set of
    ideas and insights that emphasize the use of younger seedlings (<15 days) planted
    singly and at wider spacing, together with the adoption of intermittent irrigation,
    organic fertilization, and active soil aeration to the extent possible (Uphoff
    2007; Stoop et al. 2002). SRI, developed in Madagascar with the help of Malagasy
    farmers, involves reduced water applications, including adoption of Alternate
    Wet and Dry Irrigation (AWDI) as a part of a new strategy of rice intensification,
    growing rice under mostly aerobic soil conditions. The AWDI approach to cultivating
    rice, increasingly used in parts of Asia, especially in China, Japan, and India,
    means that rice fields are not kept continuously submerged but are allowed to
    dry intermittently during the rice-growing period (Van der Hoek et al. 2001).
    AWDI can increase the productivity of water at the field level by reducing seepage
    and percolation during the crop-growth period. While yield increases have been
    the focus of much of the discussion and evaluation of SRI, here we are also concerned
    with water productivity (see “Water savings and water productivity” section) because
    of its importance for sustainable rice production. SRI’s remarkable yield increases
    seem to be achieved only when all of the SRI components (AWDI; use of young seedlings
    singly planted at wider spacing; frequent weeding in a soil-aerating manner; and
    application of organic manures as much as possible) are used in combination. The
    relative importance and contributions of each of the individual components of
    the system are currently being studied in different research projects, and there
    do appear to be synergistic relationships among the components. Rice has ever
    since been the staple food for people in Japan, and it has been the mainstay of
    Japanese agriculture. It covers 1.67 million ha with an average productivity 6.54
    t/h (IRRI 2008). The conventional rice farming involves the use of normal seedlings
    (>21 days) planted in a clump of four or five seedlings at a closer spacing of
    30 × 18 cm2; provided with a continuous irrigation up to 5–7 cm throughout the
    cropping season. Despite the marvelous achievements in rice production over the
    past 100 years, production costs associated with conventional rice farming in
    Japan are still many times higher than in other tropical Asian countries because
    of exorbitant land prices, costs for the excessive use of agri-inputs, and the
    high opportunity cost of farm labor. Increasing production cost in addition to
    the scarcity of and competition for natural resources and growing awareness on
    eco-product has also underscored the scope of using SRI in Japan. Actually, many
    of the SRI elements have been tried by Japanese farmers and rice scientists for
    their effectiveness over the past 50 years (Horie et al. 2005). These practices
    although they cover important areas of rice crop management, however, lack a combined
    study using different SRI components to assess SRI as a system. Moreover, on-farm
    demonstrations in many tropical and sub-tropical countries have shown the significance
    of SRI methods with respect to grain yield and water savings, but few attempts
    have been made to observe the efficiency and productivity of SRI elements in temperate
    climatic environments. The current study, therefore, was undertaken; to observe
    the effects of different components of SRI on rice crop performance and productivity,
    to evaluate key SRI components with respect to the crop health, water savings,
    and water productivity, and to assess the potential of the SRI in the temperate
    climatic environment in Japan. Materials and methods This study was conducted
    in Chiba, Japan during the rice season of 2008 (May to September). The experimental
    site is situated at 35°52′ North latitude and 139°59′ East longitude, and at an
    altitude of 11 m above mean sea level. Field research was carried out under natural
    environment. The soil of the experimental site was clayey loam with fairly good
    soil fertility, with pH of 6.4, organic matter 2.78% (Walkey and Black method),
    nitrogen (N2) 0.218% (Macro-Kjeldahl method), phosphorus (P2O5) 77.75 kg/ha (Olsen’s
    method), and potash (K2O) 131 kg/ha (neutral normal ammonium acetate method).
    Soil was homogeneous in both the SRI and traditional plots selected for the experimentation
    (Fig. 1) Fig. 1 Map showing the study area in Kashiwa farm, Chiba, Japan Full
    size image Experiment details Treatments and their combination The experiment
    was conducted using one of the most popular rice cultivars in Japan, Koshihikari.
    Experimentation was laid out in split–split plot design (S–SPD) with two alternative
    irrigation regimes in the main plots (AWDI at 10 day intervals with 1–2 cm water
    during wet period; and continuous flooding up to 5–7 cm throughout the growing
    season); age of seedling (14 or 21 days after sowing) was the variable evaluated
    in sub-plots; and spacing (30 × 30 vs. 30 × 18 cm2) was considered as the sub–sub
    plot factor. Altogether there was eight treatment combinations replicated thrice
    for the experimentation. The treatment combinations were shown in Table 1. Table
    1 Treatment details during 2008 rice-growing season in Chiba, Japan Full size
    table Irrigation management This was a prominent feature of the experiment. Two
    methods of irrigating the rice crop were used in two different adjacent plots.
    The first plot was designed for intermittent irrigation (1–2 cm) with alternate
    wet and dry periods, whereas the other was equipped with devices for continuous
    irrigation (up to 5–7 cm depth) throughout the rice-growing season. When determining
    the irrigation schedule, major emphasis was laid on critical stages of water requirement
    in the given climatic situation. Water level and frequency of wetting and drying
    periods for SRI in Indonesia (Sato and Uphoff 2007; Keisuke et al. 2007) and ordinary
    management for conventional rice farming in Japan were taken into consideration.
    Intermittent irrigation was applied at 10-day intervals starting 15 days after
    transplanting, up to 75 days. Irrigation was stopped thereafter until harvest
    as the precipitation water supplemented the water levels in the respective plots
    was reasonably sufficient for crop production. Other cultural practices As the
    main purpose of this study was to observe the effects of key SRI components, such
    as age and number of seedlings, plant spacing, and irrigation methods, on rice
    crop performance, other management factors were kept constant at each experimental
    unit. Integrated crop management (ICM) practices were employed to promote eco-friendly
    production on all test plots. A single application of pre-emergence herbicide
    was applied 5 days after transplanting, followed by three manual weedings (at
    15, 30, and 45 days after transplanting). There was no use of external chemical
    fertilizers (based on soil analysis) or of pesticides. Parameters observed Crop
    measurements Vegetative and reproductive parameters Observations were taken at
    regular intervals for several vegetative, phenological and yield-governing parameters.
    Several key parameters like plant height, number of tillers per plant (and per
    m2), days to flowering and maturity, and grain and straw yield were used to assess
    the treatment effects on crop growth and performance. Effects on crop stand Some
    rice varieties are very sensitive to lodging before they reach maturity. Koshihikari
    is one of these varieties. Therefore, data were recorded to observe the effect
    of water management on plant stand until harvest. Field crops were observed periodically
    and scored on a scale of 1–10 (1 for erect plants, and 10 for completely lodged
    ones) depending upon the degree of plant inclination toward ground surface. The
    values were converted into percentages in order to calculate mean figures for
    the test plots. Effects on weed population, insect and pests, and disease occurrence
    Weed populations, their species, and time required for weeding were taken into
    consideration. Similarly, types, intensity, and extent of damage by insect pests
    and diseases were also observed during the investigation. Water savings and water
    productivity Water quantities required in different plots The quantity of water
    required to maintain the appropriate water level in the main plots during each
    irrigation was noted and summed up to calculate the total amount of water applied
    to a plot throughout the cropping season. Water saving percentage was calculated
    by using the following formula: $$ {\text{Water savings}}\; ( {\text{\% )}}\;
    = \;{\frac{{{\text{Water\;consumed\;in\;flooded\;plot}} - {\text{Water\;consumed\;in\;AWDI\;plot}}}}{\text{Water\;consumed\;in\;flooded\;plot}}}\;
    \times \; 1 0 0 $$ Furthermore, the trend of water consumption and water loss
    was also calculated by using the amount of water applied in each irrigation. Water
    productivity Water productivity, defined as crop productivity per unit of water
    consumed, was calculated as follows: $$ {\text{Water}}\;{\text{productivity}}\;
    ( {\text{kg/l)}}\; = \;{\frac{{{\text{Grain yield}}\; ( {\text{kg/h)}}}}{{{\text{Total
    water consumed}}\; ( {\text{l/h)}}}}} \, $$ Data analysis Field data were recorded
    at intervals of 10 days. They were compiled and subjected to mean calculation
    and analysis of variance using Microsoft Excel and MSTAT-C software. Mean separation
    was done by LSD, and simple correlations were run between selected parameters
    using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software wherever necessary.
    Results and discussion Hydro-meteorological description of the study area Table
    2 summarizes the climatic data in the experimental site during the rice season
    (May–September) of 2008. Average daily mean temperature was 22.34°C, with the
    hottest days (up to 35.9°C) in August, whereas the average daily minimum temperature
    was 19.1°C. The average monthly sunshine hour was recorded as 134.6 h during the
    cropping season, with maximum received in July (163 h). The lowest was recorded
    in September (119.2 h). The rainy season started from April and lasted up to October.
    Total precipitation in the location during the period May to September was recorded
    as 1,052 mm, with August receiving the highest amount of rainfall (up to 148.5
    mm/day). The relative humidity (RH) commenced rising up from March–April (>60%)
    and reached to its extreme (average of 80%) in July–August, according to the Abiko
    Meteorological Station Chiba (2008). Table 2 Meteorological data during the rice
    season of 2008 in Chiba Japan Full size table Crop growth and performance Crop
    measurements Overall, SRI components exhibited the anticipated synergistic response
    over vegetative and reproductive characteristics. However, except for the variables
    of time to maturity, plant lodging percentage, and water productivity, no significant
    positive effect of intermittent irrigation was seen in crop measurements. Instead,
    other parameters were observed to be comparatively better in the continuously
    flooded plots. The number of roots, effective tillers/panicles, panicle length,
    number of filled grains, and some other yield-contributing characteristics were
    not directly associated with alternate wetting and drying, and were seen to be
    responding to use of younger seedlings and wider spacing (Tables 3 and 4). Plots
    with 14-day-old seedlings transplanted singly at 30 × 30 cm2 spacing exhibited
    remarkably larger root and stem diameters, and more productive leaf surface area.
    However, soil aeration after a drying period that led to cracks in the surface
    might have had some positive effects on the tillering ability of plants in intermittent
    plots. Table 3 Effects of irrigation methods, age of seedling and spacing on vegetative
    and reproductive characteristics during the rice season, 2008 Full size table
    Table 4 Interaction effects due to the irrigation methods, age of seedling and
    spacing on vegetative and reproductive characteristics during the rice season,
    2008 Full size table Tables 3, 4, and 5 present the key vegetative and yield-related
    components as affected by the major treatments and their interactions in the experiment.
    A good indication of plant productivity is seen in the root numbers and panicle
    characteristics. Although this was mainly affected by the age of seedlings, spacing,
    and their interactions, it also was contributed to satisfactorily by AWDI. Among
    other factors, grain weight (1,000-grain weight) and filled grain percentage in
    intermittently irrigated plots combined with younger seedlings and wider spacing
    to give better results than did the same combinations under continuous flooding.
    Although the AWDI plots took 2–3 days more time to begin flowering than in the
    same treatment combinations in flooded plots, the rice took 3–5 days less time
    than in continuously flooded plots to become mature. The effects of AWDI in synchronized
    flowering and grain maturity were clearly demonstrated. However, plots with younger
    seedling took slightly more time to get ready for harvest. Table 5 Interaction
    effects due to the irrigation methods, age of seedlings and spacing on vegetative
    and reproductive parameters during the rice season, 2008 Full size table Figure
    2 shows the general growth pattern observed in all treatment combinations. The
    growth trajectory followed a sigmoid curve in all treatment combinations tracking
    four successive growth stages throughout the cropping season. Based on the growth
    parameters, these can be distinguished as early vegetative stage (1–40 DAT), late
    vegetative stage (40–70 DAT), flowering stage (70–90 DAT), and grain filling and
    ripening stage (90–120 DAT). Fig. 2 Growth pattern in different treatments Full
    size image Although AWDI plots with younger seedlings and wider spacing produced
    more yield (7.41 t/h) as compared to the ordinary plots transplanted with normal
    seedlings at closer spacing (7.37 t/h), in general, rice yields under non-flooded
    conditions were lower compared with the same combinations in continuously flooded
    plots. The highest yield (8.06 t/h) was recorded in the treatment with younger
    seedlings (14 days old) transplanted singly at wider spacing (30 × 30 cm2) under
    flooded conditions, followed by normal seedlings (21 days with four seedling in
    a clump) transplanted at wider spacing (30 × 30 cm2) in similar water management.
    This underscores the possibility of revising alternate wet and dry intervals so
    as to avoid water stress during critical growth periods. The effects of reduced
    irrigation, wider spacing, and age and number of seedlings on vegetative and yield-contributing
    traits were also reported by a number of researchers. Krishna et al. (2008), Vijayakumar
    et al. (2001), and Udyakumar (2005) reported an enhanced tillering, early flowering,
    better yield and grain quality in SRI plots as compared to traditional methods.
    Gani et al. (2002) also reported an increased conversion of tillers into productive
    tillers/flowering panicles with the adoption of SRI management. The favorable
    influence might be due to efficient utilization of resources and less inter- and
    intra-space competition under SRI management, which may be assigned as the reason
    for superiority in these yield attributes of rice and consequently increased yield.
    Senthilkumar (2002) with the younger seedling combinations observed an increased
    leaf area and subsequent increase in photosynthetic activity through increased
    biomass production as a major portion of photosynthates accounted for dry matter,
    and all these factors favored the yield components under SRI practices. Similarly,
    Rajesh and Thanunathan (2003) reported the use of wider spacing as the reason
    for less below- and above-ground competition for better grain filling, higher
    grain weight, and more number of filled grains per panicle. In the meantime, optimum
    supply of irrigation water with soil aeration resulted in higher nutrient availability,
    subsequently resulting in better source-to-sink conversion, and in turn this enhanced
    the production of more total number of seeds and filled seeds per panicle. However,
    Shrirame et al. (2000) and Jagannath et al. (1998) did not observe the effects
    of wider spacing on grain yield, straw yield, and harvest index (HI). Effects
    on crop stand Clearly visible difference of SRI elements was observed in the share
    of plant population that got lodged during maturity/harvesting. In the case of
    AWDI plots, the mean value of complete lodging ranged from 0 to 20%, whereas in
    continuously flooded plots it was between 33 and 80%. On average, the lodged plant
    population in the plots with young seedlings transplanted singly under AWDI was
    6.67% as compare to 93.33% in the case of plots with normal seedlings transplanted
    in a clump of four under ordinary water management (Table 5). It was clearly revealed
    that the impact of AWDI on plant stand until harvesting requires less time to
    harvest (28.5–55%) and produces better grain quality. Plant lodging was observed
    to be more during grain maturity up to harvest, i.e., after 108 days of transplanting
    in both of the sets of plots. The effects of reduced water application combined
    with the baby seedlings planted singly at wider spacing was also observed in a
    number of whitish, healthy, and well-functioning roots with larger diameter. The
    average proportion of whitish (functional) and black (looks decaying and non-functional)
    roots was 74:26 in the SRI management whereas it was 46:54 in ordinary plots,
    60 days after transplanting (before flowering). The more lodging in flooded plot
    could also be due to the degeneration of surface roots that remain in the top
    5 cm of the soil by the beginning of the plants’ reproductive stage, as suggested
    by Kar et al. (1974). Effects on cropping environment The study also revealed
    the scope for minimizing the incidence of insect pests and diseases with intermittent
    irrigation. Pest damage was observed more in continuously flooded plots planted
    with normal seedlings. There were no pests observed in the intermittent plots
    with young seedlings (Fig. 3), whereas disease problems were observed more often
    in continuously flooded plots planted with young seedlings (Fig. 4). Rice leaf
    folder (Cnaphalocrosis medinalis) was a major pest observed during 30–40 days
    after transplanting, whereas seedling blight caused by pathogenic fungi (Fusarium
    spp.) was a disease often observed in continuously flooded plots. Fig. 3 Larval

    Diseased/dead plants as affected by treatments Full size image Low incidence of
    diseases and pests in AWDI plot could be due to a less favorable environment for
    disease and pest development due to alternate wetting and drying periods. Chaboussou
    (2004) has reported that plants which are not subjected to chemical (inorganic)
    fertilization and agrochemical protection measures are more resistant to losses
    from pests or diseases, enough so that chemical protection becomes less necessary
    or uneconomic because of adverse effects on plant metabolism and nutrition. Increased
    weeding requirement with SRI has been considered as a major shortcoming of the
    innovation. It is generally assumed that weeds will become a major problem with
    intermittent irrigation. However, it is worth noting here that there was no extra
    time requirement for weeding in AWDI plots in this experiment. This could be the
    combined effect of having standing water on the field for a fortnight after transplanting,
    and the single application of a herbicide 10 days after transplanting in both
    sets of plots. However, arrowhead (Sagittaria spp.) was commonly observed in both
    sets of plots followed by some other narrow-leaved weeds. Weed occurrence was
    more after 40 days of transplanting but largely in the plot borders. As the rice
    plants had already reached the peak tillering stage and crop canopies completely
    shaded the land, there was no visible effect of weeds observed on plant growth
    and development. With no additional time requirement for weeding, it is estimated
    that younger seedlings transplanted at wider spacing requires 25% less time as
    compare to the normal seedlings transplanted at closure spacing at either water
    management, especially during manual transplanting and harvesting. Labor time
    savings was even more when comparison was made between SRI and conventional water
    management. No doubt, AWDI required some more time to adjust and readjust the
    irrigation controls to drain and irrigate the field on a regular basis, but this
    time was compensated for by the practice of consecutive drying periods instead
    of continuous flooding. This finding is consistent with the report of Anthofer
    (2004), who found no difference overall in labor inputs/ha between SRI and non-SRI
    cultivation. Furthermore, Sinha and Talati (2007) documented an 8% reduction in
    labor needed per ha, with 67% increase in net income. Li et al. (2005) reported
    that Chinese farmers considered labor-saving as the most attractive feature of
    SRI, ahead of 42% water saving and 38% increased income. However, ATS (1995) and
    Rakotomalala (1997) have reported that SRI methodology requires an estimated 38–54%
    more labor than traditional methods. According to Rakotomalala, 62% of the extra
    labor needed for SRI was for weeding and 17% was for transplanting. Some of the
    disagreement about SRI labor requirements may arise from how the fact that learning
    new practices itself takes time. The time required in the first or second year
    is likely to be more than when the practices have been mastered. In Madagascar,
    a comparison over 5 years found that SRI was labor-saving by years 4 and 5 (Barrett
    et al. 2004). In general, Asian farmers have been quicker to find, or to make,
    SRI labor-saving. Water savings and water productivity Evaluation of irrigation
    methods demonstrated significant effects on the amount of water required for irrigating
    a successful rice crop. The proposed AWDI saved 28% water compared to the amount
    of water required in continuously flooded plots (Table 6). It was also observed
    that rice plants required more water during their mid to late vegetative growth
    stage; however, this depends largely upon local soil and climatic condition. The
    study showed gradual increments in water quantity requirement until the flowering
    stage, with some minor fluctuations in intermittently irrigated plots. Table 6
    Water budgeting in the experimental plots (180 m2) through the cropping season
    (May to September 2008) in Chiba Japan Full size table In general, an average
    daily water loss in flooded plots was recorded as 0.7 cm, 0.9 cm and 1.2 cm during
    the periods 1–25, 25–50, and 50–75 days after transplanting, respectively. With
    AWDI, the loss was 0.8 cm, 1.1 cm, and 1.0 cm, respectively, in these plots during
    these periods (Table 6). The soil surface was observed to crack after three continuous
    days of no surface water in intermittent plots. In addition, a remarkable conversion
    of water to grain yield was observed when practicing AWDI (Table 4). Based on
    the amounts of water applied and respective grain yields with each treatment,
    water productivity was observed to be greatly enhanced by AWDI. Water productivity
    was highest (1.74 g/l) in the AWDI plots with younger seedlings and wider spacing,
    followed by 1.72 g/l in AWDI plots with younger seedlings and closer spacing.
    Water productivity was lowest (1.23 g/l) in continuously flooded plots with normal
    seedlings and closer spacing, slightly lower than the 1.30 g/l in flooded plots
    with younger seedlings and closer spacing. Continuously flooded plots yielded
    comparatively better than in AWDI plots, however, with lesser production water-wise
    in all combinations. Grain yield per unit of water applied was substantially higher
    with AWDI. Numerous studies conducted on the manipulation of depth and intervals
    of irrigation intended to save water have demonstrated that continuous submergence
    is not essential for obtaining high rice yields (Guerra et al. 1998). Bhuiyan
    and Tuong (1995) after conducting research over several years concluded that maintaining
    a significant depth of water throughout the season is not needed for high rice
    yields. About 40–45% of the water normally used in irrigating the rice crop in
    the dry season can be saved by applying water in small quantities, only enough
    to keep the soil saturated throughout the growing season, without sacrificing
    rice yield. Similar result was reported by Sato and Uphoff (2007) for AWDI under
    SRI management in Eastern Indonesia. Similarly, Hatta (1967), Tabbal et al. (1992),
    and Singh et al. (1996) have reported that maintaining a very thin water layer,
    at saturated soil condition, or alternate wetting and drying, can reduce water
    applied to the field by about 40–70% compared with the traditional practice of
    continuous shallow submergence, without a significant yield loss. Keisuke et al.
    (2007) and Davids (1998) also reported the reduction of irrigation water requirement
    for non-flooded rice by 20–50% compared to flooded rice, with the difference being
    strongly dependent on soil type, rainfall, and water management practices. Davids
    (1998), however, also reported that rice yields under non-flooded conditions decreased
    proportionally with reduced water application due to increased water stress. Anbumozhi
    et al. (1998) reported increased water productivity (1.26 kg/m3) in AWDI plot
    at 9 cm ponding depth compared to continuous flooding (0.96 kg/m3). Mao Zhi (1993,
    1996) also concluded that in Southern China, AWDI for rice should be more widely
    used because of its potential for saving water (20–35%), increasing water productivity
    (from 0.65–0.82 to 1.18–1.50 kg/m3 after the application of AWDI), while also
    increasing rice yield (15–28%), and improving the water and soil environment (soil
    oxygen content was increased by 120–200%). Conclusion and future needs Experiments
    and field testing of the SRI method of cultivating rice from different parts of
    the globe have demonstrated the utility of intermittent irrigation, use of young
    seedlings and wider spacing to achieve water saving, better crop performance,
    and higher productivity. This experiment also showed the potential of SRI components
    on crop performance and water productivity without reducing land productivity
    (yield per unit of land) compared to traditional cultivation methods. Based on
    the field experiment in Chiba, Japan, it can be concluded that SRI components
    have much potential for irrigated rice cultivation with dual benefits of resource
    saving and enhanced productivity. Use of younger seedlings (14 days) and wider
    spacing (30 × 30 cm2) proved to be better than other combinations with either
    method of water management. Even under normal cultivation, adoption of wider spacing
    gave more satisfactory yield than the closer spacing. At the same time, intermittent
    irrigation with alternate wetting and drying intervals was observed to be a suitable
    method for reducing insect pests of rice with less adverse effects on weed management.
    AWDI seems to have good potential as part of strategies for integrated pest management
    (IPM) and integrated disease management (IDM) in irrigated rice cultivation. This
    experiment revealed also the possibility of controlling weeds by using just a
    single dose of pre-emergence herbicide and by maintaining a shallow standing water
    depth for the first 15–20 days after transplanting (or until crop canopies completely
    shade the land), followed by maintaining AWDI. The study underscored a possibility
    of defining appropriate wetting and drying intervals considering the critical
    periods during the rice growth cycle when the yield is particularly sensitive
    to moisture stress. Because of the wide range of variability in topography, soil
    and climatic conditions across the location, it is important that comparative
    studies be done in different environments with the use of a common methodology
    to verify these practices as a way for water-wise production while maintaining,
    or increasing, crop yields. Hence, substantial research is needed to develop the
    most suitable irrigation schedules along with the use of younger seedlings (<14
    days) and wider spacing before recommending exact specifications for better yield
    and environment to the farm community. These schedules will always need to be
    adjusted to local soil and climatic conditions, with attention also to what is
    optimum for the variety used of all resources are to be used most productively
    and sustainably. The increased productivity of water and its resource-saving aspects
    are likely to be the critical factors that will make farmers and other stakeholders
    adopt AWDI in water-scarce environments, becoming increasingly common. References

    Get rights and content Highlights • We conducted a meta-analysis of crop yields
    following deep tillage (n = 1530). • Mean deep tillage effect on yield was slightly
    positive (6%) – but huge variability. • Deep tillage caused 20% yield increase
    on soils with root-restricting layers. • Silty loess soils have an increased risk
    of yield depression following deep tillage. • Deep tillage can improve the resilience
    of crops during droughts. Abstract The subsoil below the regularly tilled topsoil
    stores large nutrient stocks and can retain water even under drought conditions.
    Mechanical soil profile modifications, commonly referred to as deep tillage, could
    improve the plant availability of these subsoil resources. However, field studies
    on the benefits of deep tillage have delivered inconsistent findings. Therefore,
    we (i) conducted a meta-analysis of crop yield responses to subsoiling (loosening),
    deep ploughing (turning + loosening) and deep mixing of soil profiles, and (ii)
    reviewed the relationship between site properties, management practices, water
    availability and deep tillage-induced changes in yield. The meta-analysis was
    based on 1530 yield comparisons between deep and ordinary tillage at 67 experimental
    sites in mostly temperate latitudes. On average, deep tillage slightly increased
    yield (+6%). However, individual deep tillage effects were highly site-specific,
    including about 40% documented yield depression after deep tillage. At sites with
    root-restricting, mostly compacted soil layers, the crop yield response to deep
    tillage was 20% higher than at sites without such layers. In general, differences
    between deep tillage methods were less important than the presence of root-restricting
    soil layers. Soils with >70% silt (labile soil structure) showed an increased
    risk of negative deep tillage effects. In growing seasons with dry spells, positive
    deep tillage effects were greater than in average years. Topsoil fertilisation
    buffered both extremely positive and negative deep tillage effects. Our results
    suggest that deep tillage increases the plant availability of subsoil nutrients,
    which increases crop yield if (i) nutrients are growth-limiting and (ii) deep
    tillage does not come at the cost of impaired topsoil fertility. On soils with
    stable soil structure and root-restricting layers, deep tillage can be an effective
    measure to mitigate drought stress and improve the resilience of crops under climate
    change conditions. Graphical abstract Deep tillage effects on crop yields. Top:

    facing new challenges due to climate change (Sillmann et al., 2013) and imminent
    supply shortages of nutrients (Cooper et al., 2011). This creates a need to access
    new nutrient and water sources. In cropland, the subsoil, i.e. the soil layer
    below the regularly tilled topsoil, can store almost 50% of total nitrogen stocks
    (Wiesmeier et al., 2013) and 25–70% of total phosphorus stocks (Kautz et al.,
    2013) and can retain water even under drought conditions (Kirkegaard et al., 2007).
    However, the availability of these resources to crops varies. High soil strength
    often limits root propagation and thus the plant-availability of resources in
    the subsoil (Bengough et al., 2011). Subsoil strength tends to be naturally high
    because of the weight of the above soil column and internal frictional forces
    (Gao et al., 2016). Particularly dense soil layers of mostly pedogenic (e.g. clay
    illuviation, hardpan of Podzols) and, to a lesser extent, geogenic origin (e.g.
    soils with abrupt textural change in fluvial or tidal sediment deposits) often
    pose additional natural barriers for root growth. However, high soil strength
    can also be man-made (Batey, 2009). About 15% of the agricultural land in Europe
    is compacted by agricultural mismanagement (Oldeman et al., 1991). The ability
    of roots to propagate at high soil strength differs between crop types. Dicotyledonous
    annual crops tend to have thicker roots and therefore higher ability to propagate
    at high soil strength than monocotyledonous annual crops (Clark and Barraclough,
    1999). In addition, dicotyledonous crops can improve the biopore network in the
    soil profile and build highways to the subsoil for subsequent crops (Kautz et
    al., 2013). However, today’s annual cropping systems are vastly dominated by cereals
    and other crops with thin, fibrous roots. In soils without extensive vertical
    macropore channels or fissures, access to subsoil resources is thus restricted.
    Mechanical modifications of soil profiles, commonly referred to as deep tillage,
    could alleviate high subsoil strength, facilitating deeper rooting and, thus,
    the plant-availability of subsoil resources. Various deep tillage methods have
    been developed, including subsoiling, deep ploughing and complete mixing of soil
    profiles. Subsoiling aims at loosening the soil structure and decreasing the bulk
    density of the subsoil without turning or mixing soil horizons (Fig. 1, left).
    Subsoiling is sometimes referred to as deep ripping or deep chiselling. In contrast,
    deep ploughing turns soil horizons and results in complete or semi-complete inversion
    of the soil profile, with subsoil horizons ending up at the soil surface and topsoil
    horizons buried in the deep soil (Fig. 1, centre). Finally, there are deep tillage
    options that mix subsoil and topsoil, leading to complete destruction of soil
    horizons (Fig. 1, right). In the following, we refer to the latter management
    options as ‘deep mixing’, in order to distinguish them from mere deep ploughing
    (turning) or subsoiling (loosening). Deep mixing can be conducted on the whole
    field (e.g. with a deep rotary hoe) or in stripes with undisturbed soil in between
    (e.g. with a wheel-type trencher). Download : Download high-res image (191KB)

    changes in the soil profile. The notion of improving the plant availability of
    water and nutrients from the subsoil by deep tillage has a long history. In pre-industrial
    times, soil was mostly tilled with animal-drawn ploughs, which rarely tilled deeper
    than 20 cm (Eggelsmann, 1979), and only manual digging was able to modify the
    soil profile to greater depths, like the labour-intensive method of double or
    triple digging. However, the latter was popular in confined areas only, e.g. in
    central European viticulture (Mollenhauer, 2014). Between 1850 and 1960, the development
    of steam and combustion engines allowed the maximum ploughing depth to be increased
    from 20 cm to >200 cm (Roemer, 1940, Eggelsmann, 1979). The increase in horsepower
    and potential tillage depth enabled reclamation of peatland by deep ploughing
    on a large scale in northern Germany and the Netherlands. Furthermore, large areas
    of Podzols, Luvisols and Stagnosols were deep-tilled in order to decrease subsoil
    strength. In Germany alone, more than 500,000 ha were deep tilled to break up
    hardpans and loosen dense illuvial clay layers (Table A1 in Supplementary materials).
    In the 1970s, the popularity of deep tillage declined among both the research
    community and practitioners. This was presumably largely due to inconsistent yield
    responses to deep tillage, which failed to compensate for the high execution costs.
    Concerns about negative effects of ploughing on beneficial soil biota (Kladivko,
    2001) also increased general resistance to the use of tillage, especially among
    organic farmers. Within conventional arable farming, pesticides and herbicides
    supported the emergence of minimum tillage systems. However, chemical pest and
    weed control is not the primary goal of deep tillage. The mechanical modification
    of the subsoil as achieved by deep tillage can disrupt root-restricting soil layers
    and enhance water storage, improving soil fertility in the long-term (e.g. Schröder
    and Schulte-Karring, 1984; Baumhardt et al., 2008). With respect to soil biota,
    it is important to note that deep tillage can be either performed once for ameliorative
    purposes, i.e. with the goal of long-lasting improvements at a given site, or
    annually in order to achieve gradual topsoil deepening over time. Ameliorative
    deep tillage may have much less negative impacts on earthworms and other beneficial
    soil organisms than annual deep tillage (Kladivko, 2001). In several cases, ameliorative
    deep tillage has even been reported to enhance earthworm activities (Borchert,
    1981, Fenner et al., 1993) and increase the abundance of plant growth-promoting
    rhizobacteria and mycorrhizae in the subsoil (Egerszegi, 1959, Muller and Rauhe,
    1959, Steinbrenner and Naglitsch, 1965). Inconsistent yield responses to deep
    tillage seem to occur at different sites and with different environmental conditions
    (Eck and Unger, 1985). Under drought stress, deep tillage could facilitate the
    uptake of subsoil water and thus stabilise crop yields (e.g. Doty et al., 1975).
    Climate change scenarios predict an increase in the intensity and frequency of
    droughts in many cropping regions of the world (Olesen et al., 2011, Porter et
    al., 2014). Deep tillage might be a tool to make crops more resilient to climate
    change and mitigate yield losses caused by droughts. Furthermore, because ameliorative
    deep ploughing of arable land sequesters carbon (Alcántara et al., 2016), deep
    ploughing carries the potential to compensate for greenhouse gas emissions and,
    if conducted on a large scale, may contribute to meeting future climate targets.
    Apart from climate change, limited access to fertilisers poses an imminent threat
    to crop production (Cooper et al., 2011). Subsoil nutrients have been shown to
    sustain yield in non-fertilised trials (Garz et al., 2000). Deep tillage might
    further enhance the plant availability of subsoil resources. However, a quantitative
    overview and understanding of crop responses to deep tillage is lacking to date
    (Olsson and Cockroft, 2006). We therefore conducted an extensive quantitative
    review of deep tillage trials. Specifically, our goals were to (i) gain a quantitative
    overview of documented deep tillage effects on crop yield and (ii) examine the
    role of site-specific properties, management practices and drought stress in determining
    yield response to deep tillage. Data availability delimited the focus of our study
    primarily to short-term effects of deep tillage on the productivity of cereal
    crops grown on mineral soils in temperate latitudes. 2. Material & methods 2.1.
    General approach We conducted an extensive review of studies about deep tillage
    effects on crop yield. Deep tillage was defined for each experiment, because tillage
    depth changed considerably during the observation period reviewed. In general,
    tillage treatments were defined as deep tillage if they reached deeper than in
    adjacent conventionally tilled control plots. Studies with repetitive deep tillage
    treatments were only considered if they examined gradual topsoil deepening and
    their initial experimental deep tillage treatment reached into the subsoil, i.e.
    soil which was not tilled before. Findings from organic soils like bogs and fens
    were excluded because of current environmental standards on peatland conservation.
    Quantitative and qualitative methods were used for data evaluation. First, a meta-analysis
    of experimental field trials on deep tillage was performed. This delivered a quantitative
    overview of deep tillage effects on crop yield. However, highly variable reporting
    of experimental treatments and environmental conditions restricted identification
    and parameterisation of the forces driving deep tillage effects. Therefore, the
    meta-analysis was complemented with an extensive qualitative review of the literature.
    This qualitative review included studies that matched the criteria listed above
    and which described deep tillage-induced changes in soil fertility and/or crop
    yield. The procedure used for the meta-analysis is described in the following
    section. 2.2. Meta-analysis 2.2.1. Data collection Web of Science™ was screened
    using the following keyword combinations: “yield” and “subsoil” with “tillage”,
    “mixing”, “ripping” or “ploughing”, “yield” with “deep ploughing”, “subsoiling”
    or “deep ripping”. Only articles written in English or German were considered.
    German literature was complemented with scientifically sound grey literature,
    mostly from the 1960s to 1980s because back then it was not common in German agricultural
    science to publish in international peer-reviewed journals. The search was confined
    to field experiments comparing the productivity of arable crops grown on ordinary-tilled
    control plots with adjacent deep-mixed, deep-ploughed or subsoiled plots, which
    apart from different tillage depths received the same treatments. Cases with subsoil
    fertilisation of deep-tilled plots were only included if the control plots received
    the same quality and quantity of fertiliser on the topsoil. Studies reporting
    extremely low grain or fresh matter yield (below 300 kg ha−1) on either ordinary
    or deep-tilled plots in field studies with low or no fertiliser input, chemical
    pest control and replication were ignored, in order to keep the relevance for
    recent agriculture. For each yield observation, information on site and management-related
    potential drivers was compiled. Explanatory variables were derived based on data
    availability (data given in as many studies as possible) and information content
    (continuous data better than categorical data). The resulting variables are listed
    in Table 1. Sites were classified based on the presence of root-restricting soil
    layers at deep tillage depth and their main textural class in the topsoil using
    the binary variables RootRestrictingLayer, SandyTopsoil and SiltyTopsoil. Sites
    classified with root-restricting soil layers featured either physical or chemical
    barriers to vertical root growth, which were either removed or disrupted by the
    deep tillage operation to >20 cm depth. Physical barriers included cemented layers
    (duripan and petroferric, gypsic or calcic horizons) and compacted hardpans of
    anthropogenic (plough pan) or natural origin (dense clay, fragipans). Chemical
    barriers were mostly due to anoxia in soil with stagnating water or groundwater
    and, in few cases, sodicity in saline soils. When the presence and depth of such
    root-restricting soil layers could not be judged based on the article concerned,
    a search was made for (i) other studies at the same site with more detailed soil
    descriptions and (ii) in the case of experimental sites in the USA, queries in
    the USDA NRCS Web Soil Survey database using reported or reconstructed coordinates
    of the sites (Soil Survey Staff et al., 2013). If this search failed to provide
    an indication about root-restricting layers, soils were classified without such
    layers. Topsoil textural classes were derived from the same sources. Subsoil texture
    and other soil properties such as water regime and nutrient stocks could not be
    considered in the meta-analysis because of poor data availability. Table 1. Explanatory

    methods were classified as subsoiling or deep ploughing and deep mixing (TillageType).
    The difference between the depth of deep tillage and conventional control tillage
    was recorded (TillageDepth). If the conventional control tillage depth was not
    explicitly stated, 20 cm was assumed for ploughing and 10 cm for all other control
    tillage types such as disking. Furthermore, the average number of deep tillage
    interventions per site and year was recorded, in order to characterise the frequency
    of deep tillage (TillageFreq). For each yield observation, we recorded whether
    the crop was fertilised and, if applicable, whether the fertiliser was placed
    on the topsoil (FertiliserTop) and/or in the subsoil (FertiliserDeep). Planting
    and harvesting dates were derived from the articles or, if not stated, from the
    crop and country (or US state) using specific average values presented by Sacks
    et al. (2010). The continuous variables WaterQuantity and WaterIntensity served
    as proxies for the seasonal availability of water. WaterQuantity was calculated
    as: (1) where denotes cumulative precipitation during growing days (days between
    sowing or planting and harvesting with minimum temperature >0 °C) in mm, I is
    the amount of additional irrigation water supplied in mm, and n is the number
    of growing days. Site-specific daily precipitation was calculated as the mean
    precipitation recorded by weather stations in a 100 km radius around each experimental
    field site, weighted by the reciprocal distance between each weather station and
    the field site. Daily minimum temperature was calculated following the same procedure.
    All precipitation and temperature records were downloaded from GHCN-Daily, Version
    3.12 (Menne et al., 2012a, Menne et al., 2012b). The irrigation inputs, I, were
    recorded from the articles. In general, water inputs per growing day varied considerably.
    Therefore, we created a variable for watering intensity, which was calculated
    as: (2) where denotes the number of growing days with >1.0 mm precipitation and/or
    irrigation water input. 2.2.2. The dataset Our search resulted in 1530 yield comparisons
    following deep and conventional control tillage on 67 experimental sites, which
    were extracted from 45 articles. The vast majority of the data derived from temperate
    latitudes and particularly from trials conducted in the USA and Germany, with
    679 observations and 630 observations, respectively (Fig. 2). The dataset spanned
    a period of 105 years. Download : Download high-res image (257KB) Download : Download

    Circle size increases with number of observations per site. Of the total of 1530
    observations, 437 (29%) were derived from sites at which deep tillage disrupted
    root restricting soil layers (RootRestrictingLayer, Table 1). Root-restricting
    soil layers were mostly caused by dense clay layers (138 observations), followed
    by non-cemented plough pans and fragipans (65 observations), pans cemented by
    humic substances, gypsum, carbonate or iron (44 observations) and natric horizons
    (8 observations). In the remaining 138 observations, root-restricting soil layers
    were mentioned in the study, but their nature and cause was not further specified.
    Apart from root-restricting layers, experimental sites differed in topsoil texture.
    About 40% of all observations derived from experimental sites with sandy topsoil
    and a further 25% from sites with silty topsoil (SandyTopsoil and SiltyTopsoil;
    Table 1). The deep tillage treatments consisted of subsoiling (578 observations),
    deep ploughing (779 observations) or deep mixing of the soil profile (173 observations)
    to 4–134 cm deeper (mean 23 cm) than in the conventionally tilled control plots
    (TillageType and TillageDepth; Table 1). The mean conventional control tillage
    depth was 19 cm. Around half the observations derived from ameliorative deep tillage
    trials in which the test site was deep-tilled only once (TillageFreq; Table 1).
    The other half derived from trials with repetitive deep tillage treatments every
    one to four years, with the goal of gradual topsoil deepening. The period between
    preceding deep tillage treatment and yield measurements was up to 26 years (Unger,
    1993) (Time; Table 1). A quarter of all observations derived from field trials
    without mineral fertiliser or manure amendments. In 16% of cases, deep tillage
    was combined with subsoil fertilisation and yield was compared with that in control
    plots with ordinary tillage and topsoil fertilisation. Most trials were rain-fed,
    with only about 10% of the observations deriving from irrigated crops. Considering
    both irrigation and precipitation, the crops received on average about 2.3 mm
    of water per growing day, ranging from 0.9 mm per growing day in Scottsbluff,
    NE, USA (Chilcott and Cole, 1918) to 8.7 mm per growing day in a heavily irrigated
    trial in Bushland, TX, USA (Hauser and Taylor, 1964). Watering intensity averaged
    6 mm per growing day with rain and/or irrigation (WaterIntensity; Table 1). 2.2.3.
    Statistics The effect size, i.e. the relative yield response to deep tillage,
    was calculated following standard procedures as: (3) where RY denotes the relative
    yield increase, which is defined as the ratio between the yield on the deep-tilled
    plot, YieldDeep, and the yield of its respective control, YieldControl, in the
    same unit (Rosenberg et al., 2013). Because indices for precision such as standard
    deviation or confidence interval were under-reported, each effect size was attributed
    the same weight. If not stated otherwise, differences were generally regarded
    as significant at P < 0.1. All statistical calculations were performed in R version
    3.1.1 (R Core Team, 2016). Effect size was modelled as a function of the predictors
    listed in Table 1 using ordinary least squares (OLS) and linear quantile regression
    (QR) analyses. While common OLS models estimate only the conditional mean response
    to some given values of predictors, QR allows any conditional quantile of the
    response distribution to be estimated (Koenker and Bassett, 1978, Cade and Noon,
    2003). Here we used QR to evaluate the importance of the predictors in explaining
    positive and negative effect sizes. For predicting positive effect sizes, we ran
    a regression on the quantile Q of the conditional effect size distribution, which
    corresponded to a 15% relative yield increase following deep tillage. This was
    at Q0.77, i.e. 77% of the effect sizes were lower, while 23% were higher. For
    predicting negative effect sizes, we ran a second regression on the quantile Q0.10
    of the conditional effect size distribution as Q0.10 corresponded to a 15% relative
    yield decrease following deep tillage. In the results and discussion section below,
    we use the regressions on the conditional quantiles Q0.77 and Q0.10 in order to
    illustrate and discuss the effect of the predictors on positive and negative deep
    tillage effects, respectively. For completeness, in the Supplementary material
    we present yield responses following deep tillage on further conditional quantiles
    (Q0.1–Q0.9 in 0.1 increments; Fig. A1). For the regression analyses, 59 observations
    with missing values in any of the predictors were omitted, mostly due to unknown
    irrigation water inputs in irrigated trials. All continuous predictors except
    TillageFreq were transformed by the natural logarithm to account for their large
    positive skewness. None of the explanatory variables was highly correlated (rs
    < 0.7). Regression coefficients were calculated treating all observations as independent
    of each other. Clustering of the model residuals by studies suggested the presence
    of unobserved effects on study level, i.e. effect sizes reported in the same study
    tended to be similar. Compared with the differences between studies, differences
    between experimental sites within the same study were only minor. Therefore, robust
    standard errors were calculated from study-level cluster-bootstrapped simulations
    (R = 2000) for QR coefficients (Hagemann, 2016) and OLS regression coefficients
    (Fernihough, 2013). The resulting errors present conservative estimates which
    account for similar management and environmental factors driving observations
    from the same studies that could not be parameterised and fully captured by the
    explanatory variables available (Cameron and Miller, 2015). All QR coefficients
    and errors were calculated using the R quantreg-package (Koenker, 2016). In a
    post-hoc analysis, the benefits of deep fertiliser placement were evaluated by
    examining only studies which included deep tillage treatments with and without
    subsoil fertilisation. The effect of subsoil fertilisation was evaluated as: (4)
    where RYsubsoil fert. denotes the relative yield increase following deep tillage
    with subsoil fertilisation and RYno subsoil fert. denotes the relative yield increase
    following deep tillage without subsoil fertilisation but otherwise identical treatments.
    Differences between RYsubsoil fert. and RYno subsoil fert. were assessed for each
    study separately using pair-wise Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests. 3. Results & discussion
    3.1. Overall impact of deep tillage on yield The mean crop response to deep tillage
    was significantly positive. Deep tillage increased yield by average 6%, with a
    95% confidence interval around the mean ranging from 1% to 11% (Table 2). However,
    individual deep tillage effects were highly scattered (Fig. 3). Deep tillage increased
    yield only in about 60% of the observations, while in the remaining 40% of cases
    deep tillage resulted in yield depression. Studies reporting highly positive deep
    tillage effects were contradicted by many other studies documenting neutral or
    negative deep tillage effects (Table 2). To the best of our knowledge, this study
    is the first to provide a quantitative overview of the primary literature on the
    effect of deep tillage on crop yield. In the following section, we review and
    evaluate potential drivers of the different crop responses to deep tillage. Table

    likely that the given condition was true. 3.2. Drivers of deep tillage-induced
    changes in yield 3.2.1. Limitations of the meta-analysis Data availability restricted
    the focus of our meta-analysis primarily to short-term effects of deep tillage
    on the productivity of cereal crops grown in temperate latitudes. Therefore, our
    findings should only be generalised within this framework and inferences beyond
    this should be made with care. The heavy skew towards short-term effects of deep
    tillage is partly explained by different experimental designs: about half the
    observations included in the meta-analysis derived from studies with recurring
    deep tillage treatments in at least every second year to achieve gradual topsoil
    deepening over time (mean period between yield measurement and preceding deep
    tillage 1.2 years; mean difference between tillage depth of control and deep tillage
    16 cm). The other half of the observations described the effect of non-recurring,
    usually more intense, deep tillage interventions with the goal of long-term soil
    improvement (mean period between yield measurement and preceding deep tillage
    2.7 years; mean difference between tillage depth of control and deep tillage 31
    cm). Among the 26 studies examining long-term effects of non-recurring, ameliorative
    deep tillage on yields, 20 (77%) lasted for five years or less. This might be
    explained by the short duration of many research projects and the lack of long-term
    funding sources. Observations of long-term deep tillage effects mostly derived
    from studies without continuous yield records and field trials, which might only
    have been rediscovered and systematically studied because preceding visual observations
    were “promising”, i.e. indicated more vigorous growth on the formerly deep-tilled
    plots. On the other hand, studies documenting long-term deep tillage effects may
    not have been conducted or published because long-term effects were negligible.
    Thus, publication bias may cause considerable overestimation of the average long-term
    effects of deep tillage on crop yield. In a long-term study on ameliorative subsoiling,
    soil physical properties have been shown to follow non-linear trends over time
    (Borchert and Graf, 1985). This further indicates that generalisation of our results
    to predict long-term effects of deep tillage on crop yield is tainted with high
    uncertainty. Deep tillage has a long history in soil preparation for perennial
    crops such as grapevines, pome fruits and asparagus (Bechtle, 1985). This tradition
    seems to be based on the practical experience of generations of farmers, as substantiating
    experimental data are scarce. In this meta-analysis, the only study reporting
    observations for perennial crops was on sugar cane grown in Puerto Rico (Martinez
    and Lugo-López, 1953). Our dataset consisted almost entirely of observations on
    annual crops, with 1092 observations (74%) on cereals, 228 (15%) on roots and
    tubers, 69 (5%) on legumes and 82 (6%) on other crops. Because there were relatively
    few observations apart from cereals, crop-specific influences on yield responses
    to deep tillage could not be included in the analysis. Some researchers have reported
    less stunted growth and less rotting in sugar beet after deep tillage (Mathers
    et al., 1971, Ide et al., 1987). However, this effect could not be quantified
    and, if present, contributes little to average trends. Finally, the dataset mostly
    comprised observations from temperate latitudes (Fig. 2). In subtropical and tropical
    latitudes, higher solar radiation might compromise the usefulness of WaterQuantity
    and WaterIntensity as rough proxies for drought intensity because of considerably
    higher evapotranspiration rates. However, the magnitude of this effect remains
    speculative and was neglected in this study because the share of observations
    from the subtropics and tropics was negligible (<1%). When modelling the large
    variation among individual effect sizes, it was a challenge to define suitable
    explanatory variables. Great variation among individual reporting styles resulted
    in a need to aggregate available information and create several dummy variables.
    Available predictors might only have been non-significant due to the limitations
    in parameterising driving forces. Thus, there is a need to place the results of
    the meta-analysis in a wider context. In the following sections, we embed the
    results of our meta-analysis in a qualitative review of the literature in order
    to discuss the driving forces of different crop responses to deep tillage. 3.2.2.
    Site-specific effects The success of deep tillage depends strongly on site-specific
    conditions. The meta-analysis revealed that root-restricting layers were the most
    important driver for positive crop yield responses to deep tillage. On sites with
    root-restricting soil layers, deep tillage effects were generally 20% higher than
    at sites without such layers (Fig. 4, RootRestrictingLayer). This difference was
    highly significant (P < 0.001). Thus, deep tillage can destroy barriers to vertical
    root growth and facilitate uptake of growth-limiting resources from the subsoil.
    The resources stored in the subsoil contribute significantly to crop performance
    (Kuhlmann et al., 1989, Kirkegaard et al., 2007, Kautz et al., 2013). We therefore
    estimate that at least 20% of the resources needed for cereal crop production
    in temperate latitudes derive from the subsoil. This is a conservative estimate,
    as root-restricting layers are usually not positioned at but below the boundary
    between topsoil and subsoil. Download : Download high-res image (323KB) Download

    is shown for coefficients with P < 0.1, 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001 with °, *, ** and
    ***, respectively. Soil texture is another key variable for crop response to deep
    tillage. At sites with silty topsoil (>70% silt), negative deep tillage effects
    on crop yield were significantly more frequent and severe than at sites with less
    silty topsoil. This is illustrated by the negative QR regression coefficient of
    SiltyTopsoil for negative effect sizes (Fig. 4B). Our meta-analysis thus suggests
    that intensive deep tillage should be restricted to soils low in silt. This conclusion
    is in line with studies examining the effect of deep tillage on soil physical
    properties. In an extensive long-term field study conducted at 67 sites in south-east
    Germany, subsoiling only lowered the bulk density and increased the macroporosity
    of soil if it contained >20% clay and <70% silt (Borchert, 1975, Borchert, 1981,
    Borchert, 1984, Borchert and Graf, 1985). On many soils with a clay:silt ratio
    <0.3, subsoiling resulted in complete collapse of the natural soil structure and
    compaction instead of loosening. Management options to facilitate uptake of water
    and nutrients from the subsoil of silty loess soils with low clay content should
    therefore focus on biological options such as deep-rooting catch crops (Renger,
    1974). This promotes the formation of long-term stable biopores, which can serve
    as highways for subsequent crop roots to access subsoil resources (Kautz et al.,
    2013). In silty, loamy and clayey soils, biopores seem to be important pathways
    for roots to access resources from the subsoil (Han et al., 2015, Colombi et al.,
    2017). Deep tillage comes at the cost of destroying these biopores. On very silty
    soils, deep tillage has been shown to have little potential to loosen the soil
    matrix and to decrease the bulk density (Borchert and Graf, 1985; Müller, 1985).
    Along with the destruction of biopores, this might explain the increased likelihood
    of yield depression on deep-tilled silty soils observed in the present meta-analysis.
    Sandy topsoil texture showed no significant effect on crop response to deep tillage
    (Fig. 4, SandyTopsoil). In contrast, Sene et al. (1985), who deep-loosened 12
    sites with contrasting texture in the North Carolina Coastal Plain, USA, were
    able to explain 93% of the variation in crop response by the sand content in the
    topsoil. Our results show that the distinction between sandy and non-sandy topsoil
    does not suffice to predict the success of deep tillage at many sites. In two
    studies included in this meta-analysis, yield decreased after deep tillage of
    sites with sandy topsoil (Weise, 1970, Schnieder, 1971). At both sites, only the
    topsoil was sandy, while the subsoil was loamy. Classifying the texture of subsoils
    into sandy or non-sandy might prove more constructive in predicting deep tillage
    effects on crop yield. However, this could not be evaluated in the present meta-analysis
    because in most studies included in the dataset subsoil texture was not specified.
    Very sandy subsoils often exhibit a single-grained, non-cohesive structure with
    few continuous biopores, which could facilitate root growth (Blume et al., 2010).
    Thus, root elongation has to overcome the mechanical impendence of the soil matrix
    as well as frictional forces between sand grains and the roots (Bengough et al.,
    2011). In densely packed, sandy subsoil, high mechanical impendence and frictional
    forces can restrict root growth (Batey and McKenzie, 2006, Batey, 2009). Observations
    from Hungary and India suggest that deep tillage can loosen densely packed sand
    grains in the subsoil, thus decreasing mechanical impendence and facilitating
    root elongation through the loosened subsoil matrix and resulting in considerably
    larger crop yields in the following growing season (Egerszegi, 1959, Chaudhary
    et al., 1985). However, due to low data availability on subsoil texture, these
    effects reported for single sites could not be generally quantified. 3.2.3. Deep
    tillage methods There is great variety among deep tillage methods. Based on data
    availability, in this meta-analysis we differentiated between deep tillage options
    (subsoiling vs. deep ploughing and deep mixing), tillage depths and tillage frequency.
    In doing so, we were unable to observe significant differences between tillage
    options. In the regression models, the disruption of a root-restricting soil layer
    by deep tillage was more important than details on how and how often it was disrupted
    (Fig. 4; RootRestrictingLayer vs. TillageType, ln(TillageDepth) and TillageFreq).
    However, this approach does not permit generalisation of the findings or predictions
    that different methods of deep tillage will result in the same crop response regardless
    of site and environmental conditions. A qualitative review of the literature showed
    that deep tillage options should be designed to fit site-specific needs and constraints.
    In general, the response of the soil to all deep tillage options is related to
    its water content. Successful deep tillage requires soil water content to be below
    the plastic limit from the topsoil to the maximum tillage depth (Borchert, 1975,
    Eck and Unger, 1985). The plastic limit is defined as the water content at which
    thin threads of soil rupture when rolled out (Atterberg, 1914, McBride, 2002).
    In addition to the water content, soil texture should also be considered. In soils
    with >40% clay, the plastic limit is not reached until the permanent wilting point
    at −1.5 MPa (Renger and Strebel, 1976). In humid climates, such low soil matric
    potentials may rarely be reached. In a case study in north-west Germany, Renger
    and Strebel (1976) estimated that the plastic limit of heavy soils is only reached
    in about 1–3 out of 10 years. Heavy soils in humid climates can be prepared for
    deep tillage using water-consuming crops like alfalfa and by prior drainage (Schulte-Karring,
    1985). As our climate is currently changing, increasing drought duration and intensity
    could increase the likelihood of soil reaching the plastic limit in some cropland
    regions (Dai et al., 2004). However, soil water content will remain a major constraint
    for successful deep tillage of heavy soils in humid climates. Nonetheless, in
    most studies reviewed, data specifying soil water content during deep tillage
    were either lacking or remained vague. Subsoiling can be a successful tool to
    treat soils with physical barriers to root growth (Schulte-Karring, 1970a; Chaudhary
    et al., 1985; Schulte-Karring and Schröder, 1986; Gajri et al., 1994). The loosening
    effect of subsoiling mainly depends on the plasticity of the soil and the machinery
    used. Machines for subsoiling can be classified into lift-loosening and break-up
    loosening technologies (Schulte-Karring and Haubold-Rosar, 1993). Among lift-loosening
    technologies, machines with moving tines have been shown to be superior to those
    with fixed tines (Schulte-Karring, 1995). Loosening intensity generally increases
    with increasing subsoiling depth and decreasing distance between loosened furrows
    (Schulte-Karring, 1995, Spoor, 2006). Subsoiling of soils above the plastic limit,
    i.e. when too wet, may cause compaction, plastic deformation, smearing and mole
    drainage effects (Müller, 1985). Poor soil loosening due to high soil water might
    explain many neutral and negative crop responses to subsoiling, especially in
    early trials (Smith, 1925, Anderson et al., 1958, Larson et al., 1960). On the
    other hand, heavy soil should not be too dry but still be friable when deep loosening.
    Otherwise, the pulling resistance exerted by the loosening tines can be too high
    and soil loosening impractical. Deep ploughing or deep mixing have the highest
    potential to improve duplex soils with textural changes (Seibel, 1972, Allen et
    al., 1995, Baumhardt et al., 2008), sandy soils (Egerszegi, 1959, Rauhe, 1960)
    and Solonetz soils with sodic barriers to root growth (Tyurin et al., 1960, Bowser
    and Cairns, 1967, Rasmussen et al., 1972). On very sandy soils, organic matter-rich
    topsoil, which is buried by deep ploughing, can act as a barrier to infiltrating
    water and nutrient leaching. Thus, deep ploughing sandy soils can increase water
    and nutrient storage. Deep placement of organic amendments can further enhance
    this effect (Egerszegi, 1959, Rauhe, 1960). On sodic soils, with a higher Ca2+
    to Na+ ratio in the subsoil than in the topsoil, crop responses to deep tillage
    are among the highest recorded (Rasmussen et al., 1972). Flipping the Ca2+-rich
    subsoil and the Na+-rich topsoil increases the flocculation of soil colloids,
    improves soil structure and increases infiltration rates (Tyurin et al., 1960,
    Bowser and Cairns, 1967, Rasmussen et al., 1972). In soil profiles with pronounced
    textural changes, both deep ploughing and deep mixing have been successfully applied
    for removing root-restricting layers and increasing plant-available water storage
    (Seibel, 1972, Allen et al., 1995, Baumhardt et al., 2008). However, the site-specific
    benefits of deep ploughing or mixing may come at the cost of topsoil deterioration.
    For example, subsoil clay lifted by deep ploughing may hinder trafficability and
    complicate seedbed preparation (Scheffer and Meyer, 1970). In such cases, liming
    with CaO can improve soil workability (Bechtle, 1985). The risk of poor trafficability
    is especially pronounced in the first years after deep ploughing and deep mixing.
    Perennial crops require less traffic, which may explain why deep ploughing and
    deep mixing have been successfully applied for centuries in the production of
    perennial crops (viticulture, pomiculture and asparagus cultivation), while in
    annual cropping systems such soil profile modifications are rarely applied in
    practice. Apart from workability, the burial of topsoil and its replacement with
    nutrient- and organic matter-poor substrate from the subsoil may be another constraint
    to deep ploughing and mixing (Scheffer and Meyer, 1970, Harrach et al., 1971).
    After turning or mixing topsoil and subsoil, management efforts should therefore
    be devoted to building up soil organic matter in the new topsoil. Organic manure
    and increased mineral fertilisation can mitigate initial yield depression (Renger,
    1974, Rojahn, 1974). 3.2.4. Soil nutrients and fertilisation The effect of deep
    tillage on nutrient availability is site- and management regime-specific. On the
    one hand, our meta-analysis suggests that deep tillage can improve the accessibility
    of nutrients from the subsoil, which increases crop yield if the nutrient availability
    in the topsoil is deficient. This is illustrated by significantly higher yield
    increases after deep tillage in unfertilised trials compared with trials with
    fertilised topsoil (Fig. 4B, negative QR regression coefficient of FertiliserTop
    for positive effect sizes). On the other hand, a pronounced but non-significant
    trend towards more extreme yield depression in other unfertilised field experiments
    suggests that deep tillage can also decrease nutrient availability and depress
    yield (Fig. 4B, positive QR regression coefficient of FertiliserTop for negative
    effect sizes). This might be explained by increased mineralisation of organically-bound
    nutrients and subsequent leaching due to higher water infiltration or topsoil
    deterioration resulting from deep ploughing or mixing (Weise, 1970, Bechtle, 1985).
    Overall, topsoil fertilisation buffered crop response to deep tillage. Vice versa,
    in unfertilised trials, positive and negative deep tillage effects on crop yield
    were more extreme. In some trials, deep tillage was combined with subsoil fertilisation.
    As the root density of annual crops tends to increase in spots with high nutrient
    concentrations, subsoil fertilisation can stimulate deeper rooting (Lynch et al.,
    2012). Deeper rooting can stabilise the mechanically disrupted soil structure
    and supply crops with resources from the subsoil, which mitigates yield depression,
    especially when a resource in the topsoil becomes growth-limiting (Kohnke and
    Bertrand, 1956, Schulte-Karring, 1985). Indeed, in the present meta-analysis,
    yield tended to be higher if a given type and amount of fertiliser was incorporated
    into the subsoil rather than into the topsoil (Fig. 4A; FertiliserDeep). However,
    this relationship needs to be interpreted with caution, as the number of observations
    with subsoil fertilisation was relatively small (Table 1). Our meta-analysis included
    seven studies that compared deep tillage treatments with and without subsoil fertilisation.
    Three of these studies evaluated the effect of deep ploughing or manual digging
    combined with deep placement of organic manure on crop yield at sandy sites (Fig.
    5; top), while four studies examined the effect of subsoiling combined with deep
    placement of mineral fertiliser on crop yield in heavy soils (Fig. 5; bottom).
    On sandy soils, deep placement of manure generally resulted in higher crop yield
    than incorporation of manure into the topsoil. The deep-placed manure stimulated
    deeper rooting and acted as a barrier to infiltrating water and leaching nutrients
    (Egerszegi, 1959, Rauhe and Muller, 1959, Rauhe, 1960). This increased yields
    and made crops much more resilient during droughts. The promising results of field
    trials contributed to the popularity and large-scale application of this technique
    in the former German Democratic Republic, where around 50,000 ha of sandy cropland
    was treated by deep ploughing combined with deep placement of manure or other
    organic amendments (Renger, 1974). However, the success of this method is restricted
    to deep sandy soils that are not underlain by finer-textured materials (Weise,
    1970, Schnieder, 1971). Download : Download high-res image (195KB) Download :

    as the difference between the relative yield increase following deep tillage +
    subsoil fertilisation and the relative yield increase following deep tillage alone
    grouped by study. In the case of subsoil fertilisation, yield observations with
    the same amount of fertiliser applied in the topsoil served as the control. Significant
    deep fertilisation effects following paired Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests are shown
    for P < 0.1, 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001 with °, *, ** and ***, respectively. The results
    of mineral fertilisation of the subsoil on heavy soils were inconsistent (Fig.
    5; bottom). On heavy soils, drought stress is less pronounced and deeper rooting
    might therefore be less beneficial than in light soils. Moreover, the stimulating
    effect on root growth depends on the composition of the mineral fertiliser. Larson
    et al. (1960) mostly injected only phosphorus into the subsoil and it generally
    stimulates root growth much less than nitrogen, which was used in other studies
    (Lynch et al., 2012). Finally, there are the technical constraints associated
    with the dispersal of fertiliser in the subsoil when the soil profile is only
    deeply loosened and not turned or mixed. Fertiliser that is placed or injected
    into the loosened furrow behind the subsoiling tines may only reach a maximum
    of 10–15% of the total subsoil volume (Schmid et al., 1972). If the soil is moist
    during subsoiling, the dispersal of deep-placed fertiliser is even poorer due
    to the formation of fertiliser pockets. Preferential water flow in the loosened
    furrows may increase nutrient losses by leaching and increase the risk of eutrophication
    (Schmid et al., 1972). 3.2.5. Soil water Our meta-analysis suggests that deep
    tillage increases the resilience of crops under drought stress. Positive deep
    tillage effects increased significantly with decreasing water inputs per growing
    day, i.e. drought intensity (Fig. 4; ln(WaterQuantity)). The inverse relationship
    between water input and deep tillage effect was more pronounced at sites with
    root-restricting soil layers compared to sites without such layers (Fig. 6). This
    highlights the importance of the subsoil water reservoir for mitigating dry spells.
    The associated mechanisms can be manifold. On the one hand, deep tillage may increase
    the plant-available water pool by increasing the soil volume that is accessible
    to roots (Kohnke and Bertrand, 1956, Rauhe and Muller, 1959, Rauhe, 1960, Bowser
    and Cairns, 1967, Grass, 1971, Harrach et al., 1971, Mathers et al., 1971, Rasmussen
    et al., 1972, Rojahn, 1974, Doty et al., 1975, Kamprath et al., 1979, Bradford
    and Blanchar, 1980, Chaudhary et al., 1985, Bennie and Botha, 1986, Ide et al.,
    1987, Cai et al., 2014). On the other hand, deep tillage may increase the abundance
    of mesopores, which increases the capacity of soils to store plant-available water
    (Bartels, 1989). Finally, deep tillage may increase infiltration rates, reduce
    waterlogging and run-off, and thus increase water recharge (Martinez and Lugo-López,
    1953; Kunze, 1963; Schneider and Mathers, 1970; Mathers et al., 1971; Schröder
    and Scharpenseel, 1975; Musick et al., 1981; Schulte-Karring and Schröder, 1983;
    Eck, 1986; Unger, 1993; Allen et al., 1995; Baumhardt et al., 2008). The latter
    point may also explain the amplifying effect of watering intensity on positive
    crop responses to deep tillage observed in our meta-analysis (Fig. 4B; ln(WaterIntensity)).
    The more intense the watering event, the higher the difference between the water
    recharge and associated crop resilience between deep-tilled and conventionally
    tilled plots. However, this is speculative, as the effect of ln(WaterIntensity)
    was not significant. In the special case of deep ploughing sandy soils, the positive
    relationship between deep tillage effect and drought intensity may also derive
    from the known role of buried organic matter-rich topsoil as a barrier to infiltrating
    water (Renger, 1974). Our meta-analysis provides strong quantitative evidence
    of the potential of deep tillage in increasing the plant-available water reservoir
    and improving the resilience of crops in times of greater climate change-induced
    precipitation variability and extremes. Download : Download high-res image (350KB)

    against the relative yield increase after deep tillage. 3.2.6. Deep tillage effects
    over time The meta-analysis allowed few conclusions to be drawn about the persistence
    of deep tillage effects on crop yield. There was a slight trend towards decreasing
    benefits from deep tillage over time (Fig. 4A). Doubling the period between the
    preceding deep tillage treatment and yield measurement decreased effect size by
    on average about 2%. However, the rate of this trend might have been highly underestimated,
    due to the peculiarities of our dataset described above (Section 3.2.1). Compaction
    of mechanically loosened soil has been shown to proceed faster on soils with >70%
    silt and <20% clay compared with soils with a higher clay content (Borchert, 1981).
    In soils with >20% clay, the mineralogy of clay seems to govern the rate of re-compaction
    in the following order: kaolinite > illite > smectite (Borchert, 1981). Traffic
    by agricultural machines further accelerates the rate of re-compaction (Czeratzki
    and Schulze, 1970, Schulte-Karring, 1970b, Grass, 1971, Ellington, 1986, Busscher
    and Sojka, 1987, Soane et al., 1987, Botta et al., 2006, Baumhardt et al., 2008).
    Sowing crops directly on top of loosened furrows or mixed trenches restricts subsequent
    vehicle passes to zones that were not deeply tilled, and thus prolongs the persistence
    of subsoiling and deep mixing effects (Sojka et al., 1993). If such in-row subsoiling
    or deep mixing is not possible, orthogonal vehicle passes over loosened furrows
    or slots are recommended (Schulte-Karring, 1985). Biological factors also play
    a key role in stabilising mechanically disrupted soil structure, e.g. by the extensive
    root system of catch crops and green manure (Schulte-Karring, 1985). Borchert
    and Graf (1985) attributed higher stabilisation of mechanically loosened soil
    structure to the abundance of annelids. Finally, the disrupted soil structure
    can be stabilised chemically by liming with CaO (Bechtle, 1985). This promotes
    flocculation of clays and the formation of clay-organic complexes. While the effect
    of mere subsoiling is estimated to decline over the course of a few years, deep
    ploughing and deep mixing may cause long-term changes in soil fertility. 4. Conclusions
    Barriers that restrict annual crop roots from accessing the resources stored in
    the subsoil can cause severe yield depression. The adverse effects of such root-restricting
    soil layers are especially pronounced if the plant availability of nutrients and
    water in the topsoil is limited. Deep tillage can disrupt root-restricting soil
    layers and facilitate access to additional resources stored in the subsoil. Based
    on the present meta-analysis, we conclude that deep tillage has the highest potential
    to increase yield at sites with root-restricting soil layers in regions with erratic
    rainfall and pronounced dry spells. On sites without root-restricting soil layers,
    deep tillage effects on crop yields are inconsistent and may not be positive.
    Deep ploughing and mixing may warrant increased fertilisation and organic matter
    build-up during the first growing seasons to avoid yield depression due to topsoil
    burial. However, subsoiling does not carry this risk and may be a tool to increase
    nutrient availability in low input farming systems with nutrient-deficient topsoils.
    On soils with >70% silt, all deep tillage activities carry an increased risk of
    imposing detrimental effects on crop growth. Acknowledgements This study is part

    Corn Full Access Corn Response to Nitrogen Rate, Row Spacing, and Plant Density

    14529. SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Efficient use of N by corn (Zea mays
    L.) is financially and environmentally important, and may be improved with higher
    plant density and reduced row spacing. Hypotheses were tested that irrigated corn
    yield in northeast Nebraska is increased by reducing row spacing from 0.76 m and
    increasing plant density above 61 800 plants ha−1, and that grain yield response
    to applied N is greater with reduced row spacing and increased plant density.
    Field experiments were conducted for 3 yr comparing the effects 0.76- vs. 0.51-m
    row spacing, three plant densities, and four N rates on crop performance. The
    soil was a silty clay loam (mesic Cumulic Haplustoll). Nitrogen rates ranged from
    0 to 252 kg N ha−1. Plant N concentration and biomass and grain yield were not
    affected by plant density. Decreasing row spacing from 0.76 to 0.51 m resulted
    in 4% more grain yield. Grain yield response to applied N and N rates for optimum
    yield were not affected by row spacing. Nitrogen application resulted in mean
    increases of 22% more biomass production and 24% more grain yield. The N response
    function was linear in 1996, quadratic in 1997, and quadratic with decreased yields
    at the high N rate (252 kg N ha−1) in 1998. Grain yield was not affected by increasing
    plant density above 61 800 plants ha−1 but was greater with narrow row spacing.
    Yield response to applied N was similar for all planting arrangements. Optimal
    N rate cannot be better predicted by considering plant density and row spacing.
    Nitrogen fertilizer is a major input for corn production in the Midwest. Ideal
    N management optimizes grain yield, farm profit, and N use efficiency while it
    minimizes the potential for leaching of N beyond the crop rooting zone. Efficiency
    of use of applied N is variable, with a mean of only 33% of applied N recovered
    by cereal crops (Raun and Johnson, 1999). Demand for N increases with biomass
    yield, which may be enhanced by reduced row spacing and greater plant density
    (Jordan et al., 1950). The effect of decreasing corn row spacing from a mean of
    1.07 to 0.90 m was estimated to result in an overall mean yield increase of 175
    kg ha−1 (Cardwell, 1982), while most farmers have reduced corn row spacing to
    0.76 m or less. Corn yields may be further increased by reducing row spacing from
    0.76 to 0.38 m (Nielsen, 1988; Widdicombe and Thelen, 2002), but there may be
    little advantage to further reduction (Porter et al., 1997). Corn grain yield
    typically exhibits a quadratic response to plant density, with a near-linear increase
    across a range of low densities, a gradually decreasing rate of yield increase
    relative to density increase, and finally a yield plateau at some relatively high
    plant density (Duncan, 1984; Ottman and Welch, 1989; Thomison and Jordan, 1995).
    Nitrogen demand also increases as plant density increases (Penning de Vries et
    al., 1993). Higher plant density combined with narrower row spacing results in
    a more equidistant planting pattern that is expected to delay initiation of intraspecific
    competition (Duncan, 1984) while early crop growth is increased (Bullock et al.,
    1988). Soil NO3–N, soil organic matter content, and historic yields might be considered
    in estimation of fertilizer N requirements for corn (Oberle and Keeney, 1990;
    Vanotti and Bundy, 1994a, 1994b), as well as legume credits, manure application,
    and irrigation water N (Peterson and Varvel, 1989; Hergert et al., 1995). Nitrogen
    response models might be further improved by considering the effects of row spacing
    and plant density. This study was conducted to test three hypotheses for irrigated
    corn production in eastern Nebraska: (i) increased plant density and reduced row
    spacing result in increased harvested N and corn grain yield under adequate soil
    water conditions; (ii) yield increases with applied N are greater with plant densities
    beyond 61 800 plants ha−1 and row spacing <0.76 m; and (iii) optimum N rate can
    be more accurately estimated using a model that considers row spacing and plant
    density. MATERIALS AND METHODS Site Characteristics, Experimental Design, and
    Treatments The study was conducted at the University of Nebraska Northeast Research
    and Extension Center–Haskell Agricultural Laboratory near Concord, NE (42°23′
    N, 96°57′ W) during 1996, 1997, and 1998. The soil is classified as an Alcester
    silty clay loam (mesic Cumulic Haplustoll) with 30 g kg−1 soil organic matter
    and 6.1 pH in the surface soil. Soil Bray-P1 was 32, 26, and 22 g kg−1 and exchangeable
    NH4OAc K was 330, 229, and 301 g kg−1 in the 0- to 0.30-m depth for 1996, 1997,
    and 1998, respectively. In the spring, before N fertilizer application, mean soil
    NO3–N concentration to a depth of 0 to 0.76 m was 11.4, 2.9, and 7.2 mg kg−1 for
    the respective years. The experimental design was a randomized complete block
    in a split-split-plot treatment arrangement with three replications. The main
    plot factor was plant density with targeted densities of 61 800 (low), 74 160
    (medium), and 86 520 (high) plants ha−1 Intended populations were not achieved
    in every year; hence the terms low, medium, and high will be used in the discussion.
    The low planting rate is typical of populations grown under irrigation in the
    area in which this research was conducted. The main plot size was 12.2 by 24.4
    m. Row spacing treatments (0.51 and 0.76m) comprised the split plots, which measured
    6.1 by 24.4 m. These treatments aimed for within-row distances between plants
    of 0.22, 0.18, and 0.15 m and 0.32, 0.26, and 0.23 m for the 0.76- and 0.51-m
    row spacing at the low, medium, and high plant densities, respectively. The split-split
    factor was N fertilizer rate (0, 84, 168, and 252 kg N ha−1); N was surface applied
    (unincorporated) using dry NH4NO3 (34–0–0) with a 3-m-wide Barber spreader (Barber
    Engineering Co., Spokane, WA) on 11 June 1996, 10 June 1997, and 19 May 1998.
    Experimental units in the split-split plot measured 3.0 by 12.2 m. The trial was
    conducted on a different part of the same field each year, with the whole field
    planted in corn during the 3 yr. Corn was always the preceding crop. The site
    was irrigated with 25.4 mm of water using a lateral irrigation system when soil
    water was <50% of field capacity. There were four, five, and three applications
    in 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively. Irrigation water contained 20 mg L−1 NO3–N
    and 5 kg ha−1 N as NO3 was applied with each irrigation event. Daily weather data
    were collected at the laboratory (Fig. 1). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer Precipitation,
    and accumulation of growing degree days (GDD) following crop emergence, for the
    growing seasons of 1996, 1997, and 1998. Crop Management The land was prepared
    for planting by disk followed by cultivator tillage. Corn hybrid Pioneer 3394
    (matures at 1290 growing degree days) was planted on 29 May 1996, 8 May 1997,
    and 5 May 1998. The 0.51-m rows were planted with a 12-row John Deere 7300 custom-built
    planter and the 0.76-m rows were planted with an eight-row John Deere 7100 planter
    (Deere, Inc., Moline, IL). Weeds were controlled using preplant herbicides. Field
    and Plant Measurements Yield data were collected on 4 Nov. 1996, 22 Oct. 1997,
    and 24 Sept. 1998. Plants were cut at the surface from the central 6.1 m of the
    two middle rows in the wide-row plots and the three middle rows in the narrow-row
    plots. Ears were separated, shelled, weighed, and the moisture content was measured.
    Grain yields were adjusted to 155 g kg−1 water content. Biomass yield was calculated
    from stover and grain weights, which were adjusted to oven-dry weights after subsamples
    of grain and stover were dried at 60°C. Grain and stover subsamples were analyzed
    for N content using the Dumas dry oxidation procedure (Bremner, 1996). Total plant
    N content was determined by combining stover N and grain N estimated on the basis
    of 0 g kg−1 water. Harvest index and N harvest index were calculated by dividing
    grain dry weight by biomass dry weight, and harvested grain N uptake by total
    plant N uptake, respectively. Agronomic efficiency of applied N (AEN, kg grain
    yield increase kg−1 N applied) and apparent recovery efficiency of applied N (REN,
    kg total N uptake kg−1 N applied) were determined as: AEN = (GY+N − GY0N)/N and
    REN = (UN+N − UN0N)/N, where GY is the grain yield (kg ha−1), UN is the aboveground
    plant N accumulated (kg ha−1), N is the amount of applied N (kg ha−1), and +N
    and 0N refer to treatments with and without N applied, respectively. The number
    of seeds planted at each row spacing to achieve each target plant density differed
    due to planter differences (Table 1) but the data were analyzed and results interpreted
    under the assumption that row spacing and plant density treatments were independent
    of each other (Teasdale, 1998). Table 1. Seed drop to achieve intended plant densities

    10.18 † Narrow rows were planted with a 12-row John Deere 7300 (Deere & Co., Moline,
    IL) planter and wide rows were planted with an eight-row John Deere 7100 custom-built
    planter. Seed drop was different due to the limitations of each planter. Data
    Analysis Crop performance data were analyzed using the SAS PROC GLM procedure
    to develop the ANOVA for a split-split-plot design. The PROC MIXED procedure was
    used to make tests of simple effects (Little et al., 1996). Row spacing was treated
    as a qualitative variable, and plant density and N rate as quantitative variables.
    For PROC MIXED, plant density, row spacing, and N rates were treated as fixed
    effects, and year and replication were treated as random effects. RESULTS AND
    DISCUSSION Plant Nitrogen Grain N concentration and uptake were affected by the
    N × year interaction (Table 2). There was a positive linear relationship between
    N rate and grain N concentration in 1997 and 1998, but with no effect of N rate
    on grain N concentration in 1996 (Fig. 2a). Table 2. Analysis of variance of the

    Grain N uptake was also affected by the row spacing × year interaction, as N uptake
    was less with 0.76- than with 0.51-m row spacing in 1996 and 1997, but unaffected
    by row spacing in 1998 (Table 3). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer The effect of

    N content for the 168 and 252 kg ha−1 N rates (Table 4). Grain N uptake was further
    increased at the highest plant density by increasing the N rate to 252 kg ha−1
    with 0.51-m row spacing but decreased with 0.76-m spacing in 1996 and 1997, while

    reduced in 1997 and the low population was below the target population by 7233
    plants ha−1 In other years, when the low population was closer to the target population,
    HI was similar at all populations (Table 5). Table 5. Plant density effects on

    and stover were not significant. ‡ Quadratic effects due to plant density were
    not significant for all traits. § Counts for 1998 were for ear number rather than
    plants at harvest. Nitrogen HI decreased as linear and quadratic functions of
    N rate in 1996 and 1998, but was not affected by N rate in 1997 (Fig. 3). Harvested
    grain N increased less with increased N rates relative to accumulated stover N,
    resulting in the decreased N HI values at higher N rates. Row spacing had no effect
    on N HI (Table 3). The N HI was highest at the lowest plant density in 1997, but
    was not affected by plant density in the other years (Table 4). The apparent recovery
    efficiency of applied N in the aboveground crop ranged from 0.23 to 0.58, 0.21
    to 0.37, and 0.16 and 0.30 kg accumulated N kg−1 applied N at the first, second,
    and third increment of applied N, respectively. Agronomic efficiency of applied
    N ranged from 5.8 to 22.1, 4.8 to 14.6, and 3.8 to 9.6 kg grain yield increase
    kg−1 N applied at the first, second, and third increment of applied N, respectively.
    Differences in N use efficiency were related to grain and biomass yield response
    to applied N. Apparent recovery efficiency and agronomic efficiency, as well as
    yield increase, were greater in 1997 than in the other years. The values for these
    efficiency traits were generally less and declined more with increased N rate
    than observed by Binder et al. (2002) elsewhere in eastern Nebraska; this increased
    efficiency was due to high yield response to applied N at three of four trials.
    Biomass and Grain Yield Corn biomass increased with applied N in a quadratic manner
    in 1996 and 1997, but the linear and quadratic functions of N rate were not significant
    in 1998 (Fig. 2b). In all years, the main effect of increasing N rate from 168
    to 252 kg ha−1 did not result in an increase in biomass. Corn biomass production
    was less in 1997 with the 0.76- than the 0.51-m row spacing (Tables 2 and 3),
    but unaffected in 1996 and 1998. Biomass yield was not affected by plant density,
    except in 1998 when biomass was decreased at low plant density (Table 5). Mean
    grain yields were 8.67, 7.51, and 10.40 Mg ha−1 in 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively.
    The year × N rate interaction effect for grain yield was due to differing responses
    to applied N for rates above 84 kg N ha−1 (Table 2). In 1998, grain yield was
    increased with 84 kg N ha−1 applied but did not respond to additional N, with
    the effect that neither the linear nor the quadratic functions of N rate were
    significant (Fig. 4). The response of grain yield to increased N application rate
    was linear and quadratic in 1996 and 1997, agreeing with the results of others
    (Blackmer and Sanchez, 1988; Jokela, 1992; Liang et al., 1996). The reason for
    the N rate × year interaction effect is not clear but possibly more N was released
    from mineralization of soil organic matter in 1998 due to more precipitation in
    March and April than in other years. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer Corn grain
    yield (Y) as a linear function of N fertilizer rate in 1996 and a quadratic function
    of N fertilizer rate in 1997 and 1998. Interaction effects of row spacing with
    plant density and N rate were not significant for grain yield. The simple effect
    (Little et al., 1996), however, for the row spacing × N rate interaction, at high
    plant density, was significant. At the high plant density, grain yield was less
    at the 252 kg N ha−1 rate than with the 168 kg N ha−1 rate for the 0.76-m row
    spacing in 1996 and 1997 (Table 4) while yield was increased or unchanged for
    the 0.51-m row spacing. Grain yield was higher with 0.51- vs. 0.76-m row spacing
    in 1996 and 1997, but not in 1998. The increased yield with 0.51-m spacing is
    supported by the findings of others who have reported yield increases of up to
    10% with reduced row spacing (Hodges and Evans, 1990; Polito and Voss, 1991; Porter
    et al., 1997; Ulger et al., 1997; Widdicombe and Thelen, 2002). High yields can
    be achieved with 0.76-m row spacing, however, as was the case in 1998 when grain
    yields were higher than in previous years and the main effect of row spacing was
    not significant. The advantage of 0.51- over 0.76-m row spacing may therefore
    be related to management and specific growing conditions. A notable difference
    in the 1998 season, compared with the other seasons, is the greater rate of growing
    degree day accumulation following planting in May and subsequent earlier physiological
    maturity, but this does not offer an explanation for the lack of response to reduced
    row spacing. The absence of a row-spacing effect on yield in 1998 may be due to
    the great plant growth, resulting in canopy interception of a very large proportion
    of the incident incoming photosynthetically active radiation at both row spacings
    (Ottman and Welch, 1989). Andrade et al. (2002) found that yield response to decreased
    row spacing was negatively correlated to radiation interception at pollination
    time with the wider spacing. Radiation interception was not measured in this study,
    but it is likely that the proportion of incoming radiation intercepted was very
    high with both row spacings in 1998 due to the great amount of plant growth. The
    main effect of plant density was not significant for grain yield (Tables 2 and
    5). These results differ with findings in Maryland where grain yield increased
    as plant density was increased from 56 000 to 128 000 plants ha−1 (Teasdale, 1998),
    but crop competition with weeds was a factor in that study. Porter et al. (1997)
    reported maximum corn grain yield at 82 000 to 89 000 plants ha−1 Cox and Cherney
    (2001) reported increased corn silage yield by changing plant density from 80000
    to 116000 plants ha−1 There was no plant density × row spacing interaction, although
    theory based on plant crowding alone suggests that such an interaction should
    occur with a greater advantage with narrower row spacing at high plant density
    than at lower plant density (Duncan, 1984). Porter et al. (1997) also found that
    the row spacing × plant density interaction did not significantly affect yield.
    Grain yield response to row spacing and plant density might have been different
    for other hybrids. Porter et al. (1997), however, found in a study with six adapted,
    high-yielding hybrids, that corn hybrids were similarly affected by plant density
    and row spacing. Grain Yield Response Models In 1996, a linear model, with row
    spacing as a factor (Bullock and Bullock, 1994), accounted for >90% of the grain
    yield response to applied N (Fig. 4a). The quadratic model was also significant,
    but the linear model is presented due to the small quadratic coefficient. The
    model predicted more grain production at 252 kg N ha−1 for both row spacings (9.40
    and 8.84 Mg ha−1 for 0.51- and 0.76-m row spacing, respectively) than for lower
    N levels. It also predicted 6.9% more grain yield across N rates for 0.51- vs.
    0.76-m spacing, with a yield gain of 2.2 kg ha−1 mm−1 for reduction in row spacing.
    The linear model did not allow prediction of potential maximum yield. In 1997,
    yield data were fitted to a quadratic yield model that predicted optimum grain
    yields of 8.23 and 8.60 Mg ha−1 at 240 and 200 kg N ha−1 for the 0.76- and 0.51-m
    row spacings, respectively (Fig. 4b). The row-spacing effect on grain yield was
    similar to that in the 1996 model. The 1997 model predicted an average yield advantage
    of 7.8% with 0.51- vs. 0.76-m row spacing across all N rates, with a yield gain
    of 2.2 kg ha−1 mm−1 for reduction in row spacing. In 1998, the yield response
    to N rate was quadratic and the maximum predicted yield was 11.12 Mg ha−1 at 150
    kg ha−1 of N (Fig. 4c). Row spacing effects did not account for significant variation
    in yield response to N rates. Plant density did not affect response to applied
    N, but N use efficiency was increased with narrower row spacing when plant density
    was at the highest level. The results, therefore, suggest that it is not necessary
    to consider plant density (>62 000 plants ha−1) in determination of N rate. Optimal
    N rate was affected by row spacing in 1 yr only and row spacing (<0.76 m) is not
    a major determinate of N fertilizer requirements. Treatment × corn hybrid interactions
    were not addressed in this study. Corn hybrid × N rate interactions can be important
    (O''Niell et al., 2004), but the effects of row spacing and plant density on this
    two-way interaction are not known. The lack of hybrid interactions with row spacing
    (Ottman and Welch, 1989) and plant density (Porter et al., 1997) suggests that
    the three-way interactions may not be very important and that our information
    on N-rate interactions with row spacing and plant density are applicable to other
    adapted, high-yielding hybrids. The optimal N rate for grain year differed across
    years. The N rates to achieve 98 and 99% of maximum yield, averaged across years
    and row spacing, were 123 and 143 kg ha−1 Nitrogen uptake with no fertilizer N
    applied, however, was 124, 86, and 165 kg ha−1 with 132, 53, and 101 kg ha−1 of
    N available to the crop in 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively, from soil and irrigation
    water NO3–N. CONCLUSIONS This research tested three hypotheses. The results are:
    (i) reduced row spacing, but not increased plant density, resulted in more crop
    N uptake and more grain yield; (ii) yield response to applied N was not greater
    with increased plant density and reduced row spacing; and (iii) optimum N rate
    cannot be better predicted by considering plant density and row spacing. Maximum
    grain yield and yield response to applied N can be achieved with 62 000 plants
    ha−1 when weeds are well controlled. High grain yield can be achieved with 0.76-m
    row spacing but yield was 6 to 8% higher with 0.51- than with 0.76-m row spacing
    in 2 of 3 yr. Grain yield was regularly increased with application of 84 kg N
    ha−1 but response to higher rates was inconsistent. Grain yield response to applied
    N and the optimum N application rates were generally similar for 0.51- and 0.76-m
    row spacing and for the range of plant densities tested, but response to applied
    N was greater with 0.51-m rows when plant density was high. Row spacing and plant
    density need not be considered in a model for estimation of optimum N rate. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

    derived food,Soils Environmental Science & Technology Abstract To achieve food
    and environmental security, closing the gap between actual and attainable N-use
    efficiency should be as important as closing yield gaps. Using a meta-analysis
    of 205 published studies from 317 study sites, including 1332 observations from
    rice, wheat, and maize system in China, reactive N (Nr) losses, and total N2O
    emissions from N fertilization both increased exponentially with increasing N
    application rate. On the basis of the N loss response curves from the literature
    meta-analysis, the direct N2O emission, NH3 volatilization, N leaching, and N
    runoff, and total N2O emission (direct + indirect) were calculated using information
    from the survey of farmers. The PFP-N (kilogram of harvested product per kilogram
    of N applied (kg (kg of N)−1)) for 6259 farmers were relative low with only 37,
    23, and 32 kg (kg of N)−1 for rice, wheat, and maize systems, respectively. In
    comparison, the PFP-N for highest yield and PFP-N group (refers to fields where
    the PFP-N was within the 80–100th percentile among those fields that achieved
    yields within the 80–100th percentile) averaged 62, 42, and 53 kg (kg of N)−1
    for rice, wheat, and maize systems, respectively. The corresponding grain yield
    would increase by 1.6–2.3 Mg ha–1, while the N application rate would be reduced
    by 56–100 kg of N ha–1 from average farmer field to highest yield and PFP-N group.
    In return, the Nr loss intensity (4–11 kg of N (Mg of grain)−1) and total N2O
    emission intensity (0.15–0.29 kg of N (Mg of grain)−1) would both be reduced significantly
    as compared to current agricultural practices. In many circumstances, closing
    the PFP-N gap in intensive cropping systems is compatible with increased crop
    productivity and reductions in both Nr losses and total N2O emissions. This publication

    growing food demands while simultaneously reducing agriculture’s reactive N (Nr)
    losses, especially N2O emissions, is gaining scientific and public attention.
    (1-3) By 2050, projected global crop production is predicted to increase to 1343,
    915, and 891 million tons for maize, rice, and wheat, respectively, which is 53%,
    27%, and 32% higher than crop production in 2012. (4, 5) In the future, yield
    increases that rely on increased N inputs will likely result in larger Nr losses
    per unit of output; only yield increases driven by improved N-use efficiency (NUE)
    would be expected to reduce Nr emissions per unit of output. (6-9) Therefore,
    to achieve food and environmental security, closing the gap between actual and
    attainable NUE should be as important as closing yield gaps. The NUE is a complex
    term with many components, and can be defined as the yield produced per unit of
    N applied, absorbed, or utilized by the plant to produce grain and straw. (10-12)
    The broadest measure of NUE is the ratio of yield to the amount of applied fertilizer
    N, also called the partial factor productivity of applied N, PFP-N). The PFP-N
    is a useful index because it does not require measurement of grain yield in unfertilized
    plots and grain and/or plant N uptake. (10) In practice, PFP-N gaps have always
    been part of overall integrated crop management and site-specific nutrient management.
    (10, 13, 14) With limited in situ data available from earlier studies, N loss
    responses to N inputs have often been evaluated for combinations of multiple crops
    and across large regions, up to a global scale. (15-19) Bouwman (15) in 1996 summarized
    the existing research on the direct release of N2O from the fertilization of different
    crops (e.g., grass, rice, wheat, maize, and legumes) and reported a generalized
    fertilizer-induced emission rate of 1.25% of the amount in the fertilizer applied.
    A subsequent study in 2002 reduced this estimate to 0.9%. (17) In a more recent
    study, Linquist et al. reported the N2O emission response to added N and yield-scaled
    GHG emissions is significantly different for rice, wheat, and maize systems based
    on a global database. (18) In developing countries, because of high temperatures
    and the widespread use of urea, ammonium sulfate, and ammonium bicarbonate, estimated
    NH3 volatilization loss from, and in industrialized countries it amounts to 7%.
    The estimated NH3 loss from synthetic fertilizers amounts to 18% in developing
    countries and 7% in industrialized. (16) However, there are gaps in our knowledge
    regarding the crops and regional capacity to produce more spatially disaggregated
    emission factors either by conducting meta-analyses of field measurements or by
    deriving the factors empirically. Studies on crop productivity and on Nr losses
    have been notably disconnected, although both are clearly linked to fertilization
    and management practice. (10-12, 15-19) A better understanding of the complex
    linkages of crop productivity with PFP-N and Nr losses for major cereal crops
    in China and the potential for increasing the yield while reducing Nr losses is
    important to define both global fluxes and emission-mitigation opportunities better.
    China must expeditiously address the joint challenges of production (with the
    world’s largest population on a relatively small amount of agricultural land)
    and environmental degradation (with hundreds of thousands of pollution-related
    premature deaths each year). (20) Here, we present a new database for rice, wheat,
    and maize production in China that was created from a meta-analysis of the literature
    and a survey of farmers. Using this database, we compared Nr losses (i.e., direct
    N2O emissions, NH3 volatilization, N leaching, and N runoff) and total N2O emissions
    (direct N2O plus indirect N2O emission) in response to N application rates for
    rice, wheat, and maize systems in China. Then we calculated Nr losses and total
    N2O emission for current farmer practice, and evaluated the PFP-N gap and its
    effect on grain yield, Nr losses, and total N2O emission based on a survey of
    farmer practices. Materials and Methods ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Survey of Farmer
    Practices The survey of farmer practice was conducted in the actual production
    in wheat–maize rotation systems in the North China Plain and the rice–wheat systems
    in the Yangtze River Valley. In these regions, two to eight townships were randomly
    selected in each county, and four to six villages were randomly selected in each
    township. From these, eight to ten farmers were randomly selected for a face-to-face
    questionnaire-based household survey that was conducted once a year between 2004
    and 2009. Farmer surveys had to meet specific criteria to be included in the data
    set. First, the farmers’ personal information, such as address and telephone number,
    had to be complete, so that they could be resurveyed. Second, only survey that
    include fertilizer products, N concentration, fertilizer application rate, and
    grain yield were used. For grain yield, N application, and PFP-N, only a few observations
    (<5%) fell outside the normally expected ranges of the entire data set (Supporting
    Information Figures S1–3). However, considering the great variation in each parameter
    among fields, we treated the upper and lower 2.5% of the data as outliers (Supporting
    Information Figure S1–3). In this study, a total of 1541 (25 counties in five
    provinces), 2938 (39 counties in five provinces), and 1807 farmers (34 counties
    in four provinces) were surveyed between 2004 and 2009 for rice, wheat, and maize,
    respectively. Data Collection and Meta-Analysis for N Losses An exhaustive literature
    survey of peer-reviewed articles published prior to December 2012 was undertaken
    using the China Knowledge Resource Integrated (CNKI) database (Beijing, China),
    ISI-Web of Science (Thomson Reuters, NY, USA), and Google Scholar (Google, Inc.,
    Mountain View, CA, USA). The literature survey focused on field measurements of
    Nr losses for wheat and maize planted in wheat-maize rotation systems and for
    rice systems planted in rice-wheat rotation systems. We concentrated on Nr losses,
    including direct N2O emissions, NH3 volatilization, N leaching, and N runoff.
    Studies had to meet specific criteria to be included in the data set. First, Nr
    losses had to have been measured throughout the entire growing season in the field
    experiments. Second, NH3 volatilization had to have been measured using the micrometeorological
    method (21) or the German wind tunnel method, (22) for at least 2 weeks after
    N fertilization. Direct N2O emissions had to have been measured using the static,
    opaque chamber method (23) and measured manually on a daily basis for at least
    7 days after N fertilization and for at least 3 days after other events that might
    have triggered N2O emissions, such as rainfall, irrigation, or tillage and weekly
    or biweekly during the remaining periods. (24) N leaching (NO3––N) had to have
    been measured using a suction cup, lysimeter, (25) or soil sampling methods. (26)
    The final data set collected from the literature survey consisted of 205 published
    studies covering 317 study sites and 1332 observations, including directly measured
    536 observations of direct N2O emissions, 313 observations of NO3– leaching, 155
    observations of N runoff and 328 observations of NH3 volatilization. Descriptions
    of the data used for the meta-analyses are given in Table 1 and Supporting Information
    Tables S1–S10. All data collected from the literature were for wheat–maize rotation
    systems in the North China Plain (32–41°N, 113–120°E) and rice–wheat rotation
    systems in the Yangtze River Valley (27–34°N, 102–122°E). Table 1. Number of References,

    responses of direct N2O emissions, NH3 volatilization, N leaching, and N runoff
    to increasing N application rates were subjected to regression analysis to identify
    the best-fitting curve from the linear or exponential models, defined using data
    from the literature meta-analysis. (27) The corrected R2-values were used for
    model selection in addition to visual inspection of each response curve type.
    The total N2O emissions in this study occur through a direct pathway (i.e., directly
    from the soils to which the N is added), and through two indirect pathways: volatilization
    of compounds such as NH3 and NOx with subsequent redeposition, and NO3–-N through
    leaching and runoff. Indirect N2O emissions can be estimated following the IPCC
    methodology, (28) whereby 1% and 0.75% of the volatilized N-NH3 and leached N-NO3
    are lost as N2O-N, respectively. The total Nr losses are the sum of N losses from
    direct N2O emission, NH3 volatilization, N leaching, and N runoff, and the total
    N2O emission is the sum of direct N2O and indirect N2O emissions. Using data from
    the literature meta-analysis, the direct N2O emission, NH3 volatilization, N leaching,
    N runoff and the total N2O emission were calculated. The response curves of both
    Nr losses and total N2O emissions to the N application rate were subjected to
    regression analysis to identify the best-fitting curve from the linear or exponential
    models. (27) Model selection was based on the corrected R2 values and a visual
    inspection of each type of response curve. Nr Losses and Total N2O Emissions Determined
    from the Survey of Farmers On the basis of the N loss response curves from the
    literature meta-analysis, the Nr losses (expressed per unit of crop production
    area, kg of N ha–1) and their intensity (expressed per unit of grain yield, kg
    of N (Mg of grain)−1) were calculated using information from the survey of farmers.
    Total N2O emissions and their intensity were also calculated using information
    from the survey. Data Analysis The N balance was defined as the N application
    rate minus above-ground N uptake. The crop N uptake was estimated from the relationship
    between crop N uptake and grain yield rice (1) wheat (2) maize (3) where N uptake
    is crop N uptake and Y is grain yield. (29-31) The PFP-N is defined as the ratio
    of crop yield per unit of N fertilizer applied. (10) where Y and N are the grain
    yield (kg ha–1) and N application rate (kg of N ha–1), respectively. By considering
    all of the survey data and removing the top and bottom 2.5% of respondents, three
    groups were defined in this study. The highest PFP-N group comprised farmers whose
    PFP-N was within the 80–100th percentile of all farmers; the group with the highest
    yields were farmers whose yields were within the 80–100th percentile of all farmers;
    and the highest yield and highest PFP-N group included the farmers whose PFP-N
    was within the 80–100th percentile among those fields that achieved yields within
    the 80–100th percentile. The use of the highest farm PFP-N as a proxy for PFP-N
    potential is only appropriate in intensively managed cropping systems where farmers
    apply levels of fertilizer and pest and disease controls that make it possible
    to approach the PFP-N potential. For all farmer survey data, we used farmers as
    replicates, and data were analyzed following the analysis of variance using a
    one-way ANOVA in SAS (SAS Institute, 1993). (27) Means of cropping systems (rice,
    wheat, and maize) and groups (farm average, highest PFP-N, highest yield, and
    highest yield and PFP-N) were compared using the least significant difference
    (LSD) at a 0.05 level of probability. Results ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Considering
    all of the observation data for N fertilization from meta-analyses, averages of
    0.70%, 0.53%, and 0.86% of the N applied as fertilizer were emitted as direct
    N2O, 2.98%, 10.1%, and 22.2% of the N applied was leached from the soil, and 17%,
    14%, and 24% of N applied was volatilized as NH3 for rice, wheat, and maize, respectively
    (Table 1). In the rice system, an average of 5.37% of the N applied was lost in
    runoff (Table 1). Response of Nr Losses and Total N2O Emissions to N Application
    Rates There were significant correlations among N application rate and direct
    N2O emissions (Figure 1a, Supporting Information Figure S4a, d), N leaching (Figure
    1b, Supporting Information Figure S4b, e), and N runoff (Supporting Information
    Figure S5), defined using data from the literature meta-analysis, all of which
    increased exponentially with increasing N application rate (P < 0.001) in the
    rice, maize, and wheat systems. (32) In contrast, NH3 volatilization increased
    linearly with increasing N application rate (P < 0.001, Figure 1c; Figure S4c,
    f). (32) Figure 1 Figure 1. Estimated direct N2O emissions (a), N leaching (b),
    and NH3 volatilization (c) curves in response to the N application rate, defined
    using data from a literature meta-analysis for the rice, wheat, and maize systems.
    N leaching included both leaching and runoff from rice systems. The detailed data
    for the rice and wheat systems are shown in Supporting Information Figures S4–5;
    the curve for maize was adapted from Cui et al. (2013). The relationship between
    N2O and the N application rate was Y = 0.37e0.0061x, Y = 0.33e0.0054x, and Y =
    0.48e0.0058x for the rice, wheat, and maize systems, respectively. The relationship
    between N leaching and the N rate was Y = 2.221e0.0048x, Y = 2.7e0.0088x, and
    Y = 4.46e0.0094x for the rice, wheat, and maize systems, respectively. The relationship
    between NH3 volatilization and the N application rate was Y = 0.16x + 2.97, Y
    = 0.17x – 4.95, and Y = 0.24x + 1.3 for the rice, wheat, and maize systems, respectively.
    The seasonal Nr losses, calculated based on the meta-analysis, increased exponentially
    with increasing N application rate (P < 0.001, Figure 2a). The calculated Nr loss
    for maize increased more sharply than did those for rice and wheat. This sharp
    increase in Nr losses with high N application in the maize system was attributed
    to high N leaching with increasing N application rate. The total N2O emissions,
    calculated based on the meta-analysis, also increased exponentially with increasing
    N application rate (P < 0.001, Figure 2b). When 150 kg N ha–1 were applied, the
    difference in seasonal total N2O emissions between the maize and rice systems
    was 0.61 kg of N ha–1; this value increased to 1.72 kg of N ha–1 when the N rate
    increased to 300 kg of N ha–1. Figure 2 Figure 2. Estimated Nr loss (a) and total
    N2O emission (b) curves in response to N application rates for the rice, wheat,
    and maize, systems, respectively. The curves were calculated based on the response
    of N losses to the N application rate defined using data from the literature meta-analysis.
    The relationships between total N2O emissions and the N application rate were
    Y = −62 + 281e0.0055x, Y = −54 + 230e0.0054x, and Y = −32 + 312e0.0061x for the
    rice, wheat, and maize systems, respectively. The relationships between Nr losses
    and the N application rate were Y = −31 + 40e0.0034x, Y = −9 + 15e0.0061x, and
    Y = −4 + 19e0.0069x, respectively. Grain Yield, PFP-N, Nr Losses, and Total N2O
    Emission of Current Farming Practices Among the 6259 farmers surveyed, the average
    grain yield (range) was 7.1 (3.8–10.1 Mg ha–1), 6.1 (3.4–8.3 Mg ha–1), and 6.9
    Mg ha–1 (3.8–10.5 Mg ha–1) for the rice, wheat, and maize systems, respectively
    (Table 2). Corresponding average N application rates (range) were 214 (95–479
    kg of N ha–1), 284 (102–573 kg of N ha–1), and 229 kg N ha–1 (102–552 kg of N
    ha–1) for these three systems (Table 2). Table 2. Grain Yield, N Rate, N Surplus,

    aAverage values were placed into three groups: the highest PFP-N group (80–100th
    percentile), the highest yield group (80–100th percentile), and the highest yield
    and highest PFP-N group (where the PFP-N was within the 80th to 100th percentile
    among those fields that achieved yields within the 80th to 100th percentile).
    Total numbers were n = 1,541, n = 2,938, and n = 1,807 for rice, wheat, and maize
    respectively. The N application rates and grain yields are as reported by farmers,
    the PFP-N and N surplus were calculated from these values, and the N losses were
    calculated from the results of the meta-analysis. The N application rates exceeded
    crop N uptake. The resulting N surpluses were 83, 135, and 106 kg N ha–1 for the
    rice, wheat, and maize systems, respectively. As a result, the PFP-N was only
    37, 25, and 32 kg (kg of N)−1 for the rice, wheat, and maize systems, respectively
    (Table 2). Calculated Nr losses were 57, 100, and 106 kg N ha–1, or 26.6%, 35.4%,
    and 46.3% of the N applied to the rice, wheat, and maize systems, respectively
    (Table 2). The calculated total N2O emissions following N fertilization were in
    the order maize ≈ wheat > rice systems (P < 0.05). The total N2O emissions intensity
    (kg N2O Mg grain–1) of fertilized systems was in the order wheat ≈ maize > rice
    systems (Table 2, P < 0.05). High N application and low grain yields result in
    high N surplus, Nr losses, and total N2O emission for wheat systems under current
    farming practices. The PFP-N Gap and Its Effect on Grain Yield, Nr Losses, and
    Total N2O Emissions under Current Farming Practices Compared to an average farm
    fields, the N application rate for the highest PFP-N group was lower by 36% (77
    kg N ha–1), 55% (126 kg N ha–1), and 29% (66 kg N ha–1), and the corresponding
    crop yields were greater by 8%, 6%, and 13% for the rice, wheat, and maize systems,
    respectively. As a result, the N balance for the highest PFP-N group was around
    zero, with only a small range from −6 to 27 kg N ha–1. Compared to an average
    farm fields, the corresponding PFP-N for the highest PFP-N group increased by
    54% (from 37 to 57 kg (kg of N)−1), 68% (from 25 to 42 kg (kg of N)−1), and 53%
    (from 32 to 49 kg (kg of N)−1) for the rice, wheat, and maize systems, respectively.
    The corresponding Nr loss intensities were reduced by 44%, 69%, and 49%, and total
    N2O emission intensities were reduced by 47%, 66%, and 56% for the rice, wheat,
    and maize systems, respectively (Table 2). For the highest yield group, compared
    to the average farm, grain yields increased by 27% (∼1.9 Mg ha–1), 25% (∼1.5 Mg
    ha–1), and 34% (∼2.3 Mg ha–1) for the rice, wheat, and maize systems, respectively,
    and the corresponding N application rates increased by only 11%, 7%, and 13%,
    respectively (Table 2). As a result, the N surplus was also high at around 72–122
    kg N ha–1, and the PFP-N increased by only 14%, 13%, and 19% for the rice, wheat,
    and maize systems, respectively. Although the intensities of Nr losses and total
    N2O emissions for the highest yield group were decreased, the total Nr losses
    increased by 12%, 11%, and 24%, and the total N2O emissions increased by 16%,
    10%, and 22% for the rice, wheat, and maize systems, respectively, as compared
    to the average (Table 2). The total N2O emissions and Nr losses and their intensities
    were significantly higher for the highest yield group than the corresponding values
    for the highest PFP-N group, indicating high environmental costs (Table 2, P <
    0.05). When N management was further improved, for the highest yield and PFP-N
    group, crop yields increased by 24% (1.7 Mg ha–1), 27% (1.6 Mg ha–1), and 34%
    (2.3 Mg ha–1) with the corresponding N application rates reduced by 33% (70 kg
    N ha–1), 35% (100 kg N ha–1), and 24% (56 kg N ha–1) for the rice, wheat, and
    maize systems, respectively (Table 2). As a result, the N balance for the highest
    yield and PFP-N group was around zero, with only a small range from −17 to 14
    kg N ha–1.The corresponding PFP-N increased by 68% (from 37 to 62 kg (kg of N)−1),
    69% (from 25 to 42 kg (kg of N)−1), and 66% (from 32 to 53 kg (kg of N)−1), the
    calculated total N2O emission intensities were reduced by 53% (0.15 kg N Mg grain
    –1), 64% (0.29 kg N Mg grain –1), and 52% (0.23 kg N Mg grain –1), and Nr loss
    intensities decreased by 49% (4 kg N Mg grain –1), 68% (11 kg N Mg grain –1),
    and 54% (9 kg N Mg grain –1) (Table 2) for the rice, wheat, and maize systems,
    respectively. Discussion ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To In China, average N application
    rates exceed crop N uptake, resulting in a large N surplus. As a result, the PFP-N
    for cereal cropping systems is only 25–37 kg (kg of N)−1, which is lower than
    the world average (44–72 kg (kg of N)−1) . (10) The potential environmental impacts
    of low PFP-N can be substantial. With current farming practices, the calculated
    Nr losses were 57, 100, and 106 kg N ha–1 with 26.6%, 35.4%, and 46.3% of the
    N applied to rice, wheat, and maize systems, respectively. The total N2O emissions
    resulting from N fertilization averaged 2.05, 2.71, and 2.94 kg N ha–1 for the
    rice, wheat, and maize systems, which is significantly higher than the respective
    global average values of 0.67, 1.27, and 2.38 kg N ha–1 reported by Linquist et
    al. (18) In the future, Chinese cereal production must optimize N management and
    reduce Nr losses and N2O emission. The consequences of such changes would have
    a positive impact at the global scale. The Potential of PFP-N for Intensive Cropping
    Systems The potential PFP-N can be estimated from estimates of input and export
    processes by mass balance. A surplus or deficit is a measure of the net depletion
    (output > input) or enrichment (output < input) of the system, or simply of the
    “unaccounted for” N. In agricultural systems, additional N supply other than chemical
    N fertilizer can increase PFP-N; in contrast, additional N losses can reduce PFP-N
    and lead to increased N input to maintain the same grain yield. In the long term,
    the size of the organic N pools can reach a steady state or change very slowly,
    (8) and the potential PFP-N should then be close to or less than the grain yield/crop
    N demand, unless additional N source inputs, such as organic fertilizer, biological
    N fixation, N deposition, or irrigation N exist. Due to differences in grain/whole
    plant N concentrations, the potential PFP-N without an additional N source increases
    in the order of wheat (∼41 kg (kg of N)−1) < rice (∼55 kg (kg of N)−1) ≈ maize
    (∼57 kg (kg of N)−1). (29-31) A high PFP-N can be achieved with an additional
    N source, such as legume crop rotation and organic N input, or soil N depletion,
    such as under African conditions with a N deficit. (8) In this study, the highest
    yield and PFP-N group increased their PFP-N to 42 and 53 kg (kg of N)−1 for the
    wheat and maize systems, respectively, which was close to each crop’s potential
    PFP-N. The PFP-N for rice averaged 62 kg (kg of N)−1, which is higher than the
    55 kg (kg of N)−1 potential PFP-N because of the N deficit of ∼17 kg N ha–1 (Table
    2). Here, the N balance was calculated from the N fertilizer application minus
    the N uptake by the crop and did not account for inputs of N via deposition, irrigation
    water, and the return of harvested straw to fields. Total environmental N inputs
    were about 89 kg N ha–1 for the rice–wheat system in the Taihu region and about
    104 kg N ha–1 for the wheat–maize system in the North China Plain; (24) therefore,
    N losses can and do persist even when the N surplus is zero, especially in the
    summer maize growing season (Table 2). In the U.K., the average PFP-N for winter
    wheat increased from 36 kg (kg of N)−1 in 1986/90 (186 kg of N ha–1 and 6.6 Mg
    grain–1) to 42 kg (kg of N)−1 by 2006/10 (186 kg of N ha–1 and 7.8 Mg of grain
    ha–1). (33) In the USA, annual surveys of cropping practices indicate that the
    PFP-N of maize has increased from 43 kg (kg of N)−1 in 1981/85 to 62 kg (kg of
    N)−1 in 2006/10 with increasing grain yields from 6.6 to 9.7 Mg ha–1 at a constant
    N application rate (∼150 kg of N ha–1). (34) Nr Losses from Cropping Systems With
    typical farming practices, averages of 8.4%, 19.4%, and 20.8% of the applied N
    were either leached or lost as runoff from the rice, wheat, and maize systems,
    respectively. In the rice system, a hard layer formed below the plow layer after
    the paddy soil had been plowed, due to clay deposition and low redox ability,
    and this appeared to reduce N leaching from the rice crop. (35, 36) In the wheat–maize
    system, nitrate accumulation in the soil profile and gradual leaching below the
    root zone were the important N loss pathways under conventional agricultural N
    management practices because of concentrated rainfall in the summer and flood
    irrigation. (33, 36) Under current farming practices, averages of 0.72%, 0.66%,
    and 0.88% of the applied N were emitted as direct N2O in the rice, wheat, and
    maize systems, respectively, which is much higher than the IPCC 2006 guideline
    of 0.3% for paddy rice soil and slightly lower than the guideline of 1% for upland
    soil. (28) The lower direct N2O emissions from the wheat system may be due to
    limited denitrification by the low availability of carbon sources and low soil
    moisture in the predominantly subhumid upland soils of the North China Plain.
    (33, 36) The frequent dry–wet cycle in rice–wheat rotation systems can stimulate
    N2O emissions. (37, 38)Although the N2O losses recorded in this study represent
    a negligible N loss from an agronomic perspective, they represent a substantial
    amount from a total GHG perspective because N2O has ∼298 times greater global
    warming potential than does CO2. In Chinese cropping systems, 16%, 17%, and 24%
    of the applied N was volatilized as NH3 in the rice, wheat, and maize systems,
    respectively, which was similar to results reported by Bouwman et al. (16) and
    was significantly higher than the 10% emission factor suggested by the IPCC. (28)
    In a previous study evaluating an irrigated wheat/maize rotation system, high
    NH3 volatilization was attributed to the high pH (around 8) of calcareous soils,
    together with the surface broadcasting of urea before either irrigation or rainfall.
    (24) In a rice system, the traditional practice of applying urea to surfaces has
    resulted in NH3 volatilization. (24, 39, 40) More efficient fertilizers (new forms
    of N and modified fertilizers and inhibitors that lead to a slow/controlled release)
    and more efficient N application methods, such as deep injection, banding, or
    fertigation with deep placement, may both reduce surface N losses and increase
    plant N use, resulting in reduced N losses overall, especially as NH3. (41) Opportunities
    for Closing the PFP-N Gap to Achieve Food and Environmental Security Techniques
    that enhance grain yields and crop N uptake, such as genetic improvements and
    management practices, remove restrictions on crop growth and N demand, leading
    to increased yields. Although modern crop varieties have been introduced to China,
    and sufficient (or even excessive) N and P fertilizers are applied in some regions,
    the yield gaps for rice, wheat, and maize remain relatively high. (42, 43) Management
    practices that influence the availability of soil and fertilizer N for plant uptake
    can minimize N losses through the better management of N sources, application
    rates, timing, and placement, thereby increasing the PFP-N. (10-12) In practice,
    soil N supply in the root zone should be managed to match the quantity required
    by the crop. It should also be synchronized with crop growth and be spatially
    coupled to the N supply and crop N requirements. (44, 45) Although gains in yield
    and environmental quality can be achieved by the highest yield and PFP-N group,
    uncertainty remains in using the top 80–100th percentile of farmers (based on
    yield and PFP-N) as a proxy for the potential PFP-N available to all farmers.
    The actual ability to achieve high yields and low Nr losses will be determined
    by a great complexity of factors that vary among different regions and that include
    the local environment, soil type, and management practices. (46, 47) However,
    there is increasing evidence that the majority of these gains can be practically
    realized in major cropping systems if we invest in agronomic research that incorporates
    an ecosystem perspective and if the effort to modify and adapt intensive agricultural
    systems is pursued across the boundaries of different disciplines. (48-50) Without
    multidisciplinary cooperation among (at least) soil science, agronomy, ecology,
    genetics, economics, and social sciences and without the engagement of farmers,
    it is unlikely that we will be able to double crop yields while also protecting
    environmental quality and conserving natural resources. In the future, yield increases
    in China must follow new trajectories if they are to meet the challenges of the
    growing food demands of an ever-increasing population, without further compromising
    environmental integrity. Our results demonstrate the importance of closing the
    PFP-N gap in intensive cropping systems to achieve food and environmental security.
    The enhancement of crop yields is compatible with reductions in Nr losses or total
    N2O emissions. Closing the PFP-N gap by significantly increasing grain yields
    with the careful and efficient management of N fertilizer is critical in the pursuit
    of sustainable and increased agricultural outputs. Therefore, improvement of crop
    yields combined with efficient N management should prevail among a portfolio of
    strategies required to meet food demands and simultaneously reduce total N2O emissions.

    strategies used by wheat to tolerate and recover from drought events will be important
    for ensuring yield stability in the future, but studies addressing this critical
    research topic are limited. To this end, the current study quantified the physiological,
    biochemical, and agronomic responses of a drought tolerant and drought sensitive
    cultivar to periods of water deficit and recovery. Drought stress caused a reversible
    decline in leaf water relations, membrane stability, and photosynthetic activity,
    leading to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, lipid peroxidation
    and membrane injury. Plants exhibited osmotic adjustment through the accumulation
    of soluble sugars, proline, and free amino acids and increased enzymatic and non-enzymatic
    antioxidant activities. After re-watering, leaf water potential, membrane stability,
    photosynthetic processes, ROS generation, anti-oxidative activities, lipid peroxidation,
    and osmotic potential completely recovered for moderately stressed plants and
    did not fully recover in severely stressed plants. Higher photosynthetic rates
    during drought and rapid recovery after re-watering produced less-pronounced yield
    declines in the tolerant cultivar than the sensitive cultivar. These results suggested
    that the plant’s ability to maintain functions during drought and to rapidly recover
    after re-watering during vegetative periods are important for determining final
    productivity in wheat. Similar content being viewed by others A double-stranded

    2021 Introduction Within an agricultural context, drought is a prolonged period
    of deficient precipitation which results in negative impacts on crop growth or
    yield. An increasingly warming climate is expected to intensify the frequency
    and severity of drought in the near future1. Thus, identifying key physiological
    limitations to productivity under drought and mechanisms of crop tolerance to
    water deficit stress will be important for improving yield stability in a changing
    climate. Moreover, limited genetic diversity within important crop species coupled
    with ecological constraints to productivity need to be overcome in-order to adapt
    crops to episodic drought events in the future2,3. The ability of plants to maintain
    physiological functions at low plant water status and recover quickly once the
    stress is removed will be important for ensuring sustainable crop production under
    intermittent drought events4. The effects of drought stress have been well-documented
    in many crop species; however, reports addressing physiological responses to progressive
    drought and recovery upon re-watering are relatively limited3. Reduced plant growth
    and productivity under drought are caused by altered plant water relations, decreased
    CO2 assimilation, cellular oxidative stress, membrane damage of affected tissues,
    and in some instances, inhibition of enzyme activity. Plants respond to drought
    stress by exploiting the following mechanisms: (1) drought escape by completing
    the life cycle before the onset of severe water limitation4; (2) drought avoidance
    through an enhanced water conserving mechanism via stomatal closure and reduction
    of leaf area or canopy cover1; (3) drought tolerance through osmotic adjustment
    and increased cell wall elasticity5, and (4) drought resistance through altered
    metabolic changes such as an increased antioxidant metabolism6. Plants can employ
    the above-mentioned mechanisms in response to drought stress consecutively or
    simultaneously. Under drought stress, reductions in carbon assimilation result
    in an imbalance between electron excitation and utilization through photosynthesis,
    which results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), primarily superoxide
    (O2•−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)6. These ROS damage cell membranes, proteins,
    and nucleic acids, causing oxidative stress7. The intercellular concentration
    of malondialdehyde (MDA) indicates the extent of oxidative stress8. The plants
    possess enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms to detoxify ROS9. Superoxide dismutase
    (SOD) catalyzes the conversion of O2•− to the less reactive H2O210. This H2O2
    is further detoxified to O2 and H2O through the activities of catalase (CAT) and
    ascorbate peroxidase (APX). Combined, the three enzymes noted above ensure low
    intracellular levels of O2− and H2O211. Glutathione (GSH) and carotenoids are
    among the non-enzymatic antioxidants involved in cellular defense12. GSH protect
    the chloroplasts from ROS damage by increasing the ratio of reduced glutathione
    to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG)13, whereas carotenoids safeguard the photosynthetic
    apparatus by dissipating excess excitation energy into heat14. Similarly, under
    drought conditions, plants can alter water relations to maintain cellular functions4.
    For example, plants exhibit osmotic adjustment by synthesizing and accumulating
    compatible solutes such as free amino acids, sugars, and proline15. Osmotic adjustment
    allows the plant to maintain turgor pressure and cell volume at low water potential,
    which is important for maintaining metabolic functions4,16. In addition, osmotic
    adjustment facilitates the recovery of metabolic activities after relief from
    stress16. Although attempts have been made to investigate the recovery of photosynthesis
    from drought stress in different crop species including wheat3,5,16, studies addressing
    membrane stability, oxidative stress, antioxidative process, and osmolyte dynamics
    during drought recovery are limited. Moreover, studies quantifying the impact
    of plant metabolic changes during drought and recovery periods during vegetative
    development on final productivity in wheat are, to our knowledge, non-existent
    because physiological changes during reproductive stages are understandably related
    to grain yields and have received far more attention17. Nonetheless, stress events
    during vegetative growth periods can significantly influence grain yield of wheat
    and should be investigated further17. After drought stress is removed, the availability
    of even a small amount of rainfall can have a significant effect on plant physiological
    functions, ranging from whole-plant responses to biochemical responses. Therefore,
    it is of particular importance to investigate the underlying mechanisms contributing
    to drought tolerance4. We hypothesized that 1) final productivity in wheat would
    be dependent on the ability to maintain photosynthetic stability under drought
    stress and to rapidly recover to pre-drought levels upon rewatering, 2) the ability
    to osmotically adjust and protect cellular components from oxidative stress will
    be critical factors influencing tolerance to episodic drought during the vegetative
    phase. The present experiments were carried out to quantify physiological and
    yield responses of wheat cultivars to episodic drought and re-watering when they
    were subjected to different intensities of drought during vegetative growth stages.
    Results Two wheat cultivars, Luhan7 and Yangmai16, hereafter referred to as ‘tolerant’
    and ‘sensitive’, were exposed to severe and moderate soil water stresses during
    tillering and jointing stages, respectively, followed by re-watering (Fig. 1)
    to quantify the metabolic changes associated with drought tolerance in wheat.
    Figure 1 Experimental design of the study: drought stress treatments were applied
    during tillering and jointing stages by withholding irrigation till the soil field
    capacity (FC) reached 35–40% and 55–60% for severe stress (SS) and moderate stress
    (MS), respectively. The drought treatments were maintained for 10 days by weighing
    the pots and compensating the water lost to the desired FC and then followed by
    re-watering at 75–80% FC. Severe and moderate water deficit treatments during
    tillering and jointing were designated as SS and MS, respectively, while, well-watered
    (control) was designated as WW treatments. Full size image Amount of water applied
    An average amount of water applied to plants of Luhan-7 and Yangmai-16 during
    the drought periods in both growing seasons under different drought treatments
    is given in Table 1. During severe (SS) and moderate stress (MS) applications,
    Yangmai-16 used less amount of water than Luhan-7 as compared to WW treatment.

    at tillering and jointing stages of Luhan-7 and Yangmai-16 wheat cultivars. Full
    size table Changes in net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance Figure
    2 shows that drought stress induced a gradual decline in net photosynthetic rate
    (Pn) and stomatal conductance (gs) as compared to WW plants during the stress
    period. The magnitude of decline was greater (P ≤ 0.05) for plants under severe
    drought stress (SS) during the jointing stage than moderate stress (MS) during
    tillering in both cultivars. During both stages, under SS and MS treatments, the
    Pn and gs decreased more so in the sensitive cultivar than the drought tolerant
    cultivar when compared to WW plants. After re-watering, the plants showed a progressive
    increase in Pn and gs and recovered fully to the levels of the WW treatment under
    MS treatments at three days after re-watering (3DRW). By comparison only partial
    recovery of Pn and gs was noted for the SS treatments following the same recovery
    period. Plants from both stress treatments showed greater recovery when stress
    was imposed in the tillering stage than the jointing stage in the two cultivars.
    Figure 2 Effect of drought stress (SS: severe stress, MS: moderate stress and
    WW: well watered) on net photosynthetic rate (Pn) (A,B) and stomatal conductance
    (gs) (C,D) in Luhan7 (LH-7) and Yangmai16 (YM-16) wheat cultivars. SS and MS treatments
    were applied at 35–40% and 55–60% soil field capacity (FC), respectively for ten
    days at tillering and jointing growth stages followed by re-watering, whereas
    WW was maintained at 75–80% FC. Time-course of the measurements was one day before
    stress (0DS), 5th and 10th day of stress (5DS, 10DS), 1 and 3 days after re-watering
    (1DRW, 3DRW). Shaded areas indicate the measurements taken following re-watering.
    Each vertical bar above the means indicates standard error of six replicates (n = 6)
    by using two-way ANOVA at P < 0.05. Full size image Changes in membrane stability
    index and membrane injury Drought stress caused a decrease in membrane stability
    index (MSI) (Fig. 3A,B) and an increase in membrane injury (MI) (Fig. 3C,D) during
    the stress period. The magnitude of decline in MSI was greater (P ≤ 0.05) for
    plants under SS than that under MS treatments and it was more pronounced at jointing
    than at the tillering stage. During stress periods, tolerant plants maintained
    significantly (P ≤ 0.05) higher MSI and exhibited lower MI as compared to the
    sensitive cultivar. After re-watering, both MSI and MI recovered progressively
    to WW levels by 3DRW in MS plants, whereas the SS plants showed incomplete recovery
    within the same rewatering time frame. MSI and MI showed similar recovery trends,
    irrespective of the growth stage at which stress was imposed. Figure 3 Effect
    of drought stress (SS: severe stress, MS: moderate stress and WW: well watered)
    on membrane stability index (MSI) (A,B) and membrane injury (MI) (C,D) in Luhan7
    (LH-7) and Yangmai16 (YM-16) wheat cultivars. SS and MS treatments were applied
    at tillering and jointing growth stage at 35–40% and 55–60% soil field capacity
    (FC), respectively for ten days followed by re-watering, whereas WW was maintained
    at 75–80% FC. Time-course of the measurements was one day before stress (0DS),
    5th and 10th day of stress (5DS, 10DS), 1 and 3 days after re-watering (1DRW,
    3DRW). Shaded areas indicate the measurements taken following re-watering. Each
    vertical bar above the means indicates standard error of six replicates (n = 6)
    by using two-way ANOVA at P < 0.05. Full size image Changes in reactive oxygen
    species and MDA contents The contents of O2•−, H2O2 and MDA increased rapidly
    in SS and more moderately in MS as compared with WW plants (Fig. 4). The same
    trend for the generation of O2•−, H2O2 and MDA was observed during both growth
    stages; however, the magnitude of increase in the concentrations of these substances
    due to drought stress was lower during tillering than at jointing. Drought-stressed
    plants of the sensitive cultivar contained higher contents of O2•−, H2O2 and MDA
    than did plants of the tolerant cultivar, irrespective of growth stage. After
    re-watering, the concentration of O2•−, H2O2 and MDA decreased rapidly, especially
    in MS plants, which reached levels comparable to WW plants on 1DRW for the tolerant
    cultivar and on 3DRW in both cultivars. For SS plants, contents of O2•−, H2O2
    and MDA never fully declined to the level of WW plants, even after 3 DRW. Figure
    4 Effect of drought stress (SS: severe stress, MS: moderate stress and WW: well
    watered) on the production of superoxides (A,B), hydrogen peroxide (C,D) and MDA
    contents (E,F) in Luhan7 (LH-7) and Yangmai16 (YM-16) wheat cultivars. SS and
    MS treatments were applied at tillering and jointing growth stage at 35–40% and
    55–60% soil field capacity (FC), respectively for ten days followed by re-watering,
    whereas WW was maintained at 75–80% FC. Time-course of the measurements was one
    day before stress (0DS), 5th and 10th day of stress (5DS, 10DS), 1 and 3 days
    after re-watering (1DRW, 3DRW). Shaded areas indicate the measurements taken following
    re-watering. Each vertical bar above the means indicates standard error of six
    replicates (n = 6) by using two-way ANOVA at P < 0.05. Full size image Changes
    in enzymatic antioxidant activities During drought stress, the enzymatic activities
    of CAT, SOD, and APX increased (Fig. 5). A rapid increase in the activities of
    CAT and SOD was observed, which reached a maximum at 5DS, whereas, APX activity
    reached a maximum on last day of drought stress (10DS). Overall antioxidant enzyme
    activities were higher under SS than MS without any significant difference (P ≤ 0.05)
    between growth stages except for APX, which exhibited higher activity during the
    tillering stage than the jointing stage under SS. The tolerant cultivar exhibited
    higher antioxidant enzyme activity than the sensitive cultivar at both growth
    stages (P ≤ 0.05). After re-watering, CAT, SOD and APX activities decreased but
    remained higher in SS plants as compared to WW plants, even after 3DRW. By comparison,
    in MS plants, enzyme activities recovered to the level of WW plants on 3DRW for
    both cultivars. Figure 5 Effect of drought stress (SS: severe stress, MS: moderate
    stress and WW: well watered) on CAT (catalyses) (A,B), SOD (superoxidase dismutase)
    (C,D), and APX (ascorbate peroxidases) (E,F) activities in Luhan7 (LH-7) and Yangmai16
    (YM-16) wheat cultivars. SS and MS treatments were applied at 35–40% and 55–60%
    soil field capacity (FC), respectively for ten days at tillering and jointing
    growth stage followed by re-watering, whereas WW was maintained at 75–80% FC.
    Time-course of the measurements was one day before stress (0DS), 5th and 10th
    day of stress (5DS, 10DS), 1 and 3 days after re-watering (1DRW, 3DRW). Shaded
    areas indicate the measurements taken following re-watering. Each vertical bar
    above the means indicates standard error of six replicates (n = 6) by using two-way
    ANOVA at P < 0.05. Full size image Changes in non-enzymatic antioxidants At both
    levels of drought stress, a rapid increase in the content of GSH was observed
    during the early days of stress. As drought progressed, a decline in the pool
    of GSH occurred in both cultivars at both stages (Fig. 6A,B). The sensitive cultivar
    showed significantly (P ≤ 0.05) higher GSH contents than the tolerant cultivar
    both at tillering and jointing under SS and MS treatments. After re-watering,
    the GSH contents decreased to the level of WW plants under MS but remained higher
    under SS than under WW conditions. Carotenoid content of the stressed plants showed
    a decreasing trend with a greater reduction in content under SS than MS (Fig.
    6C,D). Under drought stress, the magnitude of reduction in carotenoids was significantly
    greater (P ≤ 0.05) for the sensitive cultivar than for the tolerant cultivar and
    this effect was most pronounced at the jointing stage. After re-watering, the
    carotenoid content tended to increase and reached levels comparable to WW plants
    by 3DRW for plants under MS, whereas carotenoid content remained lower than WW
    plants for the SS treatment, even after 3DRW. Figure 6 Effect of drought stress
    (SS: severe stress, MS: moderate stress and WW: well watered) on GSH (reduced
    glutathione) (A,B) and carotenoids (C,D) contents in Luhan7 (LH-7) and Yangmai16
    (YM-16) wheat cultivars. SS and MS treatments were applied at 35–40% and 55–60%
    soil field capacity (FC), respectively for ten days at tillering and jointing
    growth stages followed by re-watering, whereas WW was maintained at 75–80% FC.
    Time-course of the measurements was one day before stress (0DS), 5th and 10th
    day of stress (5DS, 10DS), 1 and 3 days after re-watering (1DRW, 3DRW). Shaded
    areas indicate the measurements taken following re-watering. Each vertical bar
    above means indicates standard error for six replicates. Each vertical bar above
    the means indicates standard error of six replicates (n = 6) by using two-way
    ANOVA at P < 0.05. Full size image Changes in contents of proline, amino acids
    and soluble proteins Under drought stress, the concentration of soluble protein
    decreased and that of free amino acids and proline increased (Fig. 7). A greater
    increase in amino acids and proline and conversely, a greater decrease in soluble
    protein content were observed under SS than MS treatments. The sensitive cultivar
    showed a lower magnitude of increase in amino acid and proline concentration and
    a higher reduction in soluble protein than the tolerant cultivar. After re-watering,
    the concentrations of all free amino acids, proline, and protein tended to return
    to well-watered levels, but more rapid recovery was observed under MS than SS
    treatments in both cultivars. Figure 7 Effect of drought stress (SS: severe stress,

    cultivars. SS and MS treatments were applied at 35–40% and 55–60% soil field capacity
    (FC), respectively for ten days at tillering and jointing growth stages followed
    by re-watering, whereas WW was maintained at 75–80% FC. Time-course of the measurements
    was one day before stress (0DS), 5th and 10th day of stress (5DS, 10DS), 1 and
    3 days after re-watering (1DRW, 3DRW). Shaded areas indicate the measurements
    taken following re-watering. Each vertical bar above the means indicates standard
    error of six replicates (n = 6) by using two-way ANOVA at P < 0.05. Full size
    image Changes in carbohydrates concentrations The total soluble sugars (TSS) and
    fructose accumulation increased due to drought stress as compared to WW conditions
    (Fig. 8). The increase in TSS and fructose was higher under SS than MS treatments
    and this trend was more pronounced during tillering than during jointing. Sensitive
    plants showed less of an increase in TSS and fructose than did tolerant plants.
    After re-watering, the concentrations of TSS and fructose decreased and rate of
    recovery was lower under SS than MS treatments in both cultivars. Figure 8 Effect
    of drought stress (SS: severe stress, MS: moderate stress and WW: well watered)
    on total soluble sugars (A,B) and fructose (C,D) production in Luhan7 (LH-7) and
    Yangmai16 (YM-16) wheat cultivars. SS and MS treatments were applied at 35–40%
    and 55–60% soil field capacity (FC), respectively for ten days at tillering and
    jointing growth stages followed by re-watering, whereas WW was maintained at 75–80%
    FC. Time-course of the measurements was one day before stress (0DS), 5th and 10th
    day of stress (5DS, 10DS), 1 and 3 days after re-watering (1DRW, 3DRW). Shaded
    areas indicate the measurements taken following re-watering. Each vertical bar
    above the means indicates standard error of six replicates (n = 6) by using two-way
    ANOVA at P < 0.05. Full size image Changes in leaf water relations and osmotic
    adjustment Drought stress at both stages altered leaf water relations by decreasing
    leaf water potential (Ψw), osmotic potential (Ψs), turgor osmotic potential (Ψs100),
    and RWC but increasing osmotic adjustment (OA) as compared to WW plants (Table
    2). During the drought periods, leaf water potential and magnitude of OA was lower
    in the sensitive cultivar than the tolerant cultivar. At the tillering stage,
    plants of both cultivars maintained higher water potential and relative water
    content and exhibited greater OA as compared to the jointing stage. After re-watering,
    stressed plants of both cultivars tended increase water potential and decrease
    OA values in both growth stages. Return of leaf water relations parameters to
    that of well-watered plants was more rapid in drought tolerant plants than sensitive
    plants, and differences between these cultivars were more pronounced at tillering
    stage than the jointing stage. Table 2 Changes in leaf water relations and osmotic
    adjustment under drought stress and re-watering conditions during tillering and
    jointing growth stages of two wheat cultivars. The measurements were made at last
    day of drought stress and three days after re-watering. Full size table Effects
    of drought stress on crop phenology, dry matter and grain yield traits The response
    of crop phenological, dry matter and grain yield traits to drought stress depended
    on the drought intensity, crop growth stage and the cultivar (Table 3). Moderate
    drought treatments applied both at tillering and jointing stages had little or
    no significant effect on days to anthesis (DA), grain filling duration (GFD),
    dry matter and grain yield reduction in both cultivars. However, severe drought
    stress treatments both at tillering and jointing significantly shortened the DA
    and GFD and reduced dry matter and grain yield traits including spike number per
    pot, grains per spike, 1000-grain weight and grain yield per pot. However, reductions
    in these growth and yield parameters under drought treatments were less in the
    tolerant cultivar as compared to the sensitive cultivar, and these reductions
    were more pronounced at jointing than tillering in both cultivars. Consequently,
    higher pre-drought limitation (PDL) and lower drought index (DI) values were recorded
    under SS than MS, and this trend was more pronounced in the sensitive cultivar
    than the tolerant cultivar. However, drought treatments increased harvest index
    in both cultivars when applied at both vegetative stages, indicating that drought
    during vegetative stages affected wheat performance mainly by reducing total dry
    matter accumulation. Table 3 Changes in crop phenology, dry matter and grain yield
    traits under drought treatments when applied at tillering and jointing growth
    stages of two wheat cultivars. Full size table Discussion Cultivar-specific metabolic
    responses were exhibited by wheat plants to cope with the effects of drought stress
    at the tillering and jointing stages of development. These differences in metabolic
    response to drought during vegetative development also resulted in altered crop
    phenology, dry matter accumulation, and final grain yield. Several drought tolerance
    mechanisms were employed by the crop and included ROS detoxification, maintenance
    of leaf water relations, and improved membrane stability were recorded, which
    enabled the wheat plants to evade lasting drought-induced damage, thereby allowing
    tolerant plants to more readily recover their physiological functions after re-watering.
    It was observed that plants upregulated ROS scavenging processes through enhanced
    antioxidant enzyme activity and increased content of non-enzymatic antioxidants
    and exhibited osmotic adjustment. However, the ability of wheat plants to maintain
    function during drought stress and recover after re-watering were dependent on
    the severity of drought stress, the crop growth stage at which drought occurred
    and the genotypic differences in drought tolerance. Photosynthesis and stomatal
    conductance were decreased during the drought period, and these changes were reversed
    after re-watering (Fig. 2). It is clear from Fig. 2, that photosynthetic sensitivity
    of wheat plants to drought stress was mainly attributed to declines in stomatal
    conductance, which decreased CO2 availability to chloroplast and ultimately limited
    net photosynthesis. Similarly, after re-watering, the recovery of gs and Pn in
    tandem indicated that increases in stomatal aperture with duration of rewatering
    facilitated diffusion of CO2 from the atmosphere to the carboxylation site of
    Rubisco. Lower Pn and gs rates (Fig. 2) and less amount of water used by plant
    of drought-sensitive cultivar (Yangmai-16) (Table 1) indicate that this cultivar
    maintained less plant metabolic activities relative to Luhan-7 cultivar during
    the stress periods. Similarly, a lower decrease in Pn and gs as a consequence
    of drought stress and a higher degree of recovery observed at the tillering stage
    suggested that the tillering stage can more readily adapt to drought stress and
    recover when compared to jointing stage. When CO2 availability and carbon fixation
    are reduced, ROS form due to saturation of the electron transport system but limited
    availability end electron acceptors6. We observed an excessive accumulation of
    O2•− and H2O2, leading to oxidative stress which caused an increase in MDA content,
    an indicator of oxidative damage to the membranes of stressed plants18. Higher
    ROS and MDA contents in the sensitive cultivar as compared to tolerant cultivar
    (Fig. 4) (P < 0.05) might be associated with greater photosynthetic inhibition
    under drought stress and an increased potential for ROS production. ROS capable
    of damaging the photosynthetic apparatus and cause oxidation of proteins, lipids,
    nucleic acids, and carbohydrates7,8. Our results showed that higher MDA concentration
    in drought-stressed plants was associated with higher H2O2 content and greater
    rate of O2•− generation, especially in the severely drought-stressed plants. Wheat
    plants displayed a suite of drought resistance and recovery traits to overcome
    the effects of oxidative stress. During the early days of drought, wheat plants
    showed a substantial increase in CAT and SOD activities. SOD converts O2•− into
    H2O2 which is further catabolized by CAT to prevent oxidative damage19. APX also
    functions as a major enzymatic scavenger for H2O220. During the stress period,
    the level of SOD and CAT increased immediately, but as the stress period prolonged
    to 10DS, their levels decreased (Fig. 5). This might be because these ROS scavengers
    are usually water soluble, and are destroyed during ROS detoxification or through
    self-oxidation. The cell has limited capability to re-synthesize the destroyed
    or oxidized scavengers during an extended period of stress34. Consequently, tissues
    become extremely prone to ROS attack under prolonged stress21. Cultivar-specific
    differences in antioxidant enzyme capacity may partially explain differences in
    tolerance as the sensitive cultivar exhibited less ability to increase and maintain
    antioxidant enzyme activity under drought stress, resulting in poorer recovery
    as compared to the more tolerant cultivar. As an example, the tolerant cultivar
    displayed enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity (SOD, CAT, and APX) and lower MDA
    accumulation Our results indicate that enhanced ROS detoxification promotes drought
    tolerance by decreasing oxidative damage to tissues, thereby facilitating greater
    recovery in more drought tolerant genotypes. A lower increase in GSH concentration
    in the tolerant cultivar seems counterintuitive initially, but it is likely that
    upregulation of antioxidant enzymes is the dominant method of ROS detoxification
    in the tolerant cultivar, whereas the sensitive cultivar exploited GSH as an attempt
    to mitigate oxidative stress (Fig. 6A,B). A greater magnitude of increase in the
    concentration of GSH in sensitive wheat leaves relative to tolerant wheat leaves
    during drought is in accordance with the previous report on wheat given by Herbinger
    et al.22. GSH can serve as an antioxidant either by scavenging ROS directly like
    ascorbate or indirectly as a reducing agent to convert ascorbic acid from its
    oxidized form to its reduced form10. In addition to developing a greater pool
    of antioxidants, the tolerant cultivar maintained a higher level of photoprotective
    pigments (carotenoids) (Fig. 6C,D). Carotenoids perform an important role in heat
    dissipation of excess excitation energy in the photosynthetic apparatus, which
    helps prevent the initial formation of superoxide in plants receiving excess light
    energy as photosynthesis declines under drought conditions6. Thus, the carotenoids
    might have played an important role in restraining ROS accumulation in the chloroplasts
    via photoprotection of the photosystem. After re-watering, the return of H2O2,
    O2−, and MDA concentrations in drought stressed plants to the level of WW plants
    indicated that wheat plants have the ability to tolerate and recover from water
    stress at the cellular level. Moreover, the activities of CAT, SOD, APX, and GSH
    remained slightly higher under severe stress but returned to level of WW plants
    under moderate stress after re-watering (Figs 5, 6), indicating that enzymatic
    and non-enzymatic antioxidants recovered to levels comparable to well-watered
    conditions, and that a steady-state level of ROS generation and scavenging rates
    was reached that minimized oxidative stress, which was also confirmed by lower
    MDA levels after re-watering (Fig. 4E,F). Under drought stress, a higher accumulation
    of soluble sugars, free amino acids, and proline were recorded in this study (Fig.
    7). It is suggested that these compatible solutes may aid in stress tolerance
    in wheat plants by improving osmotic adjustment, ROS detoxification, protein stabilization,
    and cell membrane protection6. As a result of the higher accumulation of osmolytes
    the osmotic potential of cells was decreased, which in turn facilitated diffusion
    of water into the cell, thereby maintaining a higher turgor potential (Table 2).
    The maintenance of favorable cellular turgor potential under water limited conditions
    allows the plant to maintain physiological functions such as stomatal opening,
    CO2 assimilation, and cell expansion and development23. Proline is considered
    the main component of osmotic adjustment and this osmolyte plays a key role in
    mitigating oxidative damage and stabilizing cell membranes24. These results are
    in agreement with the report of Yi et al. 20165 who found that under drought stress,
    there was a progressive increase in free proline in cotton plants, and that of
    Monreal et al. 200725 who reported a notable proline accumulation in sugar beet
    leaves when drought stress became severe and protein synthesis was diminished
    by giving rise to free amino acids. We observed that after re-watering, the proline
    and free amino acid concentrations returned to the values of WW plants. Under
    drought stress, the accumulation of proline and other amino acids and degradation
    of protein were inversely proportional to the water status of plants (Fig. 7),
    i.e., proline and amino acid production were correlated with a decrease in leaf
    water potential, suggesting the contribution of these solutes in osmotic adjustment.
    In addition to being an integral component of osmotic adjustment, soluble sugars
    have been reported to be closely associated with the cellular antioxidation system26.
    Nishikawa et al. 200527 also confirmed this relationship and found that high soluble
    carbohydrate production in the florets of broccoli enhanced ascorbate synthesis,
    which regulated ROS buildup in the chloroplast. Similarly, significant constructive
    effects of exogenously applied sugars have previously been reported in a herbicide-induced
    photo-oxidative stress remediation in Arabidopsis28. Data presented in Fig. 8
    indicate that wheat plants responded to drought stress with increased sugar accumulation,
    which might have increased the ROS scavenging potential of wheat plants. So, it
    can be proposed that higher ROS levels in the drought sensitive cultivar of the
    current study might be associated with lower levels of soluble sugars since sugar
    starved plants have been reported to produce more ROS29. Additionally, after re-watering,
    a rapid reduction in sugar levels might be an indication of a quick breakdown
    of sugars upon relief from stress providing the plants with sufficient energy
    to repair damaged tissues. Therefore, it can be elucidated that the synergistic
    association of sugars with the cellular antioxidative system contributes to drought
    tolerance in wheat. Phenological response to drought included earlier anthesis
    and maturity under severe drought stress (Table 3). Phenological adaptation is
    a well-developed drought-escape mechanism and a key determinant of grain yield
    in cereal crops30. The results showed that severe drought stress during vegetative
    stages particularly affected crop development, growth, and final productivity
    by altering plant physiological functions. The greater grain yield declines under
    drought stress in the drought-sensitive cultivar (Table 3), especially under severe
    stress might be associated with a greater decline in photosynthesis during stress
    and limited recovery after re-watering relative to the tolerant cultivar. The
    plants under severe stress exhibited earlier maturity with a shorter life cycle
    and had lower grain numbers and decreased weight per grain. The findings of lower
    final yields under drought stress during vegetative stages are in accordance with
    previous reports of Foulkes et al.30. Severe stress caused the plants to produce
    a small canopy and tended to senesce earlier, which hastened their life cycles
    and decreased grain number and weight. Conclusions Wheat cultivars exhibited different
    metabolic features in terms of ROS accumulation, oxidative damage, antioxidant
    capacity, and production of osmotically active solutes under moderate and severe
    drought levels in the present study. In the current study there were two tolerance
    mechanisms employed in response to drought stress; the first involved the upregulation
    of antioxidant enzyme (SOD, CAT, and APX) activity and production of non-enzymatic
    (GSH and carotenoids) antioxidants; whereas the second involved accumulation of
    soluble sugars, free amino acids, and proline to facilitate osmotic adjustment.
    These metabolic allow the wheat plant to withstand and survive water-deficit conditions.
    The more drought tolerant cultivar exhibited greater photosynthetic stability
    during drought and more rapid recovery following drought, primarily due to greater
    ability to scavenge ROS and to osmotically adjust. Moreover, plants were better
    able to recover from stress imposed during the tillering stage than the jointing
    stage, emphasizing the importance of drought timing in determining productivity.
    These results revealed that the plant’s ability to maintain physiological functions
    during drought and recover after re-watering during vegetative periods are important
    for determining final productivity in wheat. Materials and Methods Plant culture
    and growth conditions The experiment was carried out under a rain exclusion shelter
    during the growing seasons of 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 at Pailou Experimental Station
    of Nanjing Agricultural University (32◦04′N, 118◦76′E), China. The two most widely
    grown wheat cultivars in the region (lower Yangtze River Basin), namely Luhan7
    (drought-tolerant) and Yuangmai16 (drought-sensitive) were used as experimental
    materials2. These cultivars show similar phenology and yield potentials under
    optimum field conditions. Uniform selected seeds of both cultivars were surface-sterilized
    by dipping in 0.5% hypochlorite solution for 20 min and then rinsing thoroughly
    with distilled water followed by drying before sowing. Fifteen surface sterilized
    seeds were planted in free-draining plastic pots of 1125 cm3 volume. Each pot
    was filled with 8 kg air-dried, sieved (2 mm) and uniformly mixed clay loam soil
    with 13% soil moisture. At the time of soil filling, 0.8 g N, 0.5 g P2O5 and 1.1 g
    K2O per pot were applied for each treatment. Further, 0.4 g per pot N splits were
    applied at jointing and booting, respectively. Thinning was carried out 10 days
    after germination to ten seedlings per pot. Then a week later, the second thinning
    was done and seven uniform seedlings per pot were retained for subsequent studies.
    Each pot was irrigated to 75–80% field capacity (FC) (leaf water potential was
    −0.50 to −0.70 MPa) with tap water having 7.5 pH, 1.2 dsm−1 electrical conductivity
    (EC) and 1200 mg L−1 total soluble salts (TSS) until the start of the stress treatments.
    Drought stress application and management As shown under experimental design (Fig.
    1), three soil water regimes consisting of a non-limiting soil water level (WW),
    moderate drought stress (MS) and severe drought stress (SS) corresponding to 75–80%
    FC (leaf water potential −0.50 to −0.70 MPa), 55–60% FC (leaf water potential
    of −1.20 to −1.40 MPa), and 35–40% FC (leaf water potential of −1.80 to −2.20 MPa),
    respectively were applied to each cultivar. Another factor included in the experimental
    design was timing of drought stress. Specifically, the stages tillering (40 days
    after planting, Feekes 2.0, beginning of tillering) and jointing (130 days after
    sowing equivalent to Feekes stage 6.0) were selected to apply the severe and moderate
    drought stress treatments on separate replicates. For drought stress imposition,
    the irrigation to pots was withheld until the soil FC reached to 55–60% and 35–40%
    for moderate and severe drought stress, respectively. Then drought stress treatments
    were maintained for 10 days. Soil FC for the specific drought level was maintained
    by weighing pots and then compensating the water lost by the addition of an equivalent
    amount of water and measuring the pre-dawn leaf water potential on a daily basis.
    During the stress period, control pots were maintained at 75–80% FC. Soil water
    status of the pots was measured before the water application, and the amount of
    water required for irrigation was calculated by the equation below: $$W=D\times
    H\times A\times (FCI-FC0)$$ (1) where, W is the amount of irrigation water, D
    is the soil bulk density, H is the soil depth, A is the area of each pot, FC1
    is the desired soil field capacity, and FC0 is the actual soil field capacity
    before irrigation. A factorial experimental arrangement of treatments was utilized
    according to a completely randomized design with two levels of cultivar (Luhan7
    and Yuangmai16), three different water regimes (severe, moderate and well-watered)
    and two drought application stages (tillering and jointing) as independent variables
    of interest. Each treatment had 30 replicates for sampling and measurements. Plant
    sampling The uppermost, fully expanded leaves from six to ten plants in each treatment
    were separated one day before starting drought stress (0DS), the 5th and 10th
    day of drought stress (5DS, 10DS), and 1 and 3 days after re-watering (1DRW, 3DRW)
    at both growth stages. Three sampled leaves were immediately put into liquid N
    for five minutes and then stored at −40 °C for the assays of ROS, enzymatic and
    nonenzymatic antioxidants. Six leaves for each treatment were used for the determination
    of leaf water potential (Ψw), osmotic potential (Ψs), relative water contents
    (RWC), and membrane stability index. Other sampled leaves were oven dried at 70 °C
    for 72 h and powdered for the measurements of total soluble sugars, fructose and
    sucrose, proline and total free amino acid concentrations. Pots were only used
    once for sampling and measurements and then discarded from the experiment. Concomitant
    with destructive leaf samplings, leaf gas exchange measurements for net photosynthetic
    rate and stomatal conductance were also performed. Plant analysis and measurements
    Measurements of leaf water relations and osmotic adjustment Leaf relative water
    content (RWC) was determined according to the standard method proposed by Barrs
    and Weatherly, 196231 as RWC = (FW − DW)/(TW − DW), where FW is fresh leaf weight,
    DW is dry weight and TW is turgid weight after 24 h floating in distilled water
    at 4 °C in darkness. Leaf water potential (Ψw) was measured according to the method
    of Scholander, 196432 using a pressure chamber (PMS Instrument Co., Corvallis,
    OR, USA). Osmotic potential (Ψs) was measured according to Sánchez et al.33. The
    leaves were put in a glass vial at −20 °C for 24 h. After thawing at room temperature,
    the cell sap was extracted with a gentle hand compress, and the Ψs was measured
    by using a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor Vapor 5520, ELITech Group Inc., Logan,
    UT, USA). The turgid osmotic potential at 100% RWC (Ψs100) was determined by the
    equation: Ψs100 = Ψs × (RWC/100). Then osmotic adjustment (OA) was estimated as
    the difference in Ψs100 between well-watered plants (Ψsww100) and the drought-stressed
    plants (Ψsd100)34 $${\rm{OA}}={\rm{\Psi }}{{\rm{s}}}_{{\rm{ww}}}^{100}-{\rm{\Psi
    }}{{\rm{s}}}_{{\rm{d}}}^{100}$$ (2) Membrane stability index and membrane injury
    The membrane stability index (MSI) was measured by using a conductivity meter
    following the method of Khanna-Chopra and Selote, 200734. Leaf samples of 200 mg
    were thoroughly washed in double distilled water and placed in two separate 10 mL
    tubes of distilled water. One tube was heated for 30 min at 40 °C in a water bath
    and electrical conductivity was measured (C1). The second set was boiled for 10 min
    at 100 °C in a boiling water bath and electrical conductivity was measured (C2).
    The MSI was estimated by the equation given below: $${\rm{MSI}}=[1-(\frac{{\rm{C}}1}{{\rm{C}}2})]\times
    \,100\,$$ (3) Membrane injury (MI) was estimated as ratio of MSI of drought-stressed
    plants and MSI of control plants as given by Dhanda et al.35; $$\mathrm{MI}\,(
    \% )=[1-(\frac{{\rm{MSId}}}{{\rm{MSIc}}})]\times \,100\,$$ (4) Gas exchange measurements
    The photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance of individual leaf blades were
    measured between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m. using a portable photosynthesis system (Li-6400;
    LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The youngest fully expanded leaf was placed in
    the leaf chamber at a photon flux density of 1000 µmol m−2 s−1; the flow rate
    through the chamber was 500 µmol s−1 and the leaf temperature was 25 °C. The ambient
    CO2 concentration was approximately 380 µmol CO2 mol−1 air, and the vapor pressure
    deficit was approximately 2.0 kPa. Each treatment included six replications. Determination
    of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and enzymatic antioxidant activities
    Reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation (estimated by measuring the malondialdehyde
    contents: MDA) and antioxidant activities in the leaf were determined following
    the methods given by Tang et al.36 and Zhang et al.37. Fresh leaf samples (0.5 g)
    were sliced and homogenized in a mortar and pestle with 5 mL ice-cold extraction
    buffer containing 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 0.4% polyvinylpoly
    pyrrolidone (PVP). The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at
    4 °C. Then supernatants were collected and used as crude extracts for the above-cited
    assays by using a Pharmacia Ultra Spec Pro UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Pharmacia,
    Cambridge, England). Superoxides (O2•−) were determined with a reaction mixture
    of 0.5 mL phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 1 mL 1 mM hydroxylammonium chloride, 1.0 mL
    17 mM P-aminobenzene sulfonic acid and 1.0 mL 7 mM α-naphthylamine. The mixture
    was incubated at 25 °C for 60 min and absorbance was noted at 530 nm. Hydrogen
    peroxide (H2O2) was determined after isolation by peroxidase coupled assay using
    4-aminoantipyrine and phenol as donor substrates. The carbonyl content in oxidatively
    modified proteins was quantified using the 2,4-dinitrophenylhy-drazone assay procedure
    by recording the absorbance at 290 nm. Contents of MDA were determined through
    thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method at 532 nm, and then corrected by subtracting
    non-specific absorbance values at 600 nm by using an extinction coefficient of
    156 mmol L−1 cm−1. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was determined according
    to Tang et al. 201036 by adding 0.1 mL enzyme extract to a reaction mixture of
    1.5 mL 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.8), 0.3 mL130 µM methionine, 0.3 mL 750 µM
    nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT), 0.3 mL 100 µM EDTA-Na2, 0.300 mL 20 µM riboflavin
    and 100 µL distilled water, and illuminated under light of 4000 flux for 20 min
    and then sample absorbance was determined at 560 nm. One unit of SOD activity
    was considered as the amount of enzyme used for 50% inhibition of the NBT reduction.
    Peroxidase (POD) activity was determined by adding 50 µL enzyme extract to a reaction
    mixture containing 1.0 mL 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 5.5), 1.0 mL 0.3% H2O2 and
    0.95 mL of 0.2% guaiacol. The absorbance value at 470 nm for changes in a unit
    of POD enzyme activity was noted. For catalase (CAT) activity, 200 µL enzyme extract
    was added to the reaction mixture of 1.5 mL 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.8), 300 µL
    0.1 M H2O2 and 1.0 mL distilled water. The change in absorbance at 240 nm per
    minute as a unit of CAT activity was recorded. For ascorbate peroxidase (APX)
    activity, 200 μL enzyme extract was added to a reaction mixture of 50 mmol L−1
    potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.5 mmol L−1 ASC and 0.1 mmol L−1 H2O2. APX
    activity was determined by noting the decrease at 290 nm for 1 min in 1 mL of
    the reaction mixture. Determination of non-enzymatic antioxidants For reduced
    glutathione (GSH) determination, 0.5 g wheat leaves were homogenized with 5 mL
    of 3% metaphosphoric acid and centrifuged the homogenate for 10 min at 10,000 × g38.
    For carotenoid content determination, 0.2 g frozen leaf samples were placed in
    a vial with 4 mL of dimethyl sulphoxide for 24 h in the dark for pigment extraction.
    Then samples were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The absorbance
    of the supernatant was measured at 664 nm to calculate the concentration of carotenoids39.
    Determination of carbohydrates, free amino acids, proline, and soluble protein
    concentrations Total soluble sugars and fructose contents were determined spectrophotometrically
    from the soluble and residual fractions of ethanol-water extracts by following
    the methods described by DuBois et al.40. Total soluble sugar contents were determined
    at 620 nm using an anthrone reagent following by incubation at 90 °C. Fructose
    content was determined at 420 nm using concentrated H2SO4. Contents of total free
    amino acids and proline were determined at 570 and 520 nm, respectively by using
    a ninhydrin reagent as described by Bates et al.41. To determine the total soluble
    protein contents, 0.5 g frozen leaf samples were pestle and extracted by a buffer
    of sodium phosphate. The mixtures were centrifuged at 4,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min.
    The supernatants were standardized using bovine serum albumin solution and then
    absorbance values were recorded spectrometrically at 595 nm. Determination of
    phenological changes, dry matter, and grain yield traits The number of days from
    planting to anthesis was recorded when plants under a given treatment had reached
    50% flowering. Similarly, grain filling duration was expressed as the number of
    days from anthesis to grain physiological maturity, defined as when 50% of spikes
    under a treatment had reached grain maturity. At maturity, whole plants from five
    randomly selected pots were severed at the soil surface using pruning-scissors
    and weighed to determine total above-ground biomass. Pre-drought limitation (PDL)
    in above-ground dry matter production due to drought treatments was estimated
    according to Xu et al.3 as follows: $$PDL( \% )=\frac{(DMC-DMT)}{DMC}\,\times
    \,100$$ (5) where DMC is total dry matter in pots under WW conditions and DMT
    is the total dry matter under drought stress followed by re-watering. Spikes in
    a pot were cut to count the number of spikes per pot, threshed individually by
    hand and final grain yield traits were recorded. Harvest index was calculated
    as grain yield fraction of total aboveground biomass. $$HI( \% )=\,\frac{Grain\,yield}{Total\,above\,ground\,biomass}\times
    \,100$$ (6) Drought index (DI) was estimated as grain yield differences between
    drought stress treatments as compared to control pots according to method of Huang
    and Zhao 200142; $$DI=\frac{YD}{YW}$$ (7) where YD is the grain yield under drought
    stress treatments and YW is the grain yield under WW conditions. Data analysis
    A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using the General Linear
    Model procedure to calculate the effects of drought stress and cultivar on metabolic
    parameters for each sampling and measurement point as well as for end of season
    growth parameters. Means were compared using Duncan’s multiple comparison tests
    for post hoc analysis (P ≤ 0.05) using the SPSS statistical package (SPSS Inc.,
    Chicago, IL, USA). Figures were plotted by using Sigma Plot 10.0 software (Systat
    Software Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Change history 12 October 2020Editor''s Note:

    Get rights and content Abstract Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from a typical greenhouse
    vegetable system in Northern China were measured from February 2004 to January
    2006 using a close chamber method. Four nitrogen management levels (NN, MN, CN,
    and SN) were used. N2O emissions occurred intermittently in the growing season,
    strongly correlating with N fertilization and irrigation. No peak emissions were
    observed after fertilization in the late Autumn season due to low soil temperature.
    57–94% of the seasonal N2O emissions came from the initial growth stage, corresponding
    to the rewetting process in the soil. The annual N2O emissions ranged from 2.6
    to 8.8 kg N ha−1 yr−1, accounting for 0.27–0.30% of the annual nitrogen input.
    Compared with conventional N management, site-specific N management reduced N
    fertilization rate by 69% in 2004 and by 76% in 2005, and consequently reduced
    N2O emissions by 51% in 2004 and 27% in 2005, respectively. Previous article in
    issue Next article in issue Keywords Nitrous oxideGreenhouse tomatoNitrogen fertilization
    managementEmission factor 1. Introduction Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse
    gas which also contributes to the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer.
    It is estimated that agricultural soils contribute to about 50% of the global
    anthropogenic emissions (Mosier et al., 1998, IPCC, 2001). In addition, N2O emissions
    from agroecosystems might be underestimated because the sources and sinks of N2O
    are not well characterized (Chen et al., 2000, Mosier et al., 1998). To accurately
    quantify N2O emissions from agroecosystems, multiple factors must be taken into
    account, including soil properties, climatic conditions, agricultural practices
    and the impacts of vegetation, etc. (Ball et al., 1999, Hao et al., 2001, Koponen
    and Martikainen, 2004, Olesen et al., 2004, Smith et al., 1998, Yanai et al.,
    2003). Moreover, a high frequency sampling schedule is also needed as N2O emissions
    occur intermittently (Zheng et al., 2004, Xiong et al., 2006). In China, vegetable-cropping
    system is an important source of N2O emissions. The estimated direct N2O emissions
    from vegetable cultivation account for about 20% of the national cropland emissions
    (Zheng et al., 2004). Currently, the greenhouse vegetable area has reached 2.5
    million hectares in China (Li, 2005). It is also well known that greenhouse vegetable
    ecosystems usually receive excessive amounts of N fertilizer. For example, in
    the greenhouse vegetable cropping systems, N fertilization rates in Beijing suburbs
    are about 1000 kg N ha−1 (Chen et al., 2004) and are >2800 kg N ha−1 yr−1 in Huimin,
    Shandong province (Ju et al., 2004, Ju et al., 2006). These fertilization rates
    are much higher than the average national N fertilization rates of about 180 kg
    N ha−1 yr−1 or 120 kg N ha−1 crop−1 (Zhu and Chen, 2002). The excessive N fertilization
    is undoubtedly the main reason of the high N2O emissions from vegetable cropping
    systems. Soil moisture is also a strong factor to influence N2O emissions. In
    a series of field experiments, soils subjected to higher levels of moisture showed
    increased emissions of N2O (Akiyama and Tsuruta, 2002, Mc Taggart et al., 2002,
    Zheng et al., 2000). However, data on N2O emissions from greenhouse vegetable
    cropping systems are lacking. In this study, a close chamber method was employed
    to measure N2O emissions from typical greenhouse vegetable cropping systems in
    Northern China. Water content and soil nitrate-N content were also monitored at
    the same time. The objectives of this study were 1) to quantify the diurnal pattern
    of N2O emissions, 2) to quantify N2O emissions throughout the growing season,
    and 3) to examine the N2O mitigation potential of several local N management practices.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental site The study site is located at Luojia
    village, Shouguang, Shandong province, China (36°55′ N, 118°45′ E). The selected
    greenhouse in this study was oriented in a north–south direction, 8.5 m wide (facing
    south) and 84 m long (total floor area of 614 m2). It was constructed of three
    clay walls: one main wall oriented in a north–south direction with a height of
    3.5 m, and two side walls in the west–east direction. The other side is leveled
    with soil. Polyethylene plastic sheets covered the top. Irrigation and fertilization
    comes in through a channel at the bottom of the main wall. The greenhouse has
    a 5-yr history of continuous tomato cultivation with two crops per year. The 0–0.1
    m soil pH (0.05 M CaCl2) is 5.7, organic matter content 18.3 g kg−1, nitrate-N
    160 kg N ha−1, NH4OAc-K 299 mg kg−1, and Olsen-P 299 mg kg−1, respectively. The
    soil texture of 0–0.3 m layer is silt loam. Water table is about 30 m deep. Nitrate-N
    content in irrigation water was 3–44 mg N l−1 during the experimental period.
    2.2. Treatments Four N treatments with three replications (plot size: 7.8 m ×
    5.6 m) were conducted in this study: (1) no fertilizer N treatment (NN): neither
    organic manure nor chemical N fertilization was used. It was taken as the control;
    (2) manure N treatment (MN): only organic manure was broadcasted as a basal fertilizer
    and no chemical fertilizer N was applied. In the four growing seasons, air-dried
    chicken manure of 8, 11, 8 and 11 t ha−1 was broadcasted before transplanting,
    supplying a total N input of 260, 360, 316 and 258 kg N ha−1, respectively; (3)
    conventional N management (CN): the same amount of chicken manure as with the
    MN treatment was applied. N fertilizer was applied following the local practice,
    the total amount at 870, 720, 630 and 720 kg N ha−1 with the N sidedressing rate
    of 120 kg N ha−1 each time in the four growing seasons, respectively (Table 1,
    Table 2); (4) site-specific N management (SN): with the same application rate
    of chicken manure as in the MN treatment, the requirement of N fertilizer was

    the Spring season spans from the transplanting period in February to the harvest
    period in June. The Autumn season is from August to January of the next year.
    July is the summer fallow period. The timing of N (urea: 46%) application in spring
    2004, spring 2005 and autumn 2005, and compound fertilizer (N:P2O5:K2O = 15%:15%:15%,
    ammonium-N) in autumn 2004 was based on weather condition and tomato cultivar
    in the investigated seasons. Triple superphosphate (P2O5: 46%) and potassium sulfate
    (K2O: 50%) were also used to maintain soil fertility and crop growth. Fertilizer
    N was first dissolved in water and then flushed with furrow irrigation water;
    while manure was broadcasted on the soil surface and then incorporated in the
    soil by plowing. Furrow irrigation was applied according to the local practice.
    In the four growing seasons, the irrigation times were 10, 11, 10 and 13, with
    656, 607, 611 and 687 mm in total, respectively (Table 1, Table 2). In summer
    fallows of 2004 and 2005, the amount of 56 and 74 mm irrigation water was used,
    respectively (Fig. 1b). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Time series

    and WFPS (line with crosses), and (c) soil nitrate-N content at 0.3 m depth for
    different N treatments in greenhouse tomato cropping system during four growing
    seasons in Shouguang, Northern China. NN, MN, CN and SN represented no N treatment,
    manure N treatment, conventional N management and site-specific N management,
    respectively (Detailed definitions are given in the “Treatments” subsection of
    the text). Dot arrows and solid arrows denote dates of transplanting and fertilizer
    N application as sidedressing, respectively. Tomatoes were grown in the greenhouse
    for four successive growing seasons. In 2004, tomatoes in Spring season (Lycopersicum
    esculentum Mill. cv. 852) and Autumn season (cv. 189) were transplanted on 15th
    February 2004 and 8th August 2004, respectively, and harvested on 10th June 2004
    and 20th January 2005, respectively. In 2005, tomatoes in Spring season (cv. Jipeng
    1) and Autumn season (cv. Pluster) were transplanted on 8th February 2005 and
    6th August 2005, respectively, and harvested on 6th June 2005 and 21st January
    2006, respectively. 2.3. In situ measurements A close chamber method was used
    to collect air samples from the experiment sites. The static chamber covered an
    area of 0.9 m × 0.7 m, and its height could be adjusted from 0.6 to 1.2 m depending
    on the plant heights inside. The main growing point was picked when tomato plants
    exceeded the size of the chambers. N2O concentration was measured by a Gas Chromatograph
    (Shimadzu, GC-14B, Japan) with an Electron Capture Detector (ECD) by using nitrogen
    (N2) as the carrier gas. Details for the GC–ECD method have been described by
    Wang and Wang (2003). Since using pure nitrogen as the carrier gas while no make-up
    gas or an ascarite filter was applied in the GC/ECD method can introduce biases,
    the raw observed N2O fluxes were corrected according to Zheng et al. (2008). The
    CN sites were selected to investigate the diurnal pattern of N2O emissions because
    the CN received the largest amount of N fertilizer and it may produce the clearest
    diurnal N2O fluxes among the four N treatments. On 21st and 27th of September
    in autumn 2004, N2O emissions were measured every 1 h from 8:00 AM to 18:00 PM
    and every 2 h from 18:00 PM to next 6:00 AM. On 4th and 8th of May in spring 2005,
    N2O emissions were measured every 2 h from 8:00 AM to next 6:00 AM. For the N2O
    emissions during any growing season, air sampling was carried out between 8:30
    AM and 10:30 AM every 1–3 days. Due to technical problems, N2O emissions were
    not measured for NN treatment in the Spring season of 2004 and for all N managements
    during the summer fallow period of 2004. Soil/air temperatures and soil moisture
    were also measured when air samples were collected. The soil temperatures at 0.02
    m and 0.1 m depth as well as the air temperatures inside and outside the chamber
    were recorded using a digital thermometer (Jminst, Model JM624, China). Soil samples
    from 0 to 30 cm were taken for analysis. Four soil cores (3.5 mm in diameter)
    were taken in each plot before transplanting, at each stage of fruit cluster development
    and at the end of harvesting. The volumetric soil moisture was determined gravimetrically
    after drying the soil at 105 °C for 12 h. Soil water-filled pore space (WFPS)
    was calculated by using mean soil bulk density: (1) where 2.65 (kg m−3) is the
    assumed soil particle density. To find out nitrate-N content, fresh soil samples
    were mixed thoroughly and sieved through a 5 mm mesh. Then, a 12-g sample was
    extracted with 100 ml of 0.01 M CaCl2 for 1 h. Nitrate-N was analyzed using a
    continuous flow analyzer (Bran Luebbe, TRACCS2000, Germany). At each harvest,
    tomato fruits were picked and weighed from an area 3.5 m × 1.4 m in each plot.
    2.4. Data analysis Data analysis such as ANOVA and the least significant difference
    (LSD) at the 5% level were conducted using SAS (6.0) software package. 3. Results
    3.1. Soil temperature, irrigation, WFPS and soil nitrate content As shown in Fig.
    1, the difference between soil temperatures at 0.02 m and 0.1 m depth was small
    and the variations of both temperatures followed the same pattern. In the later
    Autumn season from October to next January, the maximal soil temperatures were
    near or below 15 °C and soil warmed up in the Spring season continuously. Summer
    fallow period had the highest temperature (>30 °C) when no vegetable crop was
    grown in the greenhouses (Fig. 1a). The local irrigation rates were relatively
    high. Irrigation was applied 21 and 23 times, with the total amounts of 1319 and
    1372 mm in 2004 and 2005, respectively (Fig. 1b). As expected, WFPS changed strongly
    with irrigation. During the period from the transplanting to the first sidedressing,
    soil WFPS at 0.1 m ranged from 38 to 113% in Autumn 2004, 46 to 106% in Spring
    2005, and 46 to 122% in Autumn 2005, respectively. During the growing seasons,
    soil WFPS was about 100% after irrigation and over 50% during the late growing
    stage. Despite less irrigation, soil moisture was higher in autumn than in spring,
    mainly due to reduced evaporation. Soil NO3−-N content in 0–0.3 m layer was greatly
    influenced by the N application rate (Fig. 1c). Compared with Conventional N (CN)
    treatment, the site-specific management (SN) considerably reduced residual NO3−-N
    in 0–0.3 m soil layer. However, high soil NO3−-N contents were observed in no
    N (NN) treatment at the end of summer fallow in 2004 and 2005. This may have been
    caused by the high temperature during these periods which improved N mineralization
    (Quemada and Cabrera, 1997, Trindade et al., 2001) and nitrification. 3.2. Diurnal
    pattern of N2O emissions The diurnal N2O flux was measured in the plots of CN
    treatment and averaged over two replicates. Fig. 2 shows the N2O fluxes and the
    air and soil temperatures before and after the sidedressing and irrigation. Air
    temperature exhibited a large cyclic change on a daily basis, while soil temperature
    at 0.02 m and 0.1 m depth remained relatively stable. Before the fertilization
    and irrigation in the Autumn season of 2004, the N2O flux levels were relatively
    low, ranging from 12.9 to 27.0 μg N2O-N m−2 h−1 during the day. After the fertilization
    and irrigation, the N2O flux levels rose up and showed larger variations, from
    30.7 μg N2O-N m−2 h−1 around 8:00 AM to 278.3 μg N2O-N m−2 h−1 around 15:00 PM.
    In the Spring season of 2005, a similar pattern was observed: the N2O fluxes ranged
    from 9.7 to 30.4 μg N2O-N m−2 h−1 during the day before the sidedressing and irrigation,
    and 17.0 to 104.3 μg N2O-N m−2 h−1 after. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 2. Diurnal patterns of (a) N2O emissions before and after application of
    sidedressing and irrigation with conventional N management treatment, and (b)
    air temperature inside greenhouse and soil temperature at 0.02 m and 0.1 m depth
    in Autumn 2004 and Spring 2005 growing seasons in greenhouse tomato cropping system
    in Shouguang, Northern China. The fertilizer application of sidedressing contained
    ammonium and urea-N in Autumn 2004 and Spring 2005, respectively. Clearly, before
    fertilization and irrigation, N2O fluxes were low and showed no clear diurnal
    change with temperature. This may be due to the low available N content and soil
    moisture caused by crop uptake, evapotranspiration and/or leaching. In contrast,
    after fertilization and irrigation, N2O emissions peaked around 15:00 PM. The
    peak time was 2 h later than that of the highest inside air temperature and 1
    h later than that of highest soil temperature, respectively. After fertilization
    and irrigation, the fluxes of N2O from Autumn 2004 were more than that from Spring
    2005. This may be caused by the different forms of fertilizer N used. It takes
    some days for urea to hydrolyze into useable N for N2O production, while ammonium-N
    can be quickly used. Fig. 2 also shows that the average N2O fluxes from 9:00 to
    12:00 AM (148 μg N2O-N m−2 h−1 in the Autumn season of 2004 and 55 μg N2O-N m−2
    h−1 in Spring 2005, respectively) and from 20:00 to 23:00 PM (146 μg N2O-N m−2
    h−1 in Autumn 2004 and 66 μg N2O-N m−2 h−1 in Spring 2005, respectively) are close
    to the average daily fluxes (161 μg N2O-N m−2 h−1 in autumn 2004 and 60 μg N2O-N
    m−2 h−1 in spring 2005, respectively). This confirms that the sampling time between
    8:30 and 10:30 AM was appropriate. 3.3. Seasonal and annual dynamics and cumulative
    amounts of N2O emissions Fig. 3 shows the temporal variations of N2O emissions
    through four consecutive growing seasons. N2O emissions fluctuated greatly from
    −120 to 1041 μg N2O-N m−2 h−1 for NN, from −12 to 1421 μg N2O-N m−2 h−1 for MN,
    from −48 to 1905 μg N2O-N m−2 h−1 for CN, and from −37 to 1789 μg N2O-N m−2 h−1
    for SN during the entire experiment period, respectively. Negative flux of N2O
    in the later Autumn season implies the uptake of N2O. However, at the rates of
    the negative fluxes in Fig. 3, it is uncertain if the soil is a sink for N2O.

    N treatments during four consecutive growing seasons in greenhouse tomato cropping
    system in Shouguang, Northern China. NN, MN, CN and SN represent no N treatment,
    manure N treatment, conventional N management and site-specific N management,
    respectively (Detailed definitions are given in the “Treatments” subsection of
    the text). Arrows indicate the time of first sidedressing with CN and SN treatment.
    For all treatments, highest fluxes were observed on the transplanting day when
    the soil was wetted by irrigation. The pulses of N2O emissions driven by irrigation
    during the later growing stage were evidently lower than during the transplanting
    stage. Very low emissions of N2O were measured even after irrigation or fertilization
    at the later growing stage in the Autumn season. This may be due to the low soil
    temperatures which limited microbial nitrification and denitrification. As a result,
    cumulative seasonal emissions were less in Autumn season compared with Spring
    season, although application of total N and irrigation water was still high in
    Autumn season (Table 1, Table 2). Table 3 also indicates that N2O emissions mainly
    occurred in the period from transplanting to the first sidedressing, accounting
    for 57–94% of the cumulative seasonal emissions for four N treatments. Rewetting
    might be related to high N2O emissions at this stage. Table 3. Cumulative emissions

    d Averaged cumulative N2O emission over 2004 and 2005. N2O emission of NN treatment
    was only in 2005 because of not detected in Spring 2004. e Emission factor induced
    by total applied N from chemical fertilizer and manure over 2004 and 2005. N2O
    emissions in greenhouse soils are strongly related to fertilizer N inputs. As
    shown in Table 3, N2O emissions from the fertilized plots (MN, SN and CN) were
    1.1–6.8 times those from unfertilized plots (NN) during the four growing seasons.
    The obvious difference is probably due to the organic manure supplies C and N
    fertilizer provides NH4+ or NO3− for N2O production. Less N2O emission will be
    produced when less fertilizer N is used. As shown in Table 3, compared with the
    CN treatment, the fertilizer N input for SN treatment was reduced by 69% and 76%
    in 2004 and 2005, while the N2O emissions were reduced by 51% and 27%, respectively,
    without any negative effect on tomato yields. It is further noted that, even without
    direct N fertilization, there were high N2O emissions from NN treatment. Also
    as shown in Fig. 2c, 0–0.3 m nitrate-N test had considerable readings for NN treatment.
    It is believed that intensive N fertilization over the past years increased the
    residual N level in the soil. Annual emissions of N2O were calculated by integrating
    the linearly interpolated data in the growing seasons and fallow periods (Table
    3). The mean annual emissions of NN, MN, SN and CN treatments over 2004 and 2005
    were 2.6, 4.1, 5.4 and 8.8 kg N2O-N ha−1 respectively. Taking the N2O emission
    from the NN treatment as the background emission, the fertilizer-induced N2O emission
    factors for MN, SN and CN were 0.27%, 0.29% and 0.30% of the N input, respectively.
    4. Discussion Suitable sampling frequency is very important to estimate N2O emissions
    and identify the cause–effect relationships between agricultural management practices,
    soil properties and N2O emissions. The present study with a sampling frequency
    of two to four times per week demonstrates that the seasonal change of N2O emissions
    was driven by fertilization and irrigation, while the diurnal patterns were closely
    correlated with soil temperature in the greenhouse. As shown in Fig. 2, after
    fertilization and irrigation, with N input of 120 kg N ha−1, diurnal N2O fluxes
    are higher than those of a previous study, in which the values ranged from 60
    to 130 μg N2O-N m−2 h−1 with 150 kg N ha−1 (Akiyama and Tsuruta, 2003). Sampling
    frequency can explain this difference. In this study, diurnal N2O fluxes were
    measured 2 or 3 days after fertilization and irrigation in Autumn 2004 and Spring
    2005, while in the previous study, measurements were conducted 6 days after fertilization.
    Since 57–94% of N2O emissions occurred from transplanting to the first sidedressing
    over four seasons and were strongly related to the soil rewetting processes, it
    confirms that N2O emissions occurred intermittently. For N2O emission estimate,
    biases can occur if the intermittent emissions are not captured by low-frequency
    intermittent measurements. Therefore, increasing sampling frequency after irrigation
    and fertilization is very important to quantify N2O emissions from greenhouse
    vegetable cropping systems. On the other hand, when soil temperature is near or
    below 15 °C, sampling frequency could be reduced because no N2O emission peak
    occurred even after either fertilization or irrigation. N2O emission increases
    with soil temperature when soil moisture and soil nitrate content are relatively
    constant. It was reported that N2O production increased with soil temperature
    from 20 to 40 °C (Granli and Bockman, 1994). As shown in Fig. 2, N2O emissions
    followed the diurnal change of soil temperature with certain delay after irrigation
    and N sidedressing on 27 September 2004 and 8 May 2005. Similar results of diurnal
    pattern were reported in earlier studies with different gas measurement methods
    (Akiyama and Tsuruta, 2003, Hosono et al., 2006). During the later period of the
    Autumn season, soil temperatures drop to near or below 15 °C, which suppressed
    microbial nitrification and denitrification during this stage. As a result, N2O
    emission is reduced and depends less on fertilization or irrigation. After the
    first sidedressing during the Spring season, no increase of N2O emissions was
    observed for NN, MN and SN treatments with irrigation (Fig. 3), although the soil
    temperature was relatively high. It is noted in Fig. 1c that soil nitrate-N contents
    for NN, MN and SN treatments are low during this period, because of either crop
    uptake or leaching. This suggests that fertilization is the main controlling factor
    for N2O production during the later period of the Spring season. When the mineral
    N content of the soil is low, the availability of NH4+ and NO3− as a substrate
    of nitrification and denitrification reduced, temperature and irrigation cannot
    affect N2O production significantly. 57–94% of the cumulative N2O emissions observed
    in the period from transplanting to the first sidedressing is probably due to
    the frequent soil rewetting processes and change of soil WFPS (Zheng et al., 2000,
    Kusa et al., 2002, Priemé and Christensen, 2001, Sehy et al., 2003). For example,
    N and organic C can be released from manure or microbial biomass and root residue
    during the dry stage, then after the rewetting of dry soil, the availability of
    NH4+ and NO3− as a substrate for nitrification and denitrification may be increased,
    as well as microbial activity connected with nitrification and denitrification
    processes, thus enhanced N2O emissions occur (Agehara and Warncke, 2005, Pihlatie
    et al., 2004, Rudaz et al., 1999, Wu and Brookes, 2005). Moreover, aerobic or
    anaerobic conditions for N2O production via nitrification and denitrification
    may be improved by soil wetting (Fischer and Whalen, 2005, Ruser et al., 1998).
    The highest N2O emissions were observed at transplanting day, when the soil WFPS
    at 0.1 m abruptly increased from 38 to 55% before irrigation to values around
    100% after irrigation. A study in a rice-based agroecosystem showed intensive
    N2O emissions when the soil moisture was between 90% and 108% WFPS (Zheng et al.,
    2000). The supersaturated soil moisture results in less N2O emissions because
    either the higher soil moisture favors the reduction of N2O to N2, or the high
    WFPS inhibits the N2O exchange between soil and the atmosphere (Pathak et al.,
    2002). The influence of irrigation on N2O emissions decreased during the sidedressing
    period in the growing season, although WFPS was high at 60–115%. As shown in Fig.
    3, with a successive rewetting of the soil, no increase of N2O emissions was observed
    for NN, MN and SN treatments in later Autumn season. This is probably because
    low temperature and soil nitrate-N contents determine the variation pattern of
    N2O emissions. The current IPCC methodology for estimating direct N2O emissions
    from agricultural soils is to multiply the total N inputs (from synthetic fertilizer,
    manure, legumes, and crop residue) by an N2O emission factor. The N2O emission
    factor can be calculated as the difference between N2O fluxes from fertilized
    and unfertilized plots (background flux). In this study, the average annual N2O
    emission rate of CN treatment over 2004 and 2005 was 8.8 kg N2O-N ha−1 yr−1 (at
    an N application rate of 1470 kg N ha−1 yr−1) in the greenhouse systems. Higher
    results (12.0 kg N2O-N ha−1 yr−1 at N application rate of 1636 kg N ha−1) were
    reported in Jiangsu of southern China (Xiong et al., 2006). If taking emitted
    N2O-N as the fraction of applied manure and fertilizer N in each growing season,
    the N2O emission factor in this study ranged from 0.27 to 0.30%, bring in the
    lower portion of the IPCC range of 0.25–2.25% (IPCC, 1997). Assuming the data
    of 8.8 kg N2O-N ha−1 yr−1 to be representative for these greenhouse systems in
    Northern China with a total area of 4.8 × 105 ha (Li, 2005), the total N2O emissions
    from conventional management greenhouse may account for 4.2 × 106 kg N2O-N ha−1
    yr−1. If the site-specific N management is employed to these greenhouse systems,
    the total N2O emissions would be reduced by 1.6 × 106 kg N2O-N ha−1 yr−1. Annual
    background emission rate is 2.6 kg N ha−1 obtained from the NN treatment, which
    is 29.5% of the N2O emission rate from the CN treatment. It indicates that frequent
    soil rewetting processes accelerates not only fertilizer-induced N2O emissions,
    but also background emissions. The excessive organic manure and fertilizer N inputs
    over the past years increased residual N level in the soil, high soil 0–0.3 m
    nitrate-N for NN treatment from transplanting to the first sidedressing as shown
    in Fig. 1c is a proof of it. Moreover, high soil temperature improved N mineralization
    and nitrification, especially during summer fallow. In addition, N input from
    irrigation water which also provided about 200 kg N ha−1 yr−1 might also have
    contributed to the high soil nitrogen. As a consequence, to estimate annual background
    N2O emissions, it is necessary to consider emissions over the entire year, rather
    than only during the cropping period. 5. Conclusions In summary, high N2O emissions
    can be attributed to water surplus into soil by irrigation during the transplanting
    stage, which is a major characteristic of greenhouse soils in Northern China.
    N remnants in soil over years give high background N2O emissions. The fertilizer-induced
    N2O emissions account for 0.27–0.30% of the N application rate, which is less
    than the default IPCC value of 1.25%. Site-specific N treatment significantly
    reduced N fertilization rate without any impact on yields. In the long run, it
    may also reduce the N buildup in soils so to lower the background N2O emissions.
    In order to reduce N2O emissions from greenhouse cropping system, irrigation should
    also be optimized to tune the rewetting processes during the transplanting period.
    Our experimental site is a typical vegetable greenhouse in Northern China, therefore,
    the result of this two-year study can be used as a reference for estimating direct
    N2O emissions and improving agricultural practices in that region. Acknowledgements

    and content Under a Creative Commons license open access Highlights • We developed
    scenarios of agricultural intensification at farm scale. • We applied indicators
    to assess regional sustainability impacts of farm-level scenarios. • Scenario
    impacts showed regional variations depending on yield potentials and landscape
    features. • We discussed trade-offs of scenario impacts with policy stakeholders.
    • The method is exemplary for regional sustainability assessment of agricultural
    land use changes. Abstract Decisions for agricultural management are taken at
    farm scale. However, such decisions may well impact upon regional sustainability.
    Two of the likely agricultural management responses to future challenges are extended
    use of irrigation and increased production of energy crops. The drivers for these
    are high commodity prices and subsidy policies for renewable energy. However,
    the impacts of these responses upon regional sustainability are unknown. Thus,
    we conducted integrated impact assessments for agricultural intensification scenarios
    in the federal state of Brandenburg, Germany, for 2025. One Irrigation scenario
    and one Energy scenario were contrasted with the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario.
    We applied nine indicators to analyze the economic, social and environmental effects
    at the regional, in this case district scale, which is the smallest administrative
    unit in Brandenburg. Assessment results were discussed in a stakeholder workshop
    involving 16 experts from the state government. The simulated area shares of silage
    maize for fodder and energy were 29%, 37% and 49% for the BAU, Irrigation, and
    Energy scenarios, respectively. The Energy scenario increased bio-electricity
    production to 41% of the demand of Brandenburg, and it resulted in CO2 savings
    of up to 3.5 million tons. However, it resulted in loss of biodiversity, loss
    of landscape scenery, increased soil erosion risk, and increased area demand for
    water protection requirements. The Irrigation scenario led to yield increases
    of 7% (rapeseed), 18% (wheat, sugar beet), and 40% (maize) compared to the BAU
    scenario. It also reduced the year-to-year yield variability. Water demand for
    irrigation was found to be in conflict with other water uses for two of the 14
    districts. Spatial differentiation of scenario impacts showed that districts with
    medium to low yield potentials were more affected by negative impacts than districts
    with high yield potentials. In this first comprehensive sustainability impact
    assessment of agricultural intensification scenarios at regional level, we showed
    that a considerable potential for agricultural intensification exists. The intensification
    is accompanied by adverse environmental and socio-economic impacts. The novelty
    lies in the multiscale integration of comprehensive, agricultural management simulations
    with regional level impact assessment, which was achieved with the adequate use
    of indicators. It provided relevant evidence for policy decision making. Stakeholders
    appreciated the integrative approach of the assessment, which substantiated ongoing
    discussions among the government bodies. The assessment approach and the Brandenburg
    case study may stay exemplary for other regions in the world where similar economic
    and policy driving forces are likely to lead to agricultural intensification.

    1. Introduction Globally, agriculture is facing an increasing demand for food,
    bio-based energy and fiber products. Nonetheless, numerous studies predict that
    agricultural techniques will adapt to the increasing demand (Makowski et al.,
    2013). However, adaptation poses challenges for the integration of environmental
    and socio-cultural services into agricultural production. Farmers’ adaptation
    to the increasing demand may include changes in the choice of crops, crop rotations,
    utilization of crops, and intensification of production. Trends include technical
    solutions to remove yield limiting factors, such as water availability for crops,
    and increasing use of agricultural biomass as a source of renewable energy. The
    latter is often supported by government legislation. For example, in Germany,
    the introduction of the Renewable Energy Law EEG in 2000 resulted in threefold
    increase of the area of maize (Zea mays) and of rapeseed (Brassica napus) for
    bioenergy, reaching 17.5% of the German cropland area in 2012 (FNR, 2012a). Also,
    the use of irrigation to increase and stabilize crop yields is becoming more attractive,
    especially in areas with limited rainfall and with soils with limited water holding
    capacity. Additional reasons for these changes are related to an increasing water
    demand of new, more productive cultivars, and the prospect of more irregular precipitation
    patterns due to climatic change. For example, at the current market prices for
    agricultural goods, irrigation in the German federal state of Brandenburg is already
    on the verge of becoming economically viable (Münch et al., 2014). Also, a connection
    between the production of bioenergy and irrigation exists: as farmers become fuel
    suppliers for power plants, it becomes more important to achieve stable yields
    even in dry years. Agriculture is multifunctional. This means that in addition
    to (private) economic production, it contributes to public goods such as the character
    of rural landscapes and its ecosystem services (Wiggering et al., 2006, Van Zanten
    et al., 2013). A simple focus of agricultural management aimed solely at maximizing
    economic returns can lead to depletion of groundwater resources, erosion, loss
    of water quality, biodiversity loss and a reduction of socio-cultural services.
    Although these services become evident at landscape level, which has a spatial
    scale larger than a farm, it is the decision-making at farm level that affects
    these services. Sustainable development therefore requires consideration of the
    balance between the economic production functions of agriculture and environmental
    and social services. Policies are implemented to incentivize farmers to respect
    this balance by remunerating for the provision of public goods. It is important,
    when making policy decisions that support sustainable development, to acknowledge
    present and future development trends and their potential economic, social and
    ecological impacts. Here, we use ex-ante impact assessment (Helming et al., 2011).
    This integrates state-of-the-art knowledge from various disciplines in order to
    highlight those risks and opportunities which are inherent in expected trends.
    We use scenarios of agricultural management to draft different development options.
    These scenarios provide the opportunity to explore possible future developments
    through a comparative analysis of alternative driving forces and trends. In spanning
    a range of options they help to explore rather than predict possible developments
    (Milestad et al., 2014). We use impact indicators to assess economic, social and
    environmental effects of the agricultural management scenarios. The objectives
    of the study described in this paper were as follows: (i) to develop an indicator
    based impact assessment method that combines expertise on agricultural management,
    landscape, hydrology, soil erosion, biodiversity, stakeholder interaction, sustainability
    to create and analyze agricultural intensification scenarios and (ii) to conduct
    an integrated ex-ante assessment of regional sustainability impacts induced by
    farm level scenarios of bioenergy production and crop irrigation. Results had
    to assist policy stakeholders in identifying sustainability issues that require
    policy steering. The scenarios were designed to integrate currently trending assumptions
    of driving forces and describe their effects on crop choice and crop management
    at the farm level. Decisions at the farm level were translated into crop distribution
    patterns at the hectare scale for analysis of scenario impacts. Results were aggregated
    to the district (NUTS3) scale to derive policy relevance of the assessment. Also,
    this aggregation allowed the representation of the landscape level of scenario
    impacts. Scenarios were developed for the year 2025: a time frame that is sufficiently
    long to allow for major changes in agricultural management, while still being
    short enough to allow for realistic predictions of climate effects and yield trends.
    We chose the state of Brandenburg, Germany, as a case study area because several
    characteristics may make this area an example for the application of integrated
    assessments of agricultural development scenarios: large, specialized farms; low
    soil fertility; high technological level; yield limitations by water; subsidies
    for agricultural energy production. We anticipate that the trend of increased
    use of cropland for the production of renewable energy will continue and that
    irrigation will become more important in the future to increase and stabilize
    yields. The extent and speed of these changes in agricultural management are largely
    unknown, as are the sustainability implications of these changes. A few studies
    have dealt with specific aspects of bioenergy production in Germany (e.g., Dressler
    et al., 2012, Hennig and Gawor, 2012) and with specific agricultural adaptation
    scenarios at field sites (Nendel et al., 2014). However, to our knowledge, no
    integrated impact assessment studies exist that analyze the effects of agricultural
    intensification on environmental, social and economic indicators at regional level.
    Such a case study will help to generate spatially explicit systems knowledge of
    human–environment interactions in land change processes (Magliocca et al., 2014).
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Case study Brandenburg Brandenburg is the fifth
    largest German state, and it has a land surface area of 29,640 km2, of which 45%
    is agricultural land, most of which (75%) is arable land. Brandenburg surrounds
    the German capital Berlin and comprises 14 districts. The state’s mineral soils
    are developed on glaciofluvial, periglacial and glacial deposits, aeolian deposits
    and river sand. Almost two-thirds of the state’s territory, mainly with sandy
    and sandy loamy soil, has a water holding capacity lower than 140 mm (Table 1).

    Source: Schindler et al. (2004). Agricultural practice is dominated by large farm
    enterprises with an average size of 238 ha, which is four times the German average.
    Mechanization is high, and the labor force is only 1.7 persons per 100 ha on average.
    Large-scale operations, hired labor and a high mechanization rate result in highly
    competitive farm enterprises that are oriented towards profit maximization. A
    study on the regional impacts for Brandenburg of changes to the European Common
    Agricultural Policy (CAP) indicated that the dependency of farm enterprises on
    world market prices is high compared to the European average (Sieber et al., 2013).
    The average rainfall in Brandenburg is 554 mm year−1 (1981–2010), which is low
    compared to the German average of 800 mm year−1 (German Weather Service, 2013).
    This limits the yield for rain-fed agriculture. Irrigation is currently used on
    only 2% of the cropland area (Statistical Office Brandenburg, 2012). Due to increasing
    world market prices for agricultural commodities and concerns about increasing
    water stress related to climate change, we expect that irrigation will become
    more important in the near future. However, there are concerns over dwindling
    groundwater resources related to this development. We analyzed the scenario effects
    for the 14 districts of Brandenburg. Table 2 lists the names, cropland areas and
    name codes of districts. Table 2. Districts of Brandenburg and their cropland

    framework We adapted and simplified the DPSIR framework of the European Environment
    Agency (Gabrielsen and Bosch, 2003) to structure the ex-ante impact assessment
    of agricultural intensification scenarios. Three steps were involved (Fig. 1):
    Step 1 was the scenario definition, including the driver-pressure part of DPSIR.
    The driving forces in German agriculture were characterized as Drivers. Pressures
    represented the changes of agricultural management, in this case an increased
    area of silage maize to be used in biogas power plants and an increased area of
    irrigated cropland. Step 2 comprised the analysis of the scenario effects on several
    economic, social and ecological states through the use of indicators. Step 3 involved
    presenting the assessment results to members of the federal state ministries and
    local administration. This was done to inform policy decision-making and to evaluate
    the relevance of anticipated changes with regards to impacts on achieving policy
    strategies. The responsepart of DPSIR was not covered by the analysis. Download

    The analytical framework of the study, comprising three steps: (1) scenario definition
    by translating external driving forces into decisions of agricultural management;
    (2) analysis of the effects of the scenario on economic, social and environmental
    indicators at the district scale; (3) communication of assessment results to decision-makers.
    Sources of uncertainties of such an assessment approach are found in the applied
    models (structural uncertainty, parameter uncertainty), in the data used to drive
    the models and in the basic assumptions under which the models are used. In our
    case, we did not attempt to quantify the uncertainty that came with the models
    or data as this is subject to investigation in the model developer community (Asseng
    et al., 2013). The use of scenarios (Step 1), however, reduces the certainty requirement
    for model results, since scenarios are usually compared against each other and
    not evaluated in absolute terms. The scenario building process involves assuming
    conditions that are uncertain per se and this uncertainty can hardly be quantified.
    However, in the process of result communication (Step 3) uncertainty information
    plays a major role and in our case, spatial variability of model results was used
    to increase the addressees’ awareness of the uncertainty of projections and the
    likelihood of scenarios becoming true. 2.3. Scenarios Scenarios of future cropping
    practices were chosen based on their relevance to agricultural land use and sustainable
    development. They were based on the driving forces: high world market prices for
    agricultural goods, climate change projections, and state legislation to promote
    energy production from agricultural sources. Three scenarios were constructed
    (Table 3): a Business As Usual (BAU) scenario extrapolating current trends into
    the year 2025, an Energy scenario in which government subsidies for biogas production
    lead to further increase in the cultivation area of silage maize, and an Irrigation
    scenario in which all areas of silage maize, winter rapeseed, winter wheat and
    sugar beet were irrigated. In all scenarios, we assumed that silage maize for
    energy purposes was only used in biogas power plants. This is the typical energetic
    use of silage maize in Germany. The scenarios were chosen to continue current
    trends (irrigation, subsidies for 1st generation biofuel) and address agricultural
    production decisions. The first is because the current policy frame is likely
    to further support the trend. It also serves as role model for other countries
    in search for adaption measures to energy scarcities. The second is because our
    intention was to assess spatially explicit sustainability impacts of agricultural
    land use changes. Changes happening further down in the value chain such as the
    use of residues for bioenergy production (2nd generation biofuel) was not the
    focus of the study. Table 3. Parameters describing the three agricultural scenarios:
    BAU, Energy, and Irrigation for 2025. The scenarios include assumptions about
    changes in prices, yields and agricultural management constraints related to animal
    husbandry, technology, and crop rotations. Parameters Scenarios 2025 Empty Cell

    incrop rotations 50% of winter rapeseed uses winter barley as the previous crop;
    sugar beet area constant due to existing contracts 2.3.1. Translation of scenario
    assumptions (Drivers) into crop shares and crop distributions (Pressures) To translate
    scenario assumptions into agricultural management and cropping decisions, we used
    a simplified linear programming optimization model for “region farms” that consists
    of all farm resources of one district, taking into account established farm structures,
    site characteristics, markets and agricultural policy. We assumed that farmers
    make their cropping choices mainly by optimizing net farm income. This is an assumption
    that reflects long term developments and that is relevant particularly in Brandenburg
    since its exceptionally large agricultural enterprises with hired labor enforce
    economic decision making. Economic professionality of the enterprises can also
    be seen in the fact that, according to the agricultural census 2010, 46% of farm
    managers hold a university degree (Federal Statistical Office Germany, 2011).
    The approach used existing crop production data for each of five soil categories
    representing different levels of soil fertility (LELF, 2010), and it incorporated
    additional expert assessments of inputs and outputs for important cropping practices,
    including irrigation, yield development as influenced by genetic progress, climate
    change and management improvements. Crops were compared for their net margin based
    on default machinery cost figures (KTBL, 2012). The linear programming farm model
    was constructed for each district. Assumptions and constraints were (i) constant
    livestock fodder requirements, (ii) complete use of manure in the cropping systems,
    (iii) constant level of contract-based cropping systems, and (iv) adherence to
    crop rotation restrictions. On this basis, the model maximized the total net margin
    of the district by allocating part of the area of each soil category to the best-performing
    cropping practices, taking the restrictions into account. The result was a specific
    distribution of crops for each district and for each of the five soil categories.
    For the assessment of six of the impact indicators (see Table 4), it was necessary
    to disaggregate the simulated crop distribution from the district scale to the
    hectare scale. This was done by using a Monte Carlo approach to distribute crops
    on a high-resolution soil suitability map, taking into account the total area
    share of each crop as derived from the linear programming described above (Wenkel
    et al., 2013). The approach implements the idea to distribute a list of crops
    and its proportions of the agricultural area according to the suitability of the
    soil at a certain location for each crop. The result was a soil suitability-based
    probability map of crop distributions at a 1 ha scale for the area of Brandenburg.

    were chosen, representing two economic, one social and six environmental themes

    effects For the analysis of scenario effects, we focused on issues that were considered
    sensitive to agricultural management and relevant to policies in the state of
    Brandenburg. This means that indicators had to be chosen that indicate at landscape
    level the impact of field scale agricultural management. Additionally, a balance
    between economic, social, and environmental dimensions was sought. One indicator
    was selected for each impact issue based on scientific credibility, sensitivity
    to agricultural scenario changes, applicability to regional conditions, and determinability.
    An overview of the chosen indicators is given in Table 4. Calculation methods
    for each indicator are briefly described below. The final results for all indicators
    were aggregated at the district level. 2.4.1. Indicator 1: crop yields Crop yields
    were calculated by using the statistical hybrid model YIELDSTAT (YIELD estimation
    based on Statistics, Mirschel et al., 2014) and a model for the spatial distribution
    of crops in a region. Both models were controlled via the Spatial Analysis and
    Modeling Tool SAMT (Spatial Analysis and Modeling Tool, Wieland et al., 2006).
    Spatial crop distribution on a hectare scale was calculated by using statistical
    information about crop production at the state level, by performing calculations
    of crop-specific economic benefit, by developing a soil-based suitability map
    for crop growth and by using a set of algorithms that combines optimization routines
    and stochastic (Monte Carlo) elements. The scenario simulations were run under
    the following assumptions: no change in crop and soil management (conventional
    farming, soil tillage using a plough). Future climate was provided from the STAR2
    climate data set for Brandenburg (2K scenario). Annual results were calculated
    for the time period 2020–2030 and averaged. 2.4.2. Indicator 2: irrigation water
    demand Water is the most limiting factor for agricultural yields in Brandenburg.
    For this reason, irrigation is essential to stabilize and increase yields. Irrigation
    water demand (IWD) was calculated by using the model ZUWABE (Zusatzwasserbedarf
    (irrigation water demand), Mirschel et al., 2012), which is implemented in SAMT
    (Wieland et al., 2006). Soil types were grouped into four categories of different
    water storage capacities. Crop-specific irrigation water benchmarks for the soil
    categories were calculated by considering crop-specific irrigation periods, climatic
    water balance within the irrigation period, soil water storage capacity, soil
    water content at the start of the irrigation period, and rooting depth. Calculations
    considered the anticipated climatic water balance for the period 2020–2030 and
    a predicted decrease in crop transpiration caused by rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
    Input data were the medium scale agricultural site mapping for arable land (Schmidt
    and Diemann, 1991), simulated crop distributions at the hectare scale and the
    STAR2 future climate data for Brandenburg (2K scenario). The dynamic agro-ecosystem
    simulation model MONICA (model for nitrogen and carbon dynamics in agro-ecosystems,
    Nendel et al., 2011) was used to back up the simulations of the model YIELDSTAT
    and ZUWABE. MONICA has been tested against crop and soil monitoring data from
    Brandenburg. As a process-based model, it may be more sensitive to environmental
    changes than YIELDSTAT and ZUWABE. However, in a spatial application, statistical
    model approaches prove more robust against outliers. Therefore, MONICA results
    were used in an iterative process to compare and assure the results of the other
    two models. 2.4.3. Indicator 3: water constraints for irrigation The water constraints
    for irrigation constitute spatially differentiated indicators for detecting those
    parts of the state where groundwater-borne irrigation could pose problems for
    other water users, including groundwater-dependent ecosystems (peatland). A critical
    water balance was considered in this study when IWD was above 25% of the supplied
    groundwater recharge. Water balance was calculated as the spatially differentiated
    long-term mean annual groundwater recharge over the period 1976–2005 (100%) minus
    IWD (see above). Calculations were performed at the spatial level of polygons
    of hydrogeological units based on classified properties of the upper groundwater-bearing
    layer (Merz et al., 2009). Polygon results were resampled and aggregated at the
    district level. Relative water demand was clustered into three categories: IWD
    < 16% ground water recharge (low), 16% ≤ IWD ≤ 25% ground water recharge (medium),
    and IWD > 25% groundwater recharge (high). 2.4.4. Indicator 4: share of electricity
    demand covered by the production of biogas The production of biogas in Germany
    serves the purpose of increasing the share of renewable resources used in the
    production of electricity. The share of electricity demand covered was calculated
    by dividing the net electricity produced by the electricity demand projected for
    the state of Brandenburg in 2025. The electricity produced was based on silage
    maize yields for energy generation. These were multiplied by typical values for
    the amount of methane produced per ton of silage maize and by the average conversion
    efficiency of biogas plants (FNR, 2012b). Net production of electricity was calculated
    by subtracting an average value of 7.9% of electricity demand for the biogas plant
    operations (FNR, 2010). Electricity demand for the year 2025 was based on the
    targets of the energy policy of the federal state of Brandenburg, which aim for
    a reduction of 10% between 2007 and 2030. 2.4.5. Indicator 5: the scenic value
    of landscape The scenic value of landscape is an important factor for the quality
    of life in rural areas. It determines, in part, the recreational value of agricultural
    landscapes. In this study, scenario impacts on landscape scenery were determined
    by applying the principle of Ecological Risk Analysis as established in the German
    Environmental Impact Assessment. This analysis makes it possible to compare landscapes
    capacities under different human land use scenarios. Changes in landscape scenery
    caused by scenario differences were determined by identifying sensitive areas
    and demand areas. Sensitive areas have high landscape values; demand areas are
    designated for recreational or touristic purposes. Disposition was determined
    as the share of sensitive and demand cropland areas divided by the total cropland
    area in a district. The effect of scenarios upon the scenic value of landscape
    was estimated in a three-step approach. First, the aesthetic impressions of crops
    were determined by using eight criteria: colors, light and shadow, exposure; odor;
    body and structure, border situations; dynamics; and orientation. Second, the
    effects of the relative area shares of crops were assessed at a three-stage ordinal
    scale using these criteria. As a result, the ratio of grain and rapeseed areas
    to maize areas (GRM) proved to be a critical indicator integrating step one and
    two. Third, the disposition value was divided by the GRM to form an impact indicator
    representing ecological risk. 2.4.6. Indicator 6: greenhouse gas savings Germany
    intends to substitute fossil fuels and reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by
    increasing the production of electricity from renewable sources. Greenhouse gas
    savings through the substitution of fossil fuels by biogas were calculated based
    on the yields of silage maize for energy generation. We assumed that all biogas
    plants are heat and power plants. The coefficients for methane generation per
    ton of biomass, the efficiency of conversion and the electricity demand for biogas
    plant operations were based on typical values (FNR, 2010, FNR, 2012b). Greenhouse
    gas savings per kWh produced were calculated under the assumption that only fossil
    fuels would be substituted. 2.4.7. Indicator 7: biodiversity The biodiversity
    strategy of Germany (National Strategy on Biological Diversity, 2007) uses bird
    species as core indicators of the biodiversity of agricultural landscapes. We
    used the same indicators to analyze the potential conflicts between scenarios
    and biodiversity strategies. The indicator aggregates the population trends of
    ten arable bird species, of which we considered seven that either (i) breed on
    arable land: Skylark (Alauda arvensis), Corn bunting (Miliaria calandra), Lapwing
    (Vanellus vanellus) and Winchat (Saxicola rubetra), or (ii) feed regularly on
    arable land: red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), Yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella)
    and Woodlark (Lullula arborea). We applied a habitat suitability model (Brandt
    and Glemnitz, 2013), which calculates the ‘intrinsic habitat value’ according
    to Anderson and Fergusson (2006) over the growing season based on the following
    data: vegetation structure of the crop species (vegetation height and density;
    real field data), habitat demands of the bird species, agricultural management
    (sequences of agricultural activities = disturbances). 2.4.8. Indicator 8: erosion
    risk Some crops (e.g., maize, rapeseed) are more vulnerable to soil erosion by
    water than others (e.g., cereals), which is why the crop distribution within the
    scenarios may affect soil erosion risk. Erosion risk was calculated by using a
    German adaptation of the universal soil loss equation model (USLE – Wischmeier
    and Smith, 1978). Whilst it should not be used for precise estimates of soil loss,
    it is suitable for appraising erosion trends resulting from changes in agricultural
    management (Deumlich et al., 2005). The equation comprises six factors: rainfall
    and runoff (R-factor), soil erodibility (K-factor), slope length (L-factor), slope
    steepness (S-factor), cover and management (C-factor), and support practice (P-factor).
    Potential long-term average soil loss is calculated as the product of the individual
    factors. In this study, the scenarios affect only the C-factor because every combination
    of crop and management is associated with a specific C-factor. The results were
    calculated on the scale of field blocks1 (as of May 2011) and aggregated at the
    NUTS3 level. 2.4.9. Indicator 9: area demand for water quality protection An increase
    in maize cultivation area may enhance nutrient transport into nearby water bodies.
    Maize fields are considered to be hot spots of surface and groundwater pollution
    because of the large distance between plant rows and because maize is a preferred
    crop for manure application from livestock or biogas plants (Jaafar and Walling,
    2010). An “end-of-pipe” method was applied to assess the water quality impairment
    of the scenarios, using area demand for water protection as an indicator. We calculated
    the area demand for riparian buffer zones against soluble and solid matter entries
    into the water bodies. Buffer zones of 20 m between maize fields and running waters
    of 1st and 2nd order (according to the German Water Law) and around standing waters
    are most effective with respect to both retention of solid matter transported
    by surface runoff and retention/transformation of dissolved substances transported
    by groundwater runoff (DWA, 2012). Area demand was calculated by overlaying maps
    of field blocks and crop distribution for the scenarios and by considering the
    distribution of running waters of 1st and 2nd order in the state of Brandenburg.
    Existing riparian buffer zones were not considered. 2.5. Involvement of stakeholders
    Stakeholders from local government were engaged in the scenario study to (i) discuss
    scenario results with regards to their relevance, opportunities and threats, (ii)
    provide feedback on the scenario features, (iii) contribute to the identification
    of research needs, and (iv) identify future cooperation interests. Stakeholder
    engagement in research on regional land use can vary considerably from information
    sharing to interactive participation and joint decision-making (Knierim et al.,
    2010). In our case, the level of consultation was essential, which means that
    stakeholders had to be appropriately informed about and invited to discuss the
    results of the impact assessment study (Pretty, 1995). The selection of the stakeholders
    was guided by the aim to broadly represent public decision-makers, both from the
    investigated impact areas, and from organization generally involved in sustainable
    development. Among the 16 stakeholders participating in the workshop, there were
    6 experts from the Ministry for Environment representing the divisions of water
    management, biodiversity and soil conservation, one experts from the Ministry
    of Agriculture and one from the Ministry of Economy. Four experts represented
    the two state agencies for environment and for agriculture. Four stakeholders
    represented non-government institutions, namely the farmers’ association, the
    Brandenburg Sustainability Council, and a private, economic networking agency.
    In preparation for the stakeholder workshop, efforts were made to reduce the scenario
    results to seven key statements. A workshop of 2.5 h duration was designed, which
    included expert inputs, facilitated discussions and opinion polls. An interactive
    voting tool was used to determine how stakeholders perceived the degree of novelty
    and relevance of the results. After the meeting, minutes were disseminated. To
    facilitate uptake of the results, the findings of the study were compiled into
    a brochure for decision-makers (Gutzler and Helming, 2013). 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Scenario estimations of area shares of most important crops in 2025 The land
    use distributions for different scenarios are shown in Fig. 2. For the BAU scenario,
    silage maize for energy and fodder had the highest area share (29%), followed
    by rye (21%), wheat (13%) rapeseed (16%) and barley (8%). The Irrigation and Energy
    scenarios resulted in 6% and 20% increases of the maize cultivation area, respectively,
    compared to the BAU scenario. In both cases, the increase in maize area was a
    result of the increased profitability of this crop due to increased yield and
    yield stability in the Irrigation scenario, and due to the financial subsidies
    for the production of renewable energy assumed in the Energy scenario. The increase
    in the area share of maize was accompanied by reductions in all other crops, particularly
    rye and rapeseed. Rye is the least economically feasible crop, and rapeseed turned
    out not to be economically competitive in the Energy scenario. The share of barley
    was small in all three scenarios, and it was mainly cultivated for crop rotation
    purposes. Sugar beet was below 1% area share in all scenarios. The results imply
    a drastic increase in the maize share for both intensification scenarios compared
    to the BAU scenarios. However, even the maximum of 49% maize in the Energy scenario
    remained below the EU-CAP greening threshold of a maximum 70% share for one crop.
    This is due to the scenario settings, in which crop rotations (according to phytosanitary
    requirements and preceding crop effects) were a constraint for management decisions.

    Fig. 2. Simulated area shares of main crops for the three scenarios for 2025 in
    Brandenburg. The main scenario differences occur in the case of silage maize for
    energy. Increased maize share resulted in reduced shares of rye, rapeseed and
    barley. 3.2. Scenario effects at the district level for Brandenburg in 2025 3.2.1.
    Crop yields Within the period 2020–2030, simulated crop yields fluctuated due
    to year-to-year weather variation. In the BAU scenario, the standard deviation
    ranged from 10 to 15% for spring crops (silage maize, sugar beet) and from 5 to
    10% for winter crops. Simulated crop yields for the three scenarios and for the
    14 districts are presented in Table 5. The results of the Irrigation scenario
    showed that irrigation was able to support significantly higher yields, to increase
    yield stability, and to reduce cropping risk. The yield increases were highest
    for silage maize (34–48%) and lowest for winter rapeseed (3–9%). For winter wheat
    and sugar beet, simulations resulted in yield increases of 16% and 23%, respectively.
    Because of the increased yields and improved yield stability, irrigation could
    be an effective measure to adapt to climate change. This is because climate change
    impacts in this study area are predicted to shift rainfall from summer to winter
    periods thereby aggravating water stress during the vegetation period, and to
    increase the rainfall variability between years, which in turn increases yield
    variability. In addition, irrigation is important for farms growing silage maize
    for biogas production, because they have to comply with long-term contracts for
    annual biomass delivery. Table 5. Calculated average crop yields 2020–2030 for
    silage maize, sugar beet, winter rapeseed, winter rye and winter wheat in the
    three scenarios (BAU: Business As Usual; I: Irrigation; E: Energy) for the districts
    of Brandenburg. Compared to the BAU scenario, the irrigation scenario resulted
    in yield increases of 3–9% for rapeseed and 34–48% for silage maize in the 14
    districts. No significant crop yield differences were simulated for the BAU scenario
    or the energy scenario. Empty Cell Silage maize Sugar beet Winter rapeseed Winter

    yield was detected between the BAU and Energy scenarios. The crop yield of silage
    maize was reduced by 0.75 t ha−1 on average in the Energy scenario compared to
    the BAU scenario. This may be because the larger cultivation area for maize in
    the Energy scenario also includes sites of lower productivity. Patterns of simulated
    yield levels across the 14 districts of Brandenburg showed little variation between
    the scenarios. The highest simulated average crop yields were in the districts
    PR, UM, MOL, and EE. With the highest share of arable land, PR, UM and MOL are
    also the districts with the highest agricultural production (Table 2). In contrast,
    PM, LDS and LOS had the lowest average crop yields. Modeling results revealed
    that considerable yield effects can be expected with the introduction of crop
    irrigation. 3.2.2. Irrigation water demand (IWD) The IWD calculations showed that,
    to achieve an unconstrained biomass and yield accumulation, the spring crops (maize,
    sugar beet) need much more irrigation water than the winter crops (wheat, rapeseed)
    (Table 6). The reason is that the time period for irrigation stretches from early
    June until the first decade of September for silage maize and from early July
    until the second decade of September for sugar beet, whereas for winter wheat
    it stretches only from early May until the end of June and for rapeseed it stretches
    from the second decade of April to the second decade of May. The between-district
    variation in IWD was related to the precipitation pattern within Brandenburg and
    to the soil quality-related yield potential. For spring crops, EE had the lowest
    IWD and the lowest crop yield increase, whereas OPR (silage maize) and MOL (sugar
    beet) had the highest IWD and crop yield increase. For winter crops, IWD and crop
    yield increase were highest in LDS and lowest in BAR (winter wheat) and UM (winter
    rapeseed). In any case, crop yield increases caused by irrigation were positively
    correlated with IWD. Table 6. Irrigation scenario for 2025: calculated irrigation
    water demands (IWD) and respective crop yield increases for the 14 districts of
    Brandenburg. Spring crops need more irrigation water than winter crops. Variations

    for irrigation In Brandenburg, a total of 3350 million m3 of groundwater is recharged
    per year, taken as an average of the years 1976–2005 (MUGV, 2009). The IWD in
    the Irrigation scenario amounted to 667 million m3 per year, which was 20% of
    the annual groundwater recharge. Only in the two districts UM and MOL did the
    IWD amount to more than 25% of the annual groundwater recharge. In those districts,
    IWD was particularly high for sugar beet and maize. In seven other districts,
    IWD was between 16% and 25% of the groundwater recharge (Fig. 3). Download : Download
    high-res image (482KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Water constraints
    for irrigation expressed as irrigation water demand (IWD) of the Irrigation scenario
    relative to groundwater recharge. An IWD of more than 25% of annual groundwater
    recharge was found to be critical with regard to competent water uses. This threshold
    was estimated to be reached only in two of the 14 districts in Brandenburg. Although
    Brandenburg has a low annual rainfall compared to other German states, we found
    that there is sufficient groundwater recharge in most districts to provide a basis
    for crop irrigation. This was in contrast to the position taken by the federal
    state office for environmental protection in Brandenburg (see stakeholder workshop)
    that might be biased by frequent dry spells and the decline in groundwater and
    lake levels observed between the 1980s and approximately 2007. Water availability
    was defined and calculated here under the worst-case assumption of no return flow
    from irrigation into groundwater, meaning that all of the water pumped up would
    transpire or evaporate. Two factors were spatially differentiating water availability:
    (1) the share of arable land to be irrigated in a region, (2) the local groundwater
    conditions, which may account for an occasional small-scale supply shortfall.
    Provided that the local conditions are thoroughly taken into consideration, the
    results may encourage farmers to expand irrigated crop production in Brandenburg.
    However, local and area-specific problems are possible if todays irrigated area
    is increased. For example, groundwater-dependent ecosystems may locally compete
    with field irrigation for water use. For the following indicators, the estimated
    scenario effects are presented at the district level in Fig. 4. To allow comparisons
    of the scenario effects of various indicators and to allow differentiation between
    the districts of Brandenburg, all indicator values were normalized. This was achieved
    by expressing all indicator values as values relative to the mean and standard
    deviation of the respective values of the BAU scenario. The results were then
    grouped into 5 classes of deviation from the mean BAU value (Fig. 4). Download

    of three agricultural intensification scenarios: Business As Usual, Irrigation
    and Energy for 2025 at the district level in Brandenburg. Normalized values relative
    to the mean and standard deviation of the BAU scenario are displayed. 3.2.4. Share
    of electricity demand covered by the production of biogas The share of net electricity
    demand of Brandenburg that can be covered by the production of biogas was estimated
    to rise from 21% in the BAU scenario to 34% in the Irrigation scenario and 46%
    in the Energy scenario. This would require between 19% (BAU) and 39% (Energy scenario)
    of the total cropland to be used exclusively for the production of energy. These
    sites would no longer be available for food, feed or fiber production. However,
    this value is a rather optimistic estimate, because the net electricity demand
    does not account for energy losses in the distribution grid. Furthermore, the
    assumed demand in 2025 is based on political targets that include a 10% reduction
    in electricity consumption. Even in Brandenburg, where population density is low
    and cropland accounts for a large share of demand, 48% of the total cropland must
    be cultivated with maize to cover the projected electricity demand and still produce
    the required amount of animal fodder. 3.2.5. Scenic value of landscape Assessment
    of the aesthetic value of different crop types showed that grain and rapeseed
    were perceived as beautiful, whereas the perception of maize was ambivalent, and
    sugar beet was considered a less attractive crop. Regarding the relative crop
    shares, the visual perception of the BAU scenario was best, followed by the Irrigation
    scenario and the Energy scenario. This was true for the federal state Brandenburg
    as a whole as well as for the individual districts (Fig. 4). The Irrigation scenario
    was particularly disadvantageous with respect to landscape scenery in the districts
    HVL and PM. In the Energy scenario, the landscape scenery of an additional five
    districts was negatively affected. Together, these districts represented 50% of
    all districts with negative scenery effects. However, except for UM, these districts
    were not those that experienced yield increases and high irrigation water demand.
    Obviously, sensitivity to landscape scenery deterioration was not necessarily
    associated with areas of high potential for yield increase. 3.2.6. Greenhouse
    gas savings The results showed that the production of biogas can save between
    8.1 t (Energy scenario) and 9.5 t (Irrigation scenario) of CO2 equivalents per
    hectare of silage maize production. Higher yields led to higher greenhouse gas
    savings. We calculated total savings of 1.2 million tons (Irrigation scenario)
    and 1.7 million tons (Energy scenario) of CO2 equivalents compared to the BAU
    scenario. This would constitute a saving of between 4.4% and 6.2% relative to
    the total emissions of Brandenburg in 2011. Using a high amount of silage maize
    in biogas plants to produce heat and energy could contribute to lowering the greenhouse
    gas emissions. However, the results must be considered as upper limits of achievable
    savings because a number of factors were not included in the calculations. The
    method used relied on official figures published by the German Ministry for the
    Environment. Those figures were based on the assumption that energy produced from
    renewable sources will replace only fossil fuels and not other renewable energy
    sources. Furthermore, a high percentage of cropland used for bio-energy may increase
    the import of agricultural goods from other countries. Such effects were not considered
    in the calculations. For the Irrigation scenario, we did not include any emissions
    caused by the irrigation machinery, which would further increase the total emissions
    in that scenario. 3.2.7. Biodiversity All three land use scenarios were in conflict
    with the National Biodiversity Strategy for Germany, which seeks to halt and reverse
    the decline in bird populations. The habitat suitability index did not differ
    for the Irrigation and Energy scenarios, but it was better for the BAU scenario
    (Fig. 4). The simulated changes varied between bird species and between districts.
    Only one of the four indicator species nesting on arable land, the Lapwing (V.
    vanellus), benefited from the land use changes, whereas the Whinchat (Saxiola
    rubreta) was hardly affected. For the Skylark (A. arvensis) and the Corn bunting
    (M. calandra), however, the reduction of suitable crops for breeding was dramatic.
    The increase of maize cultivation (Energy scenario) decreased the available habitat
    area by 28.2% (Corn bunting) and 21.3% (Skylark). The variation between districts
    was the result of regionally varying land use change, which was a function of
    soil quality. The greatest decrease in the habitat suitability index was found
    in districts with medium to low yield potential, and the effects in the most productive
    arable regions were smaller. Comparing the scenario effects with the yield potential
    of the districts, we found that negative effects increased with decreasing yield
    potential, from −7.3% (breeding index change between BAU and Energy scenario)
    in the districts with highest yields up to −46.1% in districts with medium yields.
    However, for the districts with the lowest yield potential, the trend was reversed
    because there were only minor changes in the cropping patterns. Agricultural intensification
    is widely accepted as being a cause of bird population declines on farmland during
    the last three decades. As part of a European bird monitoring project, Guerrero
    et al. (2012) found that landscape factors (e.g., biotope inventory) accounted
    for most of the variation in ground-nesting farmland bird individual and breeding
    pair densities between the regions, and crop field factors (crops and their management)
    were found to be more important for explaining the persistence of the populations.
    The present approach is one of the first to integrate the habitat requirements
    of indicator species, regional land use structure and land management into an
    ex-ante analysis. Some of our findings were counterintuitive: the decline in habitat
    suitability was highest in the areas with medium fertility. This was due to the
    availability of fewer cropping options in these areas, which led to a decrease
    in crop species. 3.2.8. Erosion risk Rainfall erosivity in Brandenburg is low
    compared to other European regions. However, a few heavy rainstorms produce considerable
    erosion at times of insufficient soil cover or in sites with heterogeneous relief.
    Typically, erosion is a problem in fields with steep and/or converging slopes.
    An increase in the area of maize cultivation or an increase in the share of maize
    in crop rotations increases the risk of erosion because of the late protection
    of the soil surface with plant cover and because of the linear structure and high
    distance of the maize rows. Soil erosion already exists in the BAU scenario. Any
    further increase in soil erosion exacerbated the situation of affected areas and
    neighboring areas. For the Irrigation and Energy scenarios, the largest increase
    in erosion risk affects the district UM, which was also identified as the most
    vulnerable in the BAU scenario (Fig. 4). However, individual fields can also bear
    particularly high erosion risk in other districts. The higher share of maize cultivation
    in the Irrigation and Energy scenarios had negative effects on soil erosion. An
    additional effect of irrigation on soil erosion was not considered in the calculations,
    but such an effect may occur in cases of high irrigation on slope sites. A reduction
    of erosion risk requires management decisions in accordance with the site-specific
    conditions and with particular attention to soil protection. Even conservation
    tillage cannot prevent soil loss in areas with high erosion risk (high slope steepness
    and horizontal curvature) if crops such as maize are cultivated. 3.2.9. Area demand
    for water quality protection The total riparian length of the running waters of
    the state of Brandenburg is approximately 38,000 km, of which approximately 80%
    is accounted for by artificial collector ditches in ameliorated lowland areas
    such as fen peatland. Under the scenario assumptions, the length of the required
    riparian zones increases from 3743 km (BAU) to 6332 km (Energy scenario). This
    equates to 10–16% of all water ways. At a buffer zone width of 20 m, this corresponds
    to 0.5–0.8% of the total arable land area in Brandenburg, or 1.9% of the arable
    land under maize cultivation in that zone. The areas to be designated for water
    protection differed between districts in accordance with the density of their
    water body networks and the simulated acreages of arable land for maize cultivation.
    The districts EE, MOL and PR were affected most because the scenarios placed the
    highest portion of maize-cultivated area in those districts (1.85%, 3.16% and
    1.90%, respectively). However, the density of running waters in these districts
    is rather low: 0.89 km km−2 in MOL, 1.63 km km−2 in EE, and 1.47 km km−2 in PR.
    Usually, the allocation of riparian buffer zones for water protection is not appreciated
    by land owners because of economic losses and changes in property rights. However,
    when the area of maize cultivation is extended for energy production, the costs
    for water management will be increased anyway to implement the binding targets
    of EU Water Framework Directive. Our scenario calculations show that, for the
    state of Brandenburg, which is one of the German states with the low density of
    water bodies (outside of its river lowlands), the required protection area is
    less than 2% of the simulated maize area. 3.2.10. District level distributions
    When the 14 districts of Brandenburg were compared across the three scenarios,
    an interesting pattern was found. Four districts, EE, MOL, PR, and UM, showed
    the highest yield potential for all three scenarios. Of those districts, MOL and
    UM had the highest water demand for irrigation and revealed water availability
    constraints in the Irrigation scenario. For UM, additional negative effects on
    erosion risk and landscape scenery were identified. The area demand for water
    quality protection was particularly high in EE, MOL and PR. In conclusion, the
    trade-offs of agricultural intensification with water quantity and water quality
    were most evident in the four districts with the highest yield potential. In contrast,
    the trade-offs of agricultural intensification with landscape scenery and biodiversity
    were most evident in districts with moderate yield potential. The identification
    of those regional variations in trade-offs is useful for district level decision-making
    because it enables the identification of those regions where agricultural intensification
    may cause the least negative side effects and where is requires countermeasures
    such as the establishment of riparian zones or habitat zones. 3.3. Stakeholder
    involvement in the assessment of results All results of this comprehensive study
    were condensed to a few key statements to make them communicable to the invited
    stakeholders. The overall participation in the discussions during the stakeholder
    workshop was extensive and actively involved almost every participant. Questions
    and comments on the study were as diverse as the group’s composition and were
    sometimes controversial. One point of interest had to do with the social and economic
    impacts at the district level that will be subject to a follow-up study. Another
    discussion point was the energy topic–the future role of maize and other resources
    for biomass production. Doubts were raised with regards to the congruency of water
    availability estimations with older studies. Broad interest was shown in environmental
    indicators. Whereas 2/3 of the participants were astonished by at least part of
    the results (mainly water availability), the remaining third found their estimates
    confirmed. There were 10 participants who were interested in cooperating in further
    impact assessments. The results of the stakeholder discussions are scientifically
    relevant for several reasons. First, adequate documentation of stakeholder involvement
    and perception of scientific findings is a prerequisite for a systematic appraisal
    of the results (Scherhaufer et al., 2013) and constitutes an essential component
    of a sound impact assessment. Second, the stakeholder views represent a diversity
    of interests that come into play when addressing changes in agricultural practices,
    and they underline the importance of dialogue between science, practice and policy
    (Knierim et al., 2010). Third, only at certain points (e.g., related to the energy
    maize issue) when the discussions became ‘hot’ did we fully understand the challenges
    of conveying modeling results. There were a number of methodological gains that
    resulted from stakeholder involvement. First of all, it became obvious that an
    open learning attitude is key for all actors involved and hence, appropriate conditions
    have to be created by the study coordinators (Collins and Ison, 2009). In particular,
    scientists largely underestimated the efforts necessary to elaborate the results
    in a way that can be digested by stakeholders. It took several iterations of discussion
    and consensus finding to come up with the key statements. On the other hand, the
    stakeholder discussions about regional water availability showed that commonly
    accepted knowledge needs to be regularly tested and updated by research. Lastly,
    discussions about the Energy scenario showed that many stakeholders had already
    made up their minds before the meeting. As a majority confirmed their willingness
    to further cooperate in such type of studies, we conclude that the information
    provided through this impact assessment study is a suitable evidence base for
    stakeholder. But the stakeholders’ involvement into assessment has to be timely
    so that it corresponds to both, the state of political developments and the state
    of scientific insights. In the case presented here, ‘consultation’ was appropriate,
    while for the future, a more procedural and interactive participation might be
    possible (Pretty, 1995). 4. Conclusion In this paper, we demonstrated the application
    of a series of indicators in a comprehensive sustainability impact assessment
    of agricultural intensification at the regional level. It revealed the potential
    of irrigation for increasing and stabilizing yields. This information is important
    for both, at farm level for farmers’ decision making on agricultural management,
    and at regional level for policy decision making on sustainability governance.
    Scenario assumptions were set such that good agricultural practices (crop rotations,
    preceding crop effects) were respected, resulting in a maximum maize share of
    49% for the Energy scenario. This value is below the threshold set in the greening
    of the CAP (70%). In reality, without additional policy restrictions, the maize
    share may reach higher values. However, the simulated levels already show the
    adverse impacts of increasing maize share on biodiversity, landscape scenery,
    water quality and erosion risk. Policy-makers need to decide whether they will
    accept the side effects associated with an increasing maize share. The between-district
    variation of the scenario results was particularly interesting. Those regions
    that are expected to suffer most of the adverse impacts of agricultural intensification,
    according to soil quality, have only medium yield expectations. High and low yield
    potential regions turned out to be less affected. Obviously, those medium-yield-potential
    regions feature areas with high landscape values that are attractive for biodiversity
    habitats and recreation. Additionally, they have a high share of surface water
    bodies, resulting in high area demands for water quality protection. In contrast,
    high-yield-potential regions have fewer areas of high landscape value and less
    connectivity between water bodies. Low-yield-potential areas were less affected
    by the simulated scenario changes. Therefore, the scenario impacts were also low.
    The landscape characteristic that determine the agricultural scenario impacts
    have yet to be analyzed in detail. Such analysis would facilitate the transferability
    of results to other regions and situations. Our study was aimed at the science-policy
    interface. We sought to provide policy decision-makers with relevant state-of-the-art
    information about the effects of anticipated intensification trends in agriculture.
    This required a contextual upscaling of farm level assumptions and hectare scale
    yield simulations to administrative units at the regional level. Additionally,
    the analyzed impact issues had to be relevant at the spatial level of policy relevance.
    The selection of indicators was guided by this challenge. The result was an overview
    of regional sustainability impacts induced by farm-level decision-making. This
    approach proved relevant for decision-makers. Simulation results were partly new
    to decision makers (yield expectations), they partly confirmed their estimates
    (soil erosion, biodiversity), and they partly challenged common sense (water demand
    and water availability). In any case, important evidence was presented that formed
    a basis for policy decision-making. The study revealed the need for researchers
    at the science-policy interface to emphasize the broader sustainability impacts
    and focus on trade-off studies rather than analyzing single impacts without the
    sustainability context. With the combined use of multiple indicators this became
    possible. Acknowledgements Funding for this study was provided by the Leibniz

    (RS) for crop water requirements calculation is proposed. • Validations of the
    canopy variables estimated by RS are reported. • Potential ET by RS was compared
    with actual ET modelled by EPIC. • Results confirm the usefulness of RS data in
    supporting irrigation scheduling. Abstract The occurrence of water shortages ascribed
    to projected climate change, especially in the Mediterranean region, fosters the
    interest in remote sensing (RS) applications to optimize water use in agriculture.
    Remote sensing evapotranspiration and water demand estimation over large cultivated
    areas were used to manage irrigation to minimize losses during the crop growing
    cycle. The research aimed to explore the potential of the MultiSpectral Instrument
    (MSI) sensor on board Sentinel-2A to estimate crop parameters, mainly surface
    albedo (α) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) that influence the dynamics of potential
    evapotranspiration (ETp) and Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) of processing
    tomato crop (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Maximum tomato ETp was calculated according
    to the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (FAO-56 PM) using appropriate values of canopy
    parameters derived by processing Sentinel-2A data in combination with daily weather
    information. For comparison, we used the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa)
    derived from the soil water balance (SWB) module in the Environmental Policy Integrated
    Climate (EPIC) model and calibrated with in-situ Root Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM).
    The experiment was set up in a privately-owned farm located in the Tarquinia irrigation
    district (Central Italy) during two growing seasons, within the framework of the
    EU Project FATIMA (FArming Tools for external nutrient Inputs and water Management).
    The results showed that canopy growth, maximum evapotranspiration (ETp) and IWR
    were accurately inferred from satellite observations following seasonal rainfall
    and air temperature patterns. The net estimated IWR from satellite observations
    for the two-growing seasons was about 272 and 338 mm in 2016 and 2017, respectively.
    Such estimated requirement was lower compared with the actual amount supplied
    by the farmer with sprinkler and drip micro-irrigation system in both growing
    seasons resulting in 364 (276 mm drip micro-irrigation, and 88 mm sprinkler) and
    662 (574 mm drip micro-irrigation, and 88 mm sprinkler) mm, respectively. Our
    findings indicated the suitability of Sentinel-2A to predict tomato water demand
    at field level, providing useful information for optimizing the irrigation over
    extended farmland. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Sentinel-2AEvapotranspiration

    Introduction Evidence suggests that human-induced greenhouse gases emissions have
    altered our climate at a relatively rapid rate (Allen et al., 2009; IPCC, 2013),
    with the consequence that rising global temperatures and changes in precipitation
    pattern drastically exposed water-limited environments and agriculture, restricting
    crop yield, production and food availability (Avramova et al., 2016; McKersie,
    2015; Moore and Lobell, 2014). Freshwater scarcity is widely acknowledged as a
    global systemic risk in terms of potential impact (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016),
    especially in agricultural production, which uses about 70% of total freshwater
    withdrawals (WWAP, 2015). In particular, the impacts of climate change on European
    (EU) agriculture may increase productivity in northern latitudes, while in southern
    latitude projection indicated reduction in rainfall, and water availability, problems
    with salinization and increase in pest and disease outbreaks (Falloon and Betts,
    2010; Kaley et al., 2017). All above considered, there is an urgent need to seek
    out technological advancements and scalable solutions in the context of Precision
    Farming (PF) (Lal and Stewart, 2016; Liaghat and Balasundram, 2010; Moran et al.,
    1997; Mulla, 2013; Vuolo et al., 2015; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2014) to address management
    strategies on water inputs in response to seasonal drought. This objective requires
    timely and reliable estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ET) and Irrigation
    Water Requirements (IWR) at field level with high spatial and temporal resolution.
    Soil water balance (SWB) models present limitations when applied to wide areas
    due to complexity of input data required, with special concern to soil hydraulic
    properties, interaction with groundwater, variability of plant development due
    to different crop varieties and management practices. Diversely, Earth Observation
    (EO) techniques provide reliable and suitable data to feed PF applications and
    serve several end-users (i.e. farmers, landowners and decision makers). High temporal
    and spatial resolution multi-spectral imagery can be used to manage irrigation
    scheduling based on near real-time actual crop needs (Calera et al., 2017). One
    advantage is the detection of the actual crop development which influences the
    entity of evapotranspiration fluxes and hence the irrigation requirements. Although
    extensive research has been carried out on ET crop estimation for water management
    using EO data, to date one of the major limitation for their applicability and
    technological transfer was the limited spatial and temporal resolution of the
    sensors (Bisquert et al., 2016). In this context, the recent advent of Sentinel-2
    mission from European Space Agency (ESA), as part of the programme Copernicus
    (http://www.copernicus.eu/) (Drusch et al., 2012), has greatly enhanced the possibilities
    for a routine monitoring of crop parameters, such as LAI. The Multi Spectral Instrument
    (MSI) on board of Sentinel-2 captures data at 10, 20 and 60-meter spatial resolution
    over 13 spectral bands and with a very high temporal resolution of five days at
    the equator. Thanks to the rich information content the application of inversion
    techniques of radiative transfer models is now possible, providing robust physical
    basis for describing crop reflectance and estimating crop parameters such as LAI
    (Herrmann et al., 2011; Laurent et al., 2014; Richter et al., 2012; Verrelst et
    al., 2015). The combination of freely available satellite imagery, high resolution,
    novel spectral capabilities, a swath width of 290 km and frequent revisit times
    is stimulating the development of operational and commercial uses of EO data tailored
    for PF applications, as well as for scientific projects. The Sentinel-2 mission
    also provides data to be integrated in a tool for improving the quality of existing
    Web-GIS Satellite-based Irrigation Advisory Services - IAS (Calera et al., 2017;
    Richter et al., 2012; Vuolo et al., 2015; D''Urso et al., 2008) or other similar
    implementations foreseen in the near future (Pereira, 2017). This study focuses
    on the determination of the Irrigation Water Requirements in tomato crops by means
    of Copernicus Sentinel-2A data. It uses Environmental Policy Integrated Climate
    (EPIC) crop growth model simulations for the comparison of the predicted crop
    evapotranspiration. The work was developed in the context of the FATIMA project
    (http://fatima-h2020.eu/), financed by the EU Commission under the HORIZON 2020
    programme to develop and adopt innovative farming tools and service capacities
    that help the intensive farm sector to optimize its external input management
    (nutrients, energy and water) and productivity. The results of this research can
    be used for developing operational tools for monitoring water use trends of irrigated
    crop at commercial farm level in a Mediterranean environment in Central Italy.
    2. Methodological approach to estimate potential evapotranspiration from Earth
    Observation Over the past two decades, the improvements in the technical capabilities
    of spaceborne EO sensors allowed different approach for implementing potential
    evapotranspiration (ETp) estimation from satellite imagery. Several reviews have
    attempted to evaluate ETp EO-based methods and their performances, with special
    focus on irrigation management in agriculture, considering scales and temporal
    evolution during the growing season (Allen et al., 2011; Calera et al., 2017;
    D''Urso, 2010). To date, according to those reviews, two main groups of EO-based
    methods for ET estimation can be distinguished. The first group considers observations
    in the thermal range to estimate latent heat flux as a residual of surface energy
    balance, hence the actual evapotranspiration ETa, accordingly to different schematizations
    (Allen et al., 2007; Bastiaanssen et al., 1998; Kalma et al., 2008; Kustas et
    al., 2016). Surface energy balance methods can detect crop water stress but suffer
    from the technical limitations of thermal observations from space in terms of
    spatial and temporal resolution. The second group contemplates visible (VIS) and
    near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths for characterizing the crop development in the
    application of the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith (FAO-56 PM) model (Allen et al., 1998);
    in this case, it is generally assumed that the crop is in “standard conditions”,
    i.e. in a disease-free environment with adequate fertilization and sufficient
    soil water availability (irrigation applied). Often this value of evapotranspiration
    is referred to as “potential”, which might introduce some confusion with the term
    “reference”, for this reason, we prefer to use in this text the complete definition
    of FAO-56 PM, i.e. evapotranspiration in standard conditions ETp, which means
    maximum value of crop evapotranspiration. Thus, we derive the maximum IWR for
    a crop at a given development stage. Under the hypothesis of a uniform soil cover,
    the Penman-Monteith approach derives surface resistances to heat and vapour transfer
    to the atmosphere by using vegetation parameters, namely Leaf Area Index (LAI
    – key parameter characterizing the structure and functioning of vegetation cover,
    that influence crop productivity), surface albedo (α-influences the net radiation
    of the surface, which is the primary source of the energy exchange for the evaporation
    process), and crop height (hc - influences the aerodynamic resistance term of
    the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation and the turbulent transfer of vapour from
    the crop into the atmosphere) (Allen et al., 1998; D''Urso, 2001). Since for a
    crop in standard conditions, a minimum value of stomatal resistance can be considered
    for most herbaceous crops (≈100 sm−1), the surface resistance became a function
    of LAI only. This is also referred in the FAO-56 paper as the “one-step” or “direct”
    approach. During recent years, there has been a consistent effort to estimate
    vegetation parameters (α-LAI) from EO in the VIS and NIR regions (Atzberger and
    Richter, 2012; Vuolo et al., 2015), allowing to adapt the Penman–Monteith equation
    to be used directly with EO based LAI and α value (D''Urso, 2010), which can be
    measured in the field for providing an assessment of accuracy of the ET method,
    in addition to the below mentioned micro-meteorological techniques, and to derive
    the maximum IWR. The use of EO-based “one-step” FAO-56 PM method has become more
    popular recently for assessing ETp under different hydro-climatic regions and
    crops such as wheat, cotton, corn, grapes and orchards (Farg et al., 2012; Glenn
    et al., 2011; Vanino et al., 2015). This approach has the advantage of being easily
    implemented, especially over homogeneous landscapes represented by irrigated farmland
    under unstressed conditions (Anderson et al., 2012). Another category of EO methods
    for estimating ETp is based on the traditional concept of the so-called crop coefficient
    (Kc), defined as the ratio of the unstressed crop evapotranspiration to the reference
    evapotranspiration (ET0). Kc is specific to each crop and reflects the canopy
    development due to agronomic practices (including irrigation) over the course
    of the growing season. Hence, in this “two-steps” approach, ETp is estimated as
    the product of the reference evapotranspiration (ET0, depending only from atmospheric
    conditions) and the Kc. Several studies have demonstrated the linear relationship
    between Kc and different Vegetation Index (VIs), such as the Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI, Tucker et al., 1979) or the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index
    (SAVI, Huete, 1988), derived from spectral observations in the VIS and NIR region
    (D''Urso and Calera, 2006; Neale et al., 1989). However, the determination of
    the empirical parameters of the relationship between Kc and VIs would requires
    measurements of ET over well irrigated crops, by using micro-meteorological methods
    such as lysimeters, Bowen Ratio, and Eddy Covariance. This calibration procedure
    is seldom applied, leaving the definition of Kc (VIs) to visual field inspections
    of crop growth and phenology, which are subjective and qualitative. 3. Materials
    and methods 3.1. Study area The study area is in the Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ)
    of Tarquinia Municipality coastal plain (Viterbo Province, Lazio Region; 7 km
    NW of Tarquinia, 2.7 km from seashore - 42° 69′ N and 11° 69′ E, at an average
    altitude of 25 m above sea level, with 3% mean slope) and it is part of the Water
    User Association (WUA) district of “Maremma Etrusca”, one of the largest agricultural
    irrigation districts of Western Central Italy. The WUA manages the agricultural
    irrigation infrastructural network in a supply mode using river and artificial
    channel waters (Fig. 1). The area is characterized by intensive agricultural management
    due to the production of irrigated crops (mostly processing tomato) and the large
    use of mineral N fertilizer, causing groundwater pollution. Therefore, it was
    selected as the Italian pilot case study for the FATIMA project to: • Establish
    innovative and new farm tools and service capacities that help the intensive farm
    sector. • Optimize productivity and external management inputs (water, nutrients
    and energy). Download : Download high-res image (505KB) Download : Download full-size

    farm in Tarquinia Municipality coastal plain (western Central Italy). The area
    is on Pleistocene medium and low marine terraces (Quaternary period), during the
    Pleistocene epoch, and on recent local lowlands with limited costal aquifers salt-water
    intrusion. The climate is typical Mediterranean (Koppen classification: Csa) characterized
    by warm dry summers, mild winters, and with an average annual rainfall of approximately
    600 mm, mainly concentrated in autumn and spring. The mean daily temperature is
    15.3 °C (ranging from 7.7 °C in January and of 23.7 °C in July). 3.2. Experimental
    field plots description The experimental campaign was carried out during the 2016
    and 2017 growing seasons within a 20 ha privately owned farm, with a crop rotation
    of durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf. var. Iride) and processing tomato (Solanum
    lycopersicum L. var. Vulcano) (Fig. 1). The soil present a clay loam texture,
    and is classified as Calcaric Cambic Phaeozems according to FAO system (IUSS-WRB,
    2015). Tomato plants (variety “Vulcano”) were transplanted at four-leaves stage
    5th May 2016 and 29th April 2017, in an experimental area of about 3 ha with a
    plant density of 2.9 plants m−2. The tomato variety selected was suitable for
    mechanized harvesting which requires determinate or bush-like growth (max 0.4–0.6 m),
    resistance to overripe and contemporaneity of fruit ripe. Irrigation was provided
    by a sprinkler system in the first three weeks after transplanting and by micro-irrigation
    (combined by fertilization) during the rest of the growing season. Irrigation
    scheduling was established by the farmer based on his own practical experience.
    During the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the total rainfall was 75 and 18 mm.
    The irrigation water applied by micro-irrigation was recorded through a flanged
    - cast iron water flow meter (Bontempi DN065), resulting in a total amount of
    276 and 574 mm/ha for 2016 and 2017 respectively. Pest and weeds control was performed
    according to the current farming management practice. The crop was harvested on
    18th August 2016 (90.7 ton/ha yield) and on 8th August 2017 (72.3 ton/ha yield),
    when ripe fruit rate reached about 90%, with an average crop cycle length of around
    106 days. 3.3. Data set and processing procedure The data set and the processing

    R: Rainfall (mm). This included daily meteorological information, EO data from
    Sentinel-2A satellite, in-situ crop parameters and soil water content measurements,
    records of irrigation applied. The flowchart highlighted that field measures were
    used both to validate EO maps and to calibrate EPIC model. In details, canopy
    reflectance and LAI measures were used to validate α and LAI maps, while LAI,
    soil moisture and tomato yield were used to EPIC model calibration. After EO maps
    validation and model calibration, ET was estimated by EO-based direct FAO-56 PM
    method and EPIC model. Both ET results were compared using performance statistical
    indicators as detailed in Section 3.4.3. 3.3.1. Meteorological data Daily meteorological
    data (from 2004 to present) include solar radiation (S - Wm−2), air temperature
    (Ta - °C), air humidity (RH - %), wind speed (U - ms−1) and rainfall (R - mm).
    They were measured at the Agrometeorological Service station of Lazio Region (ARSIAL)
    located in the Tarquinia Municipality (Central Italy). This data were used to
    compute FAO-56 PM reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and the IWR for 2016 and
    2017. Table 1 shows the weather conditions in 2016 and 2017. In the period January
    to August, the two years presented similar mean temperature, i.e. 17.3 °C (2016)
    and 17.1 °C (2017). This was higher than the long-term (2004–2017) average of
    16.1 °C. Conversely, rainfall, from January to August, was extremely different
    for the two years, 260 vs 120 mm in 2016 and 2017, respectively. As for temperature,
    both years showed a deviation respect to the rainfall long-term average of −92 mm
    in 2016 and −232 mm in 2017. Table 1. Monthly (January–August) mean temperature

    We have used EO data acquired from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite. The Sentinel-2
    mission is based on a constellation of two identical satellites (Sentinel-2A,
    launched on 23rd June 2015, and Sentinel-2B, launched on 7th March 2017) both
    orbiting at an altitude of 786 km, 180° apart for optimal coverage and data delivery.
    Together they cover all Earth''s land surfaces, large islands, inland and coastal
    waters every five days at the equator (http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-2),
    ESA delivers Level 1C orthorectified Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance through
    the Copernicus Open Access Hub (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home); added
    value product can be obtained through the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP),
    a software package tailored to the Sentinel-2 characteristics, developed by ESA
    (http://step.esa.int/main/toolboxes/sentinel-2-toolbox/sentinel-2-toolbox-features/).
    In particular the Sen2Cor algorithm (Müller-Wilm, n.d) process Level 1C data to
    an orthoimage Bottom of Atmosphere (BoA) corrected reflectance product (Level
    2A), while the Biophysical Processor computes crop biophysical products (Level
    2B) from Sentinel-2 reflectance data. The technical characteristics of the MSI
    on-board the Sentinel-2 satellites are outlined in Table 2. Table 2. Sentinel-2

    Note: The nine bands used for LAI estimation are highlighted in bold, while for
    bands used in the α calculation see Table 3. In the context of FATIMA project,
    the University of Natural Resources and Life Science (BOKU) has implemented for
    all the project study areas a data service platform for processing Sentinel-2
    data (Vuolo et al., 2016). The service platform provides access to individual
    Sentinel-2 granules (ortho-rectified image tiles of 100 × 100 km2 in UTM/WGS84
    projection) processed at level-2A (BoA) using the ESA Sen2Cor algorithm (Müller-Wilm,
    n.d). The platform also provide value-added products - obtained from the Sentinel
    Application Platform (SNAP) biophysical processor - with a focus on agricultural
    vegetation monitoring, such as LAI, and Fraction of vegetation Cover (Fvc: used
    in this study for the calculation of the Rn - net rainfall)., The improved spectral
    and spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 satellite data allows the application
    of canopy radiative transfer models and computational efficient inversion techniques
    based e.g. on artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate crop biophysical parameters.
    In particular for LAI and Fvc, are obtained by an ANN algorithm trained using
    radiative transfer simulations from PROSPECT (Jacquemoud and Baret, 1990), and
    SAIL (Verhoef, 1984) models, and tailored for Sentinel-2 data. Detailed description
    of the algorithm can be found in Weiss and Baret, 2016. The algorithm requires
    eight Sentinel-2 spectral bands (B3-B7, B8a, B11 and B12) at 10 and 20 m pixel
    size, which are all resample to 10 m pixel size to derive LAI and Fvc. Experimental
    studies have shown the accuracy of this approach for LAI (Atzberger and Richter,
    2012; Vuolo et al., 2016; Weiss and Baret, 2016) estimation in different environments
    and crops. The broadband surface albedo is calculated as the integration of at-surface
    reflectance across the shortwave spectrum (D''Urso and Calera, 2006), as shown
    in equation (Eq. (1)). (1) where α is albedo, ρbi is surface reflectance for a
    given band bi at Level-2A Sentinel-2A surface reflectance, obtained using the
    ESA''s Sen2Cor algorithm (Version 2.3.1), ωbi is the weighting coefficient representing
    the solar radiation fraction derived from the solar irradiance spectrum (Thuillier
    et al., 2003) within the spectral range (spectral response curves) for bands bi
    (indicated with Esun in Table 3) and is calculated as equation (Eq. (2)): (2)
    where Rsλ is extra-terrestrial irradiance for wavelength λ (μm); and UPbi and
    LObi are upper and lower wavelength bounds for Sentinel-2A band bi, respectively.

    - accessed on 9th February 2018). The site provides an excel file with the spectral
    response functions. All the visible and near infrared bands have changed a little,
    even if only three bands have significant changes, B1, B2 and B8: B2 equivalent
    wavelength changes by 4 nm, B1 by 1 nm, and B8 by 2 nm. The SWIR bands did not
    change. Table 3 lists the bands settings for Sentinel-2A bands 1, 9, 10 (all not
    available after Sen2Cor processing), 8a (in the spectral range of band 8) and
    band 12 (negligible value for weighting coefficient) not taken into account for
    the albedo calculation. This calculation procedure has been validated by BOKU
    through a comparison to ground measurements of albedo obtained with a Campbell
    CNR-1 radiometer installed at 2 m height from top of canopy, over a broad range
    of LAI values and vegetation classes (Vuolo et al., 2016). Table 4 shows the temporal
    frequency of the Sentinel-2A (tiles 32TQM and 32TQN) cloud-free images, and derived

    neither Sentinel-2A image were available. The LAI was measured non-destructively
    by using a portable canopy digital analyzer (LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer, LI-COR),
    under conditions of diffuse illumination at sunset, in the day antecedent to the
    spectroradiometer measurements. The LAI value at each location is resulting as
    the average of 3 repetitions of 8 below canopy readings taken within a 5 m radius
    of the georeferenced location. An opaque cover (view cap) on the optical sensor,
    with an open wedge of 180°, was used to avoid the influence of neighboring obstacles,
    such as the operator (Gower and Norman, 1991; Li-Cor, 1992). Canopy reflectance
    was measured by means of portable spectradiometer (ASD FieldSpec HH, Boulder,
    USA) operating in the wavelength range 325–1075 nm with 1 nm spectral resolution,
    controlled by a laptop equipped with the software provided by the instrument manufacturer.
    The instrument lens had a field of view of 25° and it was positioned at about
    1 m above the canopy. All spectral readings were collected under clear sky conditions
    with no wind, between 9:30 and 11:30 local time (satellite overpass around 10:30
    UTC), in correspondence of the same location of the LAI measurements. The measurement
    protocol included: collection of white reference on a calibrated Spectralon panel
    of dimensions 25 × 25 cm (SRT-99-100 Labsphere, Sutton, USA); collection of 3
    sets of 10 reflectance spectra within 2 m from the reference location, which were
    successively averaged to reduce the signal/noise ratio of each measurements. Soil
    water content was recorded continuously at 0.3 m depth in 5 points in the center
    of each pair of transect for the crop measurements (Fig. 4, blue dots), distant
    15 m each other; in addition, at the center position of the transect a Profile
    probe PR 2/6 (Frequency Domain Reflectometry) giving readings at 10/20/30/40/60
    and 100 cm (https://www.delta-t.co.uk/product/pr2/). All the probes of the same
    transect were connected to a GP2 datalogger (Delta T device, https://www.delta-t.co.uk/product/gp2/).
    Data from GP2, expressed as volumetric water content and °C, had been retrieved
    each other week on average during growing season. The soil water content readings
    were used for calibrating and validating the soil water balance in EPIC (see Section
    3.4.2). 3.4. Methodology 3.4.1. Determination of crop evapotranspiration by Earth
    Observation-direct approach The EO-direct approach for calculation of ETp described
    in Section 2 is applied by using the crop parameters (α and LAI) derived from
    processing of Sentinel-2A data, assuming fixed values for the stomatal resistance
    (sr ≈ 100 sm−1) and hc (0.4 m), for the calculation of the aerodynamic resistance,
    in the case of herbaceous crop. The assumption of a constant hc is consistent
    with the sensitivity analysis published by Consoli et al. (2006) – which report
    a value of 0.6 m for tree crops - and D''Urso (2010), considered valid for irrigated
    environments with the radiative component of the FAO-56PM equation dominant over
    the aerodynamic term. So doing, the calculation of ETp requires standard meteorological
    data, LAI and surface α. To confirm the validity of this assumption a sensitivity
    analysis of the influence of fixed hc (0.4 m) on ETp was performed for the year
    2016 and 2017 (Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image (332KB) Download :

    (ETp) and crop height (hc) ranging from 0.1 and 0.6 m during season 2016 (top
    graph) and 2017 (bottom graph). The assumption of average constant value of hc = 0.4 m
    determines an error percentage, ranging from −2% (as respect to the crop eight
    of 0.1 m) and 1% (as respect to the 0.6 m crop eight), on ETp cumulated value
    during irrigation seasons 2016 and 2017 (from May to August). The IWR is then
    calculated by considering the following simplified equation (Eq. (3)): (3) where
    Rn is net rainfall. Runoff and percolation are considered negligible considering
    the low amount of rainfall during the two growing seasons. Rn was calculated in
    equation (Eq. (4)) as a function of the actual rainfall (R), LAI and Fractional
    Cover (Fvc) by using the semi-empirical model of interception proposed by Braden
    (1985). (4) where R is the actual rainfall in (mm d−1), and a in (mm d−1) is an
    empirical parameter representing the crop saturation per unit foliage area (~0.28
    for most crops). 3.4.2. Soil water balance and actual evapotranspiration computing
    using EPIC model and calibration procedure Micrometeorological methods such eddy-covariance
    are often not applicable in many conditions, due to their requirements in terms
    of crop uniformity and plot extension; these limits unfortunately occur very often
    in Mediterranean agricultural systems, due to high fragmentation and complex landscape.
    Hence, in order to validate the EO-based estimation of ET for the irrigated tomato
    and to verify the existence of the standard conditions underlying the PM direct
    approach, the soil water balance (SWB) was calculated using the EPIC biophysical
    model (Williams, 1995). EPIC successfully tested in many pedo-climatic situations
    (Farina et al., 2011) was selected for its capability of simulating daily crop
    growth and SWB. Mandatory inputs to run the model are: meteorological data, soil
    characteristics, crop growth data (i.e. plants density and crop growing period)
    and management (such as tillage, irrigation volumes and amount of fertilizers
    distributed). EPIC was calibrated using LAI (derived from field measurements and
    Sentinel-2A) and observed soil water content. SWB (mm) is estimated by the model
    as the difference between the water inputs (rainfall + irrigation) and outputs
    (runoff, percolation, and evapotranspiration) (Williams, 1995) at rooting depths,
    considering different layers. Actual rainfall and irrigation were input to the
    model. Runoff volume is estimated by the curve number technique (USDA, 1972).
    Water that does not run-off percolates and flows from the surface to the bottom
    layers, when soil water content exceeds Field Capacity. EPIC model offers several
    equations to calculate potential ET. Considering the experimental site conditions
    and data availability, the PM method was selected because it perform better in
    terms of crop growth and SWB. During calibration step, a set of sensitive model
    parameters at crop and soil level were selected and adjusted to maximize the agreement
    between model simulation and observations. For the variables affecting the crop
    growth, plant density and harvest index were input to the model according to the
    values measured in the field. Maximum LAI, the fraction of growing season when
    LAI declines, and the LAI decline rate were adjusted, in order to fit the estimated
    daily LAI output to data estimated by Sentinel-2A. At soil level, the value of
    the following parameters was modified respect to default values: root growth-soil
    strength (set to 1.5 to minimize stress on root growth), soil evaporation coefficient
    (set to 1.5 to better predict soil evaporation rate from top 20 cm soil depth)
    and the PM adjustment factor (set to 1 to better estimate PM-ETp). 3.4.3. Statistical
    analyses Four types of metrics were calculated in order to assess the performance
    of the simulations: 1. the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), a difference-based evaluation,
    giving an indication of the coincidence or lack of coincidence between simulated
    and measured value, was calculated. RMSE indicates the difference between measured
    and simulated values and has the advantage of producing a result in the same units
    as that used for measurement. The calculated RMSE can be compared with the size
    of difference that is considered acceptable; 2. the Pearsons''s r coefficient
    of correlation that is a measure of the correlation between measured and predicted
    data. It assesses the linear relationship, i.e. values of one variable show a
    continuous increase or decrease as values increase or decrease on a second variable,
    even though the trend may not be linear. High values of the Pearson correlation
    coefficient suggest high predictability. 3. the linear regression R2 was also
    used. In the regression between observed and model-estimated values estimates
    of the intercept and the slope are good indicators of accuracy. Best values of
    intercept and slope are zero and 1, respectively. 4. the Root Mean Square Difference
    (RMSD) was used in order to compare two estimates (as in the case of the two modelled
    estimates of ET, FAO-56 PM and EPIC), rather than comparing an estimate and measured
    value. 4. Results and discussion This section first focuses on the analysis of
    the spectral consistency of Sentinel-2A BoA reflectance data, and quality of Sentinel-2A
    data for the retrieval of LAI, compared with ground measurements. Then, it presents
    the inter-comparison of the EO-based ETp with the ETa derived from the SWB predicted
    by EPIC model. 4.1. Spectral data To verify the spectral consistency of Sentinel-2A
    BoA reflectance data with ground reflectance measurements, in different atmospheric
    condition and illumination-viewing geometry of the sensors, we have used the spectroradiometer
    measurements reported in the Section 3.3.3. Reflectance spectra of tomato canopy
    varied significantly during the growing season and between years. Fig. 6 presents
    the continuous spectra, from Field Spec, for the two-experimental campaigns, with
    the corresponding in-situ LAI for 2016 and LAI from Sentinel-2A for 2017. Download

    Spectral variation of tomato reflectance curves for 2016 (a) and 2017 (b). In
    situ LAI (measurement taken on 7th and 22th June and 7th July) for 2016, and LAI
    from Sentinel-2A for 2017 are also reported. At the beginning of the inflorescence
    emergence stage (beginning of June) and in correspondence of low LAI, the reflectance
    in the Red spectral region (maximum Chl absorption around 670 nm) is higher, while
    the NIR reflectance (from 785 to 900 nm) is lower. By the increasing of LAI, (in
    the mid-season second half of June until first decade of July - at the flowering
    stage) reflectance in the Red region decreases, conversely the NIR reflectance
    increases. The difference in the increase of reflectance in the red-edge (from
    710 to 750 nm), i.e. the slope connecting the local minimum reflectance in the
    Red region, maximum absorption of chlorophyll, and the region with high reflectance
    values of the NIR plateau, affected by plant cell structure and leaf layers can
    be also clearly noticed. The peaks around 760 nm for the acquisition of 23rd June
    2016 and 23rd June 2017 were due to variability in the atmospheric water column
    which are generally smoothed in successive steps of the analysis. In Fig. 7 the
    values of Sentinel-2A BoA reflectance are superimposed to the spectral measurements
    taken in coincidence of the satellite acquisition. The BoA values for the Sentinel-2A
    images are representing the average value for the portion of field where spectral
    measurement were taken (around 20 pixels at 10 m resolution) while the spectra
    represented are the average of all the measurements taken. A good agreement between
    Sentinel-2A signatures and the reflectance measured with the Field Spec was found,
    although differences can be noticed among different spectral bands and surface
    reflectance changes within the acquisition dates. Although the spectral variation,
    the crop reflectance curves maintain the same behavior in both years. Different
    value (in terms of reflectance units) can be observed between the two-years (lower
    in 2017 with respect to 2016). This can be ascribed to the climatic conditions
    in the two years, characterized by different seasonal rainfall and temperature
    patterns. Download : Download high-res image (275KB) Download : Download full-size

    LAI derived from the Sentinel-2A was performed through comparison with non-destructive
    field reference measurements (LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer), described in Section
    3.3.3. Table 6 reports the main statistical parameters for the 2016 field campaign

    LAI - according to phenological stages from BBCH scale (Meier, 2001) - for the
    2016 and 2017 growing seasons (from transplanting to harvest) is described in
    Fig. 9. In 2016 during the month of May at leaves development and formation of
    side shoots stage (BBCH 1-2) the LAI value was <1 m2 m−2. From the first week
    of June at inflorescence emergence stage (BBCH 5) canopy progressively developed,
    reaching the maximum around the second half of June at the flowering stage (BBCH
    6), with LAI values around 3.5 (Sentinel-2A) and 2.96 (field measurements) in
    2016, and 2.47 in 2017. From this peak, during the development of fruit (BBCH
    7) and ripening of fruit and seed in (BBCH 8) the LAI decreased down to the minimum
    before the harvest. Download : Download high-res image (153KB) Download : Download

    (included the date of July 27th where no Sentinel-2A images were available) are
    also plotted in the respective graph. (yellow square = transplanting date; red
    square = harvesting date). (For interpretation of the references to color in this
    figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Due
    to the different meteorological trend characterized by different seasonal rainfall
    and temperature patterns, there is a clear decrease on the LAI in 2017 as respect
    to the 2016. This decrease confirms the importance of LAI on the crop productivity
    (Breda, 2003). In fact, there has been a large difference in yield in the two
    year, with 90.7 ton/ha (2016) and 72.3 ton/ha (2017), and this is clearly visible
    in the Sentinel-2A data confirming its potential to detect actual crop development
    conditions. 4.3. Soil Moisture, crop evapotranspiration and Irrigation Water Requirements
    To evaluate the Soil Moisture balance, it was necessary to take into account some
    different physical and hydrological characteristics of the soils of the two experimental
    plots (2016 and 2017). Soil dry bulk density (BD), water content at Field Capacity
    (FC) and at Wilting Point (WP) measured at the beginning of each trial as average
    for the top and subsoils are reported in Table 7. These data were used to convert
    the moisture volumes measured with Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) into mm
    of water present in the soil space (voids volumes). Table 7. Soil bulk density
    (g/cm3), water content at Field Capacity (vol/vol) and at Wilting Point (vol/vol)

    and the deep soil zone (not affected by most of the roots), from 50 to 100 cm
    of depth, are reported in Fig. 10 for the two years under investigation (2016
    and 2017). Download : Download high-res image (459KB) Download : Download full-size

    for 2016 (top chart), and 2017 (bottom chart). With orange dotted line are showed
    also the daily ETp values (mm). (For interpretation of the references to color
    in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
    According to these two soil thicknesses, a simple daily balance was performed
    by considering also the Rain and the ETp. According to the Soil Moisture balance,
    as previous showed in Fig. 10, an overall estimation of the water losses due to
    deep percolation is reported in the following Table 8. Table 8. Water losses by
    deep percolation according to the irrigation volumes provided by the farmer for
    the 2016 and 2017 crop seasons. Crop season 2016a 2017 Deep percolation (m3/ha)
    636 3049 Total irrigation (m3/ha) 3340 6620 % of water losses on total irrigation
    19 46 a Water losses were observed only during the first 5 May–8 June period (irrigation
    supply was applied in two times by sprinkler system). The Fig. 10 clearly shows
    as in the 2016 the water losses are concentrated in the first period of the crop
    season, form May to beginning of June. After this date the irrigation scheduling
    seems to be more efficient and the balance is always positive, as expression of
    the difference of moisture from RSZM to the deep soil zone. On the contrary, in
    the 2017, the soil moisture balance is always negative; the water amount given
    with the irrigation scheduling were always overestimated by the farmer, despite
    the ETp trend (and consequently the IWR calculated by EO). These different trends
    are to be related to the different soil hydrological characteristics, topographic
    position (on fair slope or flat area) and also to the fixed irrigation scheduling
    adopted by the farmer. To evaluate the effectiveness of the soil water balance,
    a further comparison between FDR measures and these predicted by the EPIC model
    was performed in the RZSM depth range, as reported below in Fig.11. Good agreement
    (r = 0.86, R2 = 0.75, p < 0.01 and RMSE 21.07 mm d−1) between simulated and measured

    May to 1st august n = 89) and 0–40 (2017 - from 6th June to 2nd August n = 56)
    cm soil depth. With regards to the estimation of the daily ETa, EPIC computes
    evaporation from soil and plant separately. Potential soil water evaporation is
    estimated as a function of potential evaporation and LAI using also exponential
    functions of soil depth and water content. For the plant evaporation the estimation
    is a linear function of potential evaporation and LAI. Table 9 provides an overview
    of ETp, and ETa (EPIC) trends for the period from May 5th to August 8th for 2016
    and 2017 growing seasons. Table 9. Statistical parameters for ETp, and ETa during

    season ranged from 314 mm in 2016 to 336 mm in 2017. ETp varied from 0.49 (11th
    May) to 6.02 mm d−1 (23th June) in 2016, and from 0.33 (7th May) to 6.90 mm d−1
    (2nd July) in 2017. The seasonal values of ETp in the growing season ranged from
    315 mm in 2016 to 348 mm in 2017. A good agreement was found, r = 0.85 p < 0.01,
    R2 = 0.73 for 2016, and r = 0.83 p < 0.01, R2 = 0.70 for 2017, and RMSD of 0.99

    same date, for year 2016 (top chart), and 2017 (bottom chart). Cumulated rainfall
    (mm) is also shown. The analysis of the data highlight that in both year the amount
    of water applied by the farmer is higher than satellite IWR estimates, although
    with differences between the two years (around +20% in 2016, and +50% in 2017).
    This discrepancy could be explained by considering the following factors: • Lower
    precipitation (−75%) in 2017 compared to 2016 • Higher percolation rate, as shown
    in Fig. 10, below the root zone • Soil characteristic together with the prolonged
    drought period favored the creation of very deep cracks, the increase of evaporation
    from cracks (from 12 to 30%) and the water loss from the root zone through percolation
    down to the bottom of cracks. Ritchie and Adams (1974) observed that cracks can
    increase evaporation by 12–30% (0.3 to 0.8 mm d−1). Thus, the effect of cracks
    on water vapour movement and soil moisture evaporation is relatively important
    after a dry layer is formed at uncovered soil. Those factors influenced the farmer
    behavior which, especially in situation of drought period tends to apply quantities
    of water that are considerably higher than the real needs of the crop, also considering
    that in this WUA the water allocation (and the application of corresponding fees)
    is done based on of the extension of irrigated area and not of water volumes.
    As a consequence, farmers are not motivated to adopt efficient water saving strategies,
    which results in generalized over-irrigation and misuses of water resources. Fig.

    satellite-based irrigation advisory services, were developed and they proved to
    provide economic benefits creating advantages for the environment and opportunities
    for all of the users of water resources (Calera et al., 2017). Through these services
    the farmers and managers of water resources, evaluate the volume of irrigation
    water to be applied, get estimates of the growth and phenology of crops, and know
    the meteorological conditions in their area. For them, it means (i) a correct
    and economic scheduling of irrigation; (ii) a reduction of water and energy inputs;
    (iii) an optimization of work and production. In the FATIMA project, for the Italian
    pilot area two web-application have been developed: IRRISAT (http://fatima.irrisat.com/)
    (Fig. 15), dedicated to farmers and IRRISAT MTE (http://fatima.irrisat.com/italy/)
    (Fig. 16) dedicated to WUA. The maps and suggested irrigation volume applications
    are timely published on a dedicated web-based dashboard interface, with restricted
    access to farmers and water basin authorities, in order to better control the
    irrigation process and consequently improve its overall efficiency. An intuitive
    dashboard has been developed to give farmers the ability to monitor the canopy
    development, irrigation advice, evapotranspiration at plot level. Data as time
    series of LAI, ETp beside other variables of potential interest (e.g. time series
    of IWR, rainfall, and air temperature) are shown in charts (Fig. 15). A similar
    interface was developed for the Irrigation Consortia and Water User associations.
    The tool allows the evaluation of crop water requirements aggregated at district
    level, for a more efficient management of the conveyance and distribution network.
    The GIS tools are going to be further expanded to link the financial management
    of the irrigation fees at farm level to the IWR (Fig. 16). Download : Download

    5. Summary and conclusion This manuscript provides the descriptions of a methodology
    to estimate ETp of processing tomato crop (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and the associated
    quantitative calibration of the remote sensing reflectance products derived from
    the MSI sensor on board Sentinel-2A, which are critical for the retrievals of
    ET constituents'' parameters like LAI and α. The main advances provided by our
    research activities is – thanks to the improved spectral/spatial and temporal
    resolution of the Sentinel-2 satellite – to provide a more physically-based methodologies
    (i.e. application of radiative transfer models), to detect the actual crop development
    and the estimate of the crop parameters (e.g. LAI) which influence the entity
    of evapotranspiration fluxes and hence the IWR, by using all the available spectral
    information, surpassing the traditional Kc approach based on tabulate data (coming
    from paper FAO-56), or on the linear relationship between Kc and VIs, which uses
    a limited numbers of spectral bands, and thus is not able to detect reflectance
    behavior of surface patterns with the same accuracy. The results obtained confirmed
    the spectral consistency of Sentinel-2A data with ground reflectance measurements
    and the high potential and quality of Sentinel-2A data for the retrieval of LAI.
    Results indicate a good agreement between ETp estimated by EO direct approach
    and the ETa measured by means of a calibrated SWB. This approach confirms the
    validity of combining Penman-Monteith model with EO based vegetation parameters.
    The results indicate that farmers tend to over-irrigate the crop. This behavior
    can mainly ascribed to the following factor: • unavailability of supporting information
    about climate and canopy development, and • in most cases, even in presence of
    metered distribution networks, the water allocation (and the application of corresponding
    fees) is done on the basis of the extension of irrigated area and not of water
    volumes. As a consequence, farmers are not motivated to adopt efficient water
    saving strategies, which results in generalized over-irrigation and misuses of
    water resources. In this context the availability of reliable, objective and timely
    information about the actual development of crop (and hence its Irrigation Water
    Requirements) allows the implementations of efficient water distribution criteria
    based on the actual irrigation needs of crops. The enhanced capabilities provided
    by ESA Sentinel-2 (A and B) mission, with global coverage at 10 days revisit frequency
    of each single satellite (5 days combined constellation) and 10–20 m spatial resolutions,
    are particularly suitable for mapping crops and irrigated areas, and related IWR,
    with satisfactory accuracy and in a cost-effective way, also considering the opportunities
    for combining the data with that from complementary systems, such as Landsat-8,
    to obtain cloud free dense time series over large geographic regions. The availability
    of this unprecedented multi-spectral observations combined with the impressive.
    progresses in the field of Information and Communication Technologies can facilitate
    the improvement/development of IAS using EO data as an operational service for
    supporting irrigation water management. Hence, nowadays satellite images are delivered
    via Internet within few hours from the acquisition time, and they can be quickly
    processed to get final-users products distributed in near-real time. The services
    can provide to farmers and water resource manager sounder quantitative information
    about the spatial/temporal variability of crop growth conditions and its related
    IWR, improving crop production efficiency and reducing its environmental impact.
    This information would be helpful to achieve the commitment to the increasingly
    stringent regulatory requirements (e.g. the EU Water Framework Directive 2000/60,
    water metering and full cost recovery, and the Rural Development Program 2014–2020,
    Ex-ante conditionalities on Water Resources), which imposes a substantial increase
    in the efficiency of water use in agriculture for the next decades from farmers
    and irrigation managers. Acknowledgments This research was developed in the framework
    of the project FATIMA (FArming Tools for external nutrient Inputs and water MAnagement),
    funded by the European Union''s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme
    (Grant Agreement No 633945). Special thanks are dedicated to the farmer Mr. Vincenzo
    Fava for making his land available for experimental set-up and data collection.

    109 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Low N use efficiency (NUE) continues to
    be a problem in the rice (Oryza sativa L.)–wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping
    system. The leaf color chart (LCC)–based real-time N management can be used to
    optimize/synchronize N application with crop demand or to improve existing fixed
    split N recommendations. We conducted a field experiment during 2001–2003 at Modipuram,
    India, to determine the threshold LCC values for N application in rice and wheat,
    assess the need for basal N application, calibrate the LCC with a chlorophyll
    meter (SPAD), and work out the economics of rice–wheat systems. Treatments consisted
    of LCC scores of 2 to 5 for different cultivars of rice and wheat and were compared
    with the zero-N control and a recommended fixed-time N splitting. In rice, LCC
    ≤ 3 for ‘Basmati-370’, 4 for ‘Saket-4’, and 5 for ‘Hybrid 6111/PHB-71’ produced
    higher yield and NUE than recommended N splits. In wheat, maintenance of LCC ≤
    4 required 120 kg N ha−1, which produced higher grain yield, N uptake, and NUE
    than that of recommended N splits. Chlorophyll meter reading and crop growth rate
    (g m−2 day−1) at 15 d after transplanting in rice and 21 d after seeding in wheat
    were not significantly different with or without basal N application, indicating
    that basal N application in rice and wheat was not necessary in soils having relatively
    high indigenous N supply. Both LCC and SPAD readings (r = 0.84 to 0.91) were highly
    correlated in rice and wheat. Net returns were 19 to 31% higher in LCC-based N
    management than in fixed-time N application for rice–wheat cropping. Abbreviations

    development TCC total cost of cultivation Rice and wheat, the staple food crops
    for South Asian people, are of great significance, as these crops contribute more
    than 80% of the total cereal production in South Asia—Bangladesh, Pakistan, India,
    and Nepal (Timsina and Connor, 2001). Nitrogen is the nutrient that most often
    limits crop production. Cereals including rice and wheat accounted for approximately
    56% of the worldwide N fertilizer utilized (IFA, 2002). Nitrogen use efficiency
    in rice and wheat is low. Based on a recent worldwide evaluation, the fertilizer
    N recovery efficiency has been found to be around 30% in rice and wheat with current
    practices (Krupnik et al., 2004). The main reason of low NUE is inefficient splitting
    of N applications, including the use of N in excess to the requirements. Fixed-time
    recommended N split applications at specified growth stages is the most common
    practice followed by the farmers (PhilRice, 1991; Pillai and Kundu, 1993).This
    does not consider the dynamic crop N requirement and soil N supply because N recommendations
    were mainly derived from empirical testing of N response to few fixed doses. In
    fixed-time recommended N split schedule, the N splitting is skewed, the first
    two splittings [one as basal at the time of planting/sowing and another at 25
    to 30 d after transplanting (DAT) in rice and 21 to 25 d after sowing (DAS) in
    wheat] occur at 21 to 30 DAS/DAT, and third dose is split at panicle initiation
    (PI) stage. In some rice-growing countries, present recommendations call for 50
    to 67% of total fertilizer N inputs to be broadcast-incorporated before transplanting
    and the remainder top dressed at 5 to 7 d before PI (Cassman et al., 1998). Farmers
    do not appear to recognize differences in soil N supply because no relationship
    exists between the amount of N fertilizer they apply and crop N uptake in plots
    established within their fields that did not receive applied N (Cassman et al.,
    1998). The optimum use of N can be achieved by matching N supply with crop demand.
    A potential solution has been tried to regulate the timing of N application in
    rice and wheat using a chlorophyll meter (or SPAD meter) or a LCC to determine
    the plant N needs (Balasubramanian et al., 2003; Bijay-Singh et al., 2002). The
    concept is based on results that show a close link between leaf chlorophyll content
    and leaf N content. Moreover, leaf-area–based N concentration (Na) varies within
    a narrow range at different growth stages. The close relationship between Na and
    SPAD or LCC readings facilitates the use of a single critical value for SPAD or
    LCC to monitor leaf N status at all growth stages. Thus, the chlorophyll meter
    or LCC can be used to quickly and reliably assess the leaf N status of crops at
    different growth stages. The LCC, because of its low cost for farmers, has shown
    much promise in real-time N management studies conducted in India and elsewhere.
    But, these studies were restricted to coarse rice cultivars having similar genetic
    potential and harvest index (Balasubramanian et al., 1999, 2003; Bijay-Singh et
    al., 2002). In LCC-based N management, chart readings start at 15 DAT in rice
    and 21 DAS in wheat. An important issue is whether to use the basal N (at planting)
    when the LCC is used as an approach for managing N. In the rice–wheat cropping
    systems, genotypes of various background and growth duration are grown in a sequence
    (wheat after the harvest of rice in the same plot) to fit in a system. No information
    is available on critical LCC values for rice genotypes having different genetic
    background, plant type, and leaf color. It is also important to determine whether
    the LCC could be useful for applying N in wheat, particularly before the maximum
    tillering stage. Therefore, this study was designed to examine these issues while
    considering a systems perspective. Our objectives were to (i) assess the need
    for basal N application in LCC-based N management in rice and wheat, (ii) establish
    the validity of LCC with chlorophyll meter readings and leaf N status of crop,
    (iii) determine threshold LCC values for different rice and wheat genotypes based
    on agronomic parameters [i.e., yield, agronomic efficiency of N (AEN) and recovery
    efficiency of N (REN)], and (iv) determine economic return of different rice–wheat
    genotype combinations, using LCC and fixed-N split methods for N management. MATERIALS
    AND METHODS Experimental Site A field experiment during two consecutive years
    (2001–2002 and 2002–2003) was conducted on a typic Ustrochrept (Sobhapur sandy
    loam) soil of the research farm of the Project Directorate for Cropping Systems
    Research, Modipuram, Meerut (29°4′N, 77°46′E; 237 m above mean sea level), in
    western Uttar Pradesh, representing Transect 3 (the Upper Gangetic Plains) of
    the Indo-Gangetic Plains Region. This is an intensively cultivated transect with
    150% cropping intensity. The climate of Meerut is semiarid subtropical, with dry,
    hot summers and cold winters. The average annual rainfall is 810 mm, 75% of which
    is received during July–September. Mean maximum and minimum temperatures were
    34.0 and 24.1°C during rice cropping (July to Oct.) and 26.9 and 10.1°C during
    the wheat (Nov. to Apr.) season. The soil of the experimental sites derived from
    Gangetic alluvium is well drained, slightly alkaline in reaction (pH 8.2), and
    sandy loam in texture (160 g clay kg−1, 190 g silt kg−1, and 630 g sand kg−1).
    The organic C, Olsen P and available K, and diphenyl triamine penta acetic acid
    (DTPA) extractable Zn were 5.4 g kg−1, 10.6 mg kg−1, 0.19 C mol kg−1, and 0.60
    mg kg−1, respectively. Experimental Design and Treatments The experiment was laid
    out in a split-plot design with rice and wheat grown in sequence. In rice, three
    genotypes, Basmati-370 [traditional, tall, long fine grain, scented, long-duration
    (155–160 d), high-value crop], Saket-4 [inbred, coarse grain, short duration (115–120
    d)], and Hybrid 6111/PHB-71 [improved, high yield potential, coarse grain, medium
    duration (135–140 d)], were grown in main plots with three replications. In wheat,
    cultivars PBW-343 (early sown), HD-2687 (timely sown), and PBW-226 (late sown)
    were grown in the same layout in the plots vacated from Saket-4, the hybrid, and
    Basmati-370, respectively. The five fertilizer N (as urea) management treatments
    assigned to subplots are described in Tables 1 and 2 In rice, the LCC scores of
    ≤ 2, 3, and 4 for Basmati-370 and ≤ 3, 4, and 5 for Saket-4 and Hybrid 6111/PHB-71
    were compared with fixed-time recommended N rates (80, 120, and 150 kg N ha−1
    for Basmati-370, Saket-4, and Hybrid 6111/PHB-71, respectively). In wheat, LCC
    scores of ≤ 3, 4, and 5 were evaluated as critical values for all three cultivars
    and compared with locally recommended N splits (120 kg N ha−1). In the recommended
    N rate treatment, N was applied in three equal splits at transplanting (basal),
    midtillering, and PI in rice and at sowing (basal), crown root initiation stage
    (CRI), and PI in wheat. Both rice and wheat received P and K at the uniform rate
    of 26 and 33 kg ha−1 through single superphosphate and muriate of potash, respectively.
    In addition, 5 kg Zn ha−1 was also applied uniformly as zinc sulfate to each rice
    crop. Table 1. Treatments used in rice under rice–wheat system during 2001–2002

    †† Late sown = sown in the second week of December. Crop Management The land was
    prepared by two crisscross plowings and two harrowings. Land was leveled and puddled
    for rice transplanting on 7 July 2001. Thereafter, 25-d-old seedlings were transplanted
    at 20- by 15-cm spacing in 8- by 6-m subplots on 8 July 2001. After harvest on
    14 Oct. (Saket-4), 30 Oct. (Hybrid-6111), and 21 Nov. 2001 (Basmati-370), the
    individual plots were prepared after irrigation for wheat sowing. The wheat cultivars
    PBW-343 (early sown), HD-2687 (timely sown), and PBW-226 (late sown) were sown
    in rows 20 cm apart in the same layout using 100 kg seed ha−1 on 8 Nov., 26 Nov.,
    and 13 December 2001 in plots vacated from Saket-4, Hybrid-6111, and Basmati-370,
    respectively. These wheat cultivars were harvested on 10, 16, and 20 Apr. 2002,
    respectively. Similarly, during the second year (2002–2003), rice genotypes Saket-4,
    Hybrid-PHB-71, and Basmati-370 were transplanted on 10 July and harvested on 15
    Oct., 2 Nov., and 24 Nov. 2002, respectively. Wheat cultivars PBW-343, HD-2687,
    and PBW-226 were sown on 2 Nov., 22 Nov., and 16 Dec. 2002 and harvested on 8,
    11, and 15 Apr. 2003, respectively. Both crops were grown under assured irrigation.
    For rice cultivation, plots were kept continuously flooded 2 wk after transplanting.
    In addition to rainfall, a total of 9, 9, and 11 irrigations during 2001 and 14,
    15, and 16 irrigations during 2002 were given to rice genotypes Saket-4, Hybrid-6111/PHB-71,
    and Basmati-370, respectively. At each irrigation, 3 to 5 cm of water was applied,
    and the interval between two irrigations depended on the disappearance of water.
    In wheat, the number of irrigations depended on time of sowing (cultivar duration)
    and rainfall events during the growing season. In 2001–2002, early sown wheat
    cultivar PBW-343 received four irrigations at 21, 42, 66, and 112 DAS; timely
    sown HD-2687 received irrigations at 21, 42, 66, and 101 DAS; and late-sown PBW-226
    received only three irrigations at 21, 42, and 81 DAS. In 2002–2003, the early
    sown wheat (PBW-343) received five irrigations at 21, 42, 64, 85, and 111 DAS,
    and four irrigations were applied to both timely sown HD-2687 at 21, 43, 64, and
    101 DAS and late-sown PBW-226 at 21, 40, 76, and 92 DAS. Standard practices were
    followed for insect pest and disease control. At maturity, rice and wheat were
    harvested manually at ground level, and grain and straw yields of both rice and
    wheat were determined from an area of 27 m2 located in the center of each plot.
    The grains were threshed using a plot thresher, dried in a batch grain dryer,
    and weighed. Grain moisture was determined immediately after weighing, and subsamples
    were dried at 70°C for 48 h. Grain yield of rice and wheat were reported at 140
    and 120 g kg−1 moisture content, respectively. Straw weights were expressed on
    an oven dry weight basis. Leaf Color Chart and Chlorophyll Meter Measurement The
    LCC jointly developed by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and
    Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice), consisting of six green shades
    from yellowish green to dark green, was used in this study. In rice, 15 hills
    were selected at random in each plot. From each hill, three readings were taken
    from the uppermost fully expanded leaf. In wheat, 10 disease-free plants were
    chosen in each plot, and the color of the youngest fully expanded leaf was measured.
    The SPAD reading of the same leaf used for LCC measurement was also taken simultaneously
    for calibration of the LCC. In rice, both LCC and SPAD readings were taken at
    10-d intervals, starting from 15 DAT till 50% flowering. In wheat, the LCC and
    SPAD meter readings started at the CRI stage (21 DAS) and ended at 50% flowering.
    In addition, the LCC score and chlorophyll meter reading were also taken at PI.
    Whenever the LCC reading was equal to or below the set critical value, fertilizer
    N was applied at 20 kg N ha−1 for Basmati-370 and 30 kg N ha−1 each for Saket-4
    and Hybrid-6111/PHB-71 in 2001–2002. Since LCC ≤ 5 could not be attained in Year
    1, 45 kg N ha−1 was applied to Saket-4 and Hybrid-PHB-71 during the rapid growth
    period (29 to 49 DAT) in Year 2. In wheat, 30 kg N ha−1 was applied in LCC ≤ 3
    and 4 and 40 kg N ha−1 in LCC ≤ 5 treatments. No basal N was applied in the LCC-based
    treatments on rice or wheat. Potential Yield Simulation Potential yields, i.e.,
    maximum yield of a variety restricted only by the season-specific climatic conditions,
    of rice and wheat grown during the experiment were estimated using CERES-RICE
    3.5 (98.0) (Singh et al., 1998) and CERES-WHEAT 3.5 (98.0) (Ritchie et al., 1998)
    models, respectively. The genetic coefficients for the cultivars in this study
    were estimated from the first year of the field observations by repeated iterations
    until close matches were observed between simulated and observed phenology and
    yield. The performance of the models has been well validated in the rice–wheat
    growing environments of India (Timsina et al., 1998; Pathak et al., 2003). The
    daily weather data (solar radiation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature)
    required for simulation were collected from the meteorological observatory located
    at Modipuram. Plant Sampling Measurements and Analysis Leaf samples of 1-m row
    length were collected for the measurement of leaf area, dry weight, and N content
    at PI and flowering stages. Leaf area was measured by leaf area meter (LI-3100,
    LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). The crop growth rate was determined by harvesting the plant
    aboveground biomass from 1-m row length area at 7, 11, 15, and 20 DAT of rice
    and 8, 11, 15, 21, and 31 DAS of wheat following the method of Leopold and Kriedemann
    (1975) Dry weight was determined after oven drying at 70°C to constant weight.
    Grain and straw samples of rice and wheat collected from each plot were dried
    at 70°C in a hot-air oven. The dried samples were ground in a stainless steel
    Wiley Mill, and N content in leaf, grain, and straw was determined by digesting
    the samples in sulfuric acid (H2SO4) followed by analysis of total N by the Kjeldahl
    method (Bremner and Mulvaney, 1982) using a Kjeltec autoanalyzer. Economic Analysis
    The total cost of cultivation (TCC) of rice and wheat was calculated on the basis
    of different operations performed and materials used for raising the crops, including
    the cost of fertilizer N. The cost of labor for recording LCC readings was calculated
    on actual basis. For each recording date, 2 person days ha−1 were required, and
    depending on crop duration, LCC readings were recorded 5 to 7 times in rice and
    7 to 10 times in wheat. One person day ha−1 was required for supplying the extra
    N split. Thus, on average, 26 to 32 person days were engaged in various LCC treatments.
    The cost of additional fertilizer, if any, was also added to the TCC. The prices
    of important materials used and operations performed were rice seed, US$0.76,
    US$0.23, and US$3.26 kg−1 for Basmati-370, Saket-4, and Hybrid-6111/PHB-71, respectively;
    wheat seed, US$0.45 kg−1; N, US$0.23 kg−1; irrigation, US$4.13 irrigation−1 ha−1;
    labor, US$1.57 person days−1 d−1; plowing/harrowing, US$2.61 ha−1 operation−1;
    puddling, US$9.35 ha−1 operation−1 The current exchange rate is US$1 = Rs46. Gross
    returns (GR) were calculated by multiplying grain yield by grain price: US$0.24
    kg−1 for Basmati-370, US$0.12 kg−1 for both Saket-4 and Hybrid-6111/PHB-71, and
    US$0.14 kg−1 for wheat. Net returns (NR) were calculated as (1) The NR of rice
    genotypes Basmati-370, Saket-4, and Hybrid-6111/PHB-71 were added to the NR of
    wheat cultivars PBW-226, PBW-343, and HD-2687, respectively, to calculate the
    system net return (SNR) as (2) where NRr is the net return from rice and NRw is
    the net return from wheat. The NR of the rice–wheat system was calculated for
    the LCC-based N management at agronomically determined optimum threshold values
    and compared with the fixed split recommended N application. Data Analysis The
    statistical analysis of data consisted of analysis of variance for yield parameters
    of rice and wheat to determine the effects of rice genotypes/wheat cultivars,
    N treatments, and their interactions using IRRISTAT Version 1992 (IRRI, 1992).
    Duncan’s multiple range test (DMRT) was used at the <0.05 level of probability
    to test differences between treatment means. The relationship of LCC score to
    SPAD readings was determined for different rice and wheat genotypes by regression
    analysis using the data at different growth stages and data pooled across growth
    stages, N management options, and years. To test the significance of LCC and SPAD
    regression equation, the confidence limit (95%) was calculated as given by Draper
    and Smith (1986) Correlations between LCC scores and SPAD readings were determined
    by correlation analysis. Calculations Nitrogen Use Efficiency Agronomic efficiency
    of added N (AEN) was calculated (Cassman et al., 1998): (3) Recovery efficiency
    of added N (REN) was calculated (Cassman et al., 1998): (4) RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
    Assessing Need for Basal Nitrogen Application in Rice and Wheat In 2001, total
    N applied with LCC ≤ 3 in Basmati-370 and ≤ 4 for Saket-4 and Hybrid 6111 was
    the same as in fixed-schedule recommended N treatment (Table 1). But grain yield,
    AEN, and REN were higher for LCC-based N treatments than for fixed-schedule N
    application (Table 3) This means that Saket-4 and hybrid PHB71 required 15 kg
    ha−1 more N for LCC-based N management than for fixed-schedule N application during
    2002. In wheat also, the LCC ≤ 4 treatment (120 kg N ha−1without basal) produced
    a higher grain yield and greater AEN and REN than recommended N splits (Tables
    5 and 6). These results indicate that N applied starting at 14 DAT in rice and
    at 21 DAS in wheat based on crop need as determined by the LCC was used more efficiently
    to optimize both grain yield and NUE. Results of this study and published elsewhere
    (Ladha et al., 2000) showed that the current recommendation of fixed-time split
    N applications at specified growth stages is not adequate to synchronize N supply
    with actual crop N demand because of poorly designed N splitting and variations
    in crop N demand and indigenous N supply (INS). Although basal N application (applied
    just before or at planting) is recommended, its need has not been based on the
    early-season INS. The INS is defined as plant N accumulation in grain and straw
    at physiological maturity in zero-N plots, which represents all sources of N (soil,
    organic materials, crop residues, rhizosphere N fixation, irrigation water, rainfall,
    etc.) available to crops during the growing season (Dobermann et al., 2003). The
    INS capacity varies with cropping season, soil, and crop (Dobermann et al., 2002;
    Adhikari et al., 1999; Stalin et al., 1996). The INS capacity in the present study
    (calculated from N omission plots) was 60 ± 3.2, 54 ± 2.2, and 61 ± 2.6 kg N ha−1
    for Basmati-370, Saket-4, and Hybrid 6111/PHB-71 and 44.3 ± 1.8, 45 ± 2.5, and
    35 ± 1.5 kg ha−1 for wheat cultivars PBW-343, HD-2687, and PBW-226, respectively.
    The low INS in wheat could be due to less residual N left after rice harvest and
    low biological activity in the winter season when wheat is grown. Since the leaf
    chlorophyll content is closely related to leaf N concentration, SPAD meter readings
    during the early stage of crop growth should reflect the INS status. The chlorophyll
    meter readings taken at 15 DAT in rice and at 21 DAS in wheat in the LCC ≤ 4 treatment
    (no basal N application), fixed-time recommended N split (40 kg N ha−1 basal),
    and zero-N control plot did not show a significant difference (Fig. 1). The crop
    growth rate up to 15 DAT in rice and up to 21 DAS in wheat also did not exhibit
    a difference between treatments, i.e., with and without basal N application (Fig.
    2). This indicated that basal N application had no effect on early crop growth
    and N absorption by plants and that INS levels of 50 to 60 kg ha−1 for rice and
    35 to 45 kg ha−1 for wheat were adequate to meet the plant’s need of N at early
    stages in these soils. The contribution of N acquired during early vegetative
    growth to grain and total biomass production at maturity is considerably less
    important than the contribution of N uptake after midtillering when crop demand
    is greatest and reproductive growth begins (Cassman et al., 1996; Peng et al.,
    1995a). Further, the LCC- and SPAD-based N management experiments conducted by
    Bijay-Singh et al. (2002) with 20 kg N ha−1 as basal and without basal N application
    showed no difference in grain yield. Rice seedlings need about 7 to 8 d to recover
    from transplanting shock (Meelu and Gupta, 1980), and thus, N uptake within 2
    wk of transplanting is very small (Peng and Cassman, 1998). Likewise, in wheat,
    N uptake at 21 DAS remained very small (3 to 5 kg ha−1). We also found that wheat
    N uptake at 21 DAS in treatments with and without basal N did not differ (data
    not shown), suggesting that N uptake up to 21 DAS was very low and N demand could
    be met from the seed (100 kg ha−1 wheat seed supply 1.6 kg N ha−1) and INS. In
    both 2001 and 2002, the rice grain yields in zero-N control plots were >3 Mg ha−1
    in Saket-4 and Hybrid 6111/PHB-71 and >2.5 Mg ha−1 in Basmati–370 (Tables 3 and
    4), indicating adequate native N supply from soil. This supports the suggestion
    of Balasubramanian et al. (1999) that for high-yielding rice varieties, soils
    producing a grain yield of >3 Mg ha−1 without any fertilizer application may not
    need basal N application. Dobermann et al. (2003) found that about 50% of rice
    soils in their studies had INS > 53 kg ha−1 and required no basal N application
    while only 25% of the soils had INS < 41 and responded to basal N application.
    These results strongly indicate that fertilizer NUE could be increased by using
    the LCC- or SPAD-based N management strategy without any basal N application at
    planting for both rice and wheat crops provided that INS is sufficiently high
    (50–60 kg N ha−1 for rice and 35–45 kg N ha−1 for wheat). The threshold LCC values
    that optimized the yield, AEN, and REN were LCC ≤ 3 for Basmati-370 and LCC ≤
    4 for Saket-4 and Hybrid 6111 during 2001. Table 3. Grain yield, total N uptake,

    Vertical bar indicates the mean standard error (n = 6). Since the issue of basal

    to determine the minimum yield level in zero-N plots above which no basal N is
    required. Calibration of Leaf Color Chart with SPAD Value and Leaf Nitrogen Content
    The LCC and SPAD readings of all the genotypes had a strong positive correlation
    (r = 0.84 to 0.91) in both rice and wheat. The regression analysis showed a significant
    linear relationship between LCC and SPAD value at all growth stages for all cultivars
    of rice and wheat (Fig. 3 and 4). But the coefficients of determination, slopes,
    and intercepts varied among the growth stages within the genotype and between
    the genotypes. In rice, the coefficients of determination at different growth
    stages varied from 0.68 to 0.87, 0.65 to 0.85, and 0.71 to 0.82 for Basmati-370,
    Saket-4, and Hybrid 6111, respectively (Fig. 3). Similarly in wheat, the coefficients
    of determination varied from 0.61 to 0.89 at different growth stages among the
    three cultivars (Fig. 4). In general, the LCC score and SPAD values increased
    with increasing the crop age and LCC threshold value from 3 to 5, but no definite
    trend was noticed in coefficients of determination among the growth stages and
    N management options. When data were pooled across the cultivars and growth stages,
    treatments had no significant effect on the relationship between SPAD and LCC
    score. When data were pooled across N management options, the difference in slopes
    and intercept disappeared. When data were pooled across growth stages and N management
    options, rice cultivars Saket-4 and Hybrid 6111/PHB 71 exhibited similar slopes
    and intercepts while coefficients of determination were comparable in Basmati-370
    and Hybrid 6111/PHB 71 (Fig. 5). In wheat, slope intercept and coefficients in
    PBW-343 were as good as in HD-2687. However, cultivar PBW-226 had different slope
    and intercept and coefficient than PBW-343 and HD-2687. The regression equations
    between LCC scores and SPAD readings for rice and wheat genotypes, combining data
    across growth stages, N management options, and year, are found in Table 7. Figure

    in slope, with different intercept and coefficients, and Saket-4 and Basmati-370
    were alike in intercept with different slopes and coefficients. For wheat, coefficients,
    intercepts, and slopes were similar for all cultivar–planting date combinations.

    IR72 reported by Yang et al. (2003) was SPAD = 11.67 + 7.25LCC, where LCC 3, 4,
    and 5 corresponded to SPAD values of 33, 41, and 48, respectively, which are nearly
    similar to those of our study except for Saket-4, which exhibited higher value
    of SPAD at a specified LCC score. We speculate the greater leaf thickness/specific
    leaf weight (SLW) of Saket-4 could be the reason for getting higher SPAD value
    in Saket-4. In wheat, LCC 4 corresponded to a SPAD value of 41.3, 41.7, and 40
    for PBW-343, HD-2687, PBW-226, respectively. A study conducted by Follett et al.
    (1992) to estimate leaf N content and determine the need for additional fertilizer
    N in dryland winter wheat revealed that grain yield responded with a meter reading
    of less than about 42. Another study conducted by Bijay-Singh et al. (2002) at
    Ludhiana, India, indicated that wheat responded to N application at maximum tillering
    when SPAD values were ≤42. Thus, these results inferred that the LCC could replace
    the SPAD meter for real-time N management in rice and wheat. To establish the
    validity of LCC for assessing leaf N content, the SPAD value, leaf N content on
    dry weight (Ndw), SLW, and Na recorded at PI and flowering stages had significant
    responses to N management options and rice genotypes/wheat cultivars in both 2001
    and 2002 (Tables 8 to 11) In rice, LCC score, SPAD, Ndw, and Na increased with
    increasing the N application rates as per LCC threshold value from 3 to 5, but
    SLW decreased as the N application increased at both PI and flowering stages (Table
    8). Similar findings were reported by Yang et al. (2003) while estimating leaf
    N content using LCC in the Philippines. However, the values reported for Na were
    greater in this study for Saket-4 and hybrid rice than those reported by Yang
    et al. (2003) This could be attributed to higher values of SLW and Ndw recorded
    for these genotypes in the present study than that of ‘IR72’, ‘PSBRc52’, and ‘IR65620’
    used by Yang et al. (2003) Within a growth stage, the SPAD reading, SLW, Ndw,
    and Na were comparable for Saket-4 and hybrid rice. However, these parameters
    were significantly different than those of Basmati-370 rice (Table 9). Growth
    stages had no significant effect on the relationship between Na and LCC score.
    When leaf N concentration was measured on leaf area basis (Na), there was a similar
    linear correlation between SPAD values and Na for all stages of development and
    lines tested (Peng et al., 1995b, 1996). Moreover, the direct relationship of
    LCC score with Na and SPAD across growth stages provides confidence that one value
    can be used as the critical LCC color for the timing of N topdressing with a given
    cultivar (Yang et al., 2003). The estimated Na across growth stages and cropping
    years at LCC scores 3, 4, and 5 in Basmati-370, Saket-4, and Hybrid 6111/PHB-71
    rice were 1.26, 1.89, and 2.36 g m,−2 respectively. Except for Basmati-370, these
    values are higher than the 1.4 g m−2 at SPAD = 35 for IR72 as reported by Peng
    et al. (1996) The differences in leaf thickness are largely responsible for variations
    in the relationship between Ndw and SPAD values in rice (Peng et al., 1993). Since
    Na is equal to the product of Ndw and SLW, the greater leaf thickness in Saket-4
    and hybrid rice as evidenced by higher SLW resulted in greater value of Na compared
    with Basmati-370. Table 8. Mean values of leaf color chart (LCC) score, chlorophyll

    SLW, and Na increased with increasing LCC threshold values for N application (Table
    10). However, at the same LCC score, the SPAD, Ndw, and Na values were higher
    than those of rice. Within a growth stage, the LCC score, SPAD, Ndw, SLW, and
    Na were similar for cultivars PBW-343 (early sown) and HD-2687 (timely sown);
    however, these values were significantly higher than those of late-sown wheat
    cultivar PBW-226 (Table 11). It appears that the vegetative phase in late-sown
    wheat was abridged as the increase in minimum and maximum temperature hastened
    the early flowering. The relationship between LCC score and Na was similar for
    PBW-343 (early sown) and HD-2687 (timely sown) cultivars. However, late-sown wheat
    (PBW-226) had different slope, intercept, and regression coefficient during both
    years. The values of Na at LCC 4 were 2.08, 2.21, and 1.86 g m−2 for cultivars
    PBW-343, HD-2687, and PBW-226, respectively. Since the LCC values are closely
    related to SPAD and Na, LCC can be used directly for diagnosing leaf N status
    and determining the timing of N topdressing for real-time N management in rice
    and wheat. Determination of Threshold Leaf Color Chart Value for Rice and Wheat
    Genotypes Based on Agronomic Parameters Improving the synchronization between
    crop N demand and the available N supply is an important key to improve NUE. Crop
    N requirements are closely related to yield levels, which in turn are sensitive
    to climate, particularly solar radiation and the supply of nutrients and crop
    management practices. A fertilizer N management strategy must therefore be responsive
    to variations in crop N requirements and soil N supply. The LCC strategy, which
    has been calibrated with SPAD, is a simple and efficient way of managing N in
    real time. However, this requires the determination of critical LCC values for
    a group of varieties exhibiting similar plant type and growth duration (e.g.,
    traditional long duration, semidwarf short duration, hybrid, etc.). Once the critical
    values for different varietal groups are determined, they are valid for similar
    groups of varieties grown elsewhere in the tropics. Areas with distinct differences
    in radiation between dry and wet seasons (e.g., Central Luzon, Philippines) may
    require different LCC critical values for dry and wet seasons to optimize N use
    in rice. Critical or threshold LCC values are defined as those that optimize simultaneously
    the grain yield and NUE (AEN and REN). Based on published data (Dobermann et al.,
    2004) and experience, AEN and REN exceeding 20 and 50, respectively, with consistent
    high grain yield are regarded as efficient for rice germplasm. Likewise, AEN of
    20 and REN of 50 for late-sown wheat and AEN of 25 and REN of 60 for early and
    timely sown wheat with high grain yields are regarded as efficient. Using these
    agronomic parameters, the following LCC values were judged to be critical values:
    LCC ≤ 3 for Basmati-370, LCC ≤ 4 for Saket-4, and LCC ≤ 5 for Hybrid PHB-71 for
    rice (Table 3 and 4) and LCC ≤ 4 for all wheat cultivars (Tables 5 and 6). Potential
    Yield The actual yields of both rice and wheat were remarkably similar between
    2 yr (Tables 3 to 6). Excellent soil, crop, and water management followed during
    the experiment must have contributed to this consistency of the data. In addition,
    the analysis of weather parameters showed that the differences between 2 yr were
    not large (except rainfall). On an average, differences at critical growth stages
    (tillering, PI, and flowering) between 2 yr in average minimum temperatures were
    0.7°C in rice and 0.3°C in wheat, and in solar radiation, differences were 33.3
    MJ m−2 in rice and 37.8 MJ m−2 in wheat (Table 12) Maximum temperature during
    maximum tillering in rice was lower in 2001 than that of 2002, but at PI and flowering
    stages, it was reversed, thereby compensating for the differences. Rainfall had
    a large variation in different growth stages, but this is of no significance because
    the experiments were conducted under fully irrigated condition. Relatively smaller
    differences in weather parameters were further reflected in model-simulated climatic
    potential yields of rice and wheat. The potential yields of rice and wheat varieties
    were 6.4, 10.2, and 11.6 Mg ha−1 in Basmati-370, Saket-4, and Hybrid 6111 during
    2001 and 6.5, 9.9, and 11.7 Mg ha−1 in 2002, respectively. In wheat, the potential
    yields for PBW-343, HD-2687, and PBW-226 were 6.4, 7.5, and 4.9 Mg ha−1 and 6.2,
    8.3, and 5.2 Mg ha−1 during 2001–2002 and 2002–2003, respectively. Table 12. Weather

    Economic Analysis The economics of rice–wheat system depends on two parameters,
    namely the relative yield of rice and wheat as determined by N treatments and
    wheat yield as determined by the time of planting of wheat. The rice–wheat combinations
    that provide optimum planting dates for wheat will maximize yield and profit.
    The TCC for rice–wheat system varied from US$569.3 to US$678.7 and US$576.8 to
    US$692.0 during 2001–2002 and 2002–2003, respectively. Of the total system cost,
    rice and wheat crop shared 48 and 52%, respectively. Among the rice cultivar,
    Hybrid 6111 has highest cost of cultivation (US$306) followed by Saket-4 (US$292)
    and then Basmati-370 (US$285). The input costs for growing wheat varied from US$274
    to US$342, depending on cultivar and planting dates. Compared with fixed-time
    split N application, LCC-based N management required US$25.3 to US$58.4 extra
    investments in different LCC treatments. System’s net return varied from US$702
    to US$851 in first year and US$735 to US$886 in second year (Fig. 6). Among the
    three-genotype combinations of rice and wheat evaluated in the rice–wheat cropping
    system, the NR from Basmati-370–late-sown wheat (PBW-226) and hybrid 6111/PHB-71–timely
    sown wheat (HD-2687) combinations were comparable in both 2001–2002 and 2002–2003.
    Saket-4–early sown (PBW-343) combination gave the lowest NR (i.e., US$702 and
    US$735, respectively) in both years. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer Total net
    return ($ ha−1) from different genotype combinations in rice–wheat system as influenced
    by leaf color chart (LCC)-based N management. LSD (P < 0.05) for system (S) =
    20.6 and 16.7, N management (N) = 26.6 and 36.7, and S × N = 52.7 and 43.5. T1
    = LCC 3, 4, and 5 for Basmati-370, Saket 4, and Hybrid 6111/PHB-71 rice, respectively,
    and LCC 4 for wheat; T2 = N applied as per fixed-time recommended split in rice
    and wheat. It is important to note that in both economically superior rice–wheat
    combinations, the profit was dictated by rice. In the Basmati-370–late-sown wheat
    combination, higher returns were due to the premium value of Basmati-370 rice,
    whereas in hybrid rice–timely sown wheat, the high yield of hybrid gave higher
    profit. However, farmers preferred the Basmati-370–late-sown wheat combination
    because of the greater market demand for Basmati-370 rice. In the Basmati-370–late-sown
    wheat combination, the NR was highest when 80 kg N ha−1 (as per LCC ≤ 3) in rice
    and 120 kg N ha−1 (as per LCC ≤ 4) in wheat were applied in both 2001–2002 and
    2002–2003. Compared with the recommended N splits, in which a similar quantity
    of fertilizer N was applied, the LCC treatment combinations (LCC ≤ 3 in Basmati-370
    and LCC ≤ 4 in wheat) gave 20 and 23% higher NR in 2001–2002 and 2002–2003, respectively.
    In Saket-4–early sown wheat (PBW-343) combination, the fertilizer N application
    based on LCC ≤ 4 in rice and wheat was more profitable than any other treatment
    combination. In hybrid rice–timely sown wheat (HD-2687) combination, the N application
    based on LCC ≤ 5 in rice and 4 in wheat gave extra NR of 28 and 31% in 2001–2002
    and 2002–2003, respectively, over recommended N splits. Thus, on the basis of
    system’s net return, the threshold LCC ≤ 4 for both rice and wheat was suitable
    for Saket-4-early sown wheat (PBW-343) and LCC ≤ 5 and 4 for Hybrid 6111/PHB-71
    rice-timely sown wheat (HD-2687) combinations. However, in Basmati-370–late-sown
    wheat (PBW-226) combination, the threshold value, i.e., LCC ≤ 3 in Basmati-370
    and LCC ≤ 4 in wheat, proved superior over any other LCC combination. CONCLUSIONS
    The simultaneous optimization of grain yield and N use in rice and wheat crops
    is possible by matching N supply with crop N demand. In many field situations,
    more than 60% of applied N is lost due in part to the lack of synchrony of plant
    N demand with N supply. Results presented in a 2-yr rice–wheat system study provide
    evidence that current fertilizer N recommendations (fixed-time split N) are not
    adequate for maintaining the high yields and efficient use of N in rice and wheat.
    The LCC-based N management assures high yields consistent with efficient N use
    in both rice and wheat and enhances rice–wheat systems’ total productivity and
    farmer’s profit. The LCC is a simple and easy-to-use tool that can help farmers
    manage N judiciously. Future studies can compare the efficiency, labor use, cost,
    and profit of improved fixed-time spilt N strategies derived from this and other
    studies and the LCC-based real-time N management in rice and wheat. Improved fixed-time
    split N recommendations will work well for homogenous domains, but real-time N

    Get rights and content Abstract Sustainable land management and land use planning
    require reliable information about the spatial distribution of the physical and
    chemical soil properties affecting both landscape processes and services. Although
    many studies have been conducted to identify the spatial patterns of soil property
    distribution on various scales and in various landscapes, only little is known
    about the relationships underlying the spatial distribution of soil properties
    in intensively used, finely structured paddy soil landscapes in the southeastern
    part of China. In order to provide adequate soil information for the modelling
    of landscape processes, such as soil water movement, nutrient leaching, soil erosion
    and plant growth, this study investigates to what extent cheap and readily available
    ancillary information derived from digital elevation models and remote sensing
    data can be used to support soil mapping and to indicate soil characteristics
    on the landscape scale. This article focuses on the spatial prediction of the
    total carbon and nitrogen content and of physical soil properties such as topsoil
    silt, sand and clay content, topsoil depth and plough pan thickness. Correlation
    analyses indicate that, on the one side, the distribution of C, N and silt contents
    is quite closely related to the NDVI of vegetated surfaces and that, on the other
    side, it corresponds significantly to terrain attributes such as relative elevation,
    elevation above nearest drainage channel and topographical wetness index. Geostatistical
    analyses furthermore reflect a moderately structured spatial correlation of these
    soil variables. The combined use of the above mentioned terrain variables and
    the NDVI in a multiple linear regression accounted for 29% (silt) to 41% (total
    C) of the variance of these soil properties. In order to select the best prediction
    method to accurately map soil property distribution, we compared the performance
    of different regionalization techniques, such as multi-linear regression, simple
    kriging, inverse distance to a power, ordinary kriging and regression kriging.
    Except for the prediction of topsoil clay content, in all cases regression kriging
    model “C” performed best. Compared to simple kriging, the spatial prediction was
    improved by up to 14% (total C), 13% (total N) and 10% (silt). Since the autocorrelation
    lengths of these spatially well correlated soil variables range between three
    and five times the soil sampling density, we consider regression kriging model
    “C” to be a suitable method for reducing the soil sampling density. It should
    help to save time and costs when doing soil mapping on the landscape scale, even
    in intensively used paddy soil landscapes. Previous article in issue Next article

    soil mappingSoil property distribution 1. Introduction The declining water quality
    and the increasing water scarcity are major concerns for sustainable land management
    in water-consumptive irrigated rice landscapes (cf. Janssen and Lennartz, 2007,
    Bouman and Tuong, 2001). Thus water saving strategies have to be developed that
    focus on restricting vertical water percolation, solute leaching processes and
    lateral seepage. The establishment of soil and water protection strategies depends
    on knowledge of the spatial distribution of the key factors that control the movement
    of water and solutes and affect the environmental services of landscapes. Although
    this fact is generally known, appropriate data reflecting the spatial patterns
    of subsurface characteristics are lacking in most cases. This is particularly
    true for the spatial distribution and the variability of soil property data, such
    as soil texture, horizon thickness, bulk density, soil organic matter and nutrient
    content on both the field and the landscape scale. To date little is known about
    the spatial distribution of soil physical and chemical properties in intensively
    used paddy rice landscapes (cf. Roel and Plant, 2004, Dobermann et al., 2002,
    Dobermann et al., 1997, Yanai et al., 2001, Chien et al., 1997). While a number
    of articles deal with water movement in terraced paddy and upland rice fields
    (Liu et al., 2005), only little research work has been concerned with the spatial
    distribution of soil properties and hydraulic processes in irrigated rice growing
    areas with respect to the landscape scale (cf. Liu et al., 2004a, Chien et al.,
    1997). However, soil mapping conducted on a narrow sampling net is both time consuming
    and expensive. Thus, it seems appropriate to apply alternative approaches such
    as predictive soil mapping techniques using cheap and readily available ancillary
    data and indicators that reveal a close relationship to specific soil qualities.
    Recently a great number of predictive soil mapping techniques have been developed
    in order to transfer measures from single sampling points to areas with larger
    spatial extent, such as the field or the landscape scales. For more descriptions
    of theory and applications of predicting soil properties see McBratney et al.
    (2003). For descriptions of techniques like CART see Breiman et al. (1984) and
    for their application see Selle et al. (2006). A promising approach for the spatial
    prediction of soil property distribution taking into account secondary information
    that is given at a finer resolution than the sampled soil data is the application
    of geostatistical hybrid methods. For this study we selected a regression kriging
    approach (Hengl et al., 2004, Bishop et al., 2001, Odeh et al., 1995) to predict
    the spatial patterns of soil property distribution by using terrain and remote
    sensing data as secondary information. The effects of topography on the spatial
    distribution of soil properties and hydrological processes have been intensively
    studied by several research teams (cf. Herbst et al., 2006, Iqbal et al., 2005,
    McKenzie and Ryan, 1999, Bell et al., 1995, Moore et al., 1993, Carter and Ciolkosz,
    1991, Odeh et al., 1991, Walker et al., 1968). These studies clearly show that
    topography controls the flow of water, solutes and sediments and thus mainly affects
    catenary soil development (cf. Jenny, 1941) and the formation of typical patterns
    of spatially distributed soil properties and qualities. Moore et al. (1993) found
    significant correlations between terrain attributes calculated from a digital
    terrain model and measured soil attributes. Of the terrain attributes they considered
    as explanatory variables, the inclination of slopes and the wetness index accounted
    for more than half of the variability of the A-horizon thickness, organic matter
    content, pH value, extractable P, sand, silt and clay content. Odeh et al. (1995)
    pointed out that slope, plan curvature, profile curvature and upslope distance
    accounted for much of the soil variation in their study area. Bell et al. (1995)
    identified the wetness index and the depression proximity index as the most suitable
    predictors of A-horizon and carbonate depth. Iqbal et al. (2005) reported that
    the best combination of terrain variables considered in a stepwise multiple linear
    regression explained between 10% and 62% of the variability of measured A-horizon
    soil attributes and up to 56% of the variability of soil water content at different
    pressure heads. Further evidence of the high predictive potential of primary and
    complex terrain attributes used solely or in combination as co-variables to spatially
    predict soil hydraulic properties is given in a recent study by Herbst et al.
    (2006). Although the relationships between topography and soil property distribution
    have been demonstrated in numerous studies, it can be assumed that the prediction
    of individual soil properties based on ancillary terrain attributes not only requires
    a specific combination of different co-variables but also a different combination
    of terrain variables for predicting the spatial distribution of the same soil
    variable in different landscapes. The predictive ability of digital terrain models
    related to the spatial prediction of soil properties is limited in regions of
    low relief. In order to improve the prediction results on different spatial scales,
    a considerable number of studies have been carried out combining terrain variables
    derived from digital elevation models (DEM) and radiometric data from aerial photographs
    or satellite images (cf. Bishop and McBratney, 2001, McBratney et al., 2000, Odeh
    and McBratney, 2000). The additional use of radiometric information can be helpful
    for determining the impact of soil heterogeneity, irrigation and fertilization
    and for indicating site characteristics such as water and fertilizer supply or
    deficiency. One of the most common indicators that reflects crop growth characteristics
    and indirectly points to specific site qualities is the normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) (cf. Yang and Chen, 2004, Rondeaux et al., 1996, Huete
    and Liu, 1994). The NDVI indicates the greenness cover on the land surface and
    reveals a well documented relationship with crop and vegetation productivity (cf.
    Pettorelli et al., 2005, Li et al., 2001). Rao et al. (1993) studied relationships
    between the NDVI and root soil moisture, Lozano-Garcia et al. (1991) reported
    about correlations between NDVI and soil properties. In addition, McKenzie and
    Ryan (1999) combined selected terrain variables and Landsat TM-NDVI to predict
    soil profile depth, total phosphorus and total carbon content. Their model accounted
    for 42%, 78% and 54% of the variance of the samples. Li et al. (2001) found that
    the NDVI amongst red and infrared wavelengths was cross-correlated with soil water
    content, sand, clay and elevation. However, composed or complex indices such as
    NDVI, which generally reflects biomass status, indicates soil-dependent site qualities
    (cf. Sommer et al., 2003). This study hypothesized that the combined use of vegetation
    indices derived from satellite image data and terrain attributes calculated from
    digital elevation models would result in a suitable method of predicting soil
    property distribution even in poorly undulating and terraced terrain. While the
    radiometric information indicates canopy characteristics resulting from the complex
    interactions between soil quality and land management practices, the topographic
    information can be used to explain catenary soil development. We tested to what
    extent the integration of ancillary information into a prediction model can contribute
    to the mapping of soil property distribution in paddy rice landscapes in subtropical
    China. The major objectives of our study were: (i) to identify the spatial dependencies
    between soil properties (sand, silt, clay, soil organic matter, total N content
    and horizon depths), terrain attributes and vegetation indices, (ii) to compare
    different prediction methods such as multi-linear regression, IDW interpolation,
    simple kriging, ordinary kriging and regression kriging models “B” and “C” (cf.
    Odeh et al., 1995) in order to determine the most appropriate approach to spatially
    transfer data from a limited number of sampling points to unsampled locations
    and (iii) to construct soil property maps indicating different site characteristics
    such as soil texture, total C and N contents plant available water capacity, puddled
    layer depth and plough pan thickness. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study site
    The 10-km2-study area is located close to the Ecological Experimental Station
    of Red Soil at Liu Jia Zhan Township in the eastern-central part of Jiangxi Province,
    China (28°15′N, 116°55′E). It is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate
    with an annual mean temperature of 17.8 °C and an annual precipitation sum of
    1706 mm, of which 50% falls from March to July (Zhang and Horn, 2001). The terrain
    is marked by a gently undulating surface with elevations ranging from 20 to 45
    m above sea level and by a mean slope gradient of 5%. The soil parent material
    consists of Cretaceous Red Sandstone, which occurs mainly in the upper parts of
    the catchment, of Quaternary Red Clay covering most of the western and the south-eastern
    section of the catchment and of younger alluvial deposits filling the valley floors.
    Depending on the parent material and slope position, the soil texture varies from
    loamy sand to sandy loam in the inner parts of the catchment and from clayey loam
    to loamy clay at the western and eastern catchment border (Fig. 1). The puddled
    layer depths of the Hydragric Anthrosols that prevail in the lowland area range
    between 10 and 20 cm; the thickness of the plough pan varies from 5 to 12 cm.
    Seventy five to 80% of the arable acreage is used for rice production on irrigated
    fields. The lowland rice (Oriza sativa L.) is grown in two seasons. The first
    season spans the period from May to July, the second from August to October. In
    the upland area peanuts (Arachis hypogea), sesame (Sesamum indicum) and soybeans
    (Glycine max) are commonly grown, sometimes in a rotation with rice. Download

    locations. 2.2. Soil sampling A total of 212 soil samples were obtained from the
    study site in October 2004 and 2005 following a sample strategy that combined
    both grid sampling on a regular 150 m × 150 m grid and catenary sampling (30–50
    m) along a series of toposequences running parallel to the maximum slope gradient
    (Fig. 1). The soil samples were taken with a stainless steel corer to a depth
    of 1 m such that core material from the Ap-horizon (0–15), the puddled layer,
    the plough pan and the subsoil were extracted. Additional horizon depths were
    measured in the field. The soil samples were air-dried and subsequently analyzed
    for grain size distribution (based on seven particle size fractions: clay, coarse,
    medium and fine silt and sand; ISO/CD 11277), soil organic matter, total N (C/N-Analyzer
    EURO EA, Hekatech) and P (DL-extraction, VD LUFA). All sample point locations
    were georeferenced using a GARMIN-76 GPS receiver. To reduce the error related
    to the precision of the GPS, a 20-m buffer around the soil sampling sites was
    additionally generated, expressing the mean values of NDVI and terrain variables
    according to these sites. 2.3. Remote sensing data and applications The remote
    sensing data used in this study were extracted from one SPOT5, one ASTER and two
    Landsat ETM+ satellite images taken on 29 September 2005, 5 October 2001, 12 October
    1999, and 23 September 2000. The land use classification is based on the SPOT
    5 image (spatial resolution 10 m × 10 m) from late September 2005 using an unsupervised
    classification approach with the image analysis software ENVI® 4.1 (RSI, 2003).
    The individual land use classes were converted into regions of interest (ROI)
    in order to delineate the spatial patterns of canopy characteristics for each
    type of land use (e.g. paddy rice fields) by means of the normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI; cf. Huete and Liu, 1994). It is calculated as the reflectance
    ratio from near-infrared (NIR) and red channel (R) of satellite or airborne sensors
    as (1) The NDVI is known to be well related to biophysical crop characteristics,
    such as absorption of photosynthetic active radiation and productivity (Pettorelli
    et al., 2005, Rondeaux et al., 1996). Its values range between −1 and +1. High
    positive values usually indicate the occurrence of dense green vegetation, pointing
    to an appropriate state of water and nutrient supply. Low values express limited
    photosynthetic activity and negative ones correspond to sparse lacking ground
    coverage. For rice crops Yang and Su (1997) determined that the NDVI is sensitive
    to the progression of the vegetation cover. Reliable relationships between the
    spectral reflectance of paddy rice crops and biomass and rice growth were also
    reported by Casanova et al. (1998) and Yang and Chen (2004). Huete and Liu (1994)
    pointed out that the NDVI is extremely sensitive to optical soil properties. Because
    of background and scattering effects shortly after rice transplanting and senescence
    effects during the last period of crop development, Yang and Su (1997) recommended
    that the NDVI not be used in the early and the late phases of plant development.
    In order to reduce the errors due to soil and water spectral reflectance during
    the first stage of crop growth and to changes in plant morphology during the late
    stage, on the one hand, and to minimize the effects of water reflection during
    flooding and irrigation time, on the other, we only considered satellite images
    that are indicative of crop growth conditions 30–40 days before the harvest, when
    green biomass and canopy cover reach a maximum. The NDVI values calculated from
    the four satellite scenes used here were further processed in two ways. (I) The
    NDVI values of all images were clustered in order to delineate areas indicating
    similar crop growing conditions throughout the years by using the Iterative Self-Organizing
    Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) Algorithm (Tou and Gonzalez, 1974). (II) The
    unclassified NDVI values of the satellite images were used for the regression
    analysis to predict the spatial distribution of soil properties. 2.4. Terrain
    analysis The terrain analysis was based on a 20 m × 20 m digital elevation model
    (DEM) derived from a 1:15,000 topographic map. In particular, the following primary
    and secondary terrain attributes were derived from the DEM using the terrain analyzing
    system DiGEM (Conrad, 2002): • Primary terrain attributes: relative elevation
    (Hr), slope (β), profile (vertical) curvature (CV), plan (horizontal) curvature
    (CH). Hr (m) describes the vertical distance between a grid cell and the elevation
    at the outlet of a watershed, β (°) expresses the deviation of a surface from
    a horizontal plane, while CV (m−1) defines the rate of change of the potential
    gradient in the direction of maximum slope and CH (m−1) characterizes the change
    of gradient transverse to this slope (Moore et al., 1993). Negative curvature
    corresponds to a concave surface, positive curvature is related to a convex one.
    Both types of curvature are indicative of the acceleration and deceleration of
    water flows and sediment transports. • Secondary terrain attributes: above channel
    network (HCh), divergence/convergence-index, wetness index, stream power index
    and the length-slope factor of the USLE. These indices have been widely used to
    identify water flow characteristics in landscapes. The attribute HCh describes
    the vertical distance between each cell of a grid and the elevation of the nearest
    drainage channel cell connected with the respective grid cell of a DEM. The divergence/convergence
    index (CDI) indicates the concentration (CDI > 1) or dispersion (CDI < 1) of runoff
    processes. The wetness index is a well studied indicator of soil property and
    soil moisture distribution at different landscape positions (Bell et al., 1995,
    Moore et al., 1993, Beven and Kirkby, 1979). It is defined as: (2) where As is
    the specific catchment area (m2 m−1) and β is the slope angle (°). A rising value
    of is equal to an increase in water surplus and soil moisture. The stream power
    index (Ω) is indicative of the erosive power of overland flow (Moore et al., 1993)
    and expressed as (3) The length-slope factor (LS) of the USLE (Wischmeier and
    Smith, 1978) is suitable for identifying erosion processes. After Moore et al.
    (1993, p. 446), it can be expressed as: (4) where m = 0.6, n = 1.3 and As and
    β are as described above. 2.5. General statistics, geostatistics and regression
    kriging approach Descriptive statistics of soil properties from 212 sampling sites
    were calculated for each variable of the A-horizon (Fig. 2) using the statistical
    software “R” (Venables and Ripley, 2002). In order to identify the relationships
    between terrain attributes, vegetation indices and soil properties, simple linear
    regression, multiple linear regression and Spearman rank order correlation analyses
    were performed (cf. Lark, 2000, McKenzie and Ryan, 1999). The performance of the
    different prediction methods was assessed by using “leave one out” cross-validation
    (Isaaks and Srivastava, 1989). As comparison criteria for prediction quality the
    root mean square error (RMSE) was applied: (5) where n is the number of validation
    points and and να are the predicted and measured values at location α. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Histograms and probability functions of selected
    topsoil properties. Geostatistical analyses were conducted using the spatial package
    of “R/GSTAT” (Pebesma, 2004). To determine the degree of spatial correlation of
    the soil properties under study, experimental semivariograms were calculated from
    the measured data and fitted to a spherical variogram model (Eq. (7)) with nugget
    effect. The semivariance γ(h) is calculated as (cf. Webster and Oliver, 2001):
    (6) where z(xi) and z(xi + h) are experimental measures of the variable z at any
    two points xi and xi + h separated by the vector or lag h, and m(h) is the number
    of paired comparisons at lag h. The spherical function is calculated as (7) where
    γ(h) describes the semivariance at lag h, c0 denotes the nugget semivariance at
    distance “0” and cS is the sill parameter expressing the semivariance caused by
    spatially correlated data. The term c0 + cS marks the sill or total semivariance;
    the distance parameter a describes the correlation range. In order to spatially
    predict a target variable (soil property) from a number of independent co-variables
    we applied a regression kriging (RK) approach. If the correlation between the
    target variable and one or more independent variables is significant, the application
    of geostatistically based hybrid prediction techniques such as regression kriging
    tends to result in a more precise local prediction than ordinary kriging or other
    univariate predictors (Simbahan et al., 2006, McBratney et al., 2000). Regression
    kriging combines both (i) the regression of the target variable (soil property)
    based on ancillary data (e.g. terrain attributes and/or remote sensing data) that
    are used as co-variables, and (ii) the kriging of the regression residuals (Odeh
    et al., 1995). The RK approach is based on the idea that the deterministic component
    of the target variable is explained by a regression model, whereas the residuals
    are assumed to describe the spatially varying but dependent component (Bishop
    et al., 2001). RK model “B” involves both ordinary kriging of the regressed estimates
    of a target variable and ordinary kriging of the regression residuals (ɛ), where
    the summation of both values results in the finally predicted variable Z*. RK
    model “C” also combines simple or multiple regression with ordinary kriging of
    the regression residuals. In contrast to RK model “B”, the regression model here
    is used to predict the target variable to locations on a fine grid, where only
    the (independent) co-variables are determined. In the next step ordinary kriging
    is applied to the regression residuals (ɛ) obtained from all sampling locations
    to spatially predict the distribution of the residuals (ɛ*). Subsequently the
    regressed values of the spatially distributed target variable and the kriged residuals
    (ɛ*) are added to estimate the target variable (Z*): (8) The regression kriging
    in this study was performed using the statistical software R/GSTAT (Pebesma, 2004).
    For more complete descriptions of theory and applications see Odeh et al. (1995),
    McBratney et al., 2003, McBratney et al., 2000 and Hengl et al. (2004). 3. Results
    3.1. Indication of crop growth conditions and soil attributes by means of NDVI
    Fig. 3 shows the distribution of NDVI classes, which reflects the spatial patterns
    of differing rice growing conditions pointing to the respective soil and soil
    hydraulic characteristics. In order to reduce the randomness in NDVI distribution
    due to spatially varying management practices, to varying reflection characteristics
    of the different rice species grown here and to differing meteorological conditions
    in individual years, the NDVIs derived from individual satellite images of a 4-year
    series (1999, 2000, 2001 and 2005) were clustered. The resulting clusters are
    presented in Fig. 3. They are indicative of a short term mean annual distribution
    of crop productivity in a range from “low” (1) to “high” (3). Comparisons between
    oven-dried green biomass and grain yield (g/m2) measured at 50 sampling sites
    and the NDVI calculated from the SPOT 5 satellite scene, taken in October 2005,
    reveal a consistent relationship between these crop parameters and the vegetation
    index. High NVDI values throughout the years can be clearly identified on the
    valley floors of the individual sub-catchments and at the gently inclining slopes
    neighbouring them. Patches with low NDVI are usually related to the upper parts
    of the catchment, especially to the Quaternary Clay and to the hilltops composed
    of Red Sandstone that have only a shallow soil cover. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Spatial patterns of the classified NDVI based on a 4-year series
    of satellite images taken shortly before the harvest (only paddy fields are shown).
    We assume that the spatial distribution of the NDVI strongly depends first on
    the relief, which controls the surplus of water and solutes, and second on the
    structure of the plough pan because of its capability to keep the irrigation water
    on top. Table 1 reveals significant correlations between the NDVI and several
    topographic attributes, such as relative elevation (r = −0.63; **P < 0.01), elevation
    above nearest drainage path (r = −0.57; **P < 0.01) and wetness index (r = 0.46;
    **P < 0.01), which indicate positions with higher water supply and a longer wetness
    period. The NDVI also coincides with the total carbon (r = 0.55; **P < 0.01) and
    nitrogen content (r = 0.52; **P < 0.01) of the puddled topsoil layer. The highest
    Ctot and Ntot contents were found at the lowest relief positions along the valley
    floors, while the contents were low at the steeper slopes and at the sandstone
    hilltops with a lower storage capacity. It seems obvious that (i) the inhibition
    of organic matter decomposition by frequent wet, anaerobic soil conditions at
    the lowland positions (Liu et al., 2004b, Bell et al., 1995), (ii) a reduced hydraulic
    conductivity of the plough pan and (iii) the lateral movement of water, solutes
    and sediments are mainly responsible for the allocation of the spatial patterns
    of A-horizon Ctot and Ntot content found in this study area. All of these components
    are overlaid by the influences of historic and recent land management practices
    that also strongly affect the within-field variability of soil properties and
    productivity (cf. Olk et al., 1996). Janssen and Lennartz (2007) found that the
    infiltration rate in paddy soils strongly depends on the age of a rice field.
    The duration of cultivation affects the plough pan structure (e.g. increasing
    bulk density, clay content and plough pan thickness), such that the infiltration
    rate decreases and vertical water losses are reduced (Wopereis et al., 1994).
    To determine whether the NDVI can also be used to identify structural plough pan
    characteristics we compared the plough pan thickness measured at the different
    sampling sites and the NDVI of the individual satellite scenes. As shown in Table
    1, plough pan thickness (r = −0.25) and A-horizon depths were less significantly
    related to NDVI. This fact points to a high small-scale variability of plough
    pan thickness that could not be explained by using remote sensing data with a
    geometrical resolution of more than 10 m × 10 m. Table 1. Correlations between

    Table 2 summarizes the relationships between soil and terrain attributes using
    the Spearman correlation coefficient. For the wetness index and the stream power
    index a square root transformation was applied to achieve normal distribution.
    Since the catchment is characterized by different geologic conditions that cause
    strongly differing texture compositions in the course of the slopes, on the one
    hand, and prevent a consistent regression-based description of catenary soil development
    on the other, regression and correlation analyses were performed separately for
    samples taken from: (i) the Red Sandstone area and the alluvial valley fills that
    mainly consist of relocated sandstone weathering material and (ii) the Quaternary
    Red clay that covers the upland areas. The different types of parent material
    were differentiated by means of a cluster analysis that considered the measured
    clay, silt and sand contents. Typically, soils developed from red clay showed
    clay contents from 18% to 46% and sand contents between 25% and 50%, while soils
    developed from Red Sandstone and alluvial deposits had clay contents in a range
    from 3% to 27% and sand contents between 44% and 87% (see Fig. 2). Table 2. Relationships

    nitrogen content are significantly related to the terrain attributes “relative
    elevation” (Hr) (r = −0.58 (Ctot), r = −0.57 (Ntot)) and “altitude above nearest
    drainage channel” (HCh) (r = −0.56 (Ctot), r = −0.54 (Ntot)). The negative correlation
    between both substances, relative elevation (Hr) and altitude above nearest drainage
    channel (HCh) and the positive correlation with the topographic wetness index
    (w) indicate that carbon and nitrogen contents tend to be low on the upper catchment
    positions and high at toeslopes and the lower and wetter valley floors of the
    individual sub-catchments (see Section 3.1). Similar results were found by other
    researchers (cf. Iqbal et al., 2005, Mueller and Pierce, 2003, Moore et al., 1993).
    Less narrow but significant correlations were obtained between individual terrain
    attributes and textural soil properties. A-horizon sand content was found to be
    positively correlated with Hr (r = 0.32), and HCh (r = 0.29), while it corresponded
    negatively to (r = −0.25). This fact points to an enrichment of sand particles
    presumably caused by a selective removal of finer particles due to erosion processes
    (Li and Lindström, 2001). The reverse conditions were calculated for the silt
    content (Table 2), indicating a downslope movement of finer particles with surface
    runoff and the surface flow of irrigation water. In contrast to other studies
    (e.g. Iqbal et al., 2005) reporting considerable relationships between topsoil
    clay content and terrain attributes, we did not find any significant dependencies
    between those variables. Other secondary terrain attributes besides the wetness
    index did not contribute to the explanation of the variability of top soil properties.
    The stream power index and the LS factor tend not to be applicable to the conditions
    in terraced rice growing areas with moderate slopes and small structured paddy
    fields. 3.3. Spatial dependences of soil properties in paddy rice landscapes The
    application of geostatistical techniques requires that the measured data exhibit
    a spatial structure. The degree of spatial dependence of a measured variable can
    be quantified with the ratio of nugget (c0) to sill (c0 + cS), expressed as a
    percentage (Trangmar et al., 1985): (9) This ratio reflects the influence of the
    random component that underlies the spatial variability of a specific soil variable
    and can be used as a measure of its spatial dependence (López-Granados et al.,
    2005). According to Cambardella et al. (1994), ratios from 0% to 25% indicate
    a strongly structured (S) spatial dependence. Numbers ranging from 25% to 75%
    point to a moderately structured (M) variability and ratios >75% are indicative
    of a weakly structured (W) spatial correlation coupled with a high degree of unexplained
    variability. Strongly structured dependences are usually caused by intrinsic factors
    (e.g. factors of soil formation), while weak dependences are normally affected
    by extrinsic factors, such as soil management and tillage practices. To directly
    compare the semivariogram parameters and the calculated nugget-sill ratios (NSR)
    for each soil variable, we used a spherical variogram model (see Section 2.5).
    Fig. 4 shows the omnidirectional variograms of selected soil variables. Table
    3 summarizes the variogram parameters and the NSR values for topsoil carbon and
    nitrogen content, clay, silt and sand content, A-horizon depth and plough pan
    thickness. Except for plough pan thickness and topsoil clay content, the other
    studied soil variables revealed a moderately structured variation with nugget-to-sill
    ratios ranging between 33% and 65%. The highest degrees of structured spatial
    dependences were calculated for carbon (NSR: 43%) and nitrogen content (NSR: 46%).
    For these variables autocorrelation lengths (ranges) of about 534–600 m were found,
    corresponding to three to four times the sampling density. Smaller degrees of
    structured dependence were derived for topsoil silt content (NSR: 47%), A-horizon
    depth (NSR: 47%) and sand content (NSR: 65%). Only weak spatial dependences were
    found for the A-horizon clay content (NSR: 75%). Download : Download full-size

    variance reflects the impact of a long history of land use and of recent soil
    management, such as terracing, rearrangement of field borders, the maintenance
    of the bordering bunds by using in-field soil material, varying straw management,
    and differing puddling intensities that overlie the intrinsic variation related
    to natural soil forming processes. These factors are mainly responsible for a
    high degree of small scale variability connected with a larger share of unexplained
    variance due to the spatial distribution of soil properties in paddy landscapes
    (cf. Yanai et al., 2000). The same is true for the plough pan thickness. The high
    nugget variance and the NSR of about 83% (Table 3) indicate that the spatial distribution
    of plough pan depths and topsoil clay contents cannot be sufficiently captured
    by our sampling design, which focuses on the prediction of soil properties on
    the landscape scale and on map scales smaller than 1:10,000. 4. Discussion 4.1.
    Regression models for predicting soil property distribution Stepwise linear regression
    was performed to predict the dependences between soil variables, terrain attributes
    and the NDVI derived for different years. Table 4, Table 5 present the regression
    equations with the best fit. The regression analyses identified the terrain variables
    relative elevation and altitude above channel network (distance to nearest flow
    path) as the best predictors for describing the A-horizon total carbon and nitrogen
    content, where C and N increase with decreasing distance from the usually wet
    valley floors and from irrigation channels (Table 4). These results are in good
    correspondence with large scale studies by Liu et al. (2004a) dealing with the
    spatial variability of organic matter and nutrients in paddy field landscapes.
    They also found higher contents of soil organic matter and total nitrogen in paddy
    fields than in upland fields, indicating reduced mineralization rates in always
    moist or wet lowland areas. Likewise our results are in accordance with Sahrawat
    et al. (2005), who reported that samples from fields under a lowland rice double
    cropping system had greater organic C and total N contents than those from soils
    under rice in rotation with upland crops or under other arable systems. The A-horizon
    carbon and nitrogen contents in the Liu Jia Zhan study area are highly correlated
    (r = 0.95, P < 0.01), resulting in a nearly identical spatial pattern of C and
    N distribution (Fig. 5). Table 4. Multiple linear regression equations relating

    of total C and N contents predicted by means of regression kriging model “C”.
    The multiple regression equations presented in Table 4 explain between 32% and
    35% of the variance of the measured C and N contents. Considering the long history
    of land use in paddy field landscapes, the impact of terracing on naturally developed
    soils and the small scale variability caused by differing land management and
    soil tillage practices on relatively small-sized paddy fields (560 m2 on the average)
    it does not appear to be realistic to achieve a noticeably higher share of explained
    variation of soil property distribution on the landscape scale. As mentioned by
    Liu et al. (2004a), the human impact on paddy field landscapes led to an increase
    in the extrinsic proportion due to the variance of soil property distribution
    and weakened the spatial correlation of the individual soil properties. This might
    be one reason why we obtained only moderate – but significant – correlations between
    these soil properties and the terrain variables selected in this study. Another
    error can be attributed to the resolution of the DEM. Since a DEM with a resolution
    finer than 20 m × 20 m was not available for this study, the representation of
    the terrace structures is limited. Lower, but also significant degrees of determination
    were found for the regression equations relating the A-horizon silt (R2 = 0.25)
    and sand content (R2 = 0.11) to the terrain variables, relative elevation and
    wetness index (Table 4). While the silt content increases with decreasing vertical
    distance from the bottom of the sub-catchments and with an increase in the wetness
    index, the opposite conditions were obtained for the sand content. These results
    were expected, considering that soil erosion and runoff processes cause a selective
    removal of finer particles and an enrichment of coarser soil particles at steeper
    and higher terrain positions, while finer particles are deposited and enriched
    along the footslopes. In contrast to the soil properties described above, no reliable
    relationships were calculated for the A-horizon clay content, A-horizon depth
    and plough pan thickness. Amongst the regressed values of a respective soil variable,
    regression kriging takes the regression residuals into account. They are regarded
    as uncertainties due to regression and measurement errors (Odeh et al., 1995).
    The autocorrelation lengths found for the residuals of the target variables are
    in the same range as those calculated for the individual soil variables themselves
    (cf. Table 3, Table 6). Table 6. Semivariogram parameters of the regression residuals

    of vegetated paddy fields only improves the regression models to a minor extent.
    The integration of the NDVI into a multiple regression equation (Table 5) increases
    the degree of explanation from 3% to 17% for total C, from 3% to 12% for total
    N and from 0% to 16% for silt. For the other soil variables studied here no sufficient
    relationships with the NDVI and terrain attributes were found. Thus the NDVI was
    omitted from the prediction of soil property distribution described in the next
    section. 4.2. Prediction of soil property distribution and prediction performance
    The performance of the prediction methods applied here was assessed by using “leave-one-out
    cross-validation (LOOCV)” (Isaaks and Srivastava, 1989), implemented in R/GSTAT
    (Pebesma, 2004). The LOOC validation technique temporarily removes observation
    data one at a time from the original data set and calculates the value for this
    location from the co-variables and neighbouring data (Herbst et al., 2006). This
    procedure is repeated such that each observation of the sampling set is used as
    validation data. In order to compare the performance of the different methods
    the root mean square error (RMSE), which is commonly used as a measure of accuracy
    of prediction, was selected as comparison criterion. The relative improvement
    (RI) of regression kriging (RK) over the standard interpolation methods (SIM),
    such as simple kriging (SK), ordinary kriging (OK) and inverse distance weighted
    (IDW) and multi linear regression (MLR) is expressed as: (10) Table 7 shows that
    the prediction accuracy can be improved by incorporating ancillary variables into
    prediction, even if the differences between the applied methods are relatively
    small. Except for the topsoil clay content, which neither correlates with terrain
    attributes nor reflects a structure, due to its spatial distribution, the application
    of regression kriging model C resulted in the lowest RMSE for all the other soil
    variables considered here. Compared to simple interpolation methods that only
    use primary variables, the root mean square error is reduced if secondary variables
    are involved in the prediction. The largest relative improvement in prediction
    performance was achieved for topsoil C, N and silt content. In comparison with
    SK or OK, the application of RK-C resulted in a relative improvement of 13.8%
    for total C content, 13.2% for total N and 9.8% for silt content. The prediction
    performance of RK-C however, depends on the relationship between the target (primary)
    variable and the explanatory co-variables. The closer the dependency and the more
    systematically the primary variables vary across the landscape, the more the prediction
    performance of the regression kriging model increases. Since regression kriging
    also takes into account uncertainty due to regression and measurement in the forms
    of the kriged variables, it usually performs better than simple kriging methods
    (Odeh et al., 1995). Only little improvement was achieved by using RK-C to predict
    the spatial distribution of sand contents and topsoil depths, since these variables
    are only loosely related to landform attributes and lack a structured spatial
    correlation. Although the RMSE calculated for plough pan thickness points to a
    considerable improvement in prediction compared to SK (RI: 20.3%), the validity
    of this number seems questionable, since regression analysis and geostatistical
    analyses did not reveal any correlation for this soil variable. It remains unclear
    whether the incorporation of the regression residuals is responsible for the calculated
    improvement over simple kriging or whether the supposed improvement was more likely
    random. Table 7. Cross-validation results of selected prediction methods using

    RMSE: root mean square error; n = 174. a Power = 1. Fig. 5, Fig. 6 show the spatial
    distribution of selected soil properties predicted for the Liu Jia Zhan study
    area. The predictions are based on regression kriging model “C” using terrain
    attributes as secondary variables only (Table 4). The interpretation of the predicted
    maps reveals that the spatial patterns of total C and N content as well as silt
    and sand content correspond tightly to the patterns of classified NDVIs (see Fig.
    3). Sections dominated by classes of high NDVI coincide with locations where the
    largest C and N contents were calculated. Both high NDVI numbers and high contents
    of C and N are indicative of always moist or wet soil conditions, in accordance
    with the processual relationships described above. High C and N contents were
    predicted for the depressional areas along the slopes and for the central parts
    of the catchment close to the groundwater table. Larger C and N contents were
    also calculated for soils outside the inner sections that are characterized by
    increased silt contents (see Fig. 6a) associated with a higher available water
    capacity (see Fig. 6d) and – compared to the rather sandy soils – reduced hydraulic
    conductivity. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Predicted spatial distribution
    of A-horizon silt (a) and sand content (b), topsoil depths (c) and plant available
    water capacity (d). In contrast, sections with the smallest contents of topsoil
    C and N can be clearly related to locations outside the low lying parts of the
    study area, corresponding to the largest percentage of sand (Fig. 6b) and only
    little clay and silt contents. These sites are usually characterized by low NDVI
    classes. We assume that this fact points to a smaller water supply and a higher
    loss of water and fertilizers by the soil due to the reduced plant available water
    capacity and increased hydraulic conductivity of sandy soils (weak silty and loamy
    sand) prevailing at the shoulder areas of the catchment and at the hilltops composed
    of sandstone and sandstone weathering material. 5. Conclusions The results of
    this study show that the incorporation of ancillary terrain variables can distinctly
    improve the prediction of soil properties even in strongly changed landscapes
    such as paddy soil landscapes. This is mainly true for those soil variables indicating
    a higher degree of spatial correlation caused by intrinsic factors of the relief
    and parent material (cf. Sahrawat et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2004a) that control
    the movement and storage of water, sediment and solutes. In to the paddy soil
    landscape studied here, topsoil carbon, nitrogen, silt content and to a lesser
    extent sand content reveal a moderately structured spatial dependence and a significant
    correlation with terrain attributes (relative elevation, elevation above nearest
    drainage path, wetness index). Thus the incorporation of terrain variables into
    a regression kriging model is a suitable method for increasing the accuracy of
    prediction of these soil properties and for identifying soil characteristics that
    are dependent on landform-related processes. Moreover, the present study shows
    that the spatial distribution of total C, N and silt contents corresponds to the
    NDVI (cf. Sahrawat, 2004). The NDVI calculated for this paddy soil area tends
    to be indicative of always moist soil conditions and of locations having the best
    water supply, the highest plant available water contents (Fig. 7) and the highest
    rice yield. Since these site characteristics coincide with increased contents
    of total C and N, the NDVI is assumed to indirectly reflect the spatial patterns
    of C and N distribution in this kind of landscape. The combined use of terrain
    variables and the NDVI explained up to 41% of the variation of the total C content,
    36% of the total N and 29% of the silt content. The comparatively moderate degree
    of explanation points to the strong human impact on paddy rice landscapes. The
    long history of land use and recent land management practices affected the originally
    developed catenary soil sequences and weakened the former relationships between
    terrain characteristics and soil property distribution that can also be assumed
    for paddy rice landscapes (cf. Liu et al., 2004a, Yanai et al., 2000). The increase
    in the extrinsic component due to the intensity of human impact may explain why
    the importance of terrain attributes as explanatory co-variables decreases the
    more the individual soil attributes (such as topsoil depth, plough pan thickness)
    are influenced by spatially strongly varying land use and soil tillage practices
    and the more the land surface is smoothed by terracing. However, as pointed out
    by other researchers (e.g. López-Granados et al., 2005) for other landscapes,
    the results of this study show that even the incorporation of a rather weakly
    correlated co-variable into regression kriging tends to improve soil property
    prediction compared to simple or ordinary kriging. In order to reduce soil sampling
    density and to save the costs involved in intensive soil sampling, regression
    kriging appears to provide an appropriate method for landscape scale soil mapping
    even in paddy rice landscapes with slightly inclining land surfaces. It remains
    to be seen to what extent higher resolution DEMs and spectral data can contribute
    to more precise soil mapping on the landscape and field scales in the future.

    \ Calzadilla2\nGlobal biomass demand is expected to roughly double between 2005\
    \ and 2050. Current\nstudies suggest that agricultural intensiﬁcation through\
    \ optimally managed crops on today’s\ncropland alone is insufﬁcient to satisfy\
    \ future demand. In practice though, improving crop\ngrowth management through\
    \ better technology and knowledge almost inevitably goes along\nwith (1) improving\
    \ farm management with increased cropping intensity and more annual\nharvests\
    \ where feasible and (2) an economically more efﬁcient spatial allocation of crops\n\
    which maximizes farmers’ proﬁt. By explicitly considering these two factors we\
    \ show that,\nwithout expansion of cropland, today’s global biomass potentials\
    \ substantially exceed pre-\nvious estimates and even 2050s’ demands. We attribute\
    \ 39% increase in estimated global\nproduction potentials to increasing cropping\
    \ intensities and 30% to the spatial reallocation of\ncrops to their proﬁt-maximizing\
    \ locations. The additional potentials would make cropland\nexpansion redundant.\

    \ biomass-based products will increase\nover the next decades. In addition to\
    \ ensuring food\nsecurity for a growing and richer world population,\nbio-fuels\
    \ and bio-based materials will increasingly drive future\ndemand1–7. Present studies\
    \ conclude that global agricultural\nproduction of 2005 needs to increase by 70–110\
    \ percentage points\n(pp) to meet demand in 2050 (refs 7,8) before the backdrop\
    \ of\nclimate change. Agro-economic reactions to climate change have\nbeen investigated\
    \ in an integrated modelling intercomparison\nexercise with so far inconclusive\
    \ results9.\nExpanding cropland, more productive plants, efﬁciency gains\nin crop\
    \ and farm management, and land-use change towards an\nallocation of crops to\
    \ locations with optimal environmental\nconditions are options to meet the increasing\
    \ demand1,2,10–12.\nWhile expansion of cropland among other things reduces\nbiodiversity\n\
    and\nreleases\ngreenhouse\ngases,\nsustainable\nagricultural intensiﬁcation1,8,13\
    \ and optimal allocation of crops\non current cropland may be a preferred option\
    \ for meeting the\nfuture demand for biomass-based products. However, the results\n\
    of recent studies14–17,4 which are based on estimates of agro-\necological potential\
    \ biomass production increase (PBPI) raise\ndoubt whether this is sufﬁcient. The\
    \ agro-ecological PBPI\ndescribes the extent (in pp) to which site- and crop-speciﬁc\n\
    potential yield exceeds currently harvested yield under perfect\ncrop management\
    \ conditions18,19 (fertilizer, pest control, sowing,\nharvest (no losses), and\
    \ so on). Yield refers here to the harvested\nfresh marketable biomass, which\
    \ can be biomass of fruits, grains,\nroots or total plants depending on the respective\
    \ crop. We use the\nterm ‘biomass’ in PBPI as the fraction of the total agricultural\
    \ net\nprimary production which is used to satisfy human demands.\nRecent\nstudies\n\
    ﬁnd\nthat\nrealizing\nagro-ecological\nyield\npotentials of current croplands\
    \ creates a global agro-ecological\nPBPI of 55–77 pp (refs 14–16). The studies\
    \ use biophysical\nmodels, ﬁeld trials or maximum farmed yields14–17 and take\
    \ the\nlocal environmental and climate conditions as well as stresses\n(water,\
    \ temperature, radiation, and so on) into account. They use\ncurrent agricultural\
    \ land-use patterns20,21 and statistics of\nharvested area and cropping intensity22\
    \ (number of annual\nharvests).\nAdjustment to an increasing demand for biomass,\
    \ though,\nis not solely conﬁned to locally improved crop management\nand optimal\n\
    use of inputs during crop growth. Instead,\nit includes combinations of economic,\
    \ societal and technological\nreactions1,23. They should be taken into account\
    \ when estimating\nPBPI.\nImproving crop management skills by better qualifying\
    \ and\nequipping farmers is considered to be the main driver for\nrealizing the\
    \ agro-ecological PBPI. We assume that improved\ncrop management skills inevitably\
    \ go along with improved farm\nmanagement skills. Better training of farmers in\
    \ crop manage-\nment also enables them to reduce fallow periods, increase rain-fed\n\
    and irrigation water use efﬁciency to save water for additional\nharvests, select\
    \ the most suitable cultivars, increase cropping\nintensity and reduce harvest,\
    \ storage and transport losses.\nAlthough ﬁrst statistical analyses of changing\
    \ global cropping\nintensities are available and estimate its PBPI to 50 pp (ref.\
    \ 12),\nthe full global potential of multiple harvests has not yet been\nquantitatively\
    \ simulated in the context of analysing PBPI.\nOn top of farm management factors,\
    \ increasing global biomass\ndemand will likely create incentives for farmers\
    \ and farming\norganizations to improve market access, intensify trade, and\n\
    produce more to market conditions. We assume that this will\nresult in new cropping\
    \ patterns on existing cropland by\nreallocating crops to ﬁelds where they can\
    \ be grown more\nproﬁtably. Simulating the spatial reallocation of crops needs\
    \ to\ntake into account how reallocation takes place with respect to\ncrop rotation\
    \ patterns and the risk aversion of farmers in\nchoosing their crop mix. In principle,\
    \ a proﬁt-maximizing\nreallocation increases production potentials by shifting\
    \ high-\nproﬁt crops to high-yielding locations. Rare cases of decreasing\npotentials\
    \ may point to factors which have currently not been\nincluded in the analysis.\n\
    Two factors were identiﬁed, multiple cropping and proﬁt-\nmaximizing reallocation\
    \ of crops on current cropland, which add\nto the global agro-ecological PBPI\
    \ quantiﬁed in existing studies.\nConsequently, the extent to which they potentially\
    \ allow a rise in\nglobal and regional agricultural production merits further\
    \ analysis\nand quantiﬁcation.\nResults\nCoupled biophysical and economic models.\
    \ We explore, for the\nmajor commercial crops and across the Globe, the impact\
    \ of both\npotential cropping intensity and proﬁt-maximizing reallocation\nof\
    \ crops on PBPI by coupling the biophysical, dynamic crop\ngrowth model PROMET\
    \ with the computable general equilibrium\nmodel DART-BIO. We use data from the\
    \ recent past on climate\n(1981–2010), economic conditions (2007), cropland distribution\n\
    and actual yield statistics (around the year 2000). This provides a\nsolid database\
    \ to study and quantify the impact of optimized\ncropping and market-oriented\
    \ crop allocation on PBPI. Despite\nbeing an important further research question,\
    \ the impact of\nclimate change on PBPI is not covered.\nPROMET globally simulates\
    \ the spatially distributed agro-\necological yield potential and potential cropping\
    \ intensities\ngiven local climate and environmental conditions. DART-BIO\nsimulates\
    \ marginal proﬁt functions with respect to land which are\nused to spatially allocate\
    \ crop categories to land. We denote the\nresult of this coupled approach ‘agro-economic\
    \ PBPI’.\nTo attribute the relative shares of PBPI to cropping intensities\nand\
    \ economic factors, we perform a series of global simulations:\n(A) we simulate\
    \ agro-ecological production potentials given\ncurrent cropping intensities and\
    \ cropland as to be able to\ncompare our results with existing studies on agro-ecological\n\
    potentials; (B) we determine the additional potential of cropping\nintensity;\
    \ and (C) we determine the agro-economic production\npotentials of reallocation\
    \ including the factors considered in (B).\nWe choose the 18 globally most important\
    \ agricultural food- and\nenergy-crops (Table 1), which for the economic simulations\
    \ are\ngrouped into 10 economic crop categories (Table 2). Conversion\nand aggregation\
    \ from potential yields to PBPI is carried out for\n23 regions each divided into\

    \ of\nPBPIs in recent studies (blue).\nAlthough yield of perfectly managed crops,\
    \ which represents\nthe yield potential, can in principle be determined under\n\
    laboratory or experimental ﬁeld conditions, it is not possible to\nmeasure yield\
    \ potentials at each location on the globe. Therefore\navailable\nyield\nstatistics\n\
    always\ninclude\nthe\naccumulated\ninﬂuences of imperfect management conditions.\
    \ Consequently,\nit is in the nature of global PBPI, that measurements of actual\n\
    yield cannot be used to validate the skill of a simulation set-up\nlike the one\
    \ used in this study. We therefore compare our\nsimulation results of PBPI with\
    \ the results of existing studies.\nThe ﬁrst three columns in Fig. 1 refer to\
    \ simulation (A) and\nshow global agro-ecological PBPI under today’s climate,\
    \ with\ncurrent spatial crop allocation and with current cropping\nintensities.\
    \ They compare PROMET’s agro-ecological PBPI\n(column 3) with the maximum observed\
    \ yield approach of\nMueller et al.16 (column 1) and the global AEZs (GAEZs)\n\
    approach of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)14,15\n(column 2). All\
    \ three approaches use the same assumptions and\nlevels of disaggregation. We\
    \ use actual cropping intensities22 to\ncalculate agro-ecological potentials with\
    \ PROMET. The resulting\nglobal PROMET-PBPI of 79 pp is similar to that of FAO-GAEZ.\n\
    Both approaches use crop growth models and climate drivers\nfrom global climate\
    \ simulations.\nFigure 2a uses the biophysical simulation results of potential\n\
    agro-ecological yield (t ha \x02 1) of PROMET and FAO-GAEZ for\nall compared crops\
    \ and regions to detail the comparison. We use\nlog–log representation to allow\
    \ detailed representation of small\nand large yields and production. The linear\
    \ correlation (r2 ¼ 0.85,\nmean absolute error (MAE) ¼ 4.66) shows that on the\
    \ regional\nlevel agro-ecological potential yields simulated with PROMET\ncompare\
    \ well with the FAO-GAEZ, even though different models,\nclimate\ninputs\nand\n\
    statistical\nsources\non\nactual\ncropping\nintensities are used. Potential agro-ecological\
    \ production (poten-\ntial yield \x03 harvested area) in Fig. 2b shows a very\
    \ strong\ncorrelation between PROMET and FAO-GAEZ and is aggregated\ntogether\
    \ with actual yield statistics to the global PBPIs shown in\nFig. 1. The good\
    \ agreement of FAO-GAEZ and PROMET on the\nglobal (Fig. 1) and regional (Fig.\
    \ 2) level justiﬁes using PROMET\nto study potential cropping intensities.\nMueller\
    \ et al. estimate the global agro-ecological PBPI to be 58\npp, which is lower\
    \ than FAO-GAEZ and PROMET. They use a\nstatistical approach based on 100 global\
    \ climate regions. The\nlargest measured yield in each climate region is assumed\
    \ to\nrepresent its potential agro-ecological yield. Here, PBPI is\ndetermined\
    \ by comparing the largest measured yield in the\nclimate region of a selected\
    \ location with the actual yield at that\nlocation. Pragmatic in nature, this\
    \ approach tends to under-\nestimate PBPI because the analysis of the potential\
    \ is based on\ntoday’s best practice and does not consider further improvements\n\
    in crop cultivation.\nPBPI increase through multiple cropping. Global potential\n\
    cropping intensities were determined for simulation (B) by cal-\nculating the\
    \ optimum sowing dates and vegetation cycle lengths\nof all considered crops under\
    \ the prevailing climatic and hydro-\nlogical conditions (rainfall pattern and/or\
    \ irrigation). Dates of\nﬁrst, possible second and third sowing are calculated\
    \ for each\ncrop and selected global location by shifting the period of the\n\
    phenological cycle across the growing season(s) and identifying\nthe optimal sowing\
    \ date(s) using a fuzzy-logic approach24.\nColumns 3 and 4 in Fig. 1 show the\
    \ difference between global\nPBPIs using patterns of present22 and potential cropping\n\

    \ the estimate of global PBPI from 79 to 118 pp. This\nincrease amounts to 39\

    \ crops according to\ntheir highest yields (biomass per ha or energy content per\
    \ ha)\nwe determine crop allocation according to production costs,\nmarket prices\
    \ and crop rotation. We simulate with DART-BIO\nthe allocation of crops on current\
    \ cropland to locations\nwhere they yield the highest proﬁt. We take crop rotation\n\
    and risk aversion of farmers into account by allowing a mix\nof crops to be cultivated\
    \ at each location. For a detailed\ndescription of the approach see Methods section\
    \ and Supporting\nInformation. The resulting increase in simulated global PBPI\n\
    from 118 to 148 pp is shown in columns 4 and 5 of Fig. 1.\nIt indicates that not\
    \ all current land-use decisions are optimal\nin terms of proﬁtability and that\
    \ reallocating crops increases\nglobal PBPI.\nGeographic\ndistribution\nof\nPBPI\n\
    increases.\nIncrease\nin\nestimated PBPI is region speciﬁc. By taking a more regional\n\
    perspective, we can identify which regions would gain the most\nfrom moving towards\
    \ land-use decisions that raise cropping\nintensity and/or that consider proﬁt-maximization\
    \ in the alloca-\ntion of crops. Fig. 3 shows the global distribution of the simulated\n\
    PBPIs on today’s cropland21. Brown regions indicate small\npotentials of up to\
    \ 60 pp, yellow-brown regions moderate\npotentials of up to 100 pp, green regions\
    \ large potentials of up to\n500 pp and above. Assuming actual cropping intensities\
    \ (Fig. 3a)\nPBPI is small in Western Europe (for example, 19 pp in France,\n\
    23 pp in Germany and 33 pp in GB), the USA (54 pp) and Japan\n(8 pp). It is moderate\
    \ in China (70 pp) and Eastern Europe\n(86 pp), while it is large in the countries\
    \ of the former Soviet\nUnion (excluding Russia; 131 pp), Brazil (153 pp), India\
    \ (255\npp) and Latin America (247 pp). Sub-Saharan Africa (AFR)\nshows the largest\
    \ average PBPI of 420 pp. Large additional\nincreases in potentials also show\
    \ up in the tropical regions of\nAfrica and Latin America when maximizing cropping\
    \ intensities\nas shown in Fig. 3b. In contrast a moderate additional increase\n\
    occurs in India, Argentina and Brazil and almost no changes\noccur in the extratropical\
    \ regions of Russia, Europe, North\nAmerica and Australia, which are climatically\
    \ restricted to one\nharvest. Figure 3c shows the additional potential of proﬁt-\n\
    maximizing reallocation. The largest increase in PBPI in relation\nto Fig. 3b\
    \ occurs in parts of AFR, India, China and Latin and\nSouth America; again almost\
    \ no change occurs in Western\nEurope and North America. As expected, small agro-economic\n\
    PBPIs coincide with high degrees of commercialization of\nagriculture and vice\
    \ versa.\nRegional crop-speciﬁc increase of PBPI. Increases in estimated\nPBPI\
    \ are also crop speciﬁc. The three graphs in Fig. 4 compare\nregionally aggregated\
    \ PBPIs for four important crops in four\nregions. The graph (a) uses agro-ecological\
    \ PBPI and compare\npotential cropping intensities with actual cropping intensities;\
    \ (b)\ncompares agro-economic with agro-ecologic PBPI (both with\npotential cropping\
    \ intensities) and (c) shows the combined effect\nof factors (a) and (b) with\
    \ agro-ecological PBPI with actual\ncropping intensities. Results for wheat, maize,\
    \ rice and soy were\nchosen because they constitute the economically most important\n\
    crops. The USA, the countries of the former Soviet Union\n(without Russia), AFR\
    \ and Brazil were selected to cover regional\nagricultural production systems\
    \ that differ in commercialization,\nuse of farming technologies, and environmental\
    \ conditions.\nPoints above the identity line represent increased PBPI through\n\
    (a) more harvests per year, (b) the proﬁt-maximizing reallocation\nof crops and\
    \ (c) a combination of both. Points close to an\nabsolute PBPI value of zero represent\
    \ constellations in which the\nactual biomass production is already approaching\
    \ potential\nbiomass production.\nPBPIs in Fig. 4a range from 20 (soy in USA)\
    \ to 650 pp (maize\nin AFR). The position of the USA and Former Soviet Union\n\
    (FSU) crops shows that cropping intensity has little inﬂuence on\nPBPI there.\
    \ These regions do not have the climatic potential for a\nsecond harvest (except\
    \ for rice in the USA). Agro-ecological\nPBPIs under potential cropping intensities\
    \ are high for wheat\nboth in the USA and FSU, whereas maize and soy show relatively\n\
    low PBPIs in both regions. This corresponds to FAO-GAEZ14,15,\nwho found that\
    \ in both regions agro-ecological yield gaps of\nwheat are much larger than those\
    \ of maize. AFR as well as Brazil\nshow considerable potential for increasing\
    \ cropping intensity by\nmaking better use of the available temperature and water.\n\
    Figure 4b compares the agro-ecological and the agro-economic\nPBPI based on potential\
    \ cropping intensities. Again, the USA\nresides close to the identity line which\
    \ means that proﬁts and the\nrelated PBPI hardly increase when crops are reallocated\
    \ to their\nmost proﬁtable locations.\nIn the case of maize and soy in the USA\
    \ our allocation\nprocedure even decreases PBPI. This somewhat counterintuitive\n\
    result can be explained by the difference between our assumption\nof risk-averse\
    \ farmers who choose a diverse crop portfolio and the\nobserved behaviour in some\
    \ regions. Large areas in the USA show\nlittle crop rotation and seem to be more\
    \ exposed to the risk of bad\nharvests. For example, the actual crop mix at location\
    \ 89.9452\x02\nW/ 42.1428\x02 N within AEZ 10 in the USA is 73% maize and 27%\n\

    \ factors such as the\navailability of harvest insurances or speciﬁc risk compensation\n\
    schemes which may reduce the risks of reduced crop rotation and\nact as indirect\
    \ additional income for the farmers. These factors\nare not yet included in DART-BIO.\
    \ They open up another avenue\nof research which looks at the role of risk reduction\
    \ for a more\nintensive and concentrated agriculture. Given our assumption of\n\
    more risk-averse farmers, our estimates represent a lower bound\non PBPI in highly\
    \ commercialized agriculture.\nFigure 4b also shows that in FSU the PBPI of maize\
    \ and soy\nincreases by a factor of 2 and more (green symbols) through\nreallocation\
    \ whereas wheat seems to be already well allocated to\nits most proﬁtable locations.\
    \ The situation in FSU differs from\nthat of the USA indicating a large potential\
    \ PBPI through both a\nmore market-oriented spatial allocation of crops and better\
    \ yields.\nFor AFR and Brazil the situation is similar. PBPI is large at the\n\
    current crop locations. It could be further increased through a\nproﬁt-maximizing\
    \ spatial reallocation. This indicates synergies in\nthese regions between improving\
    \ crop management and improv-\ning farm management.\nFigure 4c shows the combined\
    \ effect of Fig. 4a,b. It does not\nchange PBPI for wheat in the USA, AFR and\
    \ FSU. Nevertheless,\nthe low value of PBPI for wheat in AFR and the USA in relation\n\
    to its PBPI in FSU indicates regional potential in the FSU. In the\ncase of Brazil\
    \ crops can signiﬁcantly increase PBPI by larger\ncropping intensity. All other\
    \ crops and regions in Fig. 4c are\npositioned along a line roughly parallel to\
    \ the identity line,\nrepresenting a PBPI that is B100 pp larger than that of\n\
    conventional agro-ecological estimates. Overall, Fig. 4 provides\nsome details\

    \ the full biomass potential on today’s cropland around the\nworld will decisively\
    \ contribute to meeting the food demand of a\ngrowing and wealthier world population.\
    \ We show that the PBPI\nof current cropland rises from 79 to 148 pp when multiple\n\
    harvests are fully realized given the biophysical conditions and\neconomically\
    \ efﬁcient land-use decisions are included. This\nsuggests that global future\
    \ biomass demand may not serve as a\njustiﬁcation for the expansion of current\
    \ cropland or the\nincreased use of genetically modiﬁed crops with higher yields.\n\
    The strongest effects on PBPI can be found in tropical and\nsubtropical and/or\
    \ less industrialized regions. Increasing cropping\nintensity is an important\
    \ factor in AFR and Latin America.\nSeveral regions in China and South America\
    \ also show increased\nproduction potentials through a reallocation of crops towards\n\
    more proﬁtable locations.\nBy using data from the recent past our study currently\
    \ ignores\nimportant factors affecting future PBPI. Most importantly,\nthe impacts\
    \ of climate change should be studied using ensembles\nof climate model outputs\
    \ that account for the uncertainties\nrelated\nto\nemission\nscenarios\nand\n\
    model\ndifferences25.\nA recent intercomparison of simulations for impacts of\
    \ climate\nchange on yields26,27 demonstrates large uncertainties with a\nmodel-dependent\
    \ range of up to ±50 pp climate change-induced\nyield changes. CO2 fertilization\
    \ effects and achievements in crop\nbreeding seem crucial but are currently not\
    \ well understood.\nRealizing these large global PBPIs is a prerequisite but not\
    \ a\nguarantee for future access to food and food security. It will\nrequire a\
    \ substantial re-evaluation of policies, knowledge transfer\nas well as technological\
    \ and management improvements in the\nagricultural sector. It may also result\
    \ in adverse environmental\n(nutrient leaching, soil degradation, adverse effects\
    \ of pesticides,\nbiodiversity loss, increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,\
    \ and\nso on) and social outcomes. This has also been recognized in\nhigh-level\
    \ assessments such as the IAASTD28. Further studies\nshould therefore concentrate\
    \ on quantifying regional and global\nPBPIs with a focus on sustainable agricultural\
    \ intensiﬁcation.\nHowever, the geographical distribution of PBPI of current\n\
    cropland can be used today to prioritize activities intended to\nincrease biomass\

    \ into forests, pasture, or so\nfar unused areas.\nMethods\nConceptual framework.\
    \ The conceptual framework of our coupled simulation\napproach is shown in Fig.\
    \ 5. We simulate the potential agro-ecological yields of the\nselected crops listed\
    \ in Table 1 at all agriculturally suitable geographical locations\non the globe24.\
    \ Urban areas, International Union for Conservation of Nature\n(IUCN)-protected\
    \ areas, forests, wetlands, rangeland and unirrigated deserts\nare excluded21,29–31.\
    \ We postulate current economic and climate conditions\n(1980–2010), the 2000\
    \ data on cropland20,21 and 2007 economic conditions32.\nWe use the biophysical\
    \ model PROMET33,34 to compute the global distribution\nof potential agro-ecological\
    \ yields. The computable general equilibrium model\nDART-BIO provides the marginal\
    \ proﬁts of cultivating a ton of a crop per\nhectare for each of 23 regions (Supplementary\
    \ Fig. 1) and AEZs (Supplementary\nFig. 2). We combine the results of PROMET and\
    \ DART-BIO to conduct\nproﬁt-maximizing spatial allocation of crops. Crops are\
    \ sequentially allocated to\nthe respective location in a region and AEZ with\
    \ the largest proﬁt until all\ncultivated cropland is allocated. Regional PBPIs\
    \ are determined by comparing, for\neach crop category (Table 2), the potential\
    \ production resulting from potential\ncropping intensities or reallocation with\
    \ current agricultural statistics. In this\nway, regional PBPIs are determined\
    \ from agro-ecological (PROMET) and\nagro-economic (DART-BIO) considerations,\
    \ which include technical, social and\ncultural factors. We denote this ‘agro-economic\
    \ PBPI’. The two components of the\nmodel framework are shortly described below,\
    \ followed by a description of the\ncoupling approach.\nBiophysical crop modelling.\
    \ Potential agro-ecological yields are simulated on\n246,000 randomly chosen representative\
    \ locations on the total agriculturally\nsuitable area of the Globe24 using the\
    \ environmental model PROMET33,34.\nThe sample locations are randomly chosen from\
    \ a 30-arcsec global data set on\nagricultural suitability24 considering soil35,\
    \ topography36, optimal sowing dates24,\npotential cropping intensities24 and\
    \ irrigation31. Each sample location represents\nan average agricultural area\
    \ of B32,000 ha. We assume optimal crop management\nof standard cultivars of 18\
    \ different crops, consisting of optimal nutrient supply,\noptimal sowing and\
    \ harvest dates, no harvest losses due to pests, diseases, and so\non. Crop growth\
    \ is simulated hourly for 30 years of present climate (1981–2010).\nClimate drivers\
    \ are downscaled, bias-corrected and disaggregated from 0.5\x02 to\n30 arcsec\
    \ spatial and from 6 h to hourly temporal resolution from the output of the\n\
    general circulation model ECHAM5 (ref. 37) using daily correction factors derived\n\
    from WorldClim38. This ensures that spatial and temporal temperature and\nprecipitation\
    \ patterns follow the best available high-resolution climatologic data set\nand\
    \ that climate variability throughout the selected period is taken into account.\n\
    PROMET. PROMET is a hydrological land surface process model34,39, which was\n\
    extended by a biophysical dynamic vegetation component to model crop growth\n\
    and potential yield formation33,40. It uses ﬁrst order physical and physiological\n\
    principles to determine net primary production and respiration based on\napproaches\
    \ from Farquhar et al.41 and Ball et al.42, combined with a phenology and\na two-layer\
    \ canopy architecture component43. PROMET has extensively been\napplied and carefully\
    \ validated for yield simulations in the context of precision\nagriculture studies\
    \ on ﬁeld, farm and watershed scale under different climate\nconditions33 by using\
    \ remote sensing data to adjust model parameters to represent\nspatial heterogeneity\
    \ on the ﬁeld scale44. It takes into account the dependency of\nnet primary production\
    \ and phenology on environmental factors including\nmeteorology, CO2 concentration\
    \ for C3 and C4 pathways as well as water and\ntemperature stress. The mass and\
    \ energy balance of the canopy and underlying soil\nsurface are iteratively closed\
    \ for each simulation time step. The canopy and\nphenology component allocates\
    \ assimilates into the different plant organs of the\ncanopy depending on the\
    \ phenological development. Assimilates that are\naccumulated within the fruit\
    \ fraction during the growing period determine the dry\nbiomass available for\
    \ yield formation. PROMET contains parameters, which\nrepresent the sensitivity\
    \ of the crops to environmental conditions (for example,\ntemperature or soil\
    \ suction) or which determine phenological development.\nPROMET uses high-resolution\
    \ (30 arcsec) global geographical data on climate, soil\nthat is derived from\
    \ the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD)35 and\ntopography that is derived\
    \ from the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission)36.\nIn case of irrigation,\
    \ we assume unlimited water availability for the irrigated area\nfraction on today’s\
    \ irrigated areas according to Siebert et al.31\nThe simulation is performed on\
    \ an hourly time step to account for non-linear\nreactions of plant growth to\
    \ environmental factors (mainly light, water,\ntemperature and wind). CO2 concentrations\
    \ in the free atmosphere are globally\nupdated on a monthly basis. Depending on\
    \ the reaction of the considered crop to\nmeteorological and soil-speciﬁc conditions,\
    \ the crop may either die due to water,\nheat or cold stress before being harvested\
    \ or it may not reach maturity. In both\ncases, this results in total yield loss.\
    \ If local conditions allow for a successful harvest,\nthe simulation result is\
    \ the potential agro-ecological yield for the respective\nlocation.\nSowing dates\
    \ and the number of harvests per season are globally determined by\nthe length\
    \ of the growing period that again depends on the seasonal course of both\ntemperature\
    \ and water supply. Optimal sowing dates for rain-fed and irrigated\nconditions\
    \ are derived from Zabel et al.24 From these dates, the potential number\nof sowings\
    \ per year for each crop at each sample location is determined. Depending\non\
    \ the simulated phenological progress, the model decides whether the potential\n\
    number of crop cycles is realized or not. We assume a time gap of 2 weeks between\n\
    harvest and replanting, accounting for technical ﬁeld work, such as ploughing,\n\
    harrowing, and so on. Multiple harvests are accumulated over the year to produce\n\
    the annual potential agro-ecological yield.\nSampling approach. The global land\
    \ surface (excluding Antarctica and\nGreenland) consists of B133 million km2.\
    \ Approximately 40% are currently not\nsuitable for agricultural use24 due to\
    \ ice cover, permafrost, lakes, deserts or urban\narea and are therefore excluded\
    \ from potential yield simulation. The remaining\nB79 million km2 are more or\
    \ less potentially suitable for cultivation of crops24.\nIt seems worthwhile to\
    \ exclude unsuitable land from potential yield simulations in\norder to save computational\
    \ costs. However, a simulation completely covering\n79 million km2 for a 30-year\
    \ period on an hourly base seems computationally\ninefﬁcient. Therefore, we developed\
    \ a spatial sampling strategy to select locations\nfrom the 30-arcsec global data\
    \ set on which to carry out potential yield simulations.\nThe sampling approach\
    \ takes into account the spatial heterogeneity of the global\nclimate, soil and\
    \ terrain conditions as represented by the determined crop\nsuitability24. The\
    \ sampling strategy is based on the hypothesis that yields increase\nwith higher\
    \ suitability.\nOn the suitable area24, a pseudo-random selection of points is\
    \ carried out\nusing an equal distribution random number generator45 to produce\
    \ a set of\nrepresentative sample locations for each region. The number of samples\
    \ necessary\nto represent a region statistically increases with the spatial heterogeneity\
    \ of its crop\nsuitability. The degree of representativeness of the selected samples\
    \ is measured\nwith the two-sided nonparametric Kolmogorov–Smirnov test46 by using\
    \ the crop\nsuitability data set of the reference period 1981–2000 as parent population.\n\
    The number of samples is chosen so that they represent a sample which is\nstatistically\
    \ equivalent to its parent population within the 95% level of signiﬁcance.\nTo\
    \ ﬁnd the minimally required representative number of points we employed\nexploratory\
    \ data analysis by testing between the entire population and the samples\nwith\
    \ increasing sample size, starting at 0.001% of parent population47,48. The\n\
    Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic measure is calculated on the basis of the cumulative\n\
    distribution function of the respective sample and its corresponding parent\n\
    population (Supplementary Fig. 3) for a representative region. Thus, the valid\n\
    number of random samples within an agro-economic region is determined\nby its\
    \ respective crop suitability value distribution.\nThis approach ensures that\
    \ only regions suitable for agriculture are simulated.\nAt global scale, the sampling\
    \ procedure resulted in 246,561 samples for the present\nsuitability conditions.\n\
    Climate data. The 30-year climate data from 1981 to 2010 used in this study are\n\
    outputs from high-resolution T213 runs of the general circulation model ECHAM5\n\
    of the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology. The speciﬁc conﬁguration of\nECHAM5\
    \ was described and extensively validated with re-analysis as well as\nmeasured\
    \ station data37,49,50. The climate data result from a collection of runs,\nwhich\
    \ use the old SRES emission scenarios, which were used in previous IPCC\nAssessment\
    \ Reports instead of the current representative concentration pathways\n(RCPs).\
    \ Since the simulation results we use cover the past no assumptions were\nmade\
    \ on a speciﬁc emission scenario. Instead the simulations are driven with\nobserved\
    \ or reconstructed CO2 and other greenhouse gas concentrations and\nozone, measured\
    \ sea surface temperature and sea ice concentrations, as well as\nradiative forcings\
    \ from observations for the past period from 1981 to 2010 (refs\n37,49,50). The\
    \ 6-hourly data set (temperature, precipitation, direct and diffuse\nshort wave\
    \ radiation, long wave radiation, surface pressure, relative humidity and\nwind\
    \ speed) is temporally interpolated to an hourly time step using cubic splines.\n\
    The data is spatially downscaled from 0.56\x02 to 0.00833\x02 (30 arcsec), based\
    \ on an\napproach by Marke et al.51, using sub-grid terrain information, provided\
    \ by the\nShuttle Radar Topography Mission data set36.\nA bias correction is executed\
    \ during the downscaling procedure for temperature\nand precipitation based on\
    \ daily derived factors from the WorldClim data set38.\nThe climate data is used\

    \ past-climate data sets,\nwhich was carefully validated speciﬁcally for the representation\
    \ of storms in the\ntropical and extratropical regions of the globe49,50. Storms\
    \ deliver rainfall and to\na large extent determine its temporal variability,\
    \ which is crucial for crop and\nyield development.\n2. Validation of the ECHAM5\
    \ results shows that the high spatial resolution of the\ndata set enables a ‘realistic\
    \ description of the El Nin˜o-Southern Oscillation\n(ENSO) and storm tracks both\
    \ in the extratropics and the tropics’49. Even more\nimportantly for the analysis\
    \ of global crop potentials, ‘the model also gives a\ngood description of tropical\
    \ intraseasonal variability’50.\n3. The ECHAM data set is available with a 6-h\
    \ time resolution, which allows to\ntake advantage of PROMET’s dynamic vegetation\
    \ model, which fully considers\nthe non-linearities and stress reactions (for\
    \ example, inhibition through\nmaximum temperature stress) which may occur during\
    \ the course of the day\nand which are hard to parameterize when using daily data.\n\
    Comparison between PROMET and FAO-GAEZ. The PROMET agro-ecological\nmodel results\
    \ are compared with existing global simulations of potential yields. The\ndata\
    \ used for comparison is available in the Supplementary Data 1. Since the\nMueller\
    \ et al.16 data result from a statistical approach, we use the FAO-GAEZ15\npotential\
    \ yield data for comparison that also result from biophysical simulations.\nIt\
    \ is in the nature of a potential yield that it cannot be validated with measurements\n\
    of actual yield. Consequently, a comparison between the PROMET and\nFAO-GAEZ results\
    \ aim at demonstrating that the PROMET model results are\ncomparable to existing\
    \ and generally accepted data, such as from the FAO-GAEZ\nglobal model approach.\
    \ Thus, we statistically analyse and compare the potential\ncrop yields (t ha\
    \ \x02 1) and productions (t) with actual cropping intensities of the two\nmodels.\n\
    Figure 2 shows the correlation between the simulation results of PROMET and\n\
    FAO-GAEZ in a scatter plot with the linear regression line and its 95% conﬁdence\n\
    bounds together with agro-ecological potential yields in t ha \x02 1 and potential\n\
    productions in Mt. It includes the values of all 18 considered crops (Table 1)\
    \ for the\n23 regions (Supplementary Fig. 1). The global aggregation level is\
    \ interpreted as an\nadditional region. Consequently, the population for the statistical\
    \ comparison\nconsists of all crops and regions for which results exist in both\
    \ models. We exclude\nfrom this population 33 samples where the number of locations\
    \ to determine\nagro-ecological yields with PROMET was o40 to ensure a sufﬁcient\
    \ number of\nlocations for robust potential yield estimation. Finally, 207 samples\
    \ remain for the\ncomparison.\nThe slope of the regression line is 0.85 (potential\
    \ yield) and 0.93 (potential\nproduction). Figure 2 includes a number of statistical\
    \ quality and error measures\n(r2, MAE, root mean square error, Nash-Sutcliffe).\
    \ The coefﬁcient of determination\n(r2) is 0.85 for potential yields and 0.98\
    \ for the potential productions, which\nindicates a close linear relationship\
    \ between the model results and a similar range\nof variances.\nSupplementary\
    \ Figure 4 shows the histograms of the potential yields and\npotential productions\
    \ for the PROMET and FAO-GAEZ model results with the\nsame population as before.\
    \ The values of mean, median and standard deviation are\nincluded in Supplementary\
    \ Fig. 4. The mean value of the PROMET potential yield\nis 1.6 t ha \x02 1 higher\
    \ than the FAO-GAEZ mean value, while median is only\n0.04 t ha \x02 1 higher\
    \ and s.d. is slightly higher in the PROMET simulation results for\nboth, potential\
    \ yield and potential production.\nBy using a two-sided Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney\
    \ test, we verify that the\nmedians of the model results are not signiﬁcantly\
    \ different (P40.05) for both,\nthe potential yields and the potential productions.\
    \ Additionally, a two sample\nKolmogorov–Smirnov test between the PROMET and the\
    \ FAO-GAEZ\ndistributions concludes that the samples are from the same population.\
    \ Hence,\nthe distributions are considered equal (P40.05).\nIn summary, the statistical\
    \ analysis shows that the simulated results from both\nmodels highly correlate\
    \ with each other and are signiﬁcantly similar, showing\nsimilar distributions,\
    \ similar means and s.d.’s. Thus, we conclude that the\nPROMET simulation provides\
    \ similar results to existing studies.\nPotential agro-ecological yields. Biophysical\
    \ crop growth models, both empirical\n(like FAO-GAEZ) and mechanistic (like PROMET)\
    \ follow the same strategy\nof simulating crop growth and development. They simulate\
    \ ideal situations\n(no nutrient stress, no pests, ideal seeding dates, and so\
    \ on) based on varying\nenvironmental conditions (temperature, rainfall) and then\
    \ reduce growth by taking\ninto account water, humidity, radiation, heat and cold\
    \ stress. This results in\npotential agro-ecological yields which is not actual\
    \ yield. Other reduction factors\nlike nutrient stress and calamities produced\
    \ by pests or natural disasters (death or\nyield reduction through ﬂoods, droughts,\
    \ hail, and so on) as well as suboptimal\nchoices of crops or cultivars, seeding\
    \ and harvest dates, as well as harvest-,\ntransportation- and storage-losses\
    \ are not taken into account.\nThe actual yield in the statistical data is the\
    \ result of the potential\nagro-ecological yield and (non-ideal) yield reducing\
    \ crop- and farm-management\npractices, which mainly consist of (in-) adequate\
    \ fertilization and pest control as\nwell as the other factors mentioned above.\
    \ They result from individual capabilities\nand decisions of farmers and extension\
    \ services and have a strongly non-linear\neffect on yield. Consequently this\
    \ detailed data on crop- and farm-management\nwould have to be included in the\
    \ simulations. However, such data does not globally\nexist. Therefore no study\
    \ is known to us, which simulates actual yields globally\nbased on considering\
    \ directly yield reductions resulting from actual crop- and\nfarm-management practices.\n\
    A common way to reproduce actual yield with biophysical crop models on the\nglobal\
    \ and regional scale is to use empirical factors to calibrate their potential\
    \ yields\non a regional basis using yield statistics52,53. The empirical factors\
    \ have the nature\nof yield gaps. For regional studies these calibration factors\
    \ indirectly try to consider\nall reducing management deﬁciencies. Following this\
    \ route of calibration would be\neasy with PROMET. We do not, because using yield-gap-like\
    \ factors to calibrate\nPROMET would mean a circular argument in the case of our\
    \ study.\nWe showed in a recent study that PROMET is able to simulate current\
    \ yield\naccurately when assimilating actual crop growth information derived from\
    \ remote\nsensing data33. We are convinced that this is a promising way forward\
    \ in the future\nand are presently working actively on assimilating remote sensing-derived\
    \ crop\ngrowth information to PROMET for different agricultural systems to also\
    \ be able to\nproduce actual yields through a combination of simulations and observations.\n\
    Economic model. We use the computable general equilibrium model DART54\nto simulate\
    \ market prices and marginal proﬁts. DART is a multi-sectoral,\nmulti-regional,\
    \ inter-temporal, computable general equilibrium model for the\nworld economy.\
    \ Regional disparities of global economy are represented in DART\nthrough 23 geographical\
    \ regions (Supplementary Fig. 1). Each of the regions is\nfurther disaggregated\
    \ into 18 AEZs55 (Supplementary Fig. 2).\nDART-BIO. The particular version of\
    \ DART used here (DART-BIO56) is\ndisaggregated with respect to the agricultural\
    \ sector. It contains especially detailed\nfeatures concerning the agricultural\
    \ sectors. A total of 31 activities in agriculture\n(thereof ten crop sectors)\
    \ are explicitly modelled which represent a realistic picture\nof the complex\
    \ value chains in agriculture. Agricultural production takes into\naccount the\
    \ joint uses of crops for food, feed and bio-energy purposes. It also takes\n\
    into account the joint production of different commodities within one crop\n(for\
    \ example, oil and cake for soy or rape or corn and dried distiller grains with\n\
    solubles for different grains). Each region is modelled as a competitive economy\n\
    that trades with all other regions with ﬂexible prices and market clearing. A\
    \ global\nequilibrium is reached by simultaneously matching the demand and supply\
    \ for all\ngoods, domestic and foreign, on all markets given by the external determinants,\n\
    such as population, capital endowments, technologies, tax and trade policies or\n\
    other policy measures (for example, subsidies, climate or renewable energy\npolicies).\
    \ DART-BIO determines the proﬁtability of different agricultural activities\n\
    in each AEZ of each region as a function of the area used for each agricultural\n\
    commodity (marginal proﬁt function). Marginal proﬁts of the ﬁrst allocated\nhectare\
    \ of a crop, as determined by DART-BIO, depend on the technological, social\n\
    and cultural conditions in each AEZ and region as well as on crop prices. Marginal\n\
    proﬁts approach zero as the cultivated area of the crop in an AEZ becomes\nallocated.\
    \ DART-BIO also provides the acreage of crops, the regional supply and\ndemand\
    \ for all crops, as well as the interaction through trade on the world market\n\
    under current or under scenario conditions. It can therefore be used to assess\
    \ the\neconomic impact of, for example, an increasing demand for biomass, yield\n\
    improvements, or changes in global market conditions.\nDART-BIO is based on microeconomic\
    \ theory: in each of the regions, the\neconomy is modelled as a competitive economy\
    \ with ﬂexible prices and market\nclearing. Agents represented in the model are\
    \ consumers who maximize utility,\nproducers who maximize proﬁts and regional\
    \ governments setting policy\nparameters such as taxes or tariffs. All industry\
    \ sectors operate at constant returns\nto scale. Output is produced by the combination\
    \ of energy, non-energy\nintermediate inputs and the primary factors of labour\
    \ and capital. In addition, the\nagricultural sectors use land as an essential\
    \ input. Producer goods are consumed by\nthe representative household in each\
    \ region, by governments, the investment\nsector, by other sectors as intermediates\
    \ and the export sector. The representative\nhousehold receives income from the\
    \ provision of primary factors (capital, labour\nand land) to the production process.\
    \ Consumers save a ﬁxed share of income in\neach time period which is invested\
    \ in producing investment goods, thus increasing\nthe capital stock of the economy.\
    \ The government provides a public good ﬁnanced\nby tax and tariff revenues. The\
    \ regions are connected via bilateral trade ﬂows,\nwhere domestic and foreign\
    \ goods are imperfect substitutes, distinguished by\ncountry of origin (Armington\
    \ assumption). Factor markets are perfectly\ncompetitive and full employment of\
    \ all factors is assumed. Labour and capital are\nassumed to be homogeneous goods,\
    \ mobile across industries within regions but\ninternationally immobile.\nThe\
    \ primary factor land is used in agriculture and forestry and exogenously\ngiven.\
    \ All 23 regions are subdivided into AEZs which represent different\nproductivity\
    \ characteristics for agriculture based on soil, climate and other natural\nparameters.\
    \ In each AEZ land enters the production of agricultural goods and\nearns the\
    \ same land rent. The development of the economies over time is\nrepresented through\
    \ a recursive-dynamic approach in DART-BIO. DART-BIO\nsolves for a sequence of\
    \ static one-period equilibria for future time periods. The\ntransition from one\
    \ period to the other is governed by (a) capital accumulation,\n(b) changes in\
    \ labour supply and (c) technological change. The regional capital\nARTICLE\n\

    \ matching demand and\nsupply for all goods, domestic and foreign, on all markets\
    \ given the external\nrestriction through tax and trade policies or other policy\
    \ measures such as quota\nof emission trading. A detailed description of DART-BIO\
    \ is available in\nCalcadilla et al.56.\nThus, DART-BIO is able to simulate different\
    \ policy scenarios or the economic\nimpact of climate change on the economics\
    \ of land-use decisions. In both cases the\ninformation provided by PROMET on\
    \ yields are used by DART-BIO.\nMarginal proﬁt functions. From the market equilibrium\
    \ which is derived for each\nAEZ and each crop the marginal proﬁt function can\
    \ be derived for each crop\ncategory (Table 2). The marginal proﬁt functions themselves\
    \ depend on the\nproductivity of the land in relation to other factor inputs for\
    \ the different crop\ncategories. This productivity can be adjusted, for example\
    \ based on information\ndelivered by the PROMET model.\nMarginal proﬁt functions\
    \ determine the proﬁt that can be achieved in a certain\nregion for growing a\
    \ certain crop category on an additional unit of land as a\nfunction of the area\
    \ already allocated to this crop category and given that all other\ninputs are\
    \ at their optimal level. In other words, if a certain area in a region has\n\
    already been allocated to different crop categories, the marginal proﬁt functions\n\
    provide a ranking of the proﬁtability of crop categories that can be grown on\
    \ an\nadditional unit of land. The information of the marginal proﬁt functions\
    \ is used\ntogether with the potential agro-ecological yields, which result from\
    \ PROMET to\ndetermine the spatial allocation of crops to the land by the coupling\
    \ approach.\nDART-BIO provides marginal proﬁt functions for each crop category\
    \ in each AEZ.\nThe derivation of the marginal proﬁt functions is given below.\n\
    To determine marginal proﬁt functions the following procedure is used:\nSuppose\
    \ for an AEZ in a region the distribution of crop categories (i) on the\nagricultural\
    \ area is given by the vector y ¼ (y1,.., yi,..,yn). The production vector y is\n\
    the market solution of allocating agricultural land to the most proﬁtable use\
    \ given a\ncrop price vector p and other factor prices.\nThe DART model has a\
    \ production function for crop categories in the\nfollowing form:\ny¼ min x; v\n\
    ð\nÞ\nð1Þ\nv ¼ \x02v yK\nK\n\x02K\n\x02 \x03r\nþ yL\nL\n\x02L\n\x02 \x03r\n\x04\
    \n\x051\nr\nð2Þ\nwith x representing a vector of intermediate inputs as well as\
    \ primary inputs\nx ¼ (x1,.., xi,..,xm, K, L). The composite primary factor input\
    \ v is produced with the\ncomposite input of the factors capital, labour, energy\
    \ (K) and agricultural land (L).\nThis nested input is modelled through a CES-production\
    \ function shown in\ncalibrated share from Bo¨hringer et al.57 Variables with\
    \ a bar denote benchmark\nvalues. The elasticity of substitution r is deﬁned by\n\
    r ¼ s \x02 1\ns\nð3Þ\nAgricultural land L in a particular region is divided into\
    \ different AEZs, denoted by\na (a ¼ 1,y,24) and is allocated to different crop\
    \ categories, denoted by i (i ¼ AGR,\nC_B, GRON, MZE, OSDN, PDR, PLM, RSD, SOY,\
    \ WHT)\nLet ymi be deﬁned as the benchmark value share of input m ¼ (K, Lai) for\
    \ crop i\nand all AEZs a\nymi ¼\n\x02Lm \x02wm\n\x02v\x02pv\nwith \x02wLai ¼ \x02\
    wL 8a2AEZ\nð4Þ\nwith wm being the factor prices of the respective inputs and pv\
    \ denoting the shadow\nprice of the nested output v.\nIn the benchmark equilibrium\
    \ the following deﬁnitions hold:\nv ¼ \x02v; xm ¼ \x02xm and wm ¼ \x02wm; m ¼\
    \ K; L; p ¼ v ¼ y ¼ 1 ¼ w\nð5Þ\nWithout loss of generality we can ignore the intermediate\
    \ inputs and thus let the\nproﬁt function for a crop category i be deﬁned as\n\
    pi K;Lai\nð\nÞ ¼ piyi \x02 wKKi \x02\nX\na2AEZ\nwLLai\nð6Þ\nThe marginal proﬁt\
    \ function with respect to land (Lai) is given by the ﬁrst\nderivative of (equation\
    \ (6)) with K* representing the optimal K, and L* representing\nthe optimal land\
    \ use of crop category i in all AEZs except for AEZ a. Also\nconsidered is the\
    \ fact that the benchmark case is normalized to pi ¼ wL ¼ yi ¼ 1 and\ntherefore\
    \ the normalized land endowment is equal to the factor share in the\nbenchmark\n\

    \ under consideration.\nThe marginal proﬁt function can be determined numerically\
    \ for every crop\ncategory i by using the factor income shares yai from DART-BIO,\
    \ the normalized\nland use in an AEZ a for crop category i (Lai) and the elasticity\
    \ of substitution r.\nThe marginal proﬁt function has negative slope and goes\
    \ to zero as the land input\napproaches the benchmark land use Lai.\nSupplementary\
    \ Figure 5 illustrates marginal proﬁt functions of different\nagro-economic crop\
    \ categories in an AEZ of a region. To get the marginal proﬁts of\nthe actual\
    \ land areas, the marginal proﬁt functions are scaled to the benchmark\narea that\
    \ is assigned to a particular crop category. These scaled marginal proﬁt\nfunctions\
    \ are used to allocate all crops categories to the sample locations where\nthey\
    \ earn the highest proﬁts relative to other potential locations.\nCoupling PROMETand\
    \ DART-BIO for agro-economic PBPI. A farmer’s land-use\ndecision depends both\
    \ on achievable yields and on the proﬁt s/he makes with each\nton of a crop harvested.\
    \ Current assessments compute PBPI on a sample location\nby taking the crop that\
    \ is currently grown. This assumption is difﬁcult to defend if\none analyses future\
    \ scenarios with different demand conditions. Alternative choices\nfor the allocation\
    \ of crops to sample locations are either the crop with the highest\nphysical\
    \ yield or the crop which offers the highest proﬁtability under given local\n\
    and global demand conditions. We assume that the latter is realized by the farmers.\n\
    We further assume that farmers, to diversify risk and follow crop rotation patterns,\n\
    cultivate more than one crop and that these crops compete for the best land and\n\
    that a crop’s share of cropland at a chosen location is equal to its share of\
    \ total\nmarginal proﬁt at that location. As a result a combination of the most\
    \ proﬁtable\ncrops determines land-use patterns. The total acreage of each crop\
    \ within the\ndifferent regions and AEZs in DART-BIO is known. What is unknown\
    \ is the\nspatial distribution of these crops across the different AEZs and regions\
    \ since\nPROMET determines the yield potentials for each crop on each sample location\n\
    and cannot decide on which crop mix at each location maximizes regional proﬁt.\n\
    For linking the regional crop production as given by DART-BIO to this a priori\n\
    unknown spatial crop distribution in PROMET, an allocation mechanism is\nneeded.\n\
    We use the following approach to allocate crops to land, which is schematised\n\
    in Supplementary Fig. 6.\nCoupling approach. The potential agro-ecological yields,\
    \ which were simulated for\nall investigated crops at all samples do not tell\
    \ which crop mix is best chosen at\neach sample location. The marginal proﬁt functions\
    \ which are available from the\nDART-BIO simulations for each crop category in\
    \ each AEZ are therefore used to\ndetermine the most proﬁtable allocation of crops\
    \ to the sample locations. Results of\npotential yields therefore have to be coupled\
    \ with marginal proﬁts from DART-\nBIO for a proﬁt-maximizing allocation of crop.\
    \ The coupling proceeds in ﬁve steps\nwhich are sequentially repeated for each\
    \ simulated location in each AEZ in each of\nthe 23 regions of the Globe until\
    \ all cultivated acreages have been allocated:\n(1) Marginal proﬁts are largest\
    \ for the ﬁrst cultivated hectare of a crop because the\nproduction is taking\
    \ place at the most suitable location for the considered crop\nwithin the selected\
    \ AEZ and will thus yield the highest return. Marginal proﬁts\ndecrease with the\
    \ area of the crops allocated and approach zero when the\nwhole acreage of the\
    \ particular crop in a region is spatially allocated\n(Supplementary Fig. 6).\
    \ Further extension of crop area would result in negative\nmarginal proﬁts under\
    \ the assumed economic conditions. For each sample\nlocation the speciﬁc marginal\
    \ proﬁt per crop (marginal proﬁt per ton and\nhectare) is multiplied with the\
    \ potential agro-ecological yield to get the\npotential marginal proﬁt per hectare.\n\
    (2) Each sample location holds a mix of crops because, on global average, it\n\
    represents an agricultural area of about 32,000 ha. The total proﬁt per sample\
    \ is\ncomputed by populating it with the harvested crops in areal fractions, which\n\
    correspond to their relative potential marginal proﬁts per hectare (1) and\nmultiplying\
    \ the potential marginal proﬁts per hectare with the their\ncorresponding acreages.\
    \ This procedure applied to all sample locations results\nin a potential marginal\
    \ proﬁt value for each sample location.\n(3) The sample location with the largest\
    \ marginal proﬁt is chosen.\n(4) The already allocated cultivation areas of the\
    \ selected crops in the maximum\nproﬁt sample of (3) are increased by the acreages\
    \ determined in (2). The\nincrease in cultivation area decreases the values of\
    \ the marginal proﬁt functions\nof the selected crops in the following steps.\n\
    (5) The selected sample location is removed from the list of samples and the\n\
    procedure of steps (1–4) is repeated.\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms9946\n\

    \ repeated until all areas of all crops grown as a result of the\neconomic model\
    \ DART-BIO in an AEZ are allocated to the AEZ. At the end, the\ntotal global production\
    \ of each crop is assigned to an area according to the best\nagro-ecological and\
    \ economic conditions.\nUnder the assumption that the selected samples adequately\
    \ represent the\nrespective region, the procedure allocates crops in a way that\
    \ maximizes regional\nproﬁts and results in spatially distributed agro-economic\
    \ potential yields given the\nprevailing economic conditions of the scenario under\
    \ investigation.\nOur approach relies on the assumption that the marginal proﬁt\
    \ functions,\nwhich are either determined with DART-BIO from actual yield statistics\
    \ or from\nscenario simulations with varying economic (demand, regulations, and\
    \ so on) and\nnatural conditions (for example, climate change), are also valid\
    \ for potential yields.\nProcedure for the calculation of PBPI. Potential yield\
    \ is converted to production\n(t) by multiplying yield (t ha \x02 1) with today’s\
    \ harvested area (ha). Production and\narea are then regionally and globally aggregated.\
    \ For the calculation of PBPI,\npotential crop production is aggregated to crop\
    \ categories. The PBPI (pp) of\neach crop category is calculated from the ratio\
    \ of potential production to actual\nproduction. The PBPI across all crop categories\
    \ is computed as an area weighted\naverage.\nThe data from different sources were\
    \ made comparable in a consistent way. The\ncrops’ actual and potential yields\
    \ out of FAO-GAEZ15 and Mueller et al.16 are\nconverted to regional and global\
    \ actual and potential production, by multiplying\nyield (t ha \x02 1) with harvested\
    \ area (ha). We use the respective source of harvested\narea of FAO-GAEZ or Mueller\
    \ et al. Actual and potential production is then\nregionally and globally aggregated\
    \ for each crop and further aggregated to the crop\ncategories.\nFor the calculation,\
    \ we used the Supplementary Data provided by Mueller et al.\nand the data provided\
    \ by the FAO-GAEZ data portal (http://gaez.fao.org). In case\nof FAO-GAEZ, we\
    \ used the ‘potential production capacity for current cultivated\nland for high\
    \ input level rain-fed crops’ and the ‘potential production capacity for\ncurrent\
    \ cultivated land for high input level irrigated crops’ for the baseline period\n\
    1961–1990. The yield of the irrigated areas is taken from the irrigated harvested\n\
    area given by the FAO-GAEZ data portal. Since the FAO-GAEZ yield data are in\n\
    dry weight (kg DW ha \x02 1), we used the conversion factor as suggested by the\
    \ GAEZ\nDocumentation15 for each crop to convert dry weight to fresh weight.\n\
    Potential yields simulated with PROMET are converted to potential production.\n\
    Thereby, we consider today’s harvested areas20 and irrigated areas31. In case\
    \ of\nactual cropping intensities, we multiply the average potential annual yield\
    \ with the\nactual cropping intensity22 for each crop. In case of potential cropping\
    \ intensities,\nwe accumulate potential yields for each crop over the year and\
    \ use physical crop\narea instead of the harvested area for the aggregation of\
    \ yields to production.\nPhysical crop areas are calculated for each crop by dividing\
    \ harvested area20 by\ncropping intensity22. This is necessary, since the harvested\
    \ area depends on the\nnumber of harvests a year and thus already includes cropping\
    \ intensities.\nReferences\n1. Godfray, H. C. J. et al. Food security: the challenge\

    all metrics Abstract Water for agriculture is increasingly becoming scarce, and
    the production of rice will be affected. This necessitates the development of
    innovative techniques that reduce water input and increase water productivity
    (WPI+R) of rice. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation and use of older
    seedlings may help reduce the input water requirement of rice. We evaluated the
    effects of AWD at different threshold levels (irrigation when perched water table
    drops to 15, 25, or 30 cm below soil surface) in comparison with continuous flooding
    (CF) and of rice plant seedling ages (S) on grain yield, water input, and WPI+R
    of lowland rice during the 2010 and 2011 dry seasons. In both years, there was
    no effect of water management and a significant effect of S. 21-day-old seedlings
    gave the highest yields. Water savings using AWD ranged from 42.8 to 53.7 % of
    total water input in comparison with CF, without yield loss, but there was little
    difference in water input among AWD treatments. Due to shorter duration of growth
    in the main field, water input with 30-day-old seedlings was lower than with younger
    seedlings, but with a corresponding yield loss. Total water productivities in
    AWD treatments were higher than those with CF. Among S, 21-day-old seedlings gave
    the highest WPI+R and 30-day-old seedlings gave the lowest. Similar content being

    Strategies in a Semi-arid Region Article 21 March 2024 Introduction Lowland rice
    in Asia is traditionally transplanted into puddled soil and grown under flooded
    conditions wherein abundant water is used. In fact, when irrigation is available,
    the field is ponded with water for at least 80 % of the crop’s duration (Bouman
    et al. 2007). At the farmer field level, rice uses much water two to three times
    more than do other irrigated crops, but an unknown fraction of water losses from
    individual fields is reused by other fields downstream. Assuming a water reuse
    fraction of 25 %, it has been estimated that irrigated rice receives some 34–43
    % of the total world’s irrigation water or 24–30 % of the total world’s freshwater
    withdrawals (Bouman et al. 2007). About 56 % of the world’s 271 million ha of
    irrigated area of all crops is in Asia, and rice accounts 40–46 % of the net irrigated
    area of all crops (Dawe 2005). In the Philippines, some 61 % of the 3.4 million
    ha of rice land is under irrigation, with the majority of the production coming
    from the rice bowl in Central Luzon (International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)
    1997). Water is becoming more scarce due to rapid increase of population, increasing
    urban and industrial demand, decreasing availability due to contamination of water
    resources by point and non-point pollutants (chemicals, salts, and silts), and
    water resource depletion (Rijsberman 2006). Climate change has also brought an
    alarming situation to agricultural sector particularly of increasing scarcity
    of water globally, which threatens irrigated lowland rice production. With declining
    availability of water for agriculture, saving water and increasing rice productivity
    have become major challenges to many rice producers. In situations where water
    is scarce, non-beneficial losses (e.g., seepage, percolation, and evaporation)
    of water in rice fields must be reduced. Several water-saving technologies and
    practices have been developed to help farmers cope with water scarcity in irrigated
    environments. These include saturated soil culture, aerobic rice, and alternate
    wetting and drying (AWD) (Belder et al. 2005; Bouman et al. 2007). These water-saving
    technologies are mostly aimed at reducing unproductive losses of water due to
    seepage, percolation, and evaporation, thereby increasing the productivity of
    total water inputs from rainfall and irrigation. AWD is a technology that has
    been widely tested and promoted in several countries in Asia, especially the Philippines,
    China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. In the Philippines, the technology has been tested
    and promoted since 2001 (Lampayan et al. 2003) and, in 2009, a policy document
    was released to support the wide-scale promotion of AWD in the country (Sibayan
    2011). In AWD, the rice field is intermittently flooded, followed by periods without
    flooding. The number of days that the soil is left dry varies from 1 to more than
    10 days depending on the soil type, crop stage, and weather. The recommended water
    management for “safe” (no yield loss) AWD involves applying irrigation (to depth
    of around 5 cm) when the perched water table falls to 15 cm below the soil surface.
    This can be monitored from a hole in the ground, but, to prevent the hole from
    collapsing, a field water tube is normally installed. The field water tube is
    a perforated tube that can be fabricated with materials such as polyvinyl chloride
    (PVC) pipe, bamboo, plastic water bottles, or even tin cans, with diameter ranging
    from 10 to 20 cm (Fig. 1). The threshold of 15 cm is called “safe” AWD as this
    will not cause any yield decline since the lower parts of the roots of the rice
    plants—generally extending 15–20 deep—will still be able to take up water from
    the (mostly) saturated soil and the perched water in the root zone (Bouman et
    al. 2007). Leaf area expansion is reduced as soon as the soil dries below saturation
    (tensions higher than 1 kPa) in most cultivars, and growth and yield formation
    become affected (Wopereis et al. 1996). The field water tube helps farmers see
    this “hidden” source of water. Safe AWD can be started at 1–2 weeks after transplanting
    is done, and afterward, the only time that field is necessarily kept flooded is
    at flowering to avoid spikelet sterility and resulting yield loss (Bouman et al.
    2007). Fig. 1 Schematic design of a field water tube to implement AWD treatments
    in the W × S experiment, Muñoz, Nueva Ecija, Philippines, 2010 and 2011 DS (modified
    from Bouman et al. 2007) Full size image Several studies have shown that safe
    AWD reduces water input significantly without penalty in grain yield (Cabangon
    et al. 2003; Lampayan et al. 2003; Samoy et al. 2008). Compared to famers practice
    of continuous flooding (CF), safe AWD saves as much as 30 % irrigation water without
    reducing rice yields, and increases farmers’ income by 30 % (Lampayan 2013). Other
    potential benefits of AWD were reduction in lodging problem of rice plants from
    grain filling to maturity stages because of better rooting system, better control
    of some diseases such as golden snail (Bouman et al. 2007), and reduction of methane
    gas emissions (Sander et al. 2012). Flooded rice fields are also anthropogenic
    source of greenhouse (GHG) methane (CH4). Multiple aerations of the paddy fields
    using AWD reduce methane emission by 30–70 % (Sander et al. 2012). Increasing
    the threshold for irrigation to a water table depth of 25 cm and even deeper may
    be possible for AWD; however, whether we can increase the depth without losing
    yield needs to be investigated. More irrigation water can be saved and water productivity
    (WPI+R) further increased by prolonging the periods of dry soil and imposing a
    slight drought stress on the plants, but this may come at the expense of yield
    loss. In the search for other ways to save water, several field experiments were
    also conducted at IRRI and in Central Luzon, Philippines, to test the hypothesis
    that “older” but “stronger” and more vigorous seedlings can reduce crop duration
    in the main field and hence water requirement without compromising rice yield
    (Faronilo et al. 2010). Age of seedlings at transplanting often depended on availability
    of inputs, including water. In lowland rice, farmers often use 25–50-day-old seedlings
    for transplanting (De Datta 1981; Singh and Singh 1999). However, as reviewed
    by Pasuquin et al. (2008), most studies indicated higher grain yields using seedlings
    not older than 25 days. In the Philippines, Pasuquin et al. (2008) found higher
    yield with younger seedlings, with, in some cases, a difference as large as 1
    t ha−1 between 7- and 21-day transplanting. Other studies outside the Philippines
    showed that transplanting younger seedlings (about 8–12 days old) with wide spacing
    and no CF gave higher yield (Uphoff 2000). In contrast, a few others reported
    that the use of 30- and 60-day-old seedlings did not affect yield (Chandra and
    Manna 1988). In the 2007 dry season (DS) at IRRI, Furukawa (2008) indicated that
    transplanting vigorous 31-day-old seedlings grown in well-fertilized wetbed nurseries
    at lower sowing density shortened crop growth duration in the main field and reduced
    water input without any yield decline. Follow-up experiments in 2009 DS and 2010
    DS confirmed that transplanting of old seedlings (31 days) can achieve yield comparable
    with that of 10-day-old seedlings or 20-day-old seedlings, provided that lower
    sowing density (25 g m−2) is used and fertilizer is applied in the seedbed (Faronilo
    et al. 2010). In this paper, we investigated the potential for further reducing
    water input and increasing input WPI+R by increasing the threshold level for AWD
    and increasing seedling age (S) without compromising grain yield. Materials and
    methods Experimental site description An experiment was conducted at the experimental
    farm of the Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice) in Muñoz (15°40′N, 120°53
    E), Nueva Ecija, Philippines, during the 2010 and 2011 DS (December–April). In
    the 2010 DS, the experiment was located in Block 6, Lot 7 of the PhilRice experimental
    farm (site A), which has a historically shallow groundwater table. In the 2011
    DS, the experiment was transferred to Block 15, Lots 3–4 (site B), about 500 m
    away from site A, to validate initial results under deeper water table conditions.
    Both sites have clay soils (44 % clay, 17 % silt, and 39 % sand). The sites have
    been continuously cropped with puddled rice twice a year and are surrounded by
    flooded rice fields during cropping seasons. Average annual rainfall in the area
    is 1,747 mm with distinct dry (December–April) and wet (May–November) seasons.
    The area has an average temperature of 27.4 °C, a relative humidity of 84.4 %,
    and solar radiation of 20.6 MJ m−2 days−1. Treatments and design The experiment
    was laid out in a split-plot design with water regime (W) as the main plot and
    S as the subplot. There were four replicates, and a total of 48 subplots (5 ×
    8 m2) were established in the main field. Four W and three S treatments were tested.
    The W were continuously flooded (CF); AWD at the −15 cm threshold level for irrigation
    (AWD15); AWD at −25 cm (AWD25); and AWD at −30 cm (AWD30). The S treatments involved
    the use of 14-day-old (S14); 21-day-old (S21); and 30-day-old (S30) seedlings.
    The inbred variety PSB RC80 was used in both years. In all water treatments, soil
    was kept saturated for the first 3 weeks after transplanting to promote better
    seedling establishment. Thereafter, water depth was increased to 5 cm; the four
    water treatments were imposed afterward. In CF, 2–5-cm water depth was maintained
    throughout the growing period of rice until 2 weeks before the expected time of
    harvest. In the AWD treatments (AWD15, AWD25, and AWD30), timing of irrigation
    was based on the water depth in the field water tube (Fig. 1) installed in each
    plot. Irrigation time thus varied slightly across replicates. The tubes were installed
    in the field to depths of 15, 25 and 30 cm (to correspond with AWD treatments).
    When there was no visible water in the tube, irrigation was applied until the
    depth above the soil surface reached 5 cm. At around flowering [67–73 days after
    transplanting (DAT)], all AWD treatments were suspended and water depth was maintained
    from 3 to 5 cm depth to reduce the risk of spikelet sterility due to water-deficit
    stress at this sensitive stage. After completion of the flowering stage, AWD was
    applied again until 2 weeks before the expected time of harvest in all water treatments.
    Seeding rate (25 g m−2) and seeding dates in the seedbed were the same for all
    S treatments. Forty-eight (48) small plots with plot size of 1 × 2 m2 were prepared
    and were separated by bunds in the seedbed. Each small plot corresponded to one
    plot in the main field. The seedbed was plowed once and harrowed twice, with the
    last harrowing done 1 day before sowing. Ten bags of organic materials (carbonized
    rice hull, sawdust, and coir dust) were incorporated into the soil during the
    final leveling of the seedbed to facilitate easy pulling of seedlings. Inorganic
    fertilizer was not applied in the seedbed. The main experimental field was prepared
    with one dry plowing using a four-wheel tractor with trailing disk harrow, followed
    by land soaking and two wet harrowing operations. Bunds and canals were constructed
    and plastic linings were installed to 40 cm depth in the side of the bunds to
    reduce seepage losses between the subplots. Seedlings were transplanted according
    to S treatment (14, 21, and 30 days after seeding). The seedlings were carefully
    pulled from the seedbeds, a few seedlings at a time to reduce root damage. Upon
    pulling, the seedlings were immersed in water in plastic trays to avoid water
    stress before transplanting the next day. Seedlings were manually transplanted
    in the experimental field with one seedling per hill at 20 × 20-cm plant spacing.
    Crop management protocols in the main field were all the same. Each season, a
    total of 120 kg ha−1 of nitrogen (N) was applied as urea in three equal splits:
    (1) basal or before transplanting, (2) 21–23 DAT or at mid-tillering, and (3)
    43–50 DAT or at panicle initiation. Phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) were also
    applied as basal fertilizer at 40 kg each ha−1. Complete fertilizer (14-14-14)
    was used as the source of NPK for the basal application. It was incorporated in
    the soil during final harrowing. Pre-emergence herbicide (butachlor) was applied
    7 DAT. Occasional manual weeding was done to keep the plots free from weeds. Measurements
    and calculations A network of pipes was installed in the experiment to facilitate
    easy irrigation application and measurement. Irrigation water applied in each
    plot was measured using a flow meter attached from the pump to the distribution
    pipe. The seasonal water input per treatment from transplanting to harvesting
    was the sum of all irrigation water applied and rainfall. Soil moisture tension
    at 15-cm soil depth was monitored using Jet Fill tensiometers installed in all
    AWD plots. Daily standing water depths (aboveground) and perched water depths
    (below ground) in all AWD plots were also monitored manually by measuring the
    water inside the field water tubes (Fig. 1) with a meter stick. In CF plots, wooden
    stick gages were installed to monitor daily ponded water depths. Daily groundwater
    dynamics were separately monitored in 3-m-long piezometers (made of 1-in-diameter
    PVC pipes with perforations in the bottom 40 cm) installed at two locations (upper
    and lower portions of the main experimental field) during the 2010–2011 DS. Water
    and soil moisture readings were taken at 0800–0900 h each day. Plant samples were
    taken five times (at the time of transplanting, mid-tillering, panicle initiation,
    flowering, and physiological maturity) to determine aboveground biomass and leaf
    area index (LAI) during the season. At each sampling, a total of four (0.16 m2)
    (2010) or six (0.24 m2) (2011) plants were destructively sampled and brought to
    the laboratory for biomass and leaf area measurements. Plants were partitioned
    into green leaf blade, stem plus leaf sheath, dead leaves (if any), and panicle
    (if any). The leaf area of the green leaves was measured using a Licor™ LI3100
    area meter. LAI was determined by dividing total leaf area by area of the sampling
    unit. Biomass was determined after oven-drying of plant samples at 70 °C for 3
    days. Grain yields were determined at maturity by taking 6-m2 plant samples at
    the center of each plot. Grains were separated from the rachis, filled and unfilled
    grains were also separated, and their total weight determined. Grain moisture
    content of the filled grains was measured with a digital moisture tester, and
    grain yield was calculated at 14 % moisture content. Plant samples were also taken
    for the determination of yield components (panicle density, number of spikelets
    per panicle, 1,000-grain weight, and percentage filled spikelets) from 12 hills
    (0.48 m2) adjacent to the harvest area. Total WPI+R was calculated as kg grain
    m−3 total water input (rainfall and the sum of all irrigations, excluding land
    preparation). Weather data, taken from the weather station at PhilRice, included
    daily rainfall, evaporation, temperature, and solar radiation. Seasonal means
    and sums were reported based on the growth duration specified in the treatments.
    Growth duration was measured from transplanting until physiological maturity.
    Data analysis Data analysis was carried out using the balanced analysis of variance
    (ANOVA) and the linear mixed model of CropStat (IRRI 2007) for a split-plot design
    with W as the main factor and S as the subfactor. Mean comparison among treatments
    was based on the least significant difference (LSD) test at the 5 % level of significance.
    Results Weather conditions Table 1 presents the total of rainfall and pan evaporation
    and the average daily minimum and maximum temperatures, solar radiation, and sunshine
    duration during the crop growth period (transplanting-harvesting) for each treatment
    in the 2010 and 2011 DS. No rainfall occurred throughout the growth duration in
    2010, while some rainfall occurred in 2011, particularly in the S14 (50 mm) and
    S21 (38 mm) S treatments. There was rainfall during the first few weeks after
    transplanting (data not shown). Average daily maximum temperature was higher in
    2010 (site A) than that in 2011 (site B). Cumulative pan evaporation in 2010 was
    also higher than in 2011, by about 35 %. In both years, cumulative pan evaporation
    decreased from S14 to S30 due to shorter crop duration (Table 2) in the main field
    as S increased. Average daily solar radiation from transplanting to harvest was
    higher in 2010 (20.5–21.0 MJ m−2) than in 2011 (19.5–20.7 MJ m−2). Average daily
    sunshine duration was also higher in 2010 (9.5–9.9 h) than in 2011 (7.4–8.3 h).

    average groundwater in the 2010 experimental main field was very shallow (Fig.

    average depth of 29 cm (before terminal drainage was imposed). In 2011, average
    groundwater depth (before terminal drainage was imposed) was 150 cm below ground
    surface, with fluctuations from 98 to 178 cm in the season. Fig. 2 Daily groundwater

    image Figure 3 shows the typical daily field water fluctuations (as measured by
    field water tubes) according to W during the 2010 and 2011 seasons. The data used
    in Fig. 3 were from the S14 plots (similar trends were observed in other S treatments).
    Within water treatment, irrigation time varied slightly across the replicates
    as irrigation of each plot was based on the field water tube depth in that plot.
    In both years, imposition of all AWD threshold levels was possible and, as expected,
    there were more AWD cycles (wetting and flooding cycles) in AWD15; they were least
    in AWD30. In CF plots, field water depth usually ranged from 1 to 5 cm. Fig. 3

    Soil water tension dynamics of the AWD treatments was well correlated with field
    water level dynamics, as shown in Fig. 4. When groundwater level became deeper,
    soil water tension at 15 cm increased. In both years, soil water tension increased
    from AWD15 to AWD30. The average soil water tensions in 2010 were higher than
    those in 2011 (more drying events in 2010), but the differences were very small.
    The seasonal average soil water tension at 15 cm in 2010 was 2.0 kPa in AWD15,
    3.4 kPa in AWD25, and 3.0 kPa in AWD30. In 2011, average soil water potential
    was 1.5 kPa in AWD15, 1.9 kPa in AWD25, and 4.7 kPa in AWD30. Fig. 4 Values of

    initiation, FL flowering Full size image Crop growth and development In general,
    LAI increased from tillering to a maximum of 3–4 around flowering, then dropped
    toward maturity. LAI in 2010 was higher than that in 2011 (Fig. 5) probably due
    to higher solar radiation and longer sunshine duration in 2010. In both years,
    there was no significant interaction between W and S treatments on LAI. The LAI
    at all measured crop stages was not significantly affected by W, but it was significantly
    affected by S. Across S treatments in both years, the trends of LAI values at
    different growth stages were consistent: S14 was highest among the treatments
    at mid-tillering, panicle initiation, and flowering, although S14 was not significantly
    different from S21 at flowering in 2010 and at panicle initiation and flowering
    in 2011. Fig. 5 LAI of rice crops exposed to different water and S treatments

    between water and S were also found with the dry biomass. Dry biomass in 2010
    was also higher than in 2011 (Fig. 6). On the average, dry biomass in 2010 increased
    from about 0.4 t ha−1 at mid-tillering, to 11.2 t ha−1 at flowering, and to 16.8
    t ha−1 at physiological maturity. In 2011, dry biomass increased from 0.12 t ha−1
    at mid-tillering, to 9.3 t ha−1 at flowering, and to 12.0 t ha−1 at physiological
    maturity. Aboveground dry biomass was not affected by W but was significantly
    affected by S in each year (Fig. 6). At panicle initiation and flowering in each
    year, there were small but significant differences in biomass. S14 was highest
    in 2010, although no difference was found between S21 and S30. In 2011, S14 and
    S21 were similarly highest and S30 was lowest at panicle initiation and flowering
    stages. Fig. 6 Dry biomass of rice crops exposed to different W and S treatments

    (SE), TP transplanting, MT mid-tillering, PI panicle initiation, FL flowering,
    PM physiological maturity Full size image Growth duration in the main field ranged
    from 90 to 99 days in 2010 and from 88 to 102 days in 2011 (Table 2). Transplanting
    30-day-old seedlings resulted in shorter duration in the main field than transplanting
    14-day-old seedlings, with a difference of up to 9 days in 2010 and 14 days in
    2011. However, late transplanting increased the time from sowing to panicle initiation
    and flowering and reduced the grain-filling period by up to 14 days in 2010 and
    8 days in 2012. The start of flowering stage of S30 was delayed by 11–12 days
    when compared with S21 and S14 in both seasons. Grain yield, yield components,
    and harvest index Grain yields of the respective treatments were higher in 2010
    than in 2011 (Table 3). In both years, there were neither significant W × S interactions
    nor significant effects of W, with respect to grain yield, yield components, and
    harvest index. S treatments significantly affected grain yields, percent filled
    spikelets, and harvest index in both years. However, the other yield components
    (i.e., number of tillers m−2, number of panicles m−2, and 1,000-grain weight)
    were only significantly affected by S in 2010, while number of spikelets m−2 was
    significantly affected in 2011 (Table 3). Grain yield was highest with S21 (albeit
    not significantly different from S14 in 2011), and lowest (P < 0.05) with S30
    in both years. Percent filled spikelets were lower in S30 than S21 in both years,
    but not significantly different from S14 in 2010; S14 and S21 were similar in
    both years. Harvest index of S30 was significantly lower than those of S14 and
    S21 in 2011 and lower than that of S21 in 2010. No significant difference of harvest
    indices of S14 and S21 was found in both years. Table 3 Effect of water regime
    and seedling age on grain yield and yield components of rice Full size table Water
    input and water productivity Total water input was higher in 2010 than in 2011.
    Total water input across water treatments in 2010 (mostly from irrigation) ranged
    from 612 to 1,321 mm in 2010 and from 556 to 1,197 mm in 2011 (Table 4). There
    was no W × S interaction on water input each year. Water input of CF was significantly
    higher than those of all other treatments each year. There was a consistent trend
    of decreasing water input as the depth threshold increased (AWD15 > AWD25 > AWD30),
    but there were no significant differences in either year. There was lower water
    input as S increased, with a significantly lower water input noted in S30 than
    in S14 in 2010. Table 4 Total water input and total WPI+R in Muñoz, Nueva Ecija,
    Philippines, during 2010 and 2011 DS Full size table Total WPI+R across water
    treatments ranged from 0.63 to 1.34 kg m−3 in 2010 and from 0.50 to 0.99 kg m−3
    in 2011 (Table 4). The higher WPI+R in 2010 was due to higher grain yield, which
    more than compensated for the higher water input that year. There was no W × S
    interaction on WPI+R. In both seasons, there were significant effects of W and
    S treatments on WPI+R. There was a consistent trend of observing the lowest WPI+R
    in CF and the highest in AWD25, with some significant differences; AWD25 obtained
    the highest (though not statistically significant) WPI+R than AWD30 in 2010 and
    AWD15 and AWD30 in 2011. The highest WPI+R was consistently seen in S21 each year
    and the lowest in S14, but there was no significant difference between S21 and
    S30 in both years. Discussion The better crop development, the more favorable
    yield components, and the higher grain yields and harvest indices in 2010 compared
    with those in 2011 were largely due to climatic differences between the 2 years.
    Across water and S treatments, grain yields ranged from 7.5 to 8.0 t ha−1 in 2010
    and from 5.0 to 6.0 t ha−1 in 2011. This gave about a 2.4-t ha−1 difference between
    the years. Higher LAI, dry biomass, panicle density, and number of spikelets per
    panicle (by about 8 %) were produced in 2010 than in 2011; percent filled spikelets
    and 1,000-grain weight were similar in both years. Lower average maximum temperatures
    and lower solar radiation and sunshine duration due to cloudy weather in 2011
    may have accounted for these differences. According to Yoshida (1981), growth
    and grain yield are determined largely by temperature and solar radiation with
    all other inputs non-limiting. The slight variations in rainfall amount between
    the 2010 and 2011 experimental periods probably had no effect on crop performance.
    Rainfall occurred in 2011 only during the first few weeks after transplanting
    (particularly in S14), and, during this period, the plants were not yet exposed
    to the water treatments. The differences in groundwater conditions in the two
    sites probably did not contribute to the difference in crop performance as there
    were no W treatment effects, even CF had a 2.1-t ha−1 lower yield. The higher
    total water input in 2010 was probably the result of higher evaporative demand
    in 2010 (Table 1) and despite the shallower water table. Effects of water regime
    AWD was developed and implemented to increase WPI+R and save water for other uses
    (Bouman et al. 2007; Bouman and Tuong 2001; Belder et al. 2004; Tabbal et al.
    2002). The present study confirmed the recommendation by Bouman et al. (2007)
    and findings from Wiangsamut (2010) that implementation of AWD is “safe” (no yield
    penalty but with substantial reduction in water input) if fields are irrigated
    when water level falls to 15–20 cm below the ground surface. In both years, grain
    yield, harvest index, and grain yield components of PSB RC80 with CF and AWD (AWD15,
    AWD25, and AWD30) were similar. Comparable yields were obtained despite higher
    soil moisture tension in the higher threshold AWD treatments. During both years,
    the average peak values of soil moisture tension at 15-cm soil depth were 12–13
    kPa in AWD15, 16–20 kPa in AWD25, and 21–25 kPa in AWD30. The higher average peak
    values were from the 2011 DS experiment and may be due to the deeper groundwater,
    hence better ability to drain the water than in 2010. While yields remained the
    same, total water inputs were significantly reduced by 42.8–48.0 % in AWD15, by
    52.0–53.0 % in AWD25, and by 53.6–53.7 % in AWD30 as compared with CF (Table 4).
    No significant differences in total water input were observed between AWD treatments,
    although in relative terms, AWD15 > AWD25 > AWD30. Sudhir-Yadav et al. (2010)
    also found very small effects of changing irrigation threshold from 20 to 40 to
    70 kPa on irrigation input in puddled transplanted rice. Total WPI+R was significantly
    higher in the AWD treatments than in CF in both years. Among the AWD treatments,
    WPI+R of AWD25 was highest. Except for S30 in 2010, the results further showed
    that lowering the threshold level of AWD up to 30 cm remained safe under the clay
    lowland rice soils in the experimental sites and shallower groundwater conditions
    (10–180 cm) in PhilRice. At a threshold level of 30 cm (AWD30), soil moisture
    tension at 15 cm remained below 30 kPa, suggesting that the plants did not experience
    any water stress at AWD30. No differences in aboveground biomass and LAI were
    observed among water treatments at different stages of the crop (Figs. 5, 6).
    A number of studies (Lu et al. 2000; Kukal et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2009) have
    suggested that 30 kPa is the possible maximum limit of soil water availability
    for “safe” AWD, but this depends on the degree of exposure to higher tension.
    For example, in a deep water table situation in a dry climate, there will be many
    dry-downs, and safe thresholds may actually be lower. Some sort of water deficit
    index may be needed to take into account both the amount of time that the soil
    is drier than a certain tension and the degree of drying to properly explain the
    response. Although higher soil moisture tensions up to 30 kPa may be “safe” in
    some situations, Bouman and Tuong (2001) cautioned that, for some situations,
    this may lead to yield reduction. For example, Wiangsamut (2010) reported a decrease
    in grain yield (when compared with CF) by more than 30 % in sandy loam, silt loam,
    and loam soils in Tarlac Province, Philippines, when irrigation was given when
    soil moisture tension reached 30 kPa. However, on clay loam, Wiangsamut (2010)
    did not find any grain yield reduction with 30 kPa AWD primarily because groundwater
    table depths were between 15 and 42 cm and never dropped below the root zone.
    On clay soil (60 % clay, 31 % silt, and 9 % sand) at IRRI, Los Baños, Philippines,
    AWD with a threshold of 30 kPa did not reduce yield for almost all of the varieties
    tested (Bueno et al. 2010). Groundwater levels at the IRRI farm are generally
    shallow, with water table depths fluctuating from 0 to 70 cm below the ground
    surface during the DS in a number of experimental fields (Cabangon et al. 2011).
    Effects of seedling age Several studies suggest that use of younger seedlings
    (8–14 days old) for transplanting results in better crop performance and yield
    (Vijayakumar et al. 2006; Mishra and Salokhey 2008; Makarim et al. 2002; McDonald
    et al. 2006; Pasuquin et al. 2008). However, other studies reported that transplanting
    younger seedlings (14 days) increases mortality of the seedlings in the main field,
    resulting in a lower yield compared with that using older seedlings (28 days)
    (Kewat et al. 2002). Several studies conducted at IRRI from 2007 to 2009 indicated
    that transplanting older but vigorous seedlings can reduce crop duration in the
    main field without yield reduction, thus reducing water requirement and increasing
    WPI+R (Lampayan et al. 2013). To achieve this, the seedlings (~31 days old) needed
    to be grown in well-fertilized wet bed nurseries at low sowing density (25 g m−2)
    (Faronilo et al. 2010). In the present study, the seedlings were also grown in
    wet bed nurseries with low seeding density (25 g m−2), with organic materials
    added to the seedbed. The results showed that S affected grain yield, which was
    highest with 21-day-old seedlings (S21) and lowest with 30-day-old seedlings (S30).
    Grain yield of 14-day-old seedlings (S14) ranked second among the treatments,
    although, in 2011, the grain yield difference between S14 and S21 was not significant.
    The effects of S on the yield components were relatively inconsistent, although
    S30 produced the lowest percent filled spikelets among the S treatments. The number
    of tillers in younger seedlings at 21–45 DAT was higher than in older seedlings
    (data not shown), which confirmed earlier findings of Pasuquin et al. (2008) and
    Mishra and Salokhey (2008). Total crop duration (from sowing in the seedbed up
    to harvesting in the main field) and main field crop duration (from transplanting
    to harvesting) were affected by S treatment in both years. Transplanted younger
    seedlings (S14) had longer duration in the main field: 2–4 days more than that
    of S21 and 9–10 days more than that of S30. These results were consistent with
    findings of previous studies by Faronilo et al. (2010): a reduction in duration
    by 10–12 days from S30 to S10. In terms of total crop growth duration (sowing
    to harvest), the maturity of rice plants was delayed by 6–7 days in S30 and by
    3–5 days in S21 as compared with S14; this was probably because of the high competition
    between the seedlings due to their extended stay in the nursery seedbed, hence
    the delay in tiller emergence (Mandal et al. 1984; Pasuquin et al. 2008). Against
    S14 in the 2010 DS, water savings of 11.0 % with S21 and 18.6 % with S30 were
    observed due to the shorter stay of the crops under these treatments in the main
    field. However, in 2011, because of rainfall occurrence at the start of the season,
    the number of irrigations for the early established plants (particularly S14)
    was reduced by one irrigation compared with that in 2010 (data not shown). This
    resulted in a similar total water input among S in 2011. With the highest yield
    and with its relatively comparable water input with S30 in both years, S21 produced
    the highest total WPI+R value than did the other two S treatments. Conclusions
    Grain yield was not significantly affected by water treatments, but it was affected
    by S. No significant W × S interactions were observed in both years of the experiment.
    Younger seedlings (S14 and S21) gave higher yields due to their higher percent
    filled spikelets, number of spikelets per panicle, and harvest index at maturity.
    AWD with thresholds of 15–30 cm water depth below the ground surface reduced water
    input significantly and increased WPI+R compared with CF. Use of 30-day-old seedlings
    (S30) reduced water input due to the shorter crop growth duration in the main
    field, but this was attained at the expense of yield. S14 had higher growth duration
    in the main field by 9–14 days when compared with S30 and by 2–8 days when compared
    with S21 in both seasons. Substantial input water savings ranging from 42.8 to
    53.7 % (compared with CF) were obtained in AWD W with no yield penalty. Across
    S, S30 obtained up to 19 % water savings, but it had a yield loss of up to 1.0
    t ha−1 when compared with younger seedlings. To respond to the challenge of the
    paper, it is concluded that there is still a scope to increase further the amount
    of water savings and WPI+R of irrigated lowland rice fields in Central Luzon,
    Philippines (with shallower groundwater tables and clay soil) by lowering the
    threshold level of safe AWD. Farmers can adopt a lower threshold level for irrigation
    to 30 cm, depending on their own conditions (in terms of water scarcity, water
    cost, and acceptable level of any yield loss). Further increase of water savings
    can also be achieved by transplanting older seedlings (30-day-old), however, with
    some yield penalty. Some yield penalty may be acceptable when the price of water
    is high or when water is scarce. To further support the results of the field analysis
    and to extrapolate the findings to other seasonal and site conditions, a simulation
    of the effects of water management and S on grain yield, water balance components,
    and WP of rice under a range of groundwater depth, soil, and weather conditions
    is warranted. References Belder P, Bouman BAM, Cabangon R, Guoan L, Quilang EJP,

    Precision Land Leveling and Furrow Irrigated Raised Bed Planting: Productivity

    Downloads   16,355 Views   Citations Abstract Stagnating yield and declining input
    use efficiency in irrigated wheat of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) coupled with
    diminishing availability of water for agriculture is a major concern of food security
    in South Asia. The objective of our study was to establish an understanding of
    how wheat yield and input use efficiency can be improved and how land leveling
    and crop establishment practices can be modified to be more efficient in water
    use through layering of precision-conservation crop management techniques. The
    “precision land leveling with raised bed” planting can be used to improve crop
    yield, water and nutrient use efficiency over the existing “traditional land leveling
    with flat” planting practices. We conducted a field experiment during 2002-2004
    at Modipuram, India to quantify the benefits of alternate land leveling (precision
    land leveling) and crop establishment (furrow irrigated raised bed planting) techniques
    alone or in combination (layering precision-conservation) in terms of crop yield,
    water savings, and nutrient use efficiency of wheat production in IGP. The wheat
    yield was about 16.6% higher with nearly 50% less irrigation water with layering
    precision land leveling and raised bed planting compared to traditional practices
    (traditional land leveling with flat planting). The agronomic (AE) and uptake
    efficiency (UE) of N, P and K were significantly improved under precision land
    leveling with raised bed planting technique compared to other practices. Keywords

    • Increase water use efficiency and productivity. • Increase energy demands and
    required investment. • To quantify the economic, social and environmental advantages
    and disadvantages. • To know the main tools and models that contribute to success
    in these process. Abstract In Spain, farmers and water user authorities have applied
    a variety of approaches in modernizing irrigation systems to address the delicate
    balance between water and energy use. This review presents the technical aspects
    of this process. This delicate balance is strongly manifested when replacing open-channel,
    gravity-based systems with pressurized distribution networks and switching from
    surface to pressurized irrigation systems, the most common modernization approach
    in Spain and other countries. This summary focuses on actions and technologies
    for improving water and energy use in irrigation and some of the main models and
    tools for improving irrigation infrastructure design and management. Calculations
    of water conservation and energy consumption as a result of improvement demonstrates
    the complexity of the balance between energy and water efficiency. The benefits
    of irrigation modernization include increased water efficiency and productivity,
    improved operation and management of irrigation systems and working conditions
    of farmers, but increased energy demands and investment amount. It is necessary
    to analyze the economic, social, and environmental viability of the irrigation
    modernization process in each case. Proper design and management of irrigation
    systems, promotion of the application and usefulness of Irrigation Advisory Services
    and web-GIS platforms to transfer and share real-time information with farmers
    in a feedback process are some of the best tools for improving consumption of
    water, energy and other production inputs. Previous article in issue Next article

    1. Introduction Low cost, reliable, efficient irrigation systems are needed to
    support sustainable intensification of agriculture in addition to policies that
    recognize the trade-offs between conserving water, reducing CO2 emissions and
    intensifying food production (Daccache et al., 2014). Consequently, optimal irrigation,
    from a sustainable point of view, should always consider both environmental and
    economic criteria. Thus, it is necessary to develop tools and models that can
    contribute directly to improving the use of water and energy in irrigation, with
    a holistic approach for the design and management of irrigation infrastructure.
    Water and energy are important resources for economic and social development as
    well as for environmental integrity, while both are essential to irrigation. An
    in-depth review of the water- energy nexus in irrigation cannot be addressed in
    just one paper. Thus, in this paper, we focus on what we consider key elements
    in the balance between water and energy for pressurized irrigation systems. Moreover,
    the experiences in Spain have been presented as an example to highlight the strengths
    and weaknesses of this process, and the research that has been conducted to overcome
    the constraints. Irrigation consumes approximately 70% of freshwater demand in
    most of the world, reaching 90% in arid and semiarid areas (Molden, 2007). It
    plays a major role in guaranteeing food production. This, together with legal
    (European Water Framework Directive (WFD)2000/60/EC and the Hydrological Plans
    of each country), environmental, social, and economic issues, highlights the importance
    of proper water resource management. Water availability for different uses will
    drastically decrease due to increased demand and the effects of climate change
    as well as by the application of the WFD in Europe. In terms of energy, 23–48%
    of the energy used directly for crop production is for on-farm water pumping (Singh
    et al., 2002). One approach for improving water use efficiency is to replace surface
    irrigation systems with more efficient pressurized (sprinkler and drip) systems
    (Playan and Mateos, 2006) to significantly reduce water application on the farm
    scale, thereby increasing water and land productivity, but also increasing energy
    and investment requirements. In Spain, 3.5 Mha of irrigated land consumes 16,000
    hm3 y−1of water, (30% are groundwater resources), with 48%, 22% and 30% of microirrigation,
    sprinkler and surface irrigation systems, respectively, making up 68% of Spanish
    water consumption (ESYRCE 2014). In 1996, 17% of the 3.45 Mha of irrigated land
    had microirrigation systems, 24% used sprinkler irrigation systems, and 59% were
    surface irrigation systems (Navarro 2002). In 2004, 3.3 Mha of irrigated area
    consumed 17,8000 hm3 y−1 (11% higher than in 2011) with 36.5%, 26%, and 37.5%
    using microirrigation, sprinkler and surface irrigation systems, respectively.
    The differences in water use over time are due to water availability, crop prices,
    energy prices, and subsidies, among others. According to the INE (National Statistics
    Institute, 2012), the energy consumed for irrigation in Spain has increased from
    2136 GWh in 1996–3647 GWh in 2011 (an increase of 70%). It is therefore necessary
    to consider energy efficiency and not only water efficiency in the irrigation
    modernization process, which further complicates the decision making process,
    especially from economic and environmental points of view. Many studies in recent
    years have focused on developing methodologies to quantify water and energy efficiency
    with improved irrigation systems. Lecina et al. (2010) analyzed modernization
    in the Alto Aragón irrigable area. They highlighted some advantages and disadvantages
    of migrating from surface to sprinkler irrigation systems and quantified water
    savings and some of the associated economic and social impacts. Moreno et al.
    (2010a) analyzed energy efficiency in more than 20 water user associations in
    Castilla-La Mancha and proposed measures to increase energy efficiency. Abadía
    et al. (2010) developed a comparative analysis of energy efficiency in more than
    30 collective irrigation networks in Murcia and Castilla-La Mancha, proposing
    some measures to improve energy efficiency and the main problems with these infrastructures.
    Rodríguez Díaz et al. (2012a) analyzed some modernized areas in Andalucía that
    migrated from surface irrigation systems to sprinkler and drip irrigation systems,
    highlighting some strengths and weaknesses of this modernization. The energy used
    by pumping stations generates significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which
    then contribute to accelerating climate change. Potential for global warming is
    indicated by carbon footprint (CF), and the effects on water availability and
    quality in terms of total freshwater volume consumed or polluted are indicated
    by the water footprint (WF). In the irrigation sector, water supply, energy consumption
    and GHG emissions are closely linked, but a reduction in water pumped, and therefore
    smaller carbon footprint (CF), may lead to reductions in yield and farmer income.
    Consequently, optimal irrigation, under a sustainable point of view, can only
    be achieved considering simultaneously environmental and economic criteria (Carrillo-Cobo
    et al., 2014). The main objective of this paper is to review the main technical
    aspects of irrigation modernization and improvement relative to water and energy
    management, and quantify the advantages and disadvantages of the modernization
    process from economic, social and environmental points of view. Examples will
    be drawn from work in Spain, an example of this process that is similar to many
    other parts of the world, analyzing the delicate balance between efficient water
    and energy use in irrigation. Since the change from open-channel, gravity-based
    systems to pressurized networks and from surface irrigation to pressurized irrigation
    systems are where this delicate balance is manifested with greatest intensity,
    these changes will be emphasized. Moreover, this paper discusses some of the main
    tools and models that contribute to successful improvements to irrigation systems,
    and to evaluate the results obtained during the modernization process in Spain
    and in some others countries. 2. Modernization of irrigable areas and water and
    energy conservation Specific objectives of modernization include: increasing water
    productivity, increasing the cost effectiveness of funds, increasing the reliability
    and flexibility of irrigation deliveries considering the demands of other users,
    and meeting environmental requirements (Playan and Mateos, 2006). Modernization
    processes are complex and their features are site-specific, depending on the socio-economic
    and environmental conditions of each region and country. An in-depth analysis
    of the irrigation modernization process for each case study should be centered
    around four main questions: 1. What causes led to modernization of the irrigation
    system? 2. What type of actions took place in that process? 3. What were the impacts
    of these actions? 4. What lessons were derived or learned? In this sense, the
    modernization process in Spain can be considered a priority because irrigation
    is a strategic asset to the farming sector and the national economy. On average,
    applying irrigation increases yields by six times for the main crops and generates
    a gross margin that is four-fold the profit of rainfed crops. In addition, irrigation
    produces 65% of agricultural production in just 16% of the cultivated area (ESYRCE,
    2014). The most obvious positive aspects of modernization, are increasing productivity
    per unit of land and water consumed and ensuring supply to the agri-food industry
    (which represents 17% of the domestic industry) and other markets. Additional
    benefits include creating direct and indirect jobs for highly qualified workers;
    facilitating the integration of young people into the rural context; maintaining
    and diversifying farmer income with the possibility of improving crop rotation;
    maintaining the population in rural areas; preventing the abandonment of lands
    and desertification (Martin de Sata-Olalla, 2001); and improving quality of life
    for farmers through training on new technology. All of these aspects, together
    with water scarcity in Spain, justify the modernization process. However, this
    process has a negative impact on cost due to the increase in energy consumption
    and the rising price of energy over the last five years. One of the first steps
    in modernization is to identify the real values for water and land productivity,
    as well as the economic, social, and environmental benefits, and compare them
    with the investment required and the increase in energy consumption. Perry et
    al. (2009) and Molden et al. (2010) present two very interesting discussion articles
    in this regard. An overview of the main phases of modernization, reflecting the
    delicate balance between water and energy consumption, is presented in Fig. 1.

    where the water-energy nexus is clearly manifested. IAS = irrigation advisory
    services; ICT = information and communication technologies; DSS = decision support
    system. Each of these phases includes a number of processes, many of which require
    tools and models to aid in decision making for proper implementation and management,which
    will be discussed in this review. As an example, some of the key aspects to be
    considered in the improvement and modernization process of irrigable areas in
    Spain can be summarized in Fig. 2. From this, it is necessary to highlight: •
    The need for a written agreement with irrigators because of the low gross margin
    of agricultural activity in some cases, increased input costs, and the long repayment
    period for investment costs that they must pay. • Extension service activities:promoting
    the participation of water users in this process is of key importance because
    they need to use new irrigation systems and management strategies. This should
    be presented as a continuous learning process between the water management authority
    and the different water users, and as continuous technical support to farmers,
    irrigation managers and operational staff. Training is essential for reaching
    the objectives of the modernization processes. • The analysis of water and energy
    management using data collected on the use of infrastructure, which will allow
    managers to resolve errors detected in the design process and in infrastructure
    management. The proposal and evaluation of measures to improve the use of water
    and energy must be constantly reexamined during the useful life of the infrastructure.

    modernization process of irrigable areas in Spain. Normally, the public administration
    helps farmers with irrigation modernization by providing loans for a high percentage
    of the investment cost. In Spain, for instance, a subsidy of 45–50% for the main
    infrastructure (wells, reservoirs, pumping stations, irrigation network, among
    others) can be covered by the administration in many cases. In addition, 30–35%
    of the total cost of the irrigation system can be also subsidized. This type of
    financial support differs by country depending on the importance of agriculture
    in the strategic action plan of each government. Thus, it is necessary to identify
    the real values for water productivity, as well as the economic, social, and environmental
    benefits, and compare them with the large investment required and the increase
    in energy consumption. Specific analyses in each irrigable area should be performed
    to determine the economic viability of the modernization and improvement process.
    3. Integration of tools for efficient water and energy use in irrigation The identification
    and quantification of the different water uses in irrigation depends on the scale
    (plot, farm, irrigable area, cultivation system, or river basin and aquifer) and
    on the time period considered. Burt et al. (1997) characterized water use based
    on three criteria: (1) recovery, (2) utility or profitability, and (3) the rationality
    of assigning the water to this use. The results of this analysis show that the
    possibilities of water conservation at the plot level have some limitations. It
    is therefore necessary to give an overview of the key technologies included in
    the literature that can contribute directly to improving the use of water and
    energy in irrigation. These technologies, applied mainly in areas with water scarcity,
    high water prices due to energy costs, and a low gross margin for farmers, can
    be grouped as: a. Tools and models for saving water and selecting the proper crop
    pattern at the farm level, with a goal of optimizing economic water productivity
    and minimizing the environmental impact. This can be performed with the use of
    precision agriculture, information and communication technologies (ICT) or remote
    sensing at different resolutions for crop status determination, combined with
    decision support system (DSS) models and tools. b. Tools and models for improving
    irrigation infrastructure design and management as a whole, based on water and
    energy savings, such as: (b-1) optimal design, size and management of pressurized
    irrigation systems on the plot scale with low pressure sprinklers and emitters,
    (b-2) collective irrigation networks, (b-3) pumping systems. c. Actions to reduce
    energy consumption and/or cost such as the use of: (c-1) benchmarking techniques,
    (c-2) energy audits, (c-3) models for optimal use of specific electricity tariffs,
    (c-4) telemetry and remote control systems, (c-5) renewable energy. In addition
    to these three specific action items, transversal activities can be included,
    such as: (1) to promote the usage and usefulness of Irrigation Advisory Services
    (IAS) to transfer and share real-time information with farmers; (2) to create
    a network of leaders among farmers and technicians who can act as examples for
    farmers; (3) to create web-based GIS platforms or to use existing platforms for
    information and technology transfer for end users in a feedback process. The CIMIS
    (California Irrigation Management Information System) is a clear example of success
    in advisory services. Parker et al. (2000) estimated that with CIMIS, water consumption
    was reduced by 10–20%; 23% of growers increased crop yield, and 28% of growers
    increased crop quality. From an economic point of view, the operational costs
    of CIMIS were established at $850,000 y−1, while the profit to farmers was estimated
    at $64,200,000 y−1. IrriSAT (Hornbuckle et al., 2009) is another good example
    of application of satellite-based technologies to advise farmers on proper irrigation
    strategies. In Spain IAS are active in most regions, and one of the most significant
    is the SIARUCLM in the Region of Castilla-La Mancha (Ortega et al., 2005) (http://crea.uclm.es/siar).
    3.1. Use of tools for optimization of farm management and profitability using
    models, DSS and remote sensing for determining crop status Optimal irrigation
    management involves the integration of many factors: soil–plant interactions;
    selection of the appropriate irrigation method and system; knowledge of the production
    target that leads to economically optimal crop requirements for water, fertilizer
    and energy; and social, economic and environmental considerations. Models for
    spatial crop growth and DSS with precision agriculture and remote sensing technologies
    interacting in real time with users through web-GIS technologies can provide a
    suite of tools to accomplish optimization. Remote sensing makes it possible to
    obtain near-real time spatial crop data regarding the type of crop, crop growth
    and development, water status, and even biomass and crop yield uniformity at the
    plot and subplot levels. Through a web-based innovation platform, this technology
    can be used for monitoring crop planning as a water resource control strategy
    for maximum environmental and socio-economic efficiency, with models such as ISAREG
    (Teixeira and Pereira, 1992), STICS (Brisson et al., 1998), CropSyst (Stöckle
    et al., 2003), DSSAT (Jones et al., 2003), AquaCrop (Steduto et al., 2009) or
    MOPECO (Dominguez et al., 2011). Although not all water users and administrators
    in irrigable areas throughout the world can afford this type of tool, these are
    new lines of research that are being transferred in many areas, offering good
    examples of methods for improving water and energy management in irrigation. However,
    it is necessary to determine the limits of this technology and to blend models
    for building synergies toward more efficient irrigation management. 3.2. Models
    and tools for improving irrigation infrastructure design and management A holistic
    approach must be emphasized for addressing the design and management of irrigation
    infrastructure from the irrigation system in the plot to the water source. This
    approach would result in optimal solutions that differ from those obtained when
    each part of the whole infrastructure is optimized individually. 3.2.1. Optimal
    design, size and management of pressurized irrigation systems on the plot scale
    The main aspects that should be considered in the process of design and management
    of an irrigation system are maximizing uniformity, minimizing drift and evaporation
    losses, obtaining the minimum total cost of the system and determining the control
    and telemetry system requirements. Thus, aspects related to soil water redistribution
    and crop water use are outside the scope of this paper. In order to optimize the
    design and management of in-plot irrigation systems, it is necessary to develop
    tools and models that act as decision support systems. Some of these tools are
    available already and will be described briefly below. The design and sizing of
    irrigation systems in a plot depends on the manner in which the irrigation system
    is fed: (1) direct injection of water from the water source (well, surface water,
    etc.), (2) a reservoir between the water source and the irrigation system and
    (3) collective irrigation networks for water supply. Each of these configurations
    results in different algorithms for irrigation system design and sizing optimization.
    Daccache et al. (2010) developed algorithms to analyze the relationship between
    irrigation uniformity and pressure at the hydrant level. To do so, they developed
    models based in the COPAM hydraulic model and applied these models to the Capitanata
    (Italy) Water User Association (WUA). This is important because it describes how
    the strategies to reduce energy consumption could affect irrigation uniformity
    in a plot, and therefore, crop yield. Moreno et al. (2012) developed software
    for the optimal design of center pivot and moving lateral systems fed directly
    from wells, considering the theoretical relation between the characteristic and
    efficiency curves of the pumps (Moreno et al., 2009), hydrologic variables (water
    table and its temporal variation), soil variables (infiltration parameters, surface
    storage capacity, surface sealing), hydraulic variables (head losses in pipes,
    demanded flow), and economic variables (energy costs, pump and pipe costs). Carrión
    et al. (2013) and Carrión et al. (2014) developed a DSS tool, named PRESUD, for
    optimal hydraulic design and sizing of solid set sprinkler and microirrigation
    systems with minimum total cost (operation + investment) per unit irrigated area
    considering the proper type and size of pump together with the irrigation system.
    Use of these tools makes it possible to accurately determine the uniformity of
    the system, which is directly related with the crop yield and, therefore, with
    efficient water use. It is also important to determine the effect of the working
    pressure of the sprinklers or drippers on the balance between energy consumption
    and the total water application cost. There are advanced developments on low pressure
    sprinklers for center pivot systems and solid set systems. Pressure is reduced
    from 3.5 bar to 1–2 bar, making it necessary to evaluate the effect of this decrease
    in pressure on the uniformity of the system and on drift and evaporation losses
    (Ortiz et al., 2010, Singh et al., 2010). Proper sizing and management of reservoirs
    has also been the objective of numerous studies, which emphasizes the need for
    this kind of research (Hirose, 1997, Pulido-Calvo et al., 2006). Robust and efficient
    optimization algorithms should be implemented to optimize these infrastructures
    as a whole. 3.2.2. Design, sizing and optimal operation of collective irrigation
    networks Collective irrigation networks are of special interest in large irrigable
    areas to reduce investment costs in water allocation. However, in many instances
    these collective infrastructures are not designed or managed properly. On-demand
    irrigation networks are more flexible for users since farmers can irrigate at
    will; however, the whole irrigation system is usually designed to meet peak irrigation
    demand, which is limited to a few days, resulting in oversized pumping station
    and network pipes during most of the irrigation season (Calejo et al., 2008).
    Moreno et al. (2010c) found that irrigation systems under a rotation schedule
    are more susceptible to inefficient management than on-demand networks. If properly
    managed, networks under rotational management can produce energy savings of 3.5–24.9%,
    minimizing the flow rate concentration in specific pipes within the network and
    reducing the pressure head needs in the intake. The proper design, dimensioning
    and management of water distribution networks can produce significant energy savings,
    which requires tools and DSS to evaluate the behavior of the operation network
    under different demand scenarios. Knowledge on the performance of existing irrigation
    networks can be used to improve management, and ensure the success by reducing
    errors in the design process of new irrigation networks. Sectoring, where hydrants
    are grouped according to similar energy demand and irrigation is arranged following
    a schedule, is one way to save energy in water distribution networks (Jiménez-Bello
    et al., 2010, Farmani et al., 2007). Rodríguez-Díaz et al. (2009) modelled the
    potential effects of sectoring measures in the OPTIEN algorithm applied to the
    Fuente Palmera irrigation district (Spain). Results show that energy savings of
    over 20% can be achieved in the peak demand period for the current water demand
    levels by operating the network in sectors and concentrating irrigation events
    per sector in 12 h rather than 24 h. A further step was achieved with WEBSO, an
    algorithm based on a topological characterization using a dimensionless coordinate
    system, which provides a monthly sectoring calendar for branched networks shown
    to achieve potential energy savings of up to 27% in Fuente Palmera (Carrillo-Cobo
    et al., 2011). However, it is necessary to consider pumping station behavior after
    sectoring, which can lead to much lower energy savings (Fernández García et al.,
    2014). This approach emphasized that considering only part of the whole infrastructure
    could lead to overestimation of energy savings due to sectoring strategies. The
    analysis and control of critical points is another alternative for improving network
    operation by saving energy. These points are hydrants with special energy requirements
    due to their distance from the pump station or because of a difference in elevation.
    Rodríguez Díaz et al. (2012b) developed the WECP algorithm, useful in detecting
    critical points and designing improvement actions to minimize their impacts on
    energy demand. Application of the WECP to El Villar irrigation district (Southern
    Spain) demonstrated energy savings of up to 30%. It is necessary to emphasize
    that most of the above mentioned papers do not consider the effect of the pumping
    station efficiency, which greatly affects the results of energy conservation when
    defining new demand patterns. 3.2.3. Optimizing the design, sizing and regulation
    of pumping systems One of the main problems in the design of water distribution
    networks is obtaining the type of pump that best fits the water demand under specific
    pressure head requirements. This adjustment is particularly complex for on-demand
    network designs where the pumping station must supply a very broad range of flows
    and pressures with maximum energy efficiency as a function of the number of hydrants
    that are open simultaneously. Moreno et al. (2009) propose an algorithm to obtain
    the desirable types of characteristic and efficiency curves considering the theoretical
    relation between the two curves for a specific pump. For proper design of pumping
    stations, the design flow in the head of the network must be determined. Several
    methodologies have been developed to obtain the design flow in each pipe of a
    network. The Clément methodology (Clément, 1966) is the most commonly used method
    because it is easy to implement. Some studies have shown that this methodology
    does not fit properly with real network behavior. Thus, the Random Daily Demand
    Curves Method (RDDC) was developed to obtain the flow rate in each pipe, and therefore
    in the head of the network (Moreno et al., 2007). The RDDC was shown to fit the
    measured data better than the Clément methodology, which underestimated the design
    flow by 35–40% in some networks studied. Many other studies have been performed
    on this topic, with similar results (Calejo et al., 2008). The distribution of
    water discharge throughout the irrigation season is an essential parameter for
    properly studying the energy used by pumping stations. Moreno et al. (2007) obtained
    the discharge distribution of a pumping station by measuring electrical parameters,
    which produced a good estimate. Typically, only the design flow and the pressure
    heads are considered when designing pumping stations, without taking into account
    the other flow rates during the irrigation season. However, research has shown
    that most pumping stations supply mainly low or medium discharge and infrequent
    episodes of maximum discharge (Moreno et al., 2007, Lamaddalena & Khila, 2012).
    Thus, it is necessary to improve the efficiency for low and medium flow rates,
    and not only for the high flow rate (design flow). Proper regulation of pumping
    systems is a key step in fitting energy consumption to actual energy demand. Marzal
    and Prat (2008) proposed a methodology to subdivide the pumping station of collective
    irrigation networks depending on energy costs, with a methodology implemented
    in GESTAR 2008. This method allows for integration of the absorbed power and the
    number of hours of operation of the pumping station for each flow rate to generate
    a theoretical model of the pump with the best performance for each case study.
    Moreno et al. (2008) developed a methodology to measure pressure in a few nodes
    and estimate the pressure at the remaining nodes in the network, which allows
    the user to fit the energy supply of the pumping station to the energy requirements
    of the irrigation network. Another aspect to consider in the regulation of pumping
    stations is the use of variable speed drives (VSD) for fitting energy consumption
    to energy demand of the system. Ait Kadi et al. (1998) demonstrated that approximately
    25% of energy can be saved in an irrigation district in Morocco by using variable-speed
    pump technology. Also, Lamaddalena and Khila (2012) demonstrated that 27–35% of
    energy savings can be achieved using an appropriate variable speed regulation
    in two Italian on-demand irrigation districts. However, most of these analyses
    do not consider the effect of the efficiency of the frequency speed drive on the
    final result. Thus, it is crucial to consider the efficiency of the VSD in energy
    accounting, and not simply consider it to be high enough that it can be ignored.
    It is not possible to generalize an expression to determine the efficiency of
    the VSD since it depends on the brand and model, the pump associated with the
    VSD, temperature conditions, and other factors. Moreno et al. (2010b) developed
    a DSS tool named A.S. (Borehole Analysis) to analyze the performance of a pumping
    system connected to wells, which determined the optimal time to extract from the
    well by comparing the suboptimal operation and extraction costs. Broader studies
    are needed to consider the progression of energy efficiency over the lifetime
    of the pump. Energy consumption increases over time because of decreasing energy
    efficiency, reaching 5–20% in the first few years of the working life of the pump,
    and increasing with wear on the pumps. Life Cycle Cost analysis can be used to
    determine optimal maintenance operation programming to minimize the total operational
    costs of the pumping system (Rocamora et al., 2013). 3.3. Actions to reduce energy
    consumption and/or costs Over the past few years, several studies have focused
    on analyzing irrigation energy consumption in response to increasing energy consumption
    and prices in Spain (Rodríguez Díaz et al., 2009, Moreno et al., 2010a). The different
    actions that can be applied are as follows. 3.3.1. Use of benchmarking techniques
    to evaluate the performance of irrigated areas Generally, modernization actions
    for irrigation schemes are previously analyzed with economic, social or environmental
    evaluations. However, the impacts are rarely evaluated after the improvements
    are made. Several researchers have developed and applied sets of performance indicators
    to measure the efficiency and sustainability of irrigation systems, but there
    are few examples in the literature of improving efficiency by comparing several
    irrigation districts using performance indicators based on benchmarking techniques.
    Earlier studies evaluated water but excluded other resources that play an important
    role in modern irrigated agriculture, such as energy. However, recent studies
    have highlighted the need for performance indicators in improving the use of both
    water and energy, focusing on alternatives for reducing water consumption and
    energy costs (Rodríguez Díaz et al., 2008, Rodríguez Díaz et al., 2011, Córcoles
    et al., 2012). In most of these previous experiences, indicators were applied
    in comparative analyses of different irrigation districts within a single year.
    This process has limitations: sometimes the indicators of very different districts
    were compared, and the best practices could not be adopted by less efficient districts.
    Indicators have been rarely applied to evaluate the efficiency of modernization
    processes by comparing the values before and after the improvement and upgrade
    actions. There are some good examples in the literature that have shown their
    efficiency for this type of evaluation: Mateos et al. (2010) studied the impact
    of some rehabilitation measures on certain irrigation districts in Mauritania;
    Lecina et al. (2010) evaluated hypothetical modernization scenarios in the Riegos
    del Alto Aragón project (Northeastern Spain) and Rodríguez Díaz et al. (2012a)
    evaluated the modernization of the Bembézar M.D. irrigation district (Southern
    Spain) using water and energy indicators. From these studies it appears that water
    use was more efficient in districts where users are charged per unit of irrigation
    water consumed. In the permanent sprinkler irrigation systems using groundwater
    analyzed in Castilla-La Mancha, energy represents 45% of the total management,
    operation, and maintenance costs, compared with 20% in drip irrigation systems
    (Córcoles et al., 2012). Benchmarking and multivariate data analysis techniques
    are powerful tools for evaluating water and energy efficiency in irrigation districts
    and may help managers and policy makers identify the best practices and the weak
    points of every irrigation district. 3.3.2. Energy audits An energy audit is not
    only an energy analysis, but also includes: indicators to identify possible solutions,
    measures for improving energy efficiency, and an economic evaluation of the proposed
    measures for prioritizing implementation. To carry out these energy audits it
    is necessary to develop region-specific tools and models integrated into DSS.
    Abadía et al. (2008) proposed a methodology to calculate the global energy efficiency
    (GEE) of irrigation distribution systems that includes the energy efficiency of
    pumping (EEP), which depends on the efficiency of the pumping stations, and the
    supply energy efficiency (SEE), which depends on the design and management of
    the water distribution system. This methodology has been applied in the Guidelines
    for Energy Audits in Water User Associations edited by the IDAE (Instituto para
    la Diversificación y Ahorro de la Energía; Institute for Energy Diversification
    and Conservation; IDAE, 2008). Measures of improvement identified in an energy
    audit can be classified into three groups, depending on the process: (a) measures
    of the performance of energy consuming equipment (pumps, motors, filters, variable
    speed drives); (b) measures of the design and management of the network, such
    as sectoring and designing new pipelines or reservoirs, and (c) measures of the
    energy contract with the energy supply company. Measures in groups (a) and (b)
    affect the EEP and SEE, respectively, and improve energy efficiency of the irrigation
    system, while measures in group (c) improve the economic efficiency of energy.
    A comparative analysis of energy efficiency in 22 irrigation water distribution
    networks was performed by Abadía et al. (2010). The average EEP and SEE values
    obtained in the 22 networks were approximately 53.0 and 73.0%, respectively. The
    estimation of average energy savings was 14.1% (11.2% related to measures of the
    performance of energy consuming equipment and 2.9% for measures of infrastructure
    design and management), with maximum values greater than 60%, and economic savings
    of 20.6% (10.8% for measures of the performance of energy consuming equipment,
    6.1% for measures of the design and management of infrastructure and 3.7% for
    measures of the energy contract with the energy supply company), with maximum
    values higher than 45%. The authors conclude that the most representative indicators
    of energy efficiency in water distribution networks are related to energy costs
    and energy consumption for the volume supplied to users, rather than indicators
    that relate these parameters to the irrigated area. Conducting these audits has
    demonstrated that in irrigated areas with high elevational differences energy
    efficiency is much lower, and the only solution is the establishment of equal-elevation
    sectors for managing the irrigation network. In most case studies, an improvement
    in energy efficiency was detected after the implementation of the proposed measures,
    with average energy savings of 10.2%. The proposed improvement measures that result
    in the highest energy savings are related to equipment improvements, mostly concerning
    well pumps. An energy audit can be an excellent tool for improving energy efficiency
    in irrigation and should be increasingly applied in the future. 3.3.2.1. Difficulties
    in implementing the energy conservation measures proposed in energy audits The
    improvement measures proposed in energy audits do not guarantee energy savings.
    After the proposal, the improvement measures must be implemented, which may present
    difficulties (Rocamora et al., 2013) such as: (I) the energy audit represents
    a static analysis of the distribution system energy performance relative to the
    period during which it has been conducted. Conditions not contemplated in the
    analysis may occur, and may complicate the implementation of corrective measures;
    (II) many distribution systems have no technical capability to implement the measures
    proposed in the audit; (III) the investment required makes it difficult to apply
    the measures, despite the economic cost-effectiveness and short lag time for return
    on investment; (IV) subjective factors are also involved, such as possible lack
    of commitment by managers to accept changes when measures reduce flexibility.
    In order to overcome these difficulties, Rocamora et al. (2013) proposed a Strategy
    for Efficient Energy Management (SEEM) as an effective way of achieving implementation
    of energy efficiency improvement measures. The SEEM consists of an Energy Management
    System (EMS) adapted for WUAs, taking into consideration the special characteristics
    of these organizations. The SEEM proposed by Rocamora et al. (2013) was applied
    to a WUA in Spain covering an irrigated area of 5340 ha, where the main crops
    were stone fruit trees, grapes and vegetables. The results show that the cost
    of the SEEM implementation was very low (0.6% of the energy cost) compared to
    the decrease in energy use and costs simulated in two possible wear and tear scenarios
    (7.1% and 6%, respectively). 3.3.3. Models for optimizing electric rate use It
    is important to specify that a suitable energy contract will result in a decrease
    in energy costs, but has no effect on energy savings. Improving energy purchasing
    means looking for the most convenient type of contract, taking into account the
    contracted power, which is determined by the power demanded by the pumping systems
    during the irrigation season. Good energy management also implies knowledge of
    the different electricity rates and periods based on time of day and types of
    days during the year. Then, if possible, energy consumption can be adapted to
    this pattern. Another factor that must be considered is the need for compensating
    reactive power. Traditionally, researchers have developed algorithms to estimate
    the flow rates of irrigation networks based on the maximum crop water requirements
    of a typical crop distribution in an irrigable area. These estimates should be
    improved for proper design and management of the irrigation network, especially
    for energy management of the pumping station. Thus, it is necessary to determine
    the water and energy demand in real time throughout the irrigation season. This
    is a key point in the current context of energy rates and types of energy contracts
    in Spain (Moreno et al., 2010a). The proper estimation of power requirements for
    energy contracts requires an understanding of the established crops and an estimation
    of the crop water requirements during the irrigation season. Once the crop water
    requirements are forecasted and the distribution in the irrigated area has been
    defined, the irrigation time and irrigation interval can be obtained by considering
    the discharge of the irrigation systems in the plot. Thus, the flow rates and
    energy demand on the pumping systems can be forecasted. This forecast can be used
    to draw up an optimum contract with the electrical company, together with the
    possibility of accessing the liberalized energy market (energy pool). In the present
    context of a deregulated market in many countries, tariff simulators are useful
    for comparing offers from different marketing companies to optimize the power
    supply capacity and to calculate the banks of capacitors required to improve the
    power factor, taking into consideration the energy use pattern of the WUA. 3.3.4.
    Telemetry and remote control systems Determining the volume of water applied and
    the energy consumed by irrigators at the field scale is a prerequisite for achieving
    sound irrigation management at higher scales. In addition, the measurement of
    applied irrigation water (AIW) is becoming mandatory in some areas of the world,
    such as in the European Union, where the Water Framework Directive requires Member
    States to develop water pricing policies linked to metering (EU, 2000). In this
    process, telemetry plays a critical role. Lorite et al. (2013) used a wireless
    telemetry system to collect water use records at the individual field level during
    two irrigation seasons in the Genil-Cabra Irrigation Scheme (GCIS), Spain, served
    by an on-demand pressurized irrigation system with a total of 1365 plots in around
    7500 ha to assess the variability in field water usage and in the timing of water
    application among farmers. Using the information provided by the telemetry system,
    a new irrigation performance assessment based on variability analysis was proposed.
    In an attempt to explain the observed variability, interviews were carried out
    with farmers and their responses indicated that much of the variability was caused
    by differences in their approaches to deficit irrigation. Stambouli et al. (2014)
    analyzed telemetry data records in Almudebar irrigation district (Spain) for water
    and electricity management analyses for irrigation cost optimization. They cite
    the need to know the crop distribution pattern and crop irrigation requirements
    as early as possible, and to adjust the contracted power related to the power
    demand. A proposed scenario, based on adjusting the power contracted to average
    consumption, resulted in a decrease of 8.4% in the total electricity cost. 3.3.5.
    Renewable energy in irrigation The use of renewable energy resources in water
    distribution systems is becoming increasingly considered as an alternative in
    urban supply systems. For example, turbines for harnessing excess energy when
    there are large differences in elevation are being installed in water supply systems.
    Hybrid systems that establish the optimal combination of several energy sources
    such as solar, wind and hydropower are being incorporated in water supply systems
    (Ramos et al., 2011). These measures contribute to lowering energy costs and sustainable
    management of water distribution systems at the same time. In the agricultural
    sector, the implementation of renewable energy resources is increasingly common,
    such as solar energy for controlling greenhouses, or in pumping systems for irrigation
    water supply (Ramazan, 2012). However, these energy resources are used only in
    small farms with low power requirements (not exceeding 10 kW). It is necessary
    to intensify the analysis of the application of renewable energy, mainly wind
    and photovoltaic energy, for applications in medium and large size farms. A comprehensive
    analysis should be performed on the applicability of renewable energy in each
    country, which is highly influenced by the energy sector and distribution networks
    together with the seasonality of the irrigation energy demand. Carrillo-Cobo et
    al. (2014) analyzed the role of solar energy in the Bembézar left margin irrigation
    district (Southern Spain) which has an irrigated area of 4000 ha. They combined
    sectoring as an energy saving strategy and a 2.15 MW photovoltaic (PV) system
    to supply energy to the sector with higher energy consumption. Results show that
    both measures together would reduce energy costs by 71.7% and the greenhouse gases
    (GHG) emissions by 70.5%. The total investment was 2.8 M€ but with a payback period
    of just 8 years. However, these results should be analyzed in-depth in the specific
    case of each country, considering the options of the proportion of energy consumed
    by the producer and injecting the surplus energy to the electrical grid, which
    can modify the results. 4. Quantification of water savings and energy consumption
    as a result of modernization A key issue in the modernization process is the evaluation
    of water savings and energy consumption derived from this process. Thus, it is
    necessary to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of modernization including
    economic viability, social and environmental aspects. In general, switching from
    surface to pressurized irrigation systems results in a decrease in water use,
    mainly via reduced losses to percolation, but an increase in water (evapotranspiration)
    and energy consumption, together with maintenance and management costs. Thus,
    Jackson et al. (2010) reported that converting from surface irrigation to pressurized
    systems led to reductions in water application by 10–66% in a surface-water supplied
    region in New South Wales and a groundwater dependent region in South Australia.
    However, in the surface water supplied region, energy consumption also increased
    by up to 163%. In the groundwater dependent region, energy consumption was reduced
    by 12–44% due to increased water use efficiency. Jiménez-Aguirre and Isidoro (2012)
    analyzed the effect of an irrigation modernization process from surface irrigation
    to sprinkler irrigation systems on 3718 ha in the WUA of Almudévar (Huesca, Spain).
    They found water conservation reached 32% (1140–860 mm y−1) for a maize crop,
    even though water consumption increased by 22% (15% from wind drift and evaporation
    losses and a 7% increase in evapotranspiration). The crop yield increased by 40%
    (from 10.2 to 14.3 kg ha−1) from the best adjustment to the irrigation requirements
    and to lower nitrogen losses due to percolation. Nitrogen application decreased
    from 431 to 316 kg ha−1. Drainage was reduced by 81% and the content of nitrogen
    in this water was reduced by 86%. In addition, farmer quality of life improved
    as a result of the automation of the irrigation control system. Rodríguez Díaz
    et al. (2011) evaluated energy use in typical Andalusian (Southern Spain) irrigation
    districts by means of performance indicators for water and energy use during 2006–2007
    irrigation seasons. The average energy consumption per irrigated area was approximately
    1000 kW h ha−1, and when analyzing energy consumption per cubic meter of water
    pumped, the average was 0.41 kW h m−3, with high variability among districts.
    The increase in energy consumption itself is a negative outcome of some irrigation
    modernization strategies, but the economic impact of this increase is even greater
    with rising energy prices. Such is the case in Spain, where electricity prices
    have dramatically increased over the last several years, and special energy tariffs
    for irrigation are no longer available. Ederra and Murugarren (2010) compared
    data from 2005 and 2009 to analyze the increase in the energy bill of an irrigable
    area of 802 ha which was very sensitive to higher energy rates due to the high
    pumping head (196 m). Annual water supply varied between 4000 and 5000 m3 ha−1.
    Supply power was 1750 kW. The power charge increased by 378%, the energy charge
    increased by 66% and the electricity bill increased by 82% in this period. This
    was not only due to the energy rates, but also irrigation management in peak billing
    periods and suboptimal contracting with the energy supplier. Rodríguez Díaz et
    al. (2012a), used performance indicators related to water and energy consumption
    to analyze systems before and after the irrigation community modernization process
    in Bembézar right margin in 2007, where users switched from traditional surface
    irrigation to drip irrigation systems. This irrigated area was created in 1969,
    with more than 11,600 ha and 1300 farmers, and an average farm size of 7 ha. The
    analysis showed an approximate 40% reduction in water diverted for irrigation
    due to more efficient irrigation systems. However, this situation has promoted
    the adoption of crop rotations (mainly citrus) of higher value and water demand,
    so the theoretical water requirements increased considerably, by around 20%. However
    Berbel et al. (2014) reported that deficit irrigation is a common practice in
    the area, so the water consumption (evapotranspiration) has not been considerably
    increased. Modernization has also led to an increase in total management, operation
    and maintenance costs, which are four times higher than before modernization (from
    99 to 392 € ha−1). This cost increase is closely related with the high energy
    dependency of the new system (0.15 kWh m−3), which was negligible before modernization.
    In the areas studied, farmers spent approximately 2.6% of their income to cover
    water costs before modernization, which increased to 10% after modernization.
    However, more flexible irrigation systems (organized, on-demand) allowed farmers
    to switch to more profitable crops. An analysis using general performance indicators
    in the 11,600 ha modernized in 2007 showed that in the period before modernization
    (1997–2002), land productivity (€ ha−1) was slightly lower than in 2008 and 2009
    (except in 2002). This analysis was performed soon after the modernization of
    the irrigation district, and it would be interesting to repeat the analysis after
    better consolidation of the modernization process to examine the effect of modernization
    on water and energy consumption. In addition, training and advice with IAS can
    improve results. Regarding productivity before and after modernization, there
    is a consensus regarding the increase in productivity, but it is mainly influenced
    by adequate irrigation management and other production techniques, and not only
    by the type of irrigation system. Lecina et al. (2010) analyzed the effects of
    irrigation modernization on water conservation using the Riegos del Alto Aragón
    (RAA) irrigation project (NE Spain, 123,354 ha) as a case study. Traditional surface
    irrigation systems and modern sprinkler systems currently occupy 73% and 27% of
    the irrigated area, respectively, where the whole irrigated area is devoted to
    field crops. Corn, alfalfa and rice were cultivated in 63% of the surface irrigated
    areas, and 75% of the sprinkler irrigated areas for analyses in the years 2003
    and 2004. The results indicate that irrigation modernization can increase water
    use and water depletion (water that is not available for further use because it
    is lost to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration, wind drift and evaporation losses
    or other sinks, such as non-recoverable runoff and percolation). In addition,
    farmers can achieve higher productivity and better working conditions: yields
    and gross land productivity were 25–33% higher, and the net land productivity
    was 29–45% higher in sprinkler systems than in surface irrigated areas. Crops
    with higher water use, such as corn and alfalfa, had net land productivity that
    was approximately 130% and 60% higher than winter cereals (barley and wheat),
    respectively. Net water productivity was 75–93% higher in sprinkler systems than
    in surface irrigated crops. Irrigation modernization would be expected to increase
    the economic activity of the agricultural sector by 27–68 M€ in some of the scenarios
    analyzed. This increase would have a cascading economic effect, extending the
    impact of irrigation modernization to related economic sectors. A multidisciplinary
    study would be required to estimate the effect on water productivity computed
    over water depletion at a regional scale because this type of modernization, in
    inland areas with irrigation return flow quality that allows for downstream reuse,
    involves a reduction in water availability in the river basin. Another barrier
    to implementation is when promising technologies are simply not suitable. Although
    field irrigation should be improved for many reasons (environmental, crop quality,
    crop yield, energy consumption, etc.) it is difficult to find the most appropriate
    balance between investments in new infrastructure and improvements in management
    practices for a given irrigation district. Burt and O’Neil (2007) compared the
    water applied and tomato yield on 187 furrow-irrigated fields and 164 drip irrigated
    fields (with water meters, maximum flexibility in water delivery, and availability
    of advisory services). Farmers applied 400–1200 mm of irrigation water with both
    irrigation systems and for the same amount of water (700 mm for instance) and
    obtained 40–130 t ha−1 in yield with both systems. This indicates that productivity
    in irrigated agriculture depends on how water and other resources are managed
    as well as fluctuations in market prices. The authors also conclude that it would
    be risky to assume that there are higher yields with drip irrigation. Thus, poorly
    managed “hi-tech” systems can be as wasteful and unproductive as poorly managed
    traditional systems (Perry et al., 2009). Although in this paper we focus the
    discussion on the technical aspects of irritation modernization related with water
    and energy use, in each modernization process it is necessary to identify the
    actual increase in water and land productivity, as well as the economic, social,
    and environmental benefits. These benefits should be compared with the investment
    costs and the increase in energy consumption. 5. Conclusions In countries like
    Spain, where irrigation plays a crucial role in the economic viability of many
    farms located in areas with water shortages, but high production potential, modernization
    by changing from open-channel gravity-based systems to sprinkler and drip irrigation
    can be necessary. In this paper, we aimed to quantify the advantages and disadvantages
    of the modernization process from economic, social and environmental points of
    view by analyzing relevant publications. We have also found areas in need of development
    and research to advance the modernization process under a context of high energy
    cost and water shortage. Some of lessons learned from Spain are: • Modernization
    reduces the amount of water supplied to a crop, as well as decreasing water drainage
    and agrochemical contamination of water and soil, although in some specific cases
    it increases the consumptive use of water per unit area due to higher evapotranspiration.
    • Modernization has increased the productivity per unit of land and water, ensuring
    supply to the agri-food industry and other markets. However, this did not lead
    to benefits for farmers in all cases because investment and energy costs have
    increased. • The economic crisis suffered since 2010 has doubled energy costs
    in Spain, which has a high impact on industry and modernized irrigation. • Modernization
    allowed farmers to include new crops, which helps with adaptation to international
    market demand and, therefore, the variable prices of the agro-market. • Automation,
    the use of information and communication technologies and the application and
    usefulness of Irrigation Advisory Services, in conjunction with web-GIS platforms
    to transfer and share real-time information with farmers through communication
    in a feedback process, contributes to improving water, energy and fertilizer efficiency,
    which means a reduction in the environmental impact of irrigation. • Farmer quality
    of life has improved, as well as the incorporation of young farmers in the sector,
    which has a positive impact in the creation of direct and indirect jobs. It also
    greatly reduces abandonment of lands and desertification in rural areas. • Several
    tools for decision making and decision support systems have been developed for
    the design and management of irrigable areas, which leads to further improvement
    in water and energy use, as well as other production inputs. Research is needed
    in assessing the quantitative effect of irrigation modernization and optimization
    plans on river basin water resources. The effects on the socio-economic sustainability
    of agriculture and on water quality in the river basin also must be evaluated.
    Furthermore, proper analysis of the costs and benefits of improving water productivity
    are required. Broader studies are needed to consider the progression of energy
    efficiency over the useful life of a pump, while robust and efficient optimization
    algorithms that consider the optimization of all infrastructures as a whole are
    necessary for drawing a complete picture of farm productivity and profit in relation
    to water and energy efficiency. Due to the increased costs of energy resources
    along with the reduction in unit costs of renewable energy resources, alternative
    energy sources are expected to play an important role in the future, which is
    another area where further research is needed. Acknowledgments The authors wish

    Highlights • Optimized fertilization and irrigation increase N and water utilization
    rate. • Lower N application and soil moisture reduce the N2O emission. • WFA and
    LCA method can be used to evaluate water consumption in northern China. Abstract
    Excessive nitrogen (N) application and shortage of water are the major obstacles
    to sustainable agricultural development in the high-yielding regions of the North
    China Plain. New cropping systems need to be created that use integrated management
    practices to improve the utilization of nitrogen and water and to reduce the emissions
    of greenhouse gases. We conducted a 4-year (2011–2015) field experiment in Huantai
    county using three cropping treatments: local farmers’ conventional practices
    (FP), recommended farming management (REC), and no N fertilization (CK). The study
    revealed that, the mean annual grain yield of FP and REC was both 16.5 Mg ha−1
    which was higher than CK (7.9 Mg ha−1). In comparison with FP, the REC treatment
    showed N fertilizer and groundwater input reduced by 43% and 28% with increasing
    of 79.3% and 61.7% of N use efficiency (NUE) and irrigation water use efficiency
    (IWUE), respectively. The REC treatment demonstrated consistently lower N2O emissions
    (36% on average) compared with the FP treatment. The annual net global warming
    potentials of the REC and CK treatments were 37% and 73% lower, respectively,
    than that of the FP treatment. The water footprint of the REC treatment was 30%
    (the Water Footprint Assessment method) to 37% (the Life Cycle Assessment method)
    less than that of the FP treatment. These results indicate that REC is a promising
    and feasible treatment for ensuring environmentally friendly, and energy-efficient
    sustainable agriculture in the high-yielding regions of the North China Plain.

    The North China Plain (NCP) is one of the most important grain production regions
    in China produced 67% of nation''s wheat and 28% of nation''s maize (NBSC, 2015),
    and wheat-maize rotation is the main cropping system in the region (Tian et al.,
    2017; Zhang et al., 2017a). In the conventional cropping systems, excessive irrigation
    (up to 667 mm yr−1, Shi et al., 2013) and over-fertilization (550 − 600 kg N ha−1,
    Ju et al., 2009; Tan et al., 2017) have been adopted as the key farming practices
    since the 1980s to achieve high crop yields. These had resulted in lower efficiency
    of irrigation water and nutrient use and increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
    and non-point source agricultural pollution (Yang et al., 2015a, b; Huang et al.,
    2017; Tan et al., 2017). To address these challenges, high-output, low-pollution
    agriculture, with highly efficient use of fertilizer and water, has been suggested
    and implemented in recent years by the Chinese government and farmers in the country
    in general and in the NCP in particular (Chen et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015).
    Many studies have been conducted in the NCP on how to improve water and nutrient
    use efficiency and to reduce GHG emissions while maintaining a high crop yield
    (Hartmann et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016a; Meng et al., 2017).
    Trials have been carried out on optimized fertilization and irrigation (Lin et
    al., 2015), a combination of mineral and organic fertilizers (Ding et al., 2013;
    Gao et al., 2015), optimum nitrogen (N) fertilization with straw incorporation
    (Huang et al., 2013a), and deep tillage (Wang et al., 2016b). These investigations
    demonstrated promising agronomic and environmental benefits and have been used
    to make recommendations for better farming practices. However, most of these studies
    focused on only one or two of the above-mentioned measures. In reality, farmers
    need to adopt several measures to improve farming practices and production. A
    key hypothesis is that an integration of the previously mentioned farming practices
    would allow high productivity, efficient utilization of water and fertilizer resources,
    and low GHG emissions. The effectiveness of these practices depends highly on
    edaphic and climatic conditions (Cai et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2017), and therefore
    field studies of only one or two seasons’ duration cannot sufficiently address
    temporal variations across different farming years. Thus, there is an urgent need
    to study the efficacy and sustainability of integrated farming management practices
    through long-term field experiments. Agricultural irrigation is the major source
    of water consumption in agriculture system. In previous evaluations of water utilization,
    the amount directly used for irrigation was used as the main indicator of agricultural
    irrigation use. However, this ignores the indirect water consumption from the
    production chemical fertilizers and other agricultural materials, water utilization
    by the soil, and the effect of fertilizer and pesticide pollution on water resources.
    To address these shortcomings, Hoekstra created the water footprints (WF) concept
    (Hoekstra and Hung, 2002). The WF is a comprehensive indicator of freshwater use
    and has three components: blue, green, and grey water. The green, blue, and grey
    WF components refer to the consumptive use of rainwater, surface and groundwater,
    and the freshwater required to assimilate the load of pollutants, respectively
    (Hoekstra et al., 2011). The WF evaluation broadens the connotation of the traditional
    water resources evaluation system, establishes relationships between physical
    and virtual water, and accurately reflects the ownership of, and demand for, water
    resources. The Water Footprints Assessment (WFA) method is used to calculate water
    resources in agro-ecosystems (Hoekstra et al., 2011). The Life Cycle Assessment
    (LCA) method is also used in agro-ecosystems (Liang, 2009; Liang et al., 2018).
    Ridoutt and Pfister (2010) suggested that the WF should be expressed as a single
    index (H2O-eq) in the same manner that the carbon footprint is expressed as CO2-eq.
    A water stress index has also been introduced to compare the water consumption
    impacts and water scarcity among different countries and regions (Jeswani and
    Azapagic, 2011). Both the LCA and WFA methods can be used to compare the water
    resource utility of different products, services, and systems (Zonderland-Thomassen
    and Ledgard, 2012; Herath et al., 2013; Lovarelli et al., 2016). In the present
    study, to study the environmental problems caused by over application of fertilizer
    in the NCP region, a four-year (from 2011 to 2015) field experiment was carried
    out in an intensively farmed wheat-maize production area in the NCP. The aim of
    the study was to analyse the effects of integrated management practices on crop
    production, N and water utilization, and GHG emission reduction. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Experimental site A long-term field experiment was established
    in October 2008 at the Agro-ecosystem Experiment Station of the China Agricultural
    University, Shandong Province (36.57 °N, 117.59 °E). This area has a temperate
    monsoon climate, with a dry and cold season from October to May, and a wet and
    hot season from June to September. The soil is classified as an aquic inceptisol
    (a calcareous, fluvo-aquic clay loam). The soil has bulk density of 1.5 g cm−3,
    pH of 7.7, soil organic matter (SOM) content of 18.75 g kg−1, and total N (TN)
    content of 1.1 g kg−1. The initial SOM and TN contents in soil layers was shown
    in Table S1.The growing year was from October of the current to October of the
    following year. Daily precipitation and mean air temperature over the experimental
    period was shown in Fig. 1. In summary, annual precipitation and mean air temperature
    were 404 mm and 13.1 °C, respectively, in the 1st year; 775 mm and 12.2 °C in
    the 2nd year; 355 mm and 13.9 °C in the 3rd year; and 466 mm and 13.7 °C in the
    4th year. Download : Download high-res image (261KB) Download : Download full-size

    period. 2.2. Experiment designing and field management A randomized block design
    was employed with four replicates for each of the three treatments: (1) local
    farmers’ conventional practices (FP), based on the local average rate of N fertilization
    and irrigation, maize straw burning (ash was buried into soil), wheat straw incorporation
    (buried into soil), and rotary tillage (∼15 cm) before wheat sown; (2) recommended
    farming management (REC), with optimized N fertilization (balanced N fertilization
    and the partial substitution of mineral N with organic manure), water-saving irrigation,
    wheat and maize straw incorporation (buried into soil), and deep tillage (∼25 cm)
    before wheat sown; and (3) no N fertilization (CK), reduced irrigation, straw
    incorporation (left on the ground), and no tillage. Each experimental plot had
    an area of 25 × 18 m2. Detailed N fertilizer and irrigation over the experimental
    period were presented in Table 1. Table 1. Nitrogen (N) input rate and groundwater

    FP treatment winter wheat was sown in early October, and maize was interplanted
    with wheat at the end of May. For REC and CK treatment the cropping system was
    wheat and maize rotation, winter wheat was sown in early October, summer maize
    was planted in the middle of June. In the FP treatment, urea was applied at 300 kg
    N ha−1 yr−1 for winter wheat and summer maize, respectively. The ratio of N as
    basal fertilizer to top-dressing (at the shooting stage) fertilizer during the
    winter wheat and summer maize seasons was 1:1. In the REC treatment, the amount
    of fertilizer N applied depended on the crop N requirements and the amount of
    residual soil nitrate-N (0–100 cm) present before sowing (balanced N fertilization)
    (Cui et al., 2008). In this practice, nitrate-N was measured before fertilization,
    and the amount of nitrate-N fertilizer was calculated as crop N requirement minus
    the amount of residual soil nitrate-N. For REC, one third of N was applied from
    broiler manure as basal fertilizer for winter wheat and summer maize, and the
    remaining N was supplied from mineral fertilizer (urea). For all the three treatments
    the, phosphorus fertilizer (triple superphosphate) was applied at a rate of 120 kg
    P2O5 ha−1 for winter wheat, and potassium (potassium sulphate) was applied at
    a rate of 100 kg K2O ha−1 for summer maize, and both were applied as basal fertilizer.
    Groundwater (well depth >80 m) was extracted for irrigation. Irrigation times
    were determined according to soil moisture content, winter wheat was irrigated
    2–4 times and maize 2–3 times (100 mm for each application for FP, and 75 mm for
    each application for REC and CK) during the 4-year period. Pesticide and herbicide
    were sprayed during the wheat and maize season. 2.3. Measurement of crop yield
    and GHG emissions Crop yield was measured at harvest in a 6 × 3 m2 area in each
    plot. N quantity in grains was determined using a CN analyser (Thermo Flash EA
    1112 Flash 2000, USA). GHG (N2O and CH4) emissions from 6 October 2011 to 5 October
    2015 for all the treatments at each plot were measured using opaque static chambers
    (area = 0.5 × 0.5 m2, the height was adjusted according to the plant growth),
    as described by Shi et al. (2013). For each measurement, five gas samples, using
    a 60-mL polypropylene syringe, were taken from the chamber headspace with an interval
    of 8 min after the chamber was closed. The fluxes were measured normally twice
    a week. However, following fertilization and/or irrigation events, they were measured
    every day for a continuous period of 7 days. Gas samples were taken between 9:00–11:00
    a.m (Yao et al., 2015). local time and analysed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent
    7820 A, China) within 24 h of sampling. The fluxes and cumulative emissions were
    calculated using a linear model and a linear interpolation method, respectively
    (Hu et al., 2013; Van der Weerden et al., 2016). 2.4. Calculation of Apparent
    N use efficiency, N recovery efficiency, Irrigation water use efficiency, Net
    GHG warming potential, and Greenhouse gas intensity Apparent N use efficiency
    (ANUE, %) was calculated as the ratio of the N amount in crop grains (Ng, kg N
    ha−1) to the amount of mineral and organic fertilizer N applied in the growing
    season (RF, kg N ha−1; Lassaletta et al., 2016): (1) ANUE = Ng /RF N recovery
    efficiency (REN, %) was calculated as the ratio of Ng to total N inputs (Ninputs)
    including mineral and organic fertilizer, atmospheric deposition and irrigation
    (Bouwman et al., 2017): (2) REN = Ng /Ninputs Irrigation water use efficiency
    (IWUE, kg m−3) was defined as the ratio of grain yield (Y, kg ha−1) to the total
    amount of irrigation water (Wg, m3) (Wang et al., 2016a): (3) IWUE = Y/Wg Net
    GHG warming potential (NGWP, kg CO2-eq ha−1) was defined for two types of GHG
    emission: 1) direct N2O and CH4 emissions, and 2) total GHG emissions for farming
    practices, including GHG emissions from the land, fertilizer and pesticide manufacturing,
    transportation, electricity consumption by irrigation, and energy consumption
    by farm tillage. The NGWP from direct emissions was calculated using the following
    equations: (4) GWPdirect = N2O (kg N2O-N ha−1)/28 × 44 × 298 + CH4 (kg CH4-C ha−1)/12 × 16 × 34
    Where 28 is the molecular weight of N in N2O, and 44 is the molecular weight of
    N2O; 12 is the molecular weight of C in CH4, and 16 is the molecular weight of
    CH4; and 298 and 34 are the factors for converting N2O and CH4, respectively,
    to CO2-eq over a 100-year time horizon (IPCC, 2013). NGWP from the total emissions
    was calculated: (5) NGWPtotal = GWPdirect + GWPFertilizer + GWPElectricity + GWPFuel
    + GWPPesticide (6) GWPFertilizer = Organic fertilizer N rate (kg ha−1) × 0.8%
    × 1% × 298 + Organic fertilizer N rate (kg ha−1) × 3% × 298 + Chemical fertilizer
    N rate (kg ha−1) × 8.3 + P2O5 rate (kg ha−1) × 1.50 + K2O (kg ha−1) × 0.98 Where
    0.8% and 3% are the NH3 emission and direct N2O emission factors, respectively,
    from the process of solid broilers manure storage in an intensive system (Huang
    et al., 2012a), and 1% is the N2O emission rate induced by volatile NH3 (IPCC,
    2006); the values 8.30, 1.50, and 0.98 are the CO2-eq emissions associated with
    the manufacture and transportation per unit of chemical fertilizer (Gao et al.,
    2015); and 298 is the factor for converting N2O over a 100-year time horizon (IPCC,
    2013). (7) GWPElectricity = Electricity (kW h ha−1) × 1.30 (8) GWPFuel = Diesel
    fuel (kg ha−1) × 3.93 (9) GWPPesticide = Pesticide (kg ha−1) × 18.0 Where 1.30,
    3.93 and, 18.0 are the CO2-eq emissions associated with electricity generation
    for pumping irrigation water, diesel fuel for farm operations, and pesticides,
    respectively (Huang et al., 2013b). Greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI, kg CO2-eq
    Mg−1 grain yield) was NGWP for the production of a unit of grain (Mosier et al.,
    2006; Shi et al., 2013), and was calculated as follows: (10) GHGI = NGWPTotal/Crop
    yield 2.5. Calculation of water consumption using WFA and LCA method In terms
    of the WF concept, the WF of the wheat-maize system is the sum of the WF of green,
    blue, and grey water in the growing process (Hoekstra et al., 2011; Lu et al.,
    2015). Total WF in agricultural production during a growing season (WFprod) was
    calculated: (11) WFprod = WFgreen + WFblue + WFgrey Where WFgreen, WFblue (the
    irrigation amount during a growth period), and WFgrey are WF of green, blue, and
    grey water, respectively. In the present study, WFgreen is the effective precipitation
    during the crop growth period (Peff t ha−1) and estimated by: (12) WFgreen = min
    (CWU, Peff) (13) Peff = ∑ [(∂×P) × 10] Crop Water Demand for Unit Area (CWU) is
    the crop water requirement, namely season evapotranspiration (mm season−1). According
    to the studies by Huang et al. (2012b) and Liang et al. (2018), the CWU values
    of wheat and maize are 710 and 550 mm, respectively. P is daily precipitation
    (mm) during the growth period, and is the effective utilization coefficient for
    a given precipitation threshold. When P < 5, 5 ≤ P ≤ 50, and P > 50, the value
    of is 0, 1, and 0.8, respectively. The constant 10 is the conversion factor from
    mm to t ha−1. WFgrey is calculated using Eq. (14). (14) WFgrey = AR × α / (Cmax−Cnat)
    AR is the amount of nitrogen applied per unit area (kg ha−1 season−1), and is
    the leaching rate. According to Liang et al. (2018), the leaching coefficients
    for wheat and maize are 14% and 16%, respectively. Cmax is the maximum allowable
    nitrate concentration (set to 10 mg L−1). Cnat is the natural nitrate background
    concentration and is generally regarded as 0. Water Footprint intensity (WFI)
    was calculated as the total WF divided by the grain yield. LCA is a tool to measure
    the various environmental impacts caused by products from cradle to grave, and
    Berger and Finkbeiner (2010) reviewed thirteen different methods enabling the
    assessment of water use impacts in LCA. In this study, the methods of Xu et al.
    (2013) and Milà et al. (2009) is adopted to calculate the WF based on LCA, and
    the system boundary is from cradle to farm gate. The WF calculated by LCA includes
    direct WFblue (water consumption of irrigation water), indirect WFblue (water
    consumption in fertilizer, pesticide, fuel, and electricity production process)
    and the impact of land use. The water consumption in the production of fertilizer,
    pesticide, fuel and electricity was calculated according to the methods of Liang,
    (2009). The water consumption by land use was calculated as shown in Eq. (15).
    (15) Land Use Impact (LUI) is the impact of land use change on water resources.
    When Peff is less than the water requirement in the crop growth period, LUI is
    0. When Peff is more than the water requirement in the crop growth period, LUI
    is the difference between Peff and CWU. In this study, LUI is 0. The water stress
    index from the experimental area (0.922) and global (0.602) were used to calculate
    the regional and global water equivalent index of the wheat-maize rotation system
    (Xu et al., 2013). (16) WFdistrict = (direct WFblue + indirect WFblue) × 0.922
    (17) WFglobal = WFdistrict / 0.602 2.6. Statistical analysis The SPSS 22.0 software
    (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) was used for the statistical data analysis. Statistically
    significant differences were tested using an analysis of one-way ANOVA. Significant
    differences were assumed when P < 0.05. Correlation and linear or nonlinear regression
    analyses were used to test the relationships between seasonal N fertilizer input
    and seasonal N2O emissions. 3. Results 3.1. N utilization, groundwater utilization,
    and crop yield For REC treatment, the average N inputs during the wheat season,
    maize season, and annually were 51%, 36%, and 43% lower, respectively, than the
    FP treatment (Table 1). In the first 2 years, the N input in the wheat season
    was lower than for the other years. The average N input in the wheat season over
    the 4 years was higher than that in the maize season. During the wheat season,
    maize season, and annual period REC treatment reduced water use by 25%, 32%, and
    28% when compared with FP treatment, respectively. Furthermore, the REC treatment
    had similar wheat yields (7.1 ± 0.4 Mg ha−1) and maize yields (9.4 ± 0.7 Mg ha−1)
    to that of FP treatment (Table S2). The CK treatment saved 300 kg N ha−1 per season
    and had the same water consumption as REC treatment. However, the wheat and maize
    yields were 2.5 ± 0.1 and 5.4 ± 0.9 Mg ha−1, respectively, which was about 64%
    and 44% lower, respectively, than that of FP treatment (Table S2). In all 4 years
    of the experiment, the REC treatment significantly (P <  0.05) improved ANUE and
    IWUE when compared with the FP treatment (Fig. 2A and C). The average ANUE, REN,
    and IWUE of FP and REC was shown in Table S2. The average annual ANUE, REN, and
    IWUE of the REC treatment were 79%, 62%, and 41% higher, respectively, than that
    of the FP treatment. Download : Download high-res image (149KB) Download : Download

    the standard error. Different lowercase letters indicate significant differences
    between treatments at P < 0.05. 3.2. N2O and CH4 emissions From 2011 to 2015,
    the FP treatment cumulative N2O emissions ranged from 0.95 to 1.37 N2O-N ha−1,
    and from 1.89 to 2.81 N2O-N ha−1, during the winter and summer maize seasons,
    respectively. The FP treatment average N2O emissions were 1.12 ± 0.18 and 2.32 ± 0.47 kg
    N2O-N ha−1 during the winter wheat and summer maize seasons, respectively (Table
    2). The REC treatment demonstrated significantly, but not consistently, lower
    N2O emissions (39% for the 1st year, 37% for the 2nd year, 1% for the 3rd year,
    and 31% for the 4th year) than the FP treatment (Table 2). CK treatment decreased
    N2O emissions significantly (by 60%, 75%, and 71% during the wheat season, maize
    season, and annual period, respectively), compared with FP treatment (Table 2).
    The N2O emission in the maize season accounted for 63%–72% of annual N2O emissions
    and was significantly higher than that in the wheat season for the 4-year study
    (Table 2). During the maize season, N2O emissions were significantly lower for
    the REC treatment than for the FP treatment. However, during the wheat season,
    the N2O emissions for the REC and the FP treatment were similar. Thus, the differences
    between FP and REC treatment in annual N2O emissions were mainly caused by the
    maize season. Soil acted as a sink for CH4 in all treatments during the study
    period. The cumulative CH4 uptake in the REC and CK treatment were similar in
    the wheat season and the maize season, and were 31% and 37% lower, respectively,
    than that of FP treatment (Table 2). Table 2. N2O emission and CH4 uptake during

    NGWP and GHGI The net global warming potential, i.e. direct GHG emission via N2O
    and CH4, and indirect GHG emission from farming operations and inputs (fertilization,
    power, fuel, and pesticide) was calculated (Table S3). Most of the GHG originated
    from fertilizer manufacturing (7%–47%), electricity used for irrigation (35%–67%),
    and field N2O emissions (12%–15%). The mean annual GHGI of three treatments had
    significantly difference and followed the sequence of FP > CK > REC (Fig. 2 B).
    The mean annual NGWP of three treatments had significantly difference and followed
    the sequence of FP > REC > CK (Fig. 2D). 3.4. Water consumption The WFprod was
    calculated using the WFA method. The total WF of FP, REE, and CK treatment was
    18639, 13,216.5, and 8076.5 (t ha−1), respectively (Table 3). Of these, the WFgreen
    showed no difference in three treatments in the same year because the precipitation
    was obviously the same for all treatments. The WFblue of FP treatment was more
    than that of REC and CK treatment in every year because the irrigation of REC
    and CK treatment was 25% less than that of FP treatment. The WFgrey followed the
    sequence FP > REC > CK because of the different N fertilizer application rates.
    The total WF followed the sequence of FP > REC > CK. WFgreen, WFblue, and WFgrey
    accounted for 22%–51%, 30%–49%, and 39%–48%, respectively, of the total WF. The
    total WFI of the REC treatment was the lowest. There was no difference between
    the FP and CK treatment. Table 3. The green, blue and grey quality Water Footprint

    4). The corresponding WFdistrict of the FP, REC CK was 5187.8, 3688.9, and 3655.9
    (t ha−1), respectively. In this method, WFblue was divided into two parts: direct
    water use, and indirect water use from farming operations and inputs (fertilization,
    power, fuel, and pesticide). The direct WFblue component accounted for more than
    95% of the total WFblue. The total WFI followed the sequence of CK > FP > REC.

    Data are means ± standard error (n = 4). Different lowercase letters indicate
    significant differences between treatments at P < 0.05. 4. Discussion 4.1. GHG
    emissions influenced by farming practices and natural factors The main source
    of N2O was nitrification and denitrification reactions. These reactions are affected
    by N application, combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizer, soil
    moisture, and temperature (Smith et al., 2010; Ju et al., 2011; Scheer et al.,
    2012; Ding et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2015;
    Huang et al., 2017). In our research, we study the influence of different agricultural
    practices combined actionin on GHG emissions. These results indicated that in
    the maize season, N2O emission mainly depends on the N fertilizer application
    rate. The N fertilizer application rate for the FP was greater than that for the
    REC and CK. The maize season N2O emissions for FP treatment was significantly
    higher than for the REC and CK treatment. The N2O emission for the CK treatment
    was the lowest in the experiment because no N fertilizer was used in the CK treatment
    (Table 1, Table 2). The organic fertilizer application in the REC treatment may
    be one of the reasons for the reduced N2O emissions. High soil moisture increases
    the abundance of nitrite reducers and nirK gene copy numbers of denitrification
    microbes in soil, and these will facilitate an increase in N2O emissions (Szukics
    et al., 2010). The irrigation amounts were limited in the REC treatment, and this
    may result in decreased N2O emissions compared with the FP treatment. There was
    no significant difference in N2O emissions for FP and REC treatments in the wheat
    season because nitrification and denitrification reactions were weak in the winter
    wheat season due to the lower soil temperature. In the present study, N2O emissions,
    fertilizer N used, and power used for irrigation accounted for 87%–93% of the
    positive GWP from all sources in the FP and REC treatments. The negative GWP from
    CH4 uptakes contributed less than 1% of NGWP (Table S3). These results are similar
    to those from previous studies (Huang et al., 2013a, b; Gao et al., 2015). The
    NGWP and GHGI of FP treatment was the highest of the three treatments because
    the N2O emissions, and the N fertilizer and water application were higher than
    for the other treatments (Table 1 and Table S3). The higher N2O emission was attributed
    to higher N fertilizer and water application (Scheer et al., 2012; Huang et al.,
    2017.) Although the NGWP of the REC treatment was significantly higher than for
    the CK treatment, the GHGI for REC and CK treatments was not significantly different
    because of the higher crop yield for the REC treatment. 4.2. Nitrogen and water
    use efficiency The NUE for REC treatment decreased with increased N application
    rates with a significant negative correlation (R2 = −0.98, p < 0.01). Similar
    trends were found in previous studies (Hartmann et al., 2015; Ayadi et al., 2016;
    Lassaletta et al., 2016). For the FP treatment, the NUE showed variations for
    different years, even when the management practices were the same. This pattern
    was most likely the result of the variation in rainfall patterns and in precipitation
    amounts (Fig. 1, Yan et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016c). The combined application
    of organic and inorganic fertilizer in the REC treatment was another reason for
    REC treatment having a higher NUE than FP treatment. The combined application
    of organic and inorganic fertilizer could have increased the NUE because the organic
    fertilizer could have decreased the N loss (Wei et al., 2016). Thus, as a result
    of balanced fertilization, the N application rate for the REC treatment was less
    than for the FP treatment. The IWUE for the REC treatment was higher than that
    for FP treatment. Previous studies have shown that limiting irrigation could increase
    soil water content and maintain crop yields (Wang et al., 2016a). The application
    of organic fertilizer also affects IWUE because organic fertilizer can increase
    the amount of large soil aggregate, inhibit soil moisture evaporation, and improve
    the soil water content (Hati et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2009). Future studies
    are planned that will analyse the role of soil aggregate at the experimental site.
    The WFA and LCA methods were used to calculate water consumption (Table 3, Table
    4). These methods were used to evaluate the water consumption of the wheat-maize
    rotation system and showed that the water consumption of wheat and maize in the
    REC were 30% and 37% lower, respectively, than FP. Xu et al. (2013) and Liang
    et al. (2018) used WFA method to estimate the water consumption of wheat and maize
    in NCP. The result showed that the total WFI of wheat-maize rotation in NCP was
    2267 m3 t−1. In the present study, the WFI of FP (2281 m3 t−1) determined using
    the WFA method was similar to the results of Xu and Liang. The results for REC
    treatment are far less than these values, which indicates that good progress is
    being made in reducing water consumption. 4.3. Validity analysis of the WFA and
    LCA methods The WFA and LCA methods have been widely used for agro-ecosystem analysis
    (Sun et al., 2013; Zonderland-Thomassen and Ledgard, 2012; Herath et al., 2013;
    Cao et al., 2015; Chiu et al., 2015; Lovarelli et al., 2016). In the present study,
    the WF and WFI of the REC was significantly less than that of the FP according
    to the results of both the WFA and LCA methods. This illustrates that both methods
    are able to correctly reflect the change of investment and management modes by
    a changed WF and WFI. The WF and WFI evaluated using the LCA method were less
    than those obtained using the WFA method. This was caused by the inconsistent
    factors under consideration. The WFA method takes into account real water consumption
    (WFgreen and WFblue) and virtual water consumption (WFgrey) in the farmland system.
    However, the LCA method considers the water consumption in the agricultural process
    without calculating WFgreen and WFgrey. The study results showed that the water
    consumption in the agriculture process was less than 130 (t ha−1) in all three
    treatments using LCA method, but WFgreen and WFgrey was more than 3000 (t ha−1)
    in FP and REC treatments using WFA method. Thus, the WF evaluated by the LCA method
    was less than that determined by the WFA method. Xu et al. (2013) used the WFA
    and LCA methods to evaluate the WF of wheat farming in the Hai, Yellow, Huai,
    and Yangtze River regions. Their results showed that when the WFA method was used,
    the WF of wheat farming in southern China (Huai and Yangtze Rivers regions) was
    more than in northern China (Hai and Yellow River regions). In contrast, when
    the LCA method was used, the WF in northern China was more than that in southern
    China. Xu et al. (2013) suggested that when the WFA method was used for agricultural
    systems, it could not reflect the real situation and needed improvement. Canals
    et al. (2009, 2010) suggested that green water use should not ordinarily be taken
    into account in the LCA assessment of water use because these flows are part of
    the natural hydrological cycle whereby precipitation returns to the atmosphere
    via evapotranspiration from vegetation. To obtain a more comprehensive evaluation,
    researchers are increasingly using several methods, including WFA and LCA, to
    analyse water resource consumption (Zonderland-Thomassen and Ledgard, 2012; Herath
    et al., 2013; Lovarelli et al., 2016). For example, Herath et al. (2013) used
    volumetric WF, stress-weighted WFA, and the LCA-based hydrological water balance
    method to estimate the water footprint of New Zealand wine production. Liang et
    al. (2018) used two methods (WFA and LCA) to analyse agricultural ecological engineering
    in northern Beijing, China. Each method has its own advantages and limitations.
    The LCA method has the advantage of considering indirect water consumption, while
    the WFA has the advantage of taking WFgreen into account, which is an important
    factor affecting the quantity of blue water. Inconsistencies in these methods
    have been noted, and are being addressed, by many researchers and international
    organizations (Ridoutt and Pfister, 2010; Jeswani and Azapagic, 2011; Herath et
    al., 2013; Lovarelli et al., 2016; ISO, 2014). 4.4. Overall performance of integrated
    management practices When compared with the FP treatment, the REC treatment successfully
    decreased N and groundwater application rates while maintaining high crop yields,
    and improved N and groundwater use efficiencies (Table 1 and Table S2). These
    results are in accord with previous studies carried out in the NCP (Li et al.,
    2015; Liu et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). Balanced fertilization and reasonable,
    limited irrigation could increase water and nutrient utilization in the soil and
    maintain high crop yields (Hartmann et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016b). Other studies
    have suggested that the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers,
    or deep tillage, can increase crop yields (Basir et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016;
    Omara et al., 2017). As well as maintaining high crop yields, the REC treatment
    can reduce N by 260 kg ha−1, water by 1560 m3 ha−1, and CO2-eq emissions by 3.5 Mg
    ha−1 when compared with the FP treatment for one crop rotation cycle. There were
    25.6 × 103 ha of cultivated land in Huantai County in 2016 (data from the Huantai
    Agricultural Yearbook of 2016). If the REC system was used instead of the FP system,
    reductions of 6.66 × 106 kg N, 39.94 × 106 m3 water, and 89.6 × 103 Mg of CO2-eq
    emissions could be made in one crop rotation cycle. In a study of the NCP, the
    N and water application were found to be 468 kg ha−1 and 5790 m3 ha−1, and the
    GHG emissions were 9.5 Mg ha−1 in one crop rotation cycle (Zhang et al., 2017b).
    If the REC system was adopted in the NCP, it could reduce N by 128 kg ha−1 (27.4%),
    water by 2030 m3  ha−1 (34%) and GHG emissions by 1.7 Mg ha−1 (17.9%). The cost
    of N fertilizer and water was 0.96 dollars kg−1 and 0.07 dollars m−3, respectively.
    If REC system was used in the NCP, it could reduce 271.62 dollars ha−1 in one
    crop rotation cycle. In addition, there is a great potential for mitigating GHG
    emissions by using integrated management practices: first, the long-term high
    inputs of carbon residues (wheat straw, maize straw, and organic fertilizer) in
    the REC treatment would increase soil carbon storage and offset part of the positive
    GWP (Lu et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2014), and reduce GHG emissions caused by
    maize straw burning (Acreche et al., 2013; Tubiello et al., 2013); second, changing
    the type and storage management of organic fertilizer could also reduce GHG emissions
    (Huang et al., 2012a). 5. Conclusions This study showed that an optimized farming
    practices REC is an environmentally friendly and energy-efficient sustainable
    agriculture farming system in the North China Plain. Balanced N fertilization,
    water-saving irrigation, and straw incorporation were optimized and integrated
    in REC farming practices that resulted in reducing N and irrigation water application,
    mitigating GHG emissions, and maintaining crop yield. Beneficial environmental
    effects, higher resource use efficiency, and high crop yields were achieved sustainably
    over the 4-year study period in this study. These results have important implications
    for agriculture in the NCP, where intensive agriculture requires urgent improvements.

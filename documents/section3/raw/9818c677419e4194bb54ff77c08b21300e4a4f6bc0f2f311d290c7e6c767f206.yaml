    system using IoT Article 05 January 2022 1 Introduction A particular volume of
    water is required to be provided to a crop at predetermined intervals throughout
    the period in which it is developing. Irrigation is critical to the accomplishment
    of any agricultural project. The process of supplying water to plants via the
    use of mechanical methods is referred to as irrigation. Particularly helpful in
    areas prone to drought or subject to unpredictable rainfall. It is impossible
    to overestimate the significance of water in the life of a plant. Because the
    principles of water management vary depending on the weather, it is essential
    to have a solid understanding of how the soil and plants interact with one another.
    The soil may be sandy, silty, clay, or any number of other textures. Every type
    of soil has both advantages and disadvantages, depending on how it was formed.
    Consider, for example, the high water absorption capacity of sand. However, the
    nutrients are immediately flushed down the drain. On the other hand, silty soil
    is made up of extremely small particles and has an exceptional capacity to store
    water for extended periods of time. Sadly, water has a difficult time draining
    through this soil because of its structure. The quality of the soil in all of
    its facets, including its ability to retain water and nutrients, is absolutely
    necessary for agricultural production. Therefore, in order to effectively manage
    the water requirements of the various types of soil, it is essential to have a
    solid understanding of the characteristics of the soil [1]. Even if there is sufficient
    precipitation in many agricultural places, there is not enough moisture for crop
    development for a number of different reasons. These causes include a lack of
    storage capacity and/or precipitation that falls at inconvenient times. It has
    been stated that the rainfall is insufficient if it is less than one hundred centimeters,
    as the irrigation system requires at least that much rain in order to function
    properly [2]. Irrigation is also necessary in regions that see fluctuating amounts
    of precipitation, such as the dry Sahel, which receives a lot of rain during the
    monsoon season but suffers from dryness during the winter months. In order to
    assist in the development of crops at times of the year when there is a deficiency
    in rainfall, water irrigation is necessary. The majority of the newest and highest-quality
    hybrid crop varieties need for a substantial amount of watering. As a consequence
    of this, it is very necessary to manage the flow of water in order to improve
    the yield and quality of the crops. Even the most common varieties of sugarcane
    and rice require a substantial amount of water to cultivate, which is demonstrated
    by the extensive and illustrious history of irrigation in the basin. This is something
    that has been well researched and written about. Each individual farmer is responsible
    for carrying out all aspects of agricultural labor, from sowing seeds and picking
    weeds to fertilizing, watering, and harvesting their crops. This process requires
    a significant investment of both time and water, in addition to a substantial
    amount of manual labor [3]. The method includes a number of decision-making phases
    that are spread out across the course of the agricultural cycle to enhance the
    productiveness of farming. Precision agriculture assists farmers in mitigating
    these issues while also increasing crop yields. This is accomplished by continuously
    measuring the soil’s temperature, humidity, temperature gradient, and pH. There
    are a number of industrialized countries in which precision farming is carried
    out exclusively through the use of the Internet of Things. The process of a computer
    being able to learn new abilities by itself through observation and repeated practice
    is referred to as machine learning [4]. In order for the algorithms to learn from
    the input datasets, gradually train the samples, and increase their performance,
    the equations need to be modified. Its foundation in real-world settings enables
    it to develop decision-making capabilities with relatively minimal input from
    humans. Machine learning-based algorithms are increasingly being used in every
    sector of the economy. On the other hand, the accuracy might be very different
    depending on the quality of the data that was utilized. As a consequence of this,
    the representations of the datasets and the variables that are being targeted
    are both essential components of the machine learning approaches [5]. The ability
    to predict the properties of the soil and plants, as well as the water level,
    together with other meteorological information, is vital for the irrigation action
    timing plan used in precision agriculture. When designing irrigation schedules,
    it is important to highlight the kind of water distribution and to take into account
    the buffer time of the system. Whether deciding when to water plants, the moisture
    level of the soil is an extremely important aspect. As soon as the set amount
    is reached, the playing field will start to get flooded. When it comes to the
    Internet of Things, new agricultural systems are beneficial because of the simplicity
    with which they make farm maintenance. The creation of such an automated system
    makes it possible to hydrate plants without the need for human involvement. Several
    different sectors have begun implementing IoT in order to increase their level
    of production. In today’s world, the Internet of Things is also being applied
    in farming in the form of smart farming. Devices connected to the internet of
    things have the ability to monitor the weather, find solutions to problems with
    irrigation, and assist farmers in increasing their crops in incremental steps.
    Innovative ideas are now necessary in the agriculture industry as a direct result
    of the growing population around the world and the accompanying rise in food consumption.
    Farmers can benefit from the Internet of Things in a number of ways, including
    increased crop productivity, improved harvesting yield, and proper field management;
    water monitoring; water usage limitation; crop monitoring; environmental impact
    prediction in advance; use of fewer people and fewer resources; prediction of
    environmental impact in advance; monitoring of water; and monitoring of crops.
    As a result of increased worldwide demand for freshwater and the concurrent expansion
    in global population, the central area of the planet is currently facing a severe
    lack of available freshwater resources. It is anticipated that by the year 2050,
    the current world population of 7.2 billion would have increased to over 9 billion.
    The vast majority of freshwater is consumed for uses related to household and
    agricultural production. The majority of industrialised countries are in dire
    need of intelligent irrigation systems since the rapid advancement of technology
    has rendered them indispensable [6]. The Smart Irrigation System is equipment
    that is considered to be at the cutting edge of technology when it comes to managing
    the flow of water in agricultural infrastructure. The SIS controller will automatically
    change the irrigation schedule so that it is optimal for the conditions of the
    soil, the current weather, and the prediction for the next week. The water-soil
    interaction as well as the crop water demand that goes along with it may both
    be established via the process of characterising the soil feature. Embedded system
    components, such as a microprocessor, together with the associated timers, sensors,
    and electrical valves, are responsible for regulating the flow of water in autonomous
    irrigation systems. As a result of this, the system is able to work in a more
    efficient manner. Controls for volume and timing, in addition to sensors that
    monitor the moisture content of the soil, are a few examples of automated irrigation.
    The controllers of the intelligent irrigation system each have their own embedded
    intelligence, which works in conjunction with the other integrated components
    of the system. These sophisticated controls keep an eye on the weather as well
    as other aspects of the surrounding environment. Based on their findings, they
    modify watering schedules and quantities so that water is neither wasted nor wasted
    too quickly. You have to be aware that the most recent generation of intelligent
    irrigation controllers set the watering schedule for the irrigation system based
    on weather forecasts. People’s confidence in the correctness of the data projected
    is essential to the operation of such a system since it relies on their input.
    This article presents IoT based Sensor integrated intelligent irrigation system
    for agriculture industry. IoT based humidity and soil sensors are used to collect
    soil related data. This data is stored in a centralized cloud. Features are selected
    by CFS algorithm. This will help in discarding irrelevant data. Clustering of
    data is performed by K means algorithm. This will help in keeping similar data
    together. Then classification model is build using the SVM, Random Forest and
    Naïve Bayes algorithm. Model is trained, validated and tested using the acquired
    data. Historical soil and humidity related data is also used in training the model.
    Section 2 presents literature survey of existing work related to intelligent irrigation
    system. Section 3 depicts the methodology part. Section 4 presents result analysis
    and discussion. This section includes performance comparison on the basis of certain
    parameters. Section 5 contains conclusion. 2 Literature survey Weakly-Secured
    Networks, often known as WSNs, are an emerging technology that have the potential
    to completely transform the agricultural industry. Maurya and Jain were kind enough
    to supply details on how to make efficient use of fuzzy logic in agricultural
    precision farming [7]. They assert that the information collected by field sensors
    is transmitted to a base station, which is then delivered to a centralised location.
    Through the use of a threshold hybrid route, the information that has been received
    by the sensors is transmitted to the base station. The authors use fuzzy logic
    to select the best cluster head in order to bring down the total amount of energy
    consumed. Farmers are able to utilise the data received by the base station to
    figure out how much water should be used for irrigation in various parts of their
    property by using the information. Farmers need to implement practises of precision
    agriculture in order to enhance their productivity. If this is the case, implementing
    WSN may significantly help farmers and other players in the agricultural sector,
    notably government irrigation agencies, make great judgements that aid in the
    forecasting of irrigation demands and crop yields. This might be a significant
    benefit of adopting WSN. A method for autonomous precision farming was developed
    by Dong et al. [8], and it makes use of centre pivot irrigation systems. This
    technological advancement makes use of sensor networks that are placed in the
    ground in order to monitor environmental elements in a field, such as the temperature
    of the soil and the moisture levels. As a result, sensors are installed, initial
    power settings are defined, and the network is maintained on a consistent basis
    in order to guarantee the most efficient utilisation of energy. In the past, a
    number of different user applications have been developed to automate and make
    the task of managing and scheduling irrigation systems more straightforward. Vellidis
    and his colleagues came up with a system that allows for more effective watering
    of cotton crops [9]. In order to establish the soil water balance in their system,
    the researchers analysed data sets collected from a variety of cotton-growing
    locations. An android mobile application was developed by the author with the
    help of the datasets. In addition to that, they have designed their app in such
    a way that it can pull weather information from surrounding weather stations.
    In order to achieve optimal levels of cotton production, the software was designed
    to carry out automated planning of the irrigation systems on the basis of the
    calculated irrigation requirements arrived at by applying both local and downloaded
    meteorological data. Imam et al. [10] conducted a study of the challenges associated
    with the design of wireless sensor networks and intelligent humidity sensors for
    use in precision agriculture. This was done with the goal of maximising the benefits
    that could be obtained. In the context of precision farming, they compared the
    performance of several microcontroller families and sensor node units with one
    another. In addition to this, an inventory of relative humidity sensor requirements
    along with modelling and interface methodologies was produced by them. Chen et
    al. [11] suggested that precision farming would be impossible without the use
    of agricultural IoT systems. Several farmers have benefited greatly from the automated
    control and data monitoring systems. The agriculture industry is rapidly turning
    to the use of machine learning in response to the pressing need to enhance traditionally
    employed practises. The capabilities of the IoT to perform remote monitoring and
    data collecting help farmers save both time and effort thanks to the utilisation
    of preexisting internet infrastructure as well as mobile and web-based applications.
    The Internet of Things system used in agriculture incorporates a wide range of
    functions, one of the most important of which is irrigation. As a result of developments
    in technology that have rendered conventional farming methods archaic, people
    are more interested in modern irrigation methods than they are in traditional
    farming. Traditional agricultural methods are no longer viable. The Internet of
    Things would be of enormous use to farmers since it would save them the time and
    effort necessary for manual monitoring of their fields. This is a big deterrent
    for many people living in metropolitan areas, despite the abundance of farmland.
    Farmers would gain greatly from the IoT. Data from sensors stored in the cloud
    might potentially be combined with methods of machine learning in order to provide
    users with assistance in planning for future output. A novel Internet of Things
    (IoT) enabled smart system was presented by Akshay and Ramesh [12] to predict
    the quantity of irrigation that is required for the field by sensing characteristics
    such as soil moisture, humidity, and temperature using a machine learning algorithm.
    This was accomplished by Akshay and Ramesh’s novel smart system. We resort to
    the K-closest neighbour strategy in order to circumvent the overfitting problem
    that occurs with the more traditional K-means and SVM methods. The outcomes of
    processing data using 3 weeks’ worth of predefined data are detailed, illustrating
    how the recommended method''s usage of the K-nearest neighbour algorithm may produce
    a completely automated irrigation system. The predictions made by the recommended
    system have a high degree of accuracy. The groundwater that is utilised for irrigation,
    home uses, and industrial reasons was analysed by Sarakutty et al. [13] in this
    particular paper. The writers also mention that in many extensive rural regions,
    irrigation is done with groundwater rather than surface water. Due to the fact
    that water is required for all forms of life on Earth, the problem of water conservation
    is an urgent one that has not yet been resolved. The global water system boosts
    the incomes and productivity of rural areas by providing assistance to farmers
    in reducing the impacts of drought and the variable nature of the weather. Irrigation
    is the most significant consumer of drinkable water but also contributes significantly
    to the depletion of ground water. The use of ground water is an unavoidable outcome
    brought about by the rising demand for agricultural goods. Because of this, it
    is very necessary to adopt cutting-edge technology in irrigation in order to make
    more efficient use of the water that is available. In a smart irrigation system
    enabled by the Internet of Things, in order to minimise the amount of water that
    is used for irrigation while yet being able to accurately estimate the rate at
    which soil moisture is being drained, Singh and others Data collected from field
    sensors and forecasts of the weather that may be available online are used to
    generate estimates of the amount of moisture in the soil. The GBRT has been demonstrated
    to be the most accurate of the several ML approaches that can be used to estimate
    the soil''s moisture content. The presented strategies have the potential to be
    a fruitful research avenue for reducing the amount of water required for irrigation.
    Pratyush Reddy and colleagues [14] have developed an intelligent irrigation system
    that is able to forecast the amount of water that a crop will require by making
    use of an algorithm that is designed for machine learning. The amount of water
    that is required for agricultural purposes may be approximated based on a number
    of different criteria, the moisture content, temperature, and humidity being the
    three most essential of these. The system’s sensors for measuring temperature,
    humidity, and wetness send data to a central CPU, which then links the device
    to the cloud. These sensors are placed in an agricultural field. The data gathered
    in the field is input into a decision tree algorithm, which is an effective tool
    for machine learning and enables efficient result prediction. Kirtana et al. [15]
    produced a work that combines the power of the internet of things (IoT) with an
    algorithm for machine learning in order to automate and speed up the process of
    developing new agricultural techniques. The planning and implementation of a smart
    irrigation system are described in depth in this article. This system makes use
    of machine learning techniques in order to fully and correctly automate the watering
    process. The sensor module is powered by solar energy, which results in a reduction
    in the system''s overall energy consumption and an improvement in the lifetime
    of the system. Singh and Sobti [16] investigated the potential applications of
    several ML algorithms in the field of agriculture as part of their research. In
    addition, the report shed light on the difficulties associated with merging IoT
    and WSN in order to achieve precision agriculture. It has come to light that the
    primary problems stem from a deficiency in intelligent infrastructure, accurate
    sensing technologies, careless water use, and an inability to predict important
    components that are required for irrigation. Therefore, according to the author,
    there is a significant demand for methods of machine learning that are both effective
    and efficient. 3 Methodology In this section, Fig. 1 presents IoT based Sensor
    integrated intelligent irrigation system for agriculture industry. IoT based humidity
    and soil sensors are used to collect soil related data. This data is stored in
    a centralized cloud. Features are selected by CFS algorithm. This will help in
    discarding irrelevant data. Clustering of data is performed by K means algorithm.
    This will help in keeping similar data together. Then classification model is
    build using the SVM, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes algorithm. Model is trained,
    validated and tested using the acquired data. Historical soil and humidity related
    data is also used in training the model. Fig. 1 IoT based Sensor integrated intelligent
    irrigation system for agriculture industry Full size image Important features
    are selected using CGS algorithm. K-Means Clustering [17] is one of the most common
    “Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques,” and if you want to evaluate the organisation
    of your data, you may make use of this technique, which gives you the opportunity
    to do so. It is a process that divides the dataset into a predetermined number
    of subsets in an iterative manner (clusters). In addition to making certain that
    the clusters do not intersect with one another, we checked to see that the data
    points contained within each cluster were as analogous to one another as was practically
    possible. The elements were grouped together into clusters according to their
    distances from the cluster''s centre, with the elements that were located the
    furthest away receiving the least amount of weight. The K-Means Clustering Algorithm
    was successful in explaining 86.6% of the variation in the data that was observed.
    K indicates that there is less variance inside a group but a greater degree of
    diversity between groups. A classifier known as a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    [18] can be utilised to accomplish the task of separating data into linear and
    nonlinear categories. If you have more than one different group, support vector
    machine analysis can guide you through the process of building a hyperplane that
    maximises the distances that separate them. The number of classes must be added
    to the number of features to arrive at the total number of hyperplanes. The precise
    positioning and orientation of the hyperplanes can be determined by examining
    the points that make up the supports vector. With the assistance of these support
    vectors, it is possible to expand the margins of the hyperplanes. Support vector
    machines, often known as SVMs, are comprised of mathematical functions known as
    kernels. These kernels accept data as input and output it in the appropriate format.
    SVM kernels are available in a wide variety of shapes, such as linear, radial
    basis function, polynomial, and sigmoidal, amongst others. These kernels are included
    in accordance with the manner in which the data is dispersed. During the course
    of this investigation, we developed a support vector machine (SVM) classification
    model by making use of radial basis functions. A random forest (RF) is a type
    of statistical analysis in which numerous individual decision trees are blended
    to generate a single forest. In the end, the ensemble forecast that was generated
    by many disparate models (tress) is superior to the prediction that was generated
    by any one prediction model. RF can be applied in classification in addition to
    its use in regression analysis, which is one of its more common applications.
    The research led to the development of the classification RF, which utilises three
    hundred trees. Out of bag error decreases with rising tree counts, but eventually
    levels off at 50 trees, which may be used to analyse the error rate by creating
    a plot. In other words, the error rate can be evaluated by drawing a plot [19].
    The Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm is a type of supervised machine learning that is
    based on Bayes'' theorem as well as the concept that the features that are utilised
    as predictors are independent of one another within a particular class. The Naive
    Bayes model outperforms a large number of other sophisticated classifiers and
    is notably helpful for making multiclass predictions with enormous datasets. It
    is possible to calculate the posterior probability with the assistance of Bayes''
    Theorem. The posterior probability, denoted by the symbol P(W|Y), is computed
    using the formula P(Y|W) * P(W)/P(Y), where P(W) represents the prior probability
    of the predictor, P(Y|W) represents the probability of the predictor given class,
    and P(Y|W) represents the prior probability of the class. We were able to generate
    a density map for each of the seven predictor variables with the help of the Naive
    Bayes function [20]. 4 Result analysis and discussion We created a dataset of
    several environmental parameters such as soil moisture, Humidity, Temperature,
    Pressure, and Luminosity. To create comprehensive data set with all important
    parameters, we have used data sets available at [21]. Rice crop related data set
    has 42665 records. 35000 records used to train the classification model and 7665
    records used to test the classification model. IoT based soil and humidity sensors
    are used to acquire data. Features are selected by CFS algorithm. Results are
    represented in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Amount of fresh water saved by proposed
    technique is presented in Fig. 7. Accuracy, precision, specificity, recall and

    the properties of the soil and plants, as well as the water level and other weather
    information. This is important for the irrigation timing plan. When making irrigation
    schedules, it''s important to pay attention to the type of water distribution
    and take the system''s buffer time into account. The level of moisture in the
    soil is a very important part of deciding when to water plants. When the set amount
    is reached, the playing field will start to get flooded.This article presented

    for the agricultural sector. In order to collect data pertaining to the soil,
    humidity and soil sensors based on the internet of things are utilised. This information
    is kept in a centralised cloud storage system. The CFS algorithm is responsible
    for the selection of features. This will aid in removing irrelevant data. The
    K means approach is used to conduct the clustering of the data. This will assist
    in keeping related data together in one place. The SVM, Random Forest, and Naive
    Bayes algorithms are utilised next in the construction of the classification model.
    Using the data that was obtained, the model is then trained, verified, and tested.
    The training of the model additionally makes use of data relating to the soil''s
    history and the humidity. The K-means SVM hybrid classifier is producing superior
    results for classification, the forecast of water demand, and the conservation
    of fresh water through intelligent irrigation. Hybrid Kmeans SVM is saving fresh
    water up to 20 percent by intelligent irrigation. Data availability The data that

    behavior in cattle may occur for several reasons including enabling social interactions,

    may occur more frequently at higher ambient temperatures, possibly due to sharing

    Here we demonstrate how bunching behavior is associated with higher ambient temperatures
    in a barn-housed UK dairy herd. A real-time local positioning system was used,

    position and activity of a commercial dairy herd (∼100 cows) in a freestall barn
    continuously at high temporal resolution for 4 mo between August and November

    Climate change is a pressing global issue which is increasingly concerning to
    farmers as changes in environmental conditions can directly affect animal physiology,
    possibly leading to heat stress. Heat stress occurs when excess body heat cannot
    be dissipated adequately to maintain thermal equilibrium, usually due to a combination
    of external factors such as elevated ambient temperature, high humidity, and lack
    of ventilation (Wang et al., 2020). Indoor-housed livestock are at high risk for
    heat stress given they are typically housed in confined areas. Under heat stress,
    cows produce less milk (Bohmanova et al., 2007; André et al., 2011; Bernabucci
    et al., 2014), and have impaired fertility (Ray et al., 1992; De Rensis and Scaramuzzi,
    2003; Sammad et al., 2020), leading to both economic and health and welfare concerns.
    Physiological changes linked to heat stress are often accompanied by behavioral
    responses including a reduction in overall activity, to conserve energy and minimize
    heat production (Cook et al., 2007). In contrast, animals may modify their behavior
    in cold conditions by increasing activity to generate body heat (Rabaiotti and
    Woodroffe, 2019; Herbut et al., 2021). Other behavioral responses to heat stress
    include decreased lying time, particularly above 19°C to 21°C, and increased standing
    time which serves to increase body surface area exposed for heat loss (Cook et
    al., 2007; King et al., 2016; Tresoldi et al., 2019). Additionally, cattle reduce
    their feeding behavior at high temperatures, thought to serve to reduce metabolic
    heat production (Bouraoui et al., 2002), which is likely to lower nutrient intake
    and may contribute to reduced conception rates under high temperatures (Marai
    et al., 2002; Morton et al., 2007; Sammad et al., 2020). This is accompanied by
    an increase in drinking, to cool individuals down, and an increase in competitive
    events at resources (Pereyra et al., 2010; McDonald et al., 2020; Tsai et al.,
    2020). Interestingly, subordinate cows appear to avoid drinkers during the hottest
    and most competitive hours of the day (McDonald et al., 2020). It is therefore
    important to consider that behavioral responses to increased heat load may be
    dependent on the individual animal, housing and the time of day. Bunching behavior
    (clustering, spatial aggregation) refers to the close grouping of individual animals
    within a herd. There is evidence that livestock may bunch when their environment
    is warmer than typical ambient temperatures including indoor (Mader et al., 2002;
    Erbez et al., 2012; Javorová et al., 2014) and outdoor-housed cattle (Lefcourt
    and Schmidtmann, 1989). The reason why cattle may bunch in warm conditions is
    not well understood, but one possibility is that bunching may occur around shaded
    areas as a strategy to reduce heat load; tree shading can reduce the body temperature
    of cattle at pasture (Kendall et al., 2006; Giro et al., 2019). This theory fits
    less well for indoor-housed cattle where they are predominantly blocked from direct
    sunlight, however shafts of sunlight may still project through panels and gaps
    in the roofing or walls. It is also possible that cattle group around water at
    high temperatures because drinking is increased to decrease body temperature.
    Studies in temperate regions have shown evidence for bunching at high temperatures
    above a particular threshold (Lefcourt and Schmidtmann, 1989; Erbez et al., 2012;
    Javorová et al., 2014). In Czech dairy barns, cows were found to bunch more with
    increasing ambient air temperature above a threshold of 19°C to 20°C (Erbez et
    al., 2012; Javorová et al., 2014). However, a limitation of these earlier studies
    is that spatial data collection was not obtained using an automated location system;
    cow locations were estimated using either video recordings or photographs at 15-min
    intervals (Erbez et al., 2012; Javorová et al., 2014). Bunching may also occur
    at low ambient temperatures, a known response throughout the animal kingdom to
    help animals thermoregulate (Huynh et al., 2005; Gilbert et al., 2010; Ozella
    et al., 2020). Similarly, animals may bunch in certain locations due to reasons
    other than temperature. For example, cows may bunch around areas with good air
    flow to avoid insects which gather around moist organic material, particularly
    during warm conditions. Moreover, bunching may help distribute fly burdens; individuals
    position their tails on the outside of a group for protection through leg kicking
    and tail swishing (Schmidtmann and Berkebile, 1985; El Ashmawy et al., 2019).
    Likewise, defensive aggregation is a known response of animals to an external
    threat (Foster and Treherne, 1981; Mooring and Hart, 1992; Bowen et al., 2013).
    In cattle, this instinctive response may activate in the presence of heightened
    fly burdens, or during heat stress when flight responses are impeded, leading
    to increased vigilance. However, if stocking densities within a barn are high,
    or if significant bunching occurs, body heat within the herd may contribute to
    an overall increase in the localized temperature, further increasing the internal
    body temperature of individuals in a potentially negative feedback cycle (Schütz
    et al., 2010; Polsky and von Keyserlingk, 2017). Temperature has indeed been found
    to increase in dense areas such as milking parlors and holdings areas (Papez and
    Kic, 2015; Celozzi et al., 2020). If bunching is determined to be a maladaptive
    response of cattle to increasing temperature, this could have significant implications
    for the health, welfare and profitability of herds (André et al., 2011; Galán
    et al., 2018; Ekine-Dzivenu et al., 2020). This would be particularly concerning
    given the growing demand for increased yields and herd sizes across the dairy
    industry, alongside the projected increase in heat stress caused by climate change
    (Ji et al., 2020). Direct behavioral observations by human observers are time-consuming
    and may be subjective. However, automated spatial positioning sensor systems used
    as part of precision livestock farming (PLF) approaches to provide continuous
    tracking of animals and their environment, offer a promising solution to help
    better measure and understand behavior (Gygax et al., 2007; Tullo et al., 2016).
    Automated sensors have the potential to collect high-resolution spatial data which
    can be analyzed through time series data (Cagnacci et al., 2010) to determine
    individual time budgets, space-use patterns, social interactions, and detect behavioral
    patterns and changes linked to health issues (Barker et al., 2018; Vázquez Diosdado
    et al., 2018; Chopra et al., 2020). In this study, we use a local positioning
    sensor system to continuously monitor a housed dairy herd over 4 mo to explore
    how bunching behavior, defined using 4 different metrics, may be associated with
    higher ambient temperatures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and Housing The animal
    study was reviewed and approved by the Royal Veterinary College Ethics and Welfare
    Committee under the unique reference number 2012 1223. Written informed consent
    was obtained from the owners for the participation of their animals in this study.
    A high-yielding (305-d milk yield of 10,909 L) indoor-housed Holstein-Friesian
    dairy cow herd was monitored continuously on a commercial farm in southeast England,
    from August 1 to November 30, 2014. The total number of different individual animals
    within the herd over this period was 127, and the minimum and maximum numbers
    of unique cows present per day during the study period were 86 and 111, respectively.
    The herd was continually housed in a closed freestall barn with open gable ends
    containing 98 usable cubicles, at a high stocking density (feed space = 0.53 m
    to 0.68 m per cow, lying space = 0.88 to 1.14 cubicles per cow) with free access
    to the feeding passage and to water troughs. A layout of the barn is shown in
    Figure 1. The cows were milked thrice daily (at ∼0500, 1300, and 2100 h), with
    milk yield recorded monthly, and cows were fed a total mixed ration during the
    first milking (which was subsequently pushed up several times later in the day).
    Analyses of spatial tracking data for the same herd, in different contexts and
    over different time periods, were previously reported in (Barker et al., 2018;
    Vázquez Diosdado et al., 2018; Chopra et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res

    virtual cells of 2.25 m2, and intercow distance (ICD) and nearest-neighbor distance
    (NND) = 12.78 m and 2.66 m, respectively (for Sep. 18, 2014, at 1100–1200 h; barn
    temperature [BT] = 20.91°C), and low bunching (C), where CR = 88 virtual cells
    of 2.25 m2, FR = 268 virtual cells of 2.25 m2, and ICD and NND = 20.87 m and 3.61
    m, respectively (for Oct. 12, 2014, at 1800–1900 h; BT = 13.10°C). (D and E) Examples
    of “snapshots” of point location data for all individuals in the herd shown for
    specific time points within each of these hours (D: Sep. 18, 2014, at 11:01:32;
    and E: Oct. 12, 2014, at 18:00:02). Local Positioning System and Data Preprocessing
    Each cow was equipped with a combined real-time local positioning sensor, temperature
    sensor, and accelerometer, Omnisense 500 (Omnisense Ltd., 2022), mounted on a
    weighted neck collar to ensure stability (see Supplemental Files S1 and S2; https://doi.org/10.5526/ERDR-00000180,
    Chopra and Codling, 2023). The Omnisense positioning sensors form a localized
    radio network which triangulates signals (at 0.1 Hz) between all (fixed and cow-equipped)
    sensors to determine the spatial position of each individual animal. Fixed sensors
    were strategically placed around the barn to improve the triangulation network
    and to fix the absolute spatial position of each sensor. In a separate study in
    the same barn environment, this sensor system showed a 50% circular error of probability
    (CEP) measurement of 1.07 m (i.e., 50% of all recorded locations lay within a
    1.07-m radius of the mean location of static sensors), which compares favorably
    to the commercially advertised CEP specification of 1 m, and mean distance error
    of 2.66 m for a static sensor, and 1.90 m and 2.90 m, respectively, for an animal-mounted
    sensor (Barker et al., 2018). All data processing and analysis was conducted in
    R for Windows with RStudio (RStudio Team, 2020; R Core Team, 2022). Extended interruption
    occurred on 15 of the study days due to the system malfunctioning and resetting
    part-way through the day; these days were excluded from the subsequent analysis.
    The number of cows in the barn on a given day across the study period (not including
    removed days) varied from n = 86 to 111, and a total of 88,576,716 location data
    points were collected from these cows. For the analysis, we excluded hours when
    most cows were in the milking parlor or collecting yard (0500–0759, 1200–1459,
    2000–2259 h), because their behavior was constrained by farm staff during these
    periods. The sensor system reset at midnight each day for data upload and hence
    times between 2300 and 0059 were also excluded. A total of 51,630,512 data points
    remained after removing milking and system reset periods (herein referred to as
    “original data”). Subsequent data pre-processing consisted of (1) removing location
    data outside of a 3-m buffer of the functional zones due to minor positional inaccuracies
    (15.88% of original data; 8,201,449 data points removed), (2) removing nonsensical
    positional data (e.g., sensors “stuck” in exactly the same or a similar, point
    location for multiple consecutive time points, often shortly after the system
    reset at the end of each day; 1.89% of original data; 975,291 data points removed),
    (3) smoothing using a simple moving average with a 2-sided window size of 15 data
    points (0.32% of original data removed as 7 data points were removed from the
    start and end of the location time series for each sensor per day; 166,555 data
    points), and finally, (4) plots of trajectories were visualized manually and any
    further nonsensical data were removed (e.g., where the trajectory of a cow was
    located within an unrealistically small area for an extended period of time);
    these instances were deemed as biologically implausible given these cows were
    not subject to any farm management actions during these times (2.17% of original
    data; 1,119,142 data points removed). In total, 79.74% of the original data remained
    after these stages, leaving a total of 41,167,975 data points for the main analysis.
    Further details of all 4 data pre-processing steps are outlined in the supplemental
    material of Chopra et al. (2020), where a similar approach was used. Environmental
    Data Wall-mounted temperature sensors automatically recorded the ambient barn
    temperature (BT) continuously throughout the study period; a mean hourly measurement
    was calculated across all sensors (n = 26 sensors, where n = 22 recorded every
    8 s and n = 4 recorded every hour; refer to Supplemental File S1 for further details
    on temperature sensors and data collected). The sensors were placed at approximately
    equal distances down the length (x-axis) of the barn at a height of ∼2.5 to 3
    m (Figure 1). Further temperature data were also obtained from the cow-equipped
    positional sensors (ST) and from a local weather station (LT), Harold Hill, located
    ∼11 km from the study site (Weather Underground, 2014). The ST sensors were housed
    in an insulated box and were located close to the body of each animal, leading
    to a buffering effect when comparing the ST ranges to the BT range (Supplemental
    Figure S1.1B–C in Supplemental File S1; https://doi.org/10.5526/ERDR-00000180,
    Chopra and Codling, 2023). Meanwhile, LT was used only as a comparator baseline
    to check temperature trends; LT was weakly correlated with both BT and ST (Supplemental
    Figure S1.1D–F in Supplemental File S1), which is unsurprising given the short
    distance from the study site. Bunching Metrics There is no formal definition of
    “bunching” behavior in the context of PLF, although a range of different metrics
    are available to measure spatial aggregation, spatial clustering, or social proximity
    from positional data. Previous studies have used direct observations or basic
    nearest-neighbor aggregation indices to measure bunching, the latter of which
    would provide a distorted score if cows tend to form dyad pairs (Lefcourt and
    Schmidtmann, 1989; Mader et al., 2002; Erbez et al., 2012; El Ashmawy et al.,
    2019). Hence, we consider 4 complementary “bunching metrics,” which directly measure
    the level of spatial separation (i.e., the inverse of bunching), each measured
    on an hourly basis across the full herd: range size (core and full), mean intercow
    distance (ICD), and mean nearest-neighbor distance (NND). Range Size Range size
    was calculated by overlaying a virtual grid (1.5 m × 1.5 m = 2.25-m2 cells) over
    the barn map (Figure 1A). At each time-step, location data were used to assign
    each individual cow within the herd to a given cell (or rejected if it lay outside
    the main barn region, see Local Positioning System and Data Preprocessing section).
    The number of individual data points assigned to each cell across the full herd
    and over a full hour (360-time steps at 0.1 Hz) were counted giving a final hourly
    total for each virtual cell within the barn. Following the standard methodology
    outlined in Vázquez Diosdado et al. (2018), the highest density cells cumulatively
    adding to 50% or 95% were then used to create an hourly utility distribution (space-use
    intensity map, Figure 1B, 1C) corresponding to the “core range” and “full range,”
    respectively. The number of unique virtual cells included in each hourly core
    range and full range distribution are then defined as the range size (CR and FR,
    respectively, measured in units of 2.25-m2 virtual cells). Intercow Distance At
    a given time-step, the herd mean intercow distance is the mean distance (in meters)
    between each of the (N2 − N)/2 possible dyad pairs across a herd with N individuals.
    An hourly value (which we define as ICD, measured in meters) is then calculated
    as the arithmetic mean of all (360) values recorded over that hour (assuming 0.1-Hz
    sampling frequency): [1] where (i, j) is a given dyad pair and i ≠ j, and t is
    a given time point. Nearest-Neighbor Distance At a given time-step, the NND for
    a given individual is simply the distance (in meters) to its closest neighbor
    in the herd (i.e., the smallest intercow distance when considering all dyad pairs
    involving that individual). A mean value can then be determined across the full
    herd on an hourly basis (which we define as NND, measured in meters): [2] where
    j indexes all possible dyad pairs for i across the N individuals in the herd.
    Although the 4 bunching metrics defined above measure different aspects of space
    use and social proximity, they will all decrease as spatial separation decreases
    and spatial clustering (“bunching”) increases. Range size is independent (in a
    statistical sense) to ICD and NND, but as it is aggregated at an hourly level
    from the outset, it will not capture short-time variations in proximity between
    individuals. Nevertheless, a smaller (core or full) range size indicates that
    the herd as a whole are using less of the barn and are hence sharing a smaller
    space (Figure 1B, 1C). Both NND and ICD are loosely dependent but capture different
    aspects of herd bunching. The ICD measures distances across the full herd and
    hence can be skewed by individuals that are far apart or in separate subgroups
    (e.g., a herd split into 2 distinct and tightly bunched subgroups could still
    have a high ICD value, even though the separate groups would be considered to
    be bunching). Meanwhile, NND only accounts for the distance between animals nearest
    each other and hence may not capture bunching between multiple individuals (e.g.,
    a herd split into spatially separated dyad pairs could have a very low NND but
    would have high ICD, and would not usually be considered as herd-level bunching).
    By measuring the above 4 metrics simultaneously we aim to accurately capture a
    wide range of herd dynamics that may be indicative of bunching behavior. Segmentation
    and Breakpoints Motivated by findings from previous studies where behavior was
    observed to change above a certain threshold (Erbez et al., 2012; Javorová et
    al., 2014), we use segmentation to explore whether bunching behavior is affected
    by ambient temperature. A segmented relationship describes changes in a trend
    at specific values, with a point of change referred to as a breakpoint (BP; Muggeo,
    2003); we consider 2 complementary approaches. Hypothesis-Driven Approach motivated
    by, and consistent with, previous studies on dairy cow behavior (Chen et al.,
    2016; Tresoldi et al., 2019), we hypothesize that changes in herd behavior may
    occur above 20°C. To test this hypothesis, we define a BP at 20°C. Linear regression
    models were then created for data <20°C and ≥20°C, for each bunching metric, using
    the “lm” function in base R. Chow tests were performed to test the significance
    of the hypothesized BP of 20°C, for all bunching metrics. For this, the function
    “sctest” from the R package “strucchange” was used (Muggeo, 2003, 2008). Data-Driven
    Approach The R package “segmented” was used to identify the locations of forced
    BPs (Muggeo, 2008). For each bunching metric, the original linear model was inputted
    into the “segmented” function, specifying one or 2 BP(s) in BT. Linear regression
    models were then created using the data-driven BP (i.e., 2 models where one BPs
    identified: BT < BP and BT ≥ BP; or 3 models where 2 BPs identified: BT < BP1,
    BP1 ≤ BT < BP2 and BT ≥ BP2) and the results analyzed. Chow tests were performed
    to test the significance of these BPs. For both approaches, default R settings
    were used in all linear models, which exclude observations containing not applicable
    (NA) values and uses QR (Q represents the orthogonal matrix and R represents the
    upper triangular matrix) factorization, an extensively used method for solving
    least squares problems. Model assumptions were considered before drawing conclusions:
    heteroskedasticity through residual versus fitted plots and non-constant error
    variance (NVC) tests, and residual normality through quantile–quantile plots and
    the Shapiro-Wilk test (see Supplemental File S3; https://doi.org/10.5526/ERDR-00000180,
    Chopra and Codling, 2023). The effect of time of day on the relationship between
    bunching behavior and temperature was explored to consider the presence of diurnal
    patterns, differences between the day (morning or afternoon) and night, and to
    consider that milking was a deterministic event at certain points of the day.
    To do this, the hourly mean data were divided into 3 intervals between milking
    times: night (0100–0400 h; no values where BT ≥20°C across the study period),
    morning (0800–1100 h; n = 33 h where BT ≥20°C) and afternoon/evening (1500–1900
    h; n = 142 h where BT ≥20°C). Linear regression models were then created for data
    where BT ≥20°C, for each bunching metric and each time interval, using the lm()
    function in base R. Bunching in Relation to Barn Location and Localized Temperature
    Bunching and Barn Location Space-use intensity distributions were determined (as
    described in the Range Size section) for those hours corresponding to the lowest
    10% of values (n = 127 h) for each individual bunching metric (CR, FR, ICD, and
    NND; i.e., corresponding to high levels of bunching for each metric separately).
    A combined space-use distribution was also determined by including the union of
    all hours identified in the previous step across all bunching metrics (n = 321
    h). These aggregated space-use distributions corresponding to periods of high
    bunching were then compared with the aggregated space-use distribution determined
    across the entire study period to determine whether animals were distributed differently
    across the barn during bunching events compared with nonbunching periods. Space-Use
    Intensity and Temperature The animal-mounted sensors were used to determine a
    mean temperature across the entire barn, which we define as ST (see Supplemental
    File S1). By matching the spatial location and sensor-measured temperature at
    each time point for all animals across the herd (i.e., by adapting the method
    described in the Range Size section), it is also possible to determine a spatially-resolved
    mean hourly temperature for each 2.25-m2 (1.5 m × 1.5 m) virtual cell of the barn,
    which we define as STXY. Hence, we can create a spatial (heat)map of the variations
    in temperature across the barn over different time periods (e.g., hourly, monthly).
    It should be stressed that both ST (the mean sensor-measured temperature across
    the whole barn; i.e., the mean of all STXY values for a given hour) and STXY are
    not true measures of either the ambient or localized temperature(s) within the
    barn; as the sensor is mounted directly on a neck collar (albeit in an insulated
    housing) it will be affected by the heat generated by the animal itself. Nevertheless,
    relative differences in STXY across the barn offer a useful measure of how the
    temperature experienced by each animal, and by the herd as a whole may vary across
    the barn. Comparison of Spatial Distributions: The Bhattacharya Coefficient To
    compare space-use distributions over different periods or to compare variation
    in space use against temperature across the barn, we use the Bhattacharya coefficient
    (BC) which provides a quantitative measure to assess the level of similarity between
    2-dimensional matrices: [3] where Px and Qx are the (normalized) distributions
    being compared. The resulting BC ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates complete
    overlap between the 2 distributions, and 0 indicates complete dissimilarity. The
    BC only gives a single measure of similarity between 2 distributions; to test
    if this similarity is significant, it is necessary to undertake a randomization
    test. Our procedure involved calculating the mean BC for each hour of our study
    (comparing temperature and space-use distributions). The same number of BC values
    were generated by randomly shuffling the order of hourly space use and temperature
    distribution matrices, and the mean was determined for these randomized BC values.
    This randomization process was repeated (n = 10,000 iterations), and the number
    of times, k, the randomized mean BC was less than the original mean BC from the
    (nonrandomized) data were used to directly determine a P-value (where P = k/10,000).
    To compare the spatial distribution for (union of all) hours of highest bunching
    (see the Bunching and Barn Location section) with the spatial distribution over
    the entire study period, we employed a similar randomization approach. First,
    we computed the BC for each of the highest bunching hours (n = 321 h) when compared
    with the entire study period. The mean BC was then calculated. Subsequently, we
    randomly selected the same number of hours (n = 321) across the study duration
    and computed the BC for each of these hours in relation to the space-use distribution
    during the entire study period. This process was repeated 10,000 times, recording
    the instances where the mean BC of the randomized data exceeded the original mean
    BC. Finally, the count of such occurrences was divided by the total number of
    iterations to derive the P-value. A similar randomization procedure was also undertaken
    for each bunching metric separately (with n = 127 h in each case; see Supplemental
    File S4; https://doi.org/10.5526/ERDR-00000180, Chopra and Codling, 2023). RESULTS
    Trends in Temperature and Bunching Hourly ambient BT peaked during the afternoon,
    and dropped during the night, as expected (Figure 2A). The coolest median hourly
    BT was recorded in November (11.77°C; n = 260 h) and the hottest in August (18.330°C;
    n = 374 h), with mean for September and October as 18.11°C (n = 276 h) and 15.11°C
    (n = 359 h) respectively. There is a significant difference in mean hourly temperature
    between months (Friedman chi-squared = 229.48, P < 2.2e-16), with August and September
    significantly hotter than October (Wilcoxon rank sum (W) = 30,552 and 23,677,
    P < 2.2e-16, with Bonferroni Correction) and November as significantly cooler
    than all other months (W = 4,927, 3,696, 77,063 for August, September and October
    respectively, P < 2.2e-16, with Bonferroni correction; Figure 2A). It should be
    noted that the mean hourly BT across days reaches above 20°C for some hours during
    the afternoon in August and September, but not during October and November (Figure
    2A). More specifically, Figure 2F shows mean hourly BT over time for the entire
    study period; most of the values which lie above 20°C occur in August and September
    (93%, n = 320 of 344 h). Download : Download high-res image (572KB) Download :

    1200–1459 h, and 2000–2259 h) and periods during which the sensor reset (∼2300–0059
    h). Also shown (F–J) are mean hourly metrics recorded across the entire study
    period (August to November 2014) for barn temperature (°C), CR (50%), FR (95%),
    ICD (m), and NND (m). Of the 2,905 total data points, 358 are above 20°C, with
    334 of these occurring in August and September. Visualization reveals few clear
    patterns in the hourly bunching metrics over time, other than a clear decrease
    in bunching during milking periods; this is expected because cows are located
    within the restricted space of the milking parlor during these periods (and hence
    we remove these times from the subsequent segmentation analysis; Figure 2B–2E;
    Figure 2G–2J). Bunching Behavior and Segmented Breakpoints Bunching Behavior Above
    and Below 20°C Above or equal to 20°C, a clear negative trend is shown between
    all 4 bunching metrics and BT. Although the breakpoint is nonsignificant for 3
    of the 4 bunching metrics, these trends are significant for CR, FR, and intercow
    distance (ICD; Table 1; Figure 3E–3G), but nonsignificant for NND (Table 1; Figure
    3H). Below 20°C, the relationships between BT and FR, ICD and NND are also negative
    and significant, but are nonsignificant for CR. For example, for CR < 20°C, correlation
    coefficient (e) = −0.15, and for ≥20°C e = −2.08 (Table 1; Figure 3A–3C). The
    direction of the relationship between NND and BT changes from positive to negative
    either side of the 20°C breakpoint (Table 2; Figure 3D). Qualitatively similar
    results were obtained when considering relative humidity from a local weather
    station, through the temperature-humidity index (THI; Supplemental File S5; https://doi.org/10.5526/ERDR-00000180,

    at a given BT, the range size values are generally lower in comparison to September
    (Figure 3I–3L). For example, at 20.1°C (rounded to nearest one decimal point),
    CR = 60 to 65 (n = 2 h) whereas CR = 65 to 78 for September (n = 4 h). The pattern
    is the opposite for ICD and NND (Figure 3M–3P). This can be explained by the number
    of cows present in the barn, consistently lower in August (n = 85 to 86 cows)
    compared with in September (n = 92 to 96 cows). Moreover, there are negative trends
    between BT and the bunching metrics ≥20°C when considering August and September
    separately (Table 1; Figure 3I–3P). Behavior Above and Below Data-Driven Breakpoints
    Forcing a data-driven method to find the location of BT breakpoints gives values
    close to 20°C for all the bunching metrics, except for FR (Figure 4). The (significant)
    negative trends using all 4 bunching metrics also hold above these forced breakpoints
    (Table 2; Figure 4), giving qualitatively similar results to using a hypothesized
    BP of 20°C (Table 1, Figure 3). Qualitatively similar results were found using
    forced breakpoints for THI (Table A3 in Supplemental File S5). Download : Download

    h) were removed. Where a subplot is marked with an asterisk, the relationship
    is significant (threshold of 0.05). Effect of Time of Day for Breakpoint of 20°C
    Barn temperature did not reach ≥20°C during the night, and most data points ≥20°C
    were recorded during the afternoon/evening (n = 142 and 33 data points, during
    the afternoon/evening and the morning respectively). Above (or at) 20°C, the negative
    relationship between BT and the range sizes and ICD, change from nonsignificant
    during the morning to significant during the afternoon and evening (Figure 5A–5C;

    h). Bunching in Relation to Barn Location and Temperature Bunching and Barn Location
    Visualization of space use over the entire study duration suggests that the cows
    preferred to position in the right-hand cubicles which are nearer to the exit
    of the milking parlor (26.90 m ≤ x ≥52.85 m and 0.80 m ≤ y ≥10.50 m and 25.10
    m ≤ x ≥52.85 m and −1.62 m ≤ y ≥0.80 m) over the left-hand cubicles (2.55 m ≤
    x ≥23.10 m and 0.80 m ≤ y ≥10.50 m) in the nonfeeding zone (Figure 6A; refer to

    17.38°C to 20.73°C); and for hours with the (G) lowest barn temperature (Nov.
    20, 2014; mean hourly barn temperature = 8.29°C, mean STXY = 17.06°C, range STXY
    = 15.39°C to 19.40°C) and (H) highest barn temperature (Aug. 7, 2014; mean hourly
    barn temperature = 22.58°C, mean STXY = 26.24°C, range STXY = 24.03°C to 29.61°C).
    In panels A and B, the median position is marked with a white cross. In panels
    C to H, sensor temperatures were calculated using recordings from cow-equipped
    sensors (n = 127 different cows, with a minimum of n = 86 cows and maximum of
    n = 111 cows present per day across the study period). Color gradients represent
    averages per 2.25-m2 cell, with (A, B) lighter shades of blue indicating areas
    of low density or space use and darker shades of blue indicating areas of high
    density, and (C–H) yellow cells representing low STXY from 17°C and red cells
    representing high STXY of 32°C. In all subplots, the highest-density 2.25-m2 cells
    cumulatively adding to 50% and 95% are shown within solid gray and dashed gray
    boundaries, respectively. Milking times are not included in any of the calculations.
    The nonfeeding zone is 1.62 m ≤ y ≤ 10.5 m, −1.6 m ≤ x ≤ 58.6 m, and the feeding
    zone is 10.5 m ≤ y ≤ 17.2 m. The highest instances of bunching are mostly during
    September and August (n = 8 of 9 h), which is consistent with results from the
    segmentation analysis as these are also the hottest months of the study period
    (refer to Figure 2). The median location of the herd is x = 31.77 m and y = 4.52
    m across the entire study period (white cross in Figure 6A) and x = 32.01 m and
    y = 4.63 m during instances of high bunching (white cross in Figure 6B), indicating
    very little difference in median location between bunching and nonbunching periods.
    Both coordinates are close to the milking parlor (29.40 m ≤ x ≥42.25 m and (−8.42
    m ≤ y ≥ −1.62 m) between the high-density cells in the feeding zone and the right-hand
    cubicles (refer to Figure 1). The case is similar when considering the highest
    instances of bunching for each bunching metric separately (Supplemental File S4).
    A mean BC of 0.903 was calculated when comparing space-use distribution during
    the union of specific hours of high bunching (n = 321) to aggregated space use
    over the entire study period (Figure 6A, 6B). The randomization procedure (comparing
    space use across n = 321 randomly selected hours to the entire study period) shows
    that, although it is still relatively high, the BC during bunching periods is
    significantly lower than expected by chance (range of mean BC = 0.914 to 0.921
    over 10,000 iterations, P < 0.0001), indicating more variation in the spatial
    distribution during bunching periods when compared with the rest of the study
    period. Similar results are obtained when considering each bunching metric separately
    (Supplemental File S4). Bunching and Temperature Variation Across the Barn On
    a monthly average basis, STXY can be seen to vary across the barn with the central
    areas closest to the feeding passage and exit from the milking parlor consistently
    hotter across all months than the gable ends (left and right sides) of the barn
    (Figure 6C–F). Visual comparisons of Figure 6A and Figure 6C–6F suggest that,
    on average and across the study period, those areas of the barn with highest space-use
    intensity are similar to those areas where STXY is higher. This finding is further
    highlighted when comparing spatial variation in STXY with space-use intensity
    across the barn across the entire study, the hourly BC varied from 0.775 to 0.927,
    with medians of 0.877 for August, 0.900 for September, 0.898 for October, and
    0.897 for November (all values exclude milking periods). Illustrative examples
    of the spatial distribution highlight that the coefficient of variation (CV) is
    very low for temperature (STXY), with a median hourly CV of 3.65% (range = 1.41%
    to 9.41%), indicating low variation across the barn (Figure 6G, 6H). In contrast,
    space-use intensity is highly variable across the barn with a median hourly CV
    of 98.88% (range = 78.13% to 218.38%); this suggests that variation in space-use
    intensity across the barn, rather than temperature variation, drives differences
    in BC. Over the full study period, the mean BC between the hourly space-use intensity
    and temperature distributions across the barn was 0.888; randomization suggests
    this is highly significant (range of mean BC = 0.857 to 0.863 for randomly paired
    space use and temperature distributions; P < 0.0001), suggesting significant high
    correlation between space-use intensity and the localized temperature within the
    barn as measured by animal-mounted sensors. There is a significant negative relationship
    between the hourly (temperature and space-use distribution) BC and hourly BT,
    and this negative relationship is stronger ≥20C compared with <20C (Figure 7E;
    overall: e = −0.001, SE = 0.0001, t-value = −7.20, P = 1.02e-12 where BT <20:
    e = −0.0004, SE = 0.0002, t-value = −2.21, P = 0.03; where BT ≥20C: e = −0.007,
    SE = 0.001, t-value = −7.21, P = 1.23e-11). The fact that BC decreases at higher
    temperatures is most likely due to bunching (which we previously observed is more
    likely at higher temperatures); bunching will cause higher variation in space-use
    intensity across the barn, which in turn will lead to a lower BC because temperature
    is consistently more uniform across the barn. Download : Download high-res image

    sensors (n = 127 different cows, with a minimum of n = 86 cows and maximum of
    n = 111 cows present per day across the study period). E excludes milking periods
    and sensor reset, whereas F includes these times. DISCUSSION This study is the
    first to use automated sensors, continuously over 4 mo as part of a PLF approach,
    to highlight associations between bunching behavior and higher ambient BT in an
    indoor dairy herd in a temperate region (UK). Four different measures of bunching
    behavior were considered, accounting for various aspects of space use and social
    proximity: CR and FR, ICD, and NND. In addition, our novel methodology, which
    uses combined animal-mounted sensors that measure both location and localized
    temperature at high spatiotemporal resolution, enables us for the first time to
    map and compare space use and localized temperature variations across the barn
    over time. Our results highlight the importance of understanding animal space-use
    behavior within the context of farm management under the increased threat of rising
    temperatures due to climate change. Bunching Behavior Increases at Higher Ambient
    BT Herd bunching behavior increased with increasing BT, and this relationship
    is significant above or equal to 20°C (Table 1; Figure 3) for CR, FR, and ICD
    (noting that a decrease in these metrics corresponds to increased bunching). For
    NND, a negative relationship was similarly found above or equal to 20°C, although
    this is nonsignificant, and this relationship did not hold below the 20°C threshold
    (Table 1; Figure 3). The increase in bunching with temperature ≥20°C held across
    the morning to the evening, but this trend was stronger during the afternoon/evening
    (1500–1900 h, n = 33) compared with the morning (0800–1100 h, n = 142) for the
    CR, FR, and ICD, potentially partly attributed to the smaller sample size available
    for the morning analysis (Figure 5). The main finding that cows significantly
    increase their bunching behavior above warmer than average ambient temperatures
    (20°C; Table 1, Figure 3), supports previous observational studies, where cows
    were found to crowd above but not below an ambient temperature of 19°C to 20°C
    (Erbez et al., 2012; Javorová et al., 2014). In these earlier studies, bunching
    was measured by counting the number of individuals in barn segments every 15 min
    (Erbez et al., 2012; Javorová et al., 2014). Our findings are consistent with
    this earlier work but provide more detailed understanding of bunching behavior
    in indoor dairy herds; our data were derived from higher-frequency recordings
    and by using 4 different metrics of bunching (FR, CR, ICD, NND) we can consider
    various aspects of space use and social proximity. Specifically, our results indicate
    that the herd used less space as a whole at high barn temperatures (FR, CR), and
    not only may dyads (NND) position closer together at higher temperatures, but
    multiple individuals may, too (ICD; Table 1, Figure 3). Conversely, bunching has
    been found to decrease with ambient temperature ≤30°C in temperate and arid climates
    (El Ashmawy et al., 2019), but this earlier study only categorized bunching using
    a binary method (bunching or not bunching) weekly, twice per day. Another previous
    study used a more detailed method to measure bunching in a dairy herd in a temperate
    climate, observing and categorizing individuals into one of 4 nearest-neighbor
    groups, with recordings taken every 20 min for 10 d, then 1 d/wk for 6 wk (Lefcourt
    and Schmidtmann, 1989). Although bunching appeared to increase with THI (using
    an ambient temperature measure), a specific temperature threshold where behavior
    qualitatively changed was not reported, which was potentially attributed to the
    study''s consistently high daily ambient temperatures recorded i.e., weekly least
    mean squares of daily ambient temperature between 21°C and 28°C (Lefcourt and
    Schmidtmann, 1989). The increase in bunching ≥20°C, in terms of 3 of our 4 metrics
    (FR, CR, ICD), is found to be clearer during the afternoon/evening (1500–1900
    h; maximum = 27.77°C and median = 18.25°C) than during the morning (0800–1100
    h; maximum = 25.25°C and median = 16.42°C; Figure 5). This is consistent with
    previous studies whereby cows were found to crowd during the afternoon, where
    temperatures were consistently recorded above 22°C, but not during the night/early
    morning, where temperatures did not exceed 11°C (Erbez et al., 2012; Javorová
    et al., 2014). Alterations to the spatial positioning of the herd during specific
    periods of the day are likely to disrupt normal behaviors, such as feeding if
    stocking rates at the feed face are increased (Hill et al., 2009). Such changes
    have the potential to disproportionately affect cows with health issues; for example,
    lame cows have been reported to moderate their feeding times to avoid competition
    at the feed face (Blackie et al., 2011; Barker et al., 2018). The lack of bunching
    we found overnight (0100–0400 h), as temperatures remained below 20°C, suggests
    these periods are important for cows to undertake activities which may have been
    avoided during the day (Figure 5). The rise of tropical nights in the UK (Hanlon
    et al., 2021) may further diminish the ability of cows to adapt to changing climatic
    conditions and to catch up on important behaviors, such as lying (Schütz et al.,
    2008). Our hypothesized temperature breakpoint of 20°C was motivated by previous
    studies on dairy cows that reported physiological or behavioral changes at or
    around this threshold (Berman et al., 1985; Nonaka et al., 2008; Dikmen and Hansen,
    2009; Hut et al., 2022). Results from using an alternative approach with purely
    data-driven forced breakpoints support our main conclusions (Table 1, Figure 3).
    These forced breakpoints were found to be close to 20°C for 3 of the 4 bunching
    metrics (CR, ICD, NND; Table 2, Figure 4), and the negative trend above these
    data-driven thresholds is consistent with results from the 20°C breakpoint (Table
    1, Table 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Other Factors That May Affect Bunching Behavior
    Many studies have considered the THI, which considers both the effects of relative
    humidity and temperature, in the context of behavioral responses of cattle to
    heat stress e.g., (Tresoldi et al., 2019; Tsai et al., 2020). Relative humidity
    was not recorded within the barn so data were obtained from a local weather station,
    and results show that the relationships between the bunching metrics and THI were
    largely qualitatively similar to those for barn temperature alone (Supplemental
    File S5). Local or regional measures of relative humidity from local weather stations
    are unlikely to reflect the fine scale microclimate changes experienced by cows
    in different areas of the barn at different times. Hence, further investigation
    should consider finer-scale humidity readings recorded within the barn, as well
    as other environmental factors (e.g., airflow, methane, or carbon dioxide levels,
    and so on) to better understand other possible factors contributing to bunching
    behavior. Cows may alter their spatial positioning during the day due to a preference
    for specific areas of the barn at high ambient temperatures. Possible factors
    which might have resulted in the presence of microclimates in the study barn (i.e.,
    temperature, humidity and air flow) were 1) mechanical ventilation provided by
    fans in the middle and right of the barn, 2) water troughs located in the center
    cross passage, and 3) sunlight radiating through the wooden cladding on the left
    gable end side (west-southwest) of the shed (due to the position of the parlor,
    no sunlight would come through the right side of the shed). Cows may have detected
    microclimatic variations in the barn due to these factors, as found in previous
    studies i.e., at high temperatures, cattle are known to seek shade and avoid sunlight
    (Bennett et al., 1985; Kendall et al., 2006; Schütz et al., 2010), but may be
    drawn to areas with water to cool down and good air flow to avoid flies. These
    factors may also contribute to increased activity at higher temperatures (see
    Supplemental File S2); for instance, cows may be more active as a group at higher
    ambient temperatures to seek preferable microclimates or to deter fly burdens
    through behavior such as tail swishing (El Ashmawy et al., 2019). However, activity
    and ambient temperature are not entirely independent; an increase in cow activity
    may increase the ambient temperature in the barn, given activity generates body
    heat, although the extent to which is unclear. It is not clear to what extent
    each of these microclimatic factors affect their bunching behavior, but it can
    be hypothesized that cows are either drawn to preferable microclimates or driven
    away from adverse microclimates when temperatures increase above 20°C. We found
    no evidence that the average location and spatial distribution of cows was different
    during bunching periods when compared with the aggregated spatial distribution
    across the entire study (Figure 6A, 6B). However, there was more variation within
    the observed spatial distribution when cows were bunching (median hourly CV of
    98.88%; range = 78.13% to 218.38%; Figure 7C, 7D). In general, cows appeared to
    prefer positioning in the right-hand cubicles over the left and lower cubicles
    in the nonfeeding zone, across the entire study duration and during hours of high
    bunching (Figure 6A, 6B). The right-hand cubicles were closer to the collecting
    yard/milking parlor which would have allowed cows to relieve their high milk yield
    sooner compared with if they were positioned elsewhere in the barn (the study
    group consisted of high-yielding cows). It has previously been observed that higher-parity
    cows and cows with more days in milk spent greater time in cubicle areas closer
    to a collecting yard (Vázquez Diosdado et al., 2018). Similarly, (Churakov et
    al., 2021) found that higher-parity cows occupied cubicles closer to a milking
    area. As discussed above, this apparent preference for the right-hand cubicles
    could also be due to other possible factors such as better ventilation in these
    areas. (Churakov et al., 2021) also reported higher occupancy near feeding areas,
    which is consistent with the high-space use in the feeding zone observed in our
    study, although this is likely driven by the requirement for feed intake rather
    than any other factors. As expected, there was a gradual decrease in both ambient
    temperature and localized temperatures within the barn over the duration of the
    study period (August to November; Figure 2F, Figure 6C–6F). Localized temperature
    throughout the barn (STXY, measured by animal-mounted sensors) showed relatively
    low spatial variation (median hourly CV of 3.65%; range = 1.41% to 9.41%; Figure
    6C–6F), although visual inspection shows that in general the hottest temperatures
    were recorded in the passageways and the feeding zone, which is perhaps not surprising
    as this is where the highest density of cows is typically observed (Figure 6A,
    6B; Papez and Kic, 2015; Celozzi et al., 2020). There was a significant correlation
    (Bhattacharyya coefficient, BC = 0.888; P < 0.0001 in randomization test) between
    localized temperature and space-use intensity across the barn over the study duration.
    However, the observed BC was negatively correlated with ambient barn temperature
    (Figure 7E), and this was significant ≥20°C. This result can be explained by the
    fact that bunching leads to higher spatial variation (higher CV) and hence a lower
    BC (in comparison to nonbunching periods), and as previously discussed, bunching
    is more likely to be observed at higher ambient temperatures. Nevertheless, further
    investigation is required to fully understand the detailed spatiotemporal dynamics
    of the barn environment and to identify the specific factors driving space use
    and bunching behavior, to help improve housing designs. Implications for Herd
    Management Due to the high metabolic demands of dairy cows their bodies radiate
    significant heat into their local environment to maintain a stable core body temperature
    (Spiers, 2003). Bunching of dairy cattle, whether due to management practices
    such as collection for milking or behavioral choices, has the potential to exacerbate
    hot and humid conditions capable of increasing heat load i.e., given temperatures
    are known to increase in areas of high stocking densities (Papez and Kic, 2015;
    Celozzi et al., 2020), which is consistent with our results in Figure 6. This
    has implications for welfare, as cows under heat stress undergo physiological
    changes such as an increase in respiration rate and panting (Osei-Amponsah et
    al., 2020; Yan et al., 2021) and production losses such as reduced milk yield
    (Gantner et al., 2011; Gorniak et al., 2014; Wildridge et al., 2018). Moving forward,
    heat stress is becoming an increasing concern as demand in the dairy sector increases
    (Bayvel et al., 2012; Cembalo et al., 2016; Miglior et al., 2017) alongside heightened
    effects of climate change. In regions such as the UK cattle have historically
    had limited experience of such high temperatures and hence little time to adapt
    (Fodor et al., 2018; Hanlon et al., 2021). Further study is required to better
    understand the relationship between bunching and temperature, alongside effects
    on production, considering appropriate heat stress thresholds at which to alert
    farmers. Precision livestock farming approaches provide opportunities to study
    and understand animal behavior, allowing us to collect and analyze vast amounts
    of data in real-time, and to identify patterns and associations that would be
    difficult to detect using traditional methods such as manual observations (Berckmans,
    2014). The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of PLF approaches
    to uncover previously unknown links between environmental factors and animal behavior
    (e.g., the overlap between space-use intensity and localized temperature, Figure
    6), with implications for health, welfare, and productivity. In this study, dairy
    cows were found to increase their bunching behavior above average ambient temperatures,
    and possible mitigation strategies could focus on addressing heat loads, such
    as through increasing access to shade (Mitlöhner et al., 2001), providing sprinklers
    and improving ventilation (Fournel et al., 2017), and reducing stocking densities
    (Celozzi et al., 2020). Our results have highlighted the association between bunching
    behavior and ambient temperatures in a large housed dairy herd. Using automated
    sensors and continuous monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution that provides
    an unprecedented level of detail, we provide evidence of how bunching behavior
    of a dairy cow herd increases above 20°C, as measured by a range of different
    metrics of spatial clustering and social proximity (Table 1). Given that temperatures
    are predicted to increase under climate change, there is a need for further exploration
    and understanding of the drivers of bunching behavior to explore potential mitigation
    strategies for heat stress (Hanlon et al., 2021), particularly if bunching behavior
    is itself contributing to the formation of localized higher temperatures. Our
    study underscores the importance of considering behavioral responses in relation
    to changing environmental conditions, so that we can implement effective strategies
    to protect animal health, welfare, and productivity within agricultural settings.

    Abstract The present study analyzed the trends in patenting in the field of Precision
    Agriculture (PA) since the late 1970s, when the potential application of microprocessor‐based
    technology started to show its dramatic effects on agriculture. The patenting
    activities analyses conducted focused as first on the evolution of the terms that
    historically have been used to indicate the common principles linked to the concept
    of precision agriculture, to mine relevant keywords within massive datasets such
    as patent documents. Then, the rationale was to impose a sorting approach based
    on different criteria: (i) field of application (Positioning and Guidance Technologies;
    Information and Communication Technologies ICT; Measuring Technologies; Reacting
    Technologies); (ii) sensory technology (Positioning; Optical; Electro-chemical;
    Mechanical); and (iii) farming practices (Sowing; Fertilization; Protection; Irrigation;
    Harvest). The number of grants collected included 2003 results, with an enormous
    increase in the number of precision agriculture-related patents registered in
    the last years. This study emphasizes the central role of ICT and Global Positioning
    technologies in supporting several measuring and response technologies, highlights
    the increasing relevance of environmental sensors and image devices, notes the
    rise of unmanned vehicles in agricultural patents, and underscores fertilization
    as a dominant subject for patent activity among the farming practices. Previous

    agricultureTechnologies 1. Introduction In agricultural activities, the characteristics
    of the “production affecting objects” (e.g. plants, animals, machineries, but
    also parasites and weeds) and the conditions of the environment (atmosphere, soil,
    but also “social and economic environment” like market dynamics) vary continuously
    in the time and in the space. The managing of this highly variable context to
    optimize the results of agricultural activities, is the main goal of the agribusiness
    producers. The evolution of technologies in many different sectors (electronics,
    information and communication technologies, new materials, modeling) dramatically
    increased the availability of instruments and methodologies able to monitor this
    variability, to manage the related data, and to precisely apply the agronomic
    inputs. The combination of these tools and methodologies produced a new paradigm
    in farming: the Precision Agriculture (PA), that has been described as the way
    “to precisely define the right time, right way, and right place to manage agro-farm
    producing process” [1]. This evolution in technology and approach led to a deep
    innovation in agriculture permeating all the aspects of agricultural practices
    (e.g. plant status monitoring, weeds and pests control, soil properties monitoring
    and management). Within the innovation process, seen as the path of translating
    invention and/or existing knowledge into marketable solutions, the patents and
    trademarks system encourages and stimulates the inventors to share and apply their
    discoveries granting the protection of intellectual property and the control of
    commercial use of the inventions. In this view, the patents represent an up-to-date
    source of information not only on applied technology but also on application fields,
    and enables the monitoring of the innovation trends [[2], [3], [4]]. The patent
    data could be analyzed for determining innovation, analyzing innovation trends,
    forecasting technological developments, identifying technological vacuums/hotspots,
    and competitors [5]. A further advantage of patent analyses is that they are classified
    in databases, thus facilitating their retrieval [6]. A patent landscape search
    provides a snapshot of the patent state of art in a given technical discipline.
    These landscapes are used to understand a particular domain by using patent literature
    and derive the various insights based on the patent cluster extracted [7]. Since
    1990, the world has experienced a tremendous growth in the volumes of patents,
    but agricultural and related technologies account for a relatively small fraction
    of the total [8]. Taking into consideration the core sections for these technologies
    in the International Patent Classification, the author reported that agricultural
    and foodstuffs related patent applications in 2010 comprised 2.4 % of the total
    Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) of the World Intellectual Property Organization
    (WIPO) [9]. Quantifying, evaluating and benchmarking innovation in agriculture,
    therefore, is a significant, as well as complex, issue for both the public and
    private sectors, but also from an academic research perspective, because it can
    reveal the contribution to agriculture achieved in other sectors. Assessing patents
    in precision agriculture domain offers numerous advantages to stakeholders, as
    the following: Helping businesses and technology companies to identify the latest
    advancements in precision agriculture; Driving the R&D efforts to provide insights
    into existing technologies and areas where further research is needed; Gauging
    the maturity and potential of the precision agriculture market, crucial information
    for investors and funding agencies. Moreover, policymakers can use patent data
    to draft policies, regulations, and incentives that promote sustainable agricultural
    practices, whereas market analysts and consultants can use patent data to assess
    market trends and forecast future developments. Therefore, analysis of the patents
    in this domain could suggest numerous possibilities for additional technological
    advancements in precision agriculture. Based on this framework, this research
    focused on providing an overview on the technological developments in agricultural
    patents linked with the dictated of precision agriculture, on the changes in agricultural
    technology in terms of patent applications by specific sector with the purpose
    of forecasting future trends, identifying areas of concentration or lack of patents.
    To achieve the proposed objectives, as first step, a section discussed the evolution
    of the terms that historically have been used to indicate the common principles
    linked to the concept of precision agriculture. This expedient allowed to find
    relevant keywords within massive datasets such as precision agriculture patent
    documents. In subsequent steps, we classified them in relation to the field of
    application (Positioning and Guidance Technologies; Information and Communication
    Technologies ICT; Measuring Technologies; Reacting Technologies), (ii) sensory
    technology (Positioning; Optical; Electro-chemical; Mechanical) and (iii) farming
    practices (Sowing; Fertilization; Protection; Irrigation; Harvest) and fixing
    the patents in the timeline procedure to forecast future changes that are still
    happening. 2. Research background 2.1. Precision agriculture: the historical development
    of its meaning This introductory paragraph provides a background to the evolution
    of the terms linked to the concept of Precision Agriculture. If on one hand the
    principles and goals of a Precision Agriculture management strategy were clear
    from the beginning, on the other hand the terminology used to define them was
    not. This research comes from a terminology extraction output to identify the
    most effective keywords list for search engine optimization and to restrict the
    patents selection. In developed countries, agriculture has evolved over the years
    from a manual occupation to a highly automation demanding activities, utilizing
    a wide variety of tools and machines. Agricultural machinery patents date back
    to the early days of the patent system and a number of innovations were explored
    as early as 1920, picked with the application No. 1506706 [10] filed by Fred L.
    Willrodt (Steering attachment for tractors, 1924) in which the author patented
    a concept of fully autonomous agricultural vehicle. But we had to wait years until
    the technology was mature enough to really be effective, and, as early as 1970s,
    engineers began to concretely speculate about sensors able to recognize variations
    in time and space across the field and controllers able to react to these variations,
    varying the amounts of inputs. It encompasses wide-ranging technologies that started
    to be applied in agricultural activities when remote sensing [11], new soil sampling/testing
    approaches to detect soil variability [[12], [13], [14], [15]] and yield meter
    [16] were proposed. The potential to apply microprocessor‐based technology in
    mobile agricultural equipment actually dates back to 1978 in a patent application
    for a planter monitor [17], but it shall have to wait until the availability of
    the U.S. Department of Defense''s NAVSTAR satellite‐based Global Positioning System
    (GPS) to feel the significant effect of electronics in precision agriculture applications.
    Therefore, well before precision agriculture became an established practice, the
    early electronic equipment for sensing comprised fundamental aspects such as collecting
    georeferenced data, soil and grain yield monitoring and the Geographical Information
    System (GIS). The GPS system became fully operational in March 1994 [18], but
    since the early 1980s, numerous scientific papers and technical reports have been
    published concerning the new technologies/methodologies particularly involving
    geographical positioning systems [19,20], crop or soil monitoring sensors [21,22],
    data management [23,24], and agricultural machineries automatic control [25,26].
    In the same decade, integrating many of the above reported technologies/methodologies,
    some visionaries researchers argued how automation, sensing systems, positioning
    systems and information technology would transform agricultural crop production
    as the technology became widely available [27]. The idea of a variable rate fertilizer
    spreader was studied by several scientists during the early to mid-1980s. Pierre
    Robert [28], often regarded as the father of precision agriculture, indicated
    in his PhD dissertation titled “Evaluation of Some Remote Sensing Techniques for
    Soil and Crop Management” that farm management could be improved using color infrared
    aerial photography from the previous year in association with soil series maps.
    Johnson et al. [29] developed the concept of ‘custom prescribed tillage’. In 1985,
    Rust [30] introduced the concept of ‘farming by soil’, intended as the rate of
    fertilizer that varies according to digitized soil maps. The potential of spatially-variable
    fertilizer and pesticide application has led to a number of attempts to commercialize
    the technology. The first commercial precision agriculture technology for site-specific
    application was based on a patent issued in 1986: the U.S. patent 4630773 [31]
    of Ortlip, owned by Soil Teq. Inc. In the patent claim section, it was clearly
    stated how the rates of fertilizer application is supplied according to digital
    maps. It employs a computerized control system with a digital soil map, determines
    vehicle location, adjusts feeders based on soil type, and utilizes aerial photographs
    and soil testing to customize product rates for different soil types. Schueller
    [32] from the University of Florida introduced into scientific literature the
    term “site-specific”. According to this author, “the continuing advances in automation
    hardware and software technology have made possible what is variously known as
    spatially-variable, precision, prescription, or site-specific crop production”.
    Gradually, the terms “farming by soil” and “site-specific farming” were replaced
    by “variable rate” technology [33]. Robert et al. organized in 1992 the first
    workshop “Soil Specific Crop Management”, in which the terms “site-specific crop
    management” and “site-specific agriculture” were widely recognized and used [34].
    However, gradually many of these terms were replaced by “precision farming”. In
    the Second International Conference on “Site-Specific Management for Agricultural
    Systems” [35], five contributes reported the terms “precision farming” or “precision
    agriculture” in the title. In the preface of the proceedings, Robert analyzed
    that have been used various names to describe the same basic concept: farming
    by soil, farming by the foot, spatially prescriptive farming, computer aided farming,
    farming by computer, farming by satellite, high-tech sustainable agriculture,
    spatially variable field operations, soil-specific crop management, site-specific
    farming, ending the list with the term “precision farming”. However, in his opinion
    [36], precision farming had a broader meaning, including a wider set of agronomic
    practices such as soil sampling procedures, fertilizer and chemical rate selection,
    timing of applications, and type of machinery selection. Blackmore [37], in the
    paper “Precision farming; an introduction” realized that although new technologies
    enabled new processes, the core of Precision Farming was the understanding and
    management of variability. He defined it as a comprehensive system designed to
    optimize agricultural production by carefully tailoring soil and crop management,
    to correspond to the unique condition found in each field while maintaining environmental
    quality. In the same year, Emmert and coworkers [38] published a brief guide about
    “precision farming” a means of growing crops by making more efficient use of inputs
    such as fertilizers and pesticides. So, the term “precision farming” was formally
    introduced into scientific literature in 1994 and by the mid-1990s, what we now
    regard as a paradigm in agriculture, was being referred to precision agriculture
    and the related concept and set of tools nowadays also known as “smart farming”.
    Entering the new era of the digital economy, digital technology has gradually
    penetrated all aspects of today''s society, with high potential for impact in
    agriculture. In this framework, “digital agriculture” and the similar terms such
    as “smart farming”, “e-agriculture”, as well as “agriculture 4.0”, are increasingly
    used terms to refer to the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs)
    with remote and proximal sensing, artificial intelligence-based techniques, big
    data analytics, processing algorithms, robotics, Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain
    technology and machine learning with the aim to monitor, control and optimize
    the activities of agricultural production in terms of productivity and sustainability.
    All this, once again, led to the evolution of terminology used. In true, there''s
    a blurred line between definitions of Precision Agriculture, Smart Farming or
    Digital Agriculture. For some authors smart agriculture fall under the definition
    of precision agriculture, some others use the term Precision Agriculture only
    when referring to production or precise measurements. Others claim it in a more
    holistic approach of smart solutions to capture data and interpreting them using
    computing technologies to make farm operations more predictable and efficient
    [39,40]. In general, all of them refer to the use of modern technologies to manage
    farms in order to improve yield, reducing input and human labor requirements.
    2.2. Precision agriculture technology, sensor and applicator controllers In view
    of what just claimed, the precision agriculture approach is founded on engineering
    technology applications to well-established agronomic management practices. The
    concrete application of these principles, in fact, is strictly dependent on technological
    innovations to acquire, manage, and utilize a large quantity of data required.
    PA refers to a range of rapidly developing technologies which provide more precise
    information about the managed resources and allow variable management of them.
    To this regard, till now, there were few attempts to classify of Precision Agriculture
    Technologies (PATs) and most of them categorizing PATs in three main categories.
    Khanna et al. [41] grouped the range of technologies contributing to the data
    collection, decision making and management processes into diagnostic and applicative
    techniques. Diagnostic technologies are methods of detecting and analyzing spatial
    variability at sub-field level (GPS, GIS, yield monitors, and crop scouting or
    remote sensing systems), whereas applicative tools implement site-specific input
    application decisions using computer-controlled devices that vary input applications
    across the field, focusing on variable-rate application and guidance technologies.
    In the same year, Keskin [42] classified into three main groups of technologies
    as Data Collection, Data Processing/Decision Making and Variable-Rate Application.
    McBratney et al. [43] classifies PATs in Hardware and Sensors; Data Analysis and
    Decision Support Systems; and Commodity. Schwarz and coworker [cited by 44] categorized
    the range of PA technologies as Recording technologies, Reacting technologies
    and Guidance technologies, all relying on some form of geographical positioning
    systems. More recently, Zarco-Tejada et al. [44] categorized PATs in a linear
    manner, following the timeline of use of the technologies ending up in three categories,
    namely Remote Sensing; Guidance Systems; and Variable Rate Applications. Finally,
    Balafoutis et al. [45] divided the smart farming technologies into Data Acquisition
    Technologies; Data Analysis and Evaluation Technologies; Precision Application
    Technologies. When sensors were taken into account, precision agriculture uses
    intensive data and information collection from proximal and remote sensors. Sudduth
    [46] attempted to classify the sensing technologies into GPS for Location Sensing,
    Close-range Sensors and Remote Sensing. Most recently, Veena and coworkers [47]
    identified six sensing technologies which are implied in precision agriculture
    to provide data to monitor and optimize crop yields: Optical Sensors, Electro-chemical
    Sensors, Location Sensors, Dielectric Soil Moisture Sensors, Airflow Sensors and
    Agricultural Weather Stations. From planting to crop harvest, Kakarla and coworkers
    [48] categorized the whole farming process into five different areas (Planting;
    Soil management; Nutrient and Water management; Pest and Diseases management;
    Yield harvesting and Post-harvest processing), whereas they identified several
    categories of sensing systems that are used in agriculture (Remote sensing; Computer
    vision; RGB; Multispectral; Hyperspectral; Thermal; Lidar; Synthetic Aperture
    Radar). In real world, generally patents collected many principles and different
    technologies for plant sensing, and do not easily fall into these classifications.
    3. Methodology 3.1. Collection of patent data and analytics processes The workflow
    of the present study is divided into several steps, as shown in Fig. 1. In the
    first step, a literature review was carried out to mine relevant keywords derived
    from the study of the evolution of terms historically used to refer to the common
    principles associated with the concept of precision agriculture, described in
    the previous Section 2.1. In a second step, fourteen relevant keywords were chosen
    based on knowledge acquired (“digital agriculture”, “high-tech sustainable agriculture”,
    “precise farming”, “precision agriculture”, “precision farming”, “prescription
    farming”, “site specific crop management”, “site-specific farming”, “smart agriculture”,
    “smart farming”, “soil-specific crop management”, “spatially prescriptive farming”,
    “spatially variable field operations”, “variable rate technology”), because they
    has been historically used and/or are sometimes used interchangeably today. Download

    Patent analysis process flow applied in the study. In the third step (data collection),
    an extensive use of the freely available patent databases has been made in the
    USA (http://www.uspto.gov/patft/index.html), Europe (http://ep.espacenet.com/-
    http://www.epo.org), World International Patent Organization (http://pctgazette.wipo.int/).
    In addition, this review includes data from Google Patents Interface (patents.google.com/advanced),
    that indexes more than 87 million patents with full text from the patent offices
    of 17 different countries, and the user-friendly interface of the Google''s search
    engine. The search was carried out also using different set of Boolean operators
    like AND, OR, NEAR, etc. Data of non-English patents were based on the interpretation
    of abstract and claims by means of Google translation tools. The time span was
    set from January 1970 to December 2022. A detailed patent search strategy (step
    four) was designed to identify and retrieve relevant patents on PA, then a structured
    framework was developed for categorizing precision agricultural technologies,
    sensing technologies and agricultural practices to create a taxonomy (see section
    3.2). Precision agriculture, indeed, encompasses a set of sophisticated tools,
    systems and technologies (sensors, tractors, drones, terrestrial platforms, etc.)
    for its full realization, many of which were not specifically developed for agriculture.
    Moreover, patent implementations could be related to the development of single
    sensing device or to the whole system integrating perception, actuation, and decision
    making. To provide the needful restrictions, the search (step five) was narrowed
    keeping in the database only the grants that match the aspect of innovation in
    the five identified agricultural practices and/or the technologies explicitly
    designed for precision agriculture, while keeping out purely technological innovation
    common to several productive contexts. To be clear, we keep into the database
    patents related to sampling the grain characteristics (moisture content, harvest
    yield, etc.) detected at a plurality of locations by mean a GNSS system located
    in an associated vehicle, excluding patents focused just on methods or tools for
    the automatic location of vehicles. Moreover, it was kept out from the search:
    1) the duplicate patents (double patenting occurs when patents are filed by the
    same inventors claiming the same invention in different countries, because they
    has its own system of patent numbering); 2) the patents on topics regarding precision
    agriculture in livestock industry or aquaculture (also knows as “Precision livestock
    farming” that shares common terms with this search); 3) agricultural biotechnologies;
    4) plant breeding, 5) post-harvest precision innovations. Patent analysis was
    conducted manually through the collective expertise of three PhD experts in precision
    agriculture techniques and practices along with one expert specializing in socio-economic
    aspects. It was carried out on entire patent texts to avoid being misled by patent
    information and involved a series of steps, including extracting patents from
    patent databases, extracting information from the patents, and analyzing the extracted
    information to infer the logical conclusions. Since the subjectivity of the selection
    process could represent an issue, to design the selection process as objectively
    as possible the outcome of the downloading procedure was cross-validated, by comparing
    the relevance of the downloaded patents in terms of coherence with the investigated
    sector. All the recovered documents were stored and treated in Excel spreadsheet
    containing the patent number, the title, the year of publication, the country
    of publication, the inventor or the author''s name, the abstract and claims. We
    first examined the analysis of the identified PATs, and, in separate section,
    related them to agricultural practices. It is expected that data records are replicated
    when compared parallelly with other areas. 3.2. Precision agriculture technologies
    and sensing technologies classification Following the scientific literature review
    in previous sections 2.2, many aspects of PA have been analyzed and categorized
    focusing on three relevant technologies or areas of application that can summarize
    in guidance technologies, data acquisition, data processing/decision making/variable-rate
    application. With the purpose of providing a more accurate analysis and comprehensive
    categorization of PATs that this research aims to achieve, a special attention
    has been addressed to those technologies used for facilitating data information
    exchange, digitalization of farming, data storage, decision-making tools and wireless
    communication. Hence, we identified the following four Precision Agriculture Technologies:
    “Positioning and Guidance Technologies”; “Information and Communication Technologies”;
    “Measuring Technologies”; “Reacting Technologies”. The first group provide the
    essential spatial data to conduct the site-specific management, but also information
    allowing the vehicle to navigate along a pre-set path within the field. Second
    group includes focused on data management (sharing, exchange, storage and communication),
    processing and analysis and decision-making purposes. Measuring technologies consist
    of proximal and remote sensor-based systems that record data able to be mapped
    into a farm analytics and management systems. The last group that includes reacting
    technology is the actual application of the precision agriculture. The implementation
    of precision agriculture principles involves various aspects and activities that
    growers undertake during cultivation of crops. Therefore, we related the precision
    agriculture technologies to the following crucial agricultural practices “Sowing”,
    “Fertilization”, “Protection”, “Irrigation”, “Harvesting”. A special attention,
    in our patent search, was also focused on the technologies addressed to measure
    parameters and properties of soil, due to their crucial role for precision agriculture.
    In this field, several grants were addressed to developed to specific soil sensors
    as pivotal data inputs for a profitable use of nutrients or water. We also produced
    a classification to describe sensors and actuators, describing them using the
    domain of interest and the measurements they make. A sensor monitors conditions
    and signals when changes occur, whilst an actuator receives a signal and performs
    an action. Given the aim of the paper, to describe technological advances in sensor/actuator
    design, we classified them in four main categories. 1) Position: use the Global
    navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and the mapping technologies. 2) Optical:
    use electromagnetic waves to detect the level of energy absorbed or reflected
    by a medium. In this context camera-based imaging are the way for remote sensing
    of plants, since detailed information can be get from spectral and spatial intensity
    distribution (RGB, Lidar, infrared, Multi/Hyper-spectral, thermal cameras). 3)
    Electro-chemical: use ion-selective membranes that produce a voltage output in
    response to the activity of selected ions (H+, K+, NO3−, Na+, etc.) and measure
    electrical resistivity or conductivity, capacitance or inductance. 4) Mechanical:
    measure forces, weight or impact. In this category were enclosed the acoustic
    sensors that quantify the sound produced by a tool interacting with the grain,
    for instance. A separate discussion was deserved for the vectors, such as the
    unmanned platforms in Precision Agriculture. 4. Precision agriculture technologies
    Without any restrictions provided by our patent selection strategy, with all the
    abovementioned keywords as search parameters, the number of grants obtained resulted
    in over 4890 outcomes, but keeping out from the search the duplicate and the off
    topic patents, the database counted 2,003, with an enormous increase in the number
    of precision agriculture-related patents registered in the last decade. Fig. 2

    grant per year were counted from the first identified grant on precision agriculture
    in 1986 [31] to the 1998. In next the decade 1999–2008, the number of grants reached
    an average of 17 per year, then a relevant increase in the number of grants patented
    was found until 2014 (with an average of 58 patents per year). From 2015, a dramatic
    increase of the number of grants were recorded, picked with the 233 grants counted
    in 2018. In 2019 and 2020 the number of patents showed a sharply contraction,
    driven by an overall decline in worldwide trademark-filing activity in China [9],
    whereas patent-filing activity returned to growth in 2021. The 49 % of patents
    in precision agriculture are granted in the past five years. China''s National
    Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) processed 61 % of all patents on
    precision agriculture applications (Fig. 3). With over 1200 total grants, China
    patented approximately three-fold than the United States patent system. These
    numbers do not necessarily correspond with intense advances in innovation, because
    in CNIPA patents being granted for small design tweaks and incremental changes
    versus entirely new inventions. While the United States holds the top spot in
    the relevance of innovation, China is expected to continue its dominance in the
    raw quantity of patents published. Download : Download high-res image (220KB)

    use of location sensors, the most advanced precision agriculture practices continue
    to require and apply positioning technologies. A total of 703 grants were counted
    (35 % of the patent granted in PA), 43 % of these are granted in the last five-year
    period 2018–2022 (Fig. 4 - Table 1). Download : Download high-res image (185KB)

    that a patent could be reported multiple times as it could refers to different
    technologies. a The number of Positioning sensors was not reported with in the
    Positioning and guidance technologies. The global positioning technologies based
    on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS, - such as the US NAVSTAR GPS, the
    Russian GLONASS, the European GNSS Galileo, China''s BeiDou, the Japanese Quasi-Zenith
    Satellite System, and India''s NAVIC) or the tools that allow users to capture,
    store, manipulate and analyze spatial information (the Geographic Information
    Systems - GIS) are one of the most common device in precision agriculture. As
    a result, patents in this field relate to provide high-accuracy GNSS-based data
    that can easily be integrated with the ground truth information recorded in the
    field, such as field boundaries, optimizing machine operations, crops cover, crop
    health, weed infestation, yield monitoring and land mapping. The computational
    functionalities of such systems call for improved ICT architecture, creating synergies
    previously unexplored, both in terms of technical development and regarding new
    domains of applications. In this view, we counted a total of 222 grants (61 %
    of these are granted over the past quinquennium) that are associated to technologies
    that combines uses of GNSS and ICT (Table 1). A great number of grants (430, 47
    % granted in the five-year period 2018–2022) make use of position to react to
    a site request, whereas 286 (36 % in the 2018–2022 period) were the grants that
    related global position data to sensors measuring a variety of field and crops
    parameters. Among the sensors, optical (188, 53 % granted in the 2018–2022 period,
    i.e. light detection and ranging, LIDAR, hyper and multispectral cameras) and
    electrical sensors/actuators (178, 39 % granted in the 2018–2022 period, i.e.
    accelerometers, ultrasonic sensors, gyroscopes, etc.) are often used in environmental
    perception and navigation in land vehicles in integration with GNSS or as an alternative
    to it, in scenarios such as indoor environments where the GNSS technologies lack
    precision or fail entirely. Innovation in the field of positioning sensors have
    been addressed to develop Real Time Kinematic (RTK) devices that boosted GNSS
    accuracy with dual-frequency receivers, enabling real-time positioning at centimeter
    level, to trace operation, to monitor crops or, paired with computer vision and
    sensors, to contribute to smart and autonomous farm machineries development. 4.2.
    Information and communication technologies (ICTs) ICTs encompass many different
    types of technologies, from computers and internet to radio communications, to
    Internet of Things and their impact are playing a pivotal role in promoting innovation
    in the agriculture sector. These innovations (including software and hardware
    aspects, data handling, data communication, data interpretation) are revolutionizing
    agriculture, not only in developed economies but also in developing countries.
    The analysis of data revealed 792 grants (40 % of the patent granted in PA), 58
    % of these granted over the past quinquennium (Fig. 4). It delivers a collection
    of technologies and processes that hold great promise for agriculture and rural
    development. Increased efficiency of PA practices are the result of remote control
    and management of machinery using satellite positioning, while data from farm
    operations are collected and analyzed, often in conjunction with information on
    weather data to provide new efficient decision-making tools that promote agricultural
    productivity and manage natural resource effectively. Innovation have been addressed
    to develop wireless sensors as standalone unit or connected as networks called
    wireless sensors network (WSN). For these reasons, it is not surprising that a
    higher number of patents make use of ICT in measuring rather than reacting technologies
    (485 and 332 grants, respectively). 4.3. Measuring technologies Precision agriculture
    requires development of sensors for measurement of crop and soil properties, environmental
    conditions, pest''s identification and diffusion. A number of 1172 grants (59
    % of the patent granted in PA), 29 % of these are granted in the past five-year
    period 2018–2022, are associated to technologies able to monitor environment parameters
    or to characterize a crop status by sensors placed on the ground, canopy, vehicles
    or aerial platforms. In this context, the optical sensors, which use the light
    to measure plant/soil properties (by means of measure of fluorescence, reflectance,
    irradiance, etc.) counted the highest number of grants (544, 58 % over the period
    2018–2022, Table 1) in precision agriculture (i.e., soil nutrient and moisture
    levels, crop health status, etc.). These are followed by electro-chemical sensors
    (501, 42 % in the period 2019–2022), usually ion-selective electrodes and solid-state
    electrochemical sensors providing key information required. Relative humidity,
    air and soil temperature, soil moisture and soil nutrient sensors are areas whose
    sensor advance increased the most. 4.4. Reacting technologies Sensing technologies
    provide actionable data to be processed and implemented as need to optimize crop
    yield while minimizing environmental effects. Having such information at a real-time
    interval, automated actuation devices can be used to control irrigation, fertilization
    and pest control in order to offset the adverse conditions. Variable-rate technology
    (VRT) allows input application rates to be varied across fields for site-specific
    management of the field variability. In this context, 878 grants were counted
    (44 % of the patent granted in PA), 21 % of these in the period 2018–2022. VRT
    can be characterized as a fairly complex technology to use, and many systems to
    be integrated. When the typology of sensor/actuator technology was taken into
    account, the controlled equipment incorporates position (430, as previously reported),
    electro-chemical (314, 50 % in the period 2018–2022), optical (199, 58 %), and
    mechanical (57, 37 %) sensors (Table 1). 5. Precision agriculture technologies
    in agricultural practices 5.1. Precision agriculture technologies on sowing Within
    this topic, 176 patents (9 % of the patents granted in PA – Fig. 5) were counted,
    43 % of these granted in the last quinquennium. Modern precision seeding equipment
    manages to place the seeds and plantlets uniformly at proper distances and depths
    for optimal access to moisture and sunlight. In this field, reacting technologies
    accounted the highest number of grants (146, 42 % in 2018–2022 period – Fig. 6,
    Table 2), followed by those that have as main goal to locate and navigate agricultural
    vehicles within a field for sowing procedures (82, 33 % over the period 2018–2022),
    ITC (49, 65 %) and measuring (34, 47 %). Among the sensory technologies (Table
    3), the greater number of grants patent were counted in electro-chemical sensors
    (68, manly represented by actuators), followed by optical (31) and mechanical
    sensors (17). Download : Download high-res image (231KB) Download : Download full-size

    5.2. Precision agriculture technologies on fertilization The analysis of data
    revealed 412 patents (21 % of the patents granted in PA - Figs. 5), 45 % of these
    granted in 2018–2022 period, in somewhat related to a fertilizer control system.
    Reacting technologies engineered for the optimal supply of nutrient are the object
    of the highest number of grants (306, representing the 74 % of patents in this
    field – Fig. 6, Table 2), followed by positioning (195), ICT (136) and measuring
    (118) technologies. In this peculiar field, the electric actuators accounted 136
    grants (Table 3), whereas the innovation relates to optical sensors to acquire
    information able to adjust rates of fertilizer (both in real time or based on
    previously gathered data such spectral image) counted 112 grants. To date, the
    dominant remote sensing technologies are addressed to grant sensor in visible,
    near infrared (NIR), and short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelength. Mechanical sensors
    and actuators were less represented (17). 5.3. Precision agriculture technologies
    on protection Within this topic, 277 grants addressed to support agricultural
    pest and weed management strategies (14 % of the patent granted in PA - Figs.
    5), 42 % of these are granted in the period 2018–2022. The grants associated to
    crop protection, even in somewhat outnumbered than fertilization, had percentage
    values substantially similar. In practice, it is not possible to make a clear
    distinction between spreading a fertilizer or an insecticide or an herbicide,
    as they tend, in terms of machine innovation, to overlap each other. The highest
    number of grants (216, 78 % of the patents granted in this field – Fig. 6, Table
    2) had as main topic reacting technologies, followed by location and guidance
    technologies (144), ICT (100) and measuring technologies (65). The main part of
    the innovation on this field presents invention related to optical sensors (77,
    Table 3) and the related methods for automatic identification of pests or weeds
    by means of digital RGB camera, whereas 73 patents relate to devices, systems
    and methods that through the use of electric sensors/actuators using GPS knife-based
    systems or to turn on individual nozzles where each knife or nozzles are independently
    controlled by the GPS/RTK technology. 5.4. Precision agriculture technologies
    on irrigation Notwithstanding the importance of controlling irrigation for higher
    yield production, just 122 patents have been granted (6 % of the patent application
    granted in PA - Fig. 5), most of them (32 %) granted in the 2018–2022 period.
    Also for irrigation, reacting technologies accounted the highest number of grants
    (82, 67 % of the patents granted in this context - Fig. 6, Table 2), followed
    by ICT (57) and measuring technologies (44), whereas position technologies achieved
    20 grants. When sensors were taken into account (Table 3), the most represented
    grants were the electro-chemical sensors/actuators (66), followed by the grants
    concerning the optical sensor (20). In fact, the main part of the innovation in
    this field is represented by sensors devoted to measure soil moisture and temperature,
    or acquire weather information using a real-time wireless in-field sensing (wireless
    radio communication) to provide information to control software for site-specific
    sprinkler irrigation. 5.5. Precision agriculture technologies on harvesting An
    accurate measure of crop yield or the development of an automated fruit harvesting
    are useful for farmers for a number of reasons, including labor saving, storage
    requirements, planning fertilization necessities on the next crop cycle, or cash
    flow budgeting. Within this topic, 204 are the grants identified (10 % of the
    grants in PA – Fig. 5), mostly represented by measuring technologies (130, 63
    % of the patents granted in this context - Fig. 6, Table 2), followed by location
    and guidance technologies (88), reacting (77) and ICT (37). The innovation on
    this field has been directed toward the development of electrical sensors (90,
    Table 3), followed by optical (70) and mechanical sensors (51). Under the mechanical
    sensor family was included the acoustic, ultrasonic and impact-based sensors,
    and a large number of grants developed this kind of sensors in harvest machine
    to measure crop yield. Several impact-based yield sensors, available from the
    middle of 1990s [49], have been patented almost exclusively in grain crops. Lowenberg-DeBoer
    [50] defined “killer application” when GPS-based information technology has been
    combined with yield monitors. Yield, indeed, is an indirect indicator of the various
    crop and soil parameters (such as moisture, nutrients, pest problems, etc.) able
    to relate the spatial information on both yield and soil properties to the main
    factors affecting crop productivity. The recent advances in spectral imaging technology
    enabled the development of new sensors that estimate various crop parameters from
    spectral imagery data. At this regard, a number of patents were addressed to develop
    complex vegetation index models to detect crop yields. Another point worthy of
    mention is the increasing number of patents applications that disclose automatic
    harvesting of fruits by a robot (34 between years 2020 and 2022), where fruit
    detection and localization on trees using computer vision and robot arm motion
    are described. 5.6. Precision agriculture technologies to identify soil properties
    How previous reported, precision agriculture began, during the mid-1980s, with
    farming by soil and progressed, in the early 1990s, to the approach based on continuous
    real-time sensing of spatial variations in soil properties using sensors mounted
    on tractors [51]. A total number of 242 grants was addressed to acquiring soil
    parameters, the mostly represented by electro-chemical sensor (130), followed
    by optical sensor (61). The main part of the innovation regarding soil sensors
    are based on the detection of water content and soil properties (soil organic
    matter, nutrient level, pH and topsoil depth) includes determination of available
    phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg),
    the cation exchange capacity (CEC), salinity, nitrate, sulfate, certain micronutrients,
    and heavy metals. The patents devoted to measure these parameters applying diverse
    types of technologies, such as field-based electric sensors, machine vision, airborne
    multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing, satellite imagery, thermal imaging,
    among others. 6. Unmanned platforms in precision agriculture Although in our classification
    it has not been specifically identified as separate PAT, the use of unmanned platforms
    in their various ground and aerial forms (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle – UAV and Unmanned
    Ground Vehicle - UGV) represents definitely a breakthrough tool in precision agriculture,
    almost as much as the use of global position technology at the beginning of the
    ‘90s. They provide unparalleled spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution through
    a range of sensors and cameras capable of carrying out detailed data collection
    for vegetation, drought plant stress, weed and pathogen detection, nutrient status
    and growth vigor assessment, and yield prediction [52]. Over the past five years,
    the number of patents using unmanned vehicles in precision agriculture applications
    has exponentially increased, with a total of 137 grants, 85 % of these are granted
    from 2018. Equipped with GNSS receivers, artificial intelligence, wireless networks
    and inertial measurement units, unmanned vehicles are capable of being fully-fledged
    mobile measurement platforms. Patents in this peculiar field disclosed multi-data
    acquisition devices for various operations devoted to monitoring (such as mapping,
    land inspection, checking for diseased crops, etc., 45 %) or managing the crops
    (spraying fertilizers, herbicide or pesticide, for pollinating of crops, application
    of defoliating agent to assist harvesting, etc., 55 %). The innovation in this
    peculiar field was addressed to the development of components for aerial spraying
    of pesticide (34 %) or fertilizer (30 %). Most of China-originated filings relate
    to UAV''s able to dispense treatments, whereas in the rest of the world, filings
    are spread across applications in areas such as sensors, crop management systems,
    data processing and spray systems. As a main advantage, the unmanned vehicle systems
    can acquire low-cost information of the within-field spatial variation through
    imagery with centimeter resolution. Consequently, it is not surprising that a
    great number of patents (43 %) make use of optical sensors (RGB, multispectral,
    hyperspectral, infrared cameras, Lidar, electromagnetic sensors). If earlier sensors
    on board were more of an adaptation of existing technologies, the latest sensors
    are mostly developed from scratch with the express intent of being utilized on
    UAV or UGV. Patent activity on the electro-chemical sensors devoted to the gas
    sensing applications (8 %) are still poorly represented in a precision agriculture
    context. 7. Conclusions and future outlook This paper represents one of the first
    attempts to analyze patenting activities in the field of Precision Agriculture
    over the period 1970–2022. Patents count was used as the most suitable proxy for
    innovation, and, from this perspective, the patent database has been very useful
    to catch innovation performance at global scale. To date, the impact of patents
    on innovation and development of agricultural technologies has not systematically
    assessed, and such evaluation was sorely needed. Although some recent efforts
    have been made [53,54], due to the nature of patent documents and the information
    associated with them, patent data is particularly nasty. Very often, the patent
    focused just on a peculiar aspect of the device implementation, but without being
    blind to the possibilities to further enactment of the entire system. Moreover,
    a significant number of patents appear to be essentially noise, and systematic
    biases remain in patent statistics, the full evaluation of which necessarily should
    be achieved through a careful classificatory and survey research. This study tries
    to fill this gap, classifying precision agricultural technologies, sensing technologies
    and agricultural practices, and providing a comprehensive overview of changes
    and trends in the development of agricultural technologies, through the definition
    of a taxonomy used to extract, analyze and categorize the patent data. Precision
    agriculture could be certainly considered one the most significant innovation
    introduced to agriculture in the last thirty years, but its adoption rate, at
    least for the first 15 years, did not meet expectations [55] for several different
    reasons. There was no clear evidence of economic feasibility associated with precision
    agriculture [56], due to high technological risk, primarily in the form of obsolescence.
    To this, it must be added a parallel lack of progress in developing of proper
    decision-support systems oriented to the application of the information acquired
    [43]. Another aspect of no less importance was the lack of excludability which
    results in an insufficient incentive for private sector to produce the innovation
    in the first place [57]. Then something changed in these recent years, and the
    number of patent grants in PA, which in 2011 was 74, tripled in 2018, reaching
    a total of 233 grants. Similar results were achieved by Tey and coworkers [54]
    obtained in a patent network analysis comparable findings, noting a fourfold increase
    in patent applications between 2010 and 2019. Over the past ten years, in fact,
    the private companies have become more involved in developing on-farm technologies
    (such agricultural machinery, post-harvest technology, electronic sensors) where
    the market role and intellectually property right (such patents, copyrights and
    trademarks) has long been used to increase the appropriability of innovation-related
    benefits. Moreover, the advancement in low-cost powerful computers, real-time
    controllers, sensing and communication technologies has significantly brought
    down the cost of systems and devices, making precision agriculture feasible. Simultaneously,
    wireless technologies allowed setup remote sensors with several advantages including
    easy installation, cost-effectiveness, small size and low power consumption [58].
    In this view, although the adoption of technologies for precision agriculture
    systems is still a challenging and dynamic issue for farmers, the great part of
    innovation in PA in the past few years seems addressed to help smallholder to
    surmount these obstacles by providing reliable and easy to use information, offering
    competitive advantage that can be introduced into farming without too much effort
    or cost. But the fact that the rise in patenting occurred mainly in new technology
    areas (such as ICT, spectral imaging technology, navigation sensors), where inventions
    have been more intense over the past few year, suggests that patent grants reflect
    trends in invention. This study, indeed, unveiled that the ICT and Global Positioning
    technologies plays an essential role as a key cross-cutting tools supporting several
    measuring and reacting technologies, with the higher number of related patents
    granted in the 2018–2022 period. From the early use of computers and the development
    of basic software for farm management, to the most recent agriculture widespread
    adoption of internet, big data analytics and Internet of Things, ICT is nowadays
    playing a crucial role in promoting sustainable farming practices. Looking forward,
    it would expect to count more patent filings directed toward the artificial intelligence
    (AI), augmented reality, machine vision and cloud-machine learning-based crop
    management systems and robotic [59]. In our research, we counted 16 patents in
    the last three years which explicitly mentioned the use and development of algorithms,
    artificial intelligence and machine learning application specifically developed
    for precision agriculture. Artificial intelligence is being used for crop monitoring,
    pest control, and yield prediction, while robots are aiding in labor-intensive
    tasks like harvesting and weeding. When the innovation on positioning technologies
    was taken into account, it was initially focused on the enhancement of the positioning
    accuracy (e.g. RTK technology), then, from the 2000s, the positioning technology
    started to be merged to other technologies including inertial navigation systems
    and sensors, while actual investments are addressed to the autonomous guidance
    of tractors, rover, robots and UAV to carry out farming tasks such as tilling,
    planting, fertilizing, applying pesticide, weed control and harvesting. Undeniably,
    unmanned platforms offer a wide range of applications to transform traditional
    agricultural practices into Agriculture 4.0 that integrates advanced technology
    to optimize agricultural productivity, sustainability, and efficiency [60]. The
    heavy concentration of activity on sensors/actuators development, as showed by
    the highest number of related patents recorded in this study, was intended to
    enhance versatility in the number of parameters covered, accuracy, reproducibility
    and response times (in the order of one to few seconds). Over the past few years,
    there has been a growing interest in the application of imaging technologies [61]
    and environmental sensors for their application in precision agriculture. When
    combined with satellite data, sensor-derived information is used to make fairly
    accurate forecasts or diagnosis, for spatial, spectral, radiometric applications,
    for yield projection, land use classification, biomass estimation. These tools
    and methods can provide support for the implementation of precision technologies
    and the adoption of best practices to optimize resource use and to improve the
    efficiency and profitability of agricultural operations while minimizing their
    impact on the environment, in both developed and developing economies. In these
    latter, incorporating precision agriculture dictates into the agricultural practices
    can contribute to food security, economic growth, and sustainable development,
    helping these nations in unlocking the possibilities of contemporary agricultural
    technology. In the final analysis, our evidence, for the first time provides some
    support for the potential use of patent statistics as proxy measure of innovation
    in PA, as well as the rates and the directions of innovation process and the aggregate
    information, that can be drawn from the huge amount of data achieved in this study,
    seem to be indicative of the trend of innovation on Precision Agriculture domain.

  description: Earlier, researchers have employed computer vision-based automatic
    fruit detection to estimate coffee yield at the time of harvest, however, studies
    on the on-plant quantification of the coffee fruit are scarce. In this study,
    the latest version of the state-of-the-art algorithm YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once)
    was used for the first time. YOLOv7 was trained with 324 annotated images of fruit
    bearing coffee branches followed by its evaluation with 82 annotated images as
    validation data (supervised method) and then tested through raw images (unannotated)
    as test data. Meanwhile, the K-means models were trained which led to machine-generated
    color classes of coffee fruit for semi-supervised image annotation. Consequently,
    the developed model efficiently analyzed the test data with an mAP@.5 (mean average
    precision) of 0.89. Strikingly, our innovative semi-supervised method with an
    mAP@.5 of 0.77 for multi-class mode surpassed the supervised method which had
    mAP@.5 of only 0.60, leading to faster and more accurate annotation. While testing
    the yield estimation of the model in two plots, an average error of 3.78% was
    recorded between the predicted (pre-harvest) and ground truth (harvest) data for
    binary class mode. The average error for multi-class data was recorded as 3.87%
    for green, 3.445% for green-yellow, 5.09% for cherry-raisin, and 2.51% for dry
    fruits. This AI-based technology when integrated with other tools such as UAV
    would efficiently remotely monitor coffee field for informed decision about irrigation,
    fertilizer application and other measures of timely field management, hence advancing
    precision agriculture. Moreover, this machine learning intelligent model can be
    tailored for various other fruit farming.

    learningartificial intelligencedigital phenotyping 1. Introduction Coffee is a
    highly traded commodity globally ranking second only to oil in terms of traded
    value (FAO, 2023). The crop is a major contributor to the socio-economic development
    of tropical developing countries, with millions of people globally depending on
    it for their livelihoods. Aside from its contribution to agricultural GDP, coffee
    production is a significant employer and supports poverty alleviation (Chemura
    et al., 2016; Läderach et al., 2017). Thus, coffee cultivation is considered an
    avenue for realizing several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such
    as generating income, creating rural employment, and poverty alleviation (FAO,
    2023). Coffee cultivation takes place in over 60 countries, primarily in tropical
    regions that are conducive to its growth. Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia are the
    leading producers worldwide, with Brazil alone accounting for 36% of global coffee
    production (USDA), while the U.S, Brazil and Europe are its top consumers. Additionally,
    coffee plantations, especially shaded farms, provide crucial ecosystem services
    such as biodiversity conservation (Jha et al., 2014), carbon sequestration (van
    Rikxoort et al., 2014), and soil protection (Meylan et al., 2017). The coffee
    market is subject to recurrent supply-demand imbalances and uneven income distribution
    along the value chain. The global exports of coffee were recorded 10.88 million
    bags by December 2022 (ICO, 2023). Per data provided by the International Coffee
    Organization (ICO) in 2023, global coffee production was estimated to have reached
    169.34 million bags, with each bag weighing 60 kg, signifying a decline of 2.2%
    compared to the previous year. In 2021, Brazil suffered a 21.7% drop in coffee
    production, which amounted to an estimated 67.2 million bags due to weather-associated
    factors such as drought and frost. The sustainability of coffee bean production
    and the impact of climate change are key sources of uncertainty for the coffee
    industry. Climatic conditions, especially during the vegetative and reproductive
    phases of the coffee plant, significantly influence coffee yield (Tavares et al.,
    2018). Rising temperatures and precipitation shortages affect flowering, fruiting,
    and bean quality. Furthermore, climate variability is a key factor influencing
    the incidence of severe pests and diseases such as coffee leaf rust and coffee
    berry borer, which can decrease coffee yield and quality and increase production
    costs (Krishnan, 2017). Globally, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, commonly
    referred to as Arabica and Robusta coffees respectively, constitute approximately
    99% of the coffee production (Jayakumar et al., 2017). The quality of beans and
    yield of both species declines when outside these optimal temperature ranges (18-22°C
    for Arabica, while 22-28°C for Robusta), suggesting significant sensitivity to
    climatic changes (Magrach and Ghazoul, 2015). Therefore, from a socio-economic
    standpoint, it is crucial to comprehend the degree of climate-driven impacts on
    coffee production and the advantages of potential adaptation strategies to maintain
    and enhance coffee productivity and profitability while sustaining the livelihoods
    of smallholder producers globally. To protect coffee farms from adverse climatic
    conditions, keep a sustainable production and even enhance coffee yield and productivity,
    coffee farms demand continuous monitoring of every aspect. Nonetheless, the phenomenon
    of asynchronous flowering poses a significant challenge for coffee growers, leading
    to irregular fruit ripening (López et al., 2021). Consequently, this causes problems
    during the harvesting process, as careful attention must be paid to ensure optimal
    timing. Oftentimes, for quality coffee production, coffee farmers resort to the
    practice of lapsed harvesting, wherein they must wait for the next batch of cherries
    to ripen before harvesting. This approach is not only time-consuming but also
    labor-intensive, requiring frequent visits and manual screening of the fruits.
    It is important to note that the quality of coffee is largely dependent on the
    ripeness of the fruits (Thompson et al., 2012). Coffee fruits, commonly referred
    to as red cherries, undergo a color transformation during the ripening process
    (Haile and Kang, 2019). The term \"red cherry\" is used to describe the fruit''s
    epidermis when it achieves a uniform and intense red color at full ripeness, having
    progressed through various shades of green, orange, and pink. Overripe cherries
    turn dark violet, while the presence of green, overripe, or dry cherries in the
    harvested mass negatively impacts the quality of the beverage and subsequently,
    its value in the international market (Velásquez et al., 2019). In particular,
    the proportion of green cherries in the harvested mass can significantly affect
    the beverage''s acidity. To maintain high-quality standards and command a premium
    price, it is crucial to ensure that at least 98% of the harvested cherries are
    fully ripe (Leroy et al., 2006). In the current landscape, the adoption of new
    technologies and innovation is imperative for the beverage industry to increase
    productivity and competitiveness. To this end, the scientific community is making
    significant efforts to develop automatic systems that can enhance the inspection
    process. Numerous studies have already been conducted, resulting in the development
    of various applications that have improved for example sorting processes for different
    fruits and vegetables (Hameed et al., 2018). Technological advancements in precision
    agriculture play a vital role in obtaining accurate and reliable measurements
    for crop monitoring. Precision agricultural practices can enhance the potential
    of a region to produce crops with higher yield and quality at less cost. Remote
    sensing has emerged as a promising technology for coffee management, with studies
    demonstrating its efficacy in evaluating coffee leaf rust levels through the use
    of Sentinel 2 sensor and Random Forest (RF) algorithms combined with vegetation
    indices, as described earlier (Chemura et al., 2017). Convolutional Neural Networks
    (CNNs) (Sultana et al., 2020) are a type of deep learning model that are inspired
    by the human visual system and consist of multiple convolutional and pooling layers
    followed by fully connected layers. The input layer of a CNN takes in the input
    data, which could be an image, and passes it through a series of convolutional
    and pooling layers. The convolutional layers apply convolution operations to the
    input data to extract features such as edges, corners, and textures, which are
    important for object recognition. The pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions
    of the feature maps obtained from the convolutional layers, which helps in reducing
    computational complexity and improving the model''s ability to generalize. The
    output of the last pooling layer is then flattened into a vector, which is passed
    through fully connected layers. These fully connected layers learn complex patterns
    and relationships between the features extracted from the convolutional layers,
    and produce the final prediction output (Bellocchio et al., 2019). During the
    training process, the forward computation is performed to make predictions, and
    the backward computation is performed to compute the gradients of the model parameters
    based on the prediction output and the labeled ground-truth. The gradients are
    then used to update the parameters of the model, typically using optimization
    algorithms such as gradient descent, which iteratively adjust the parameters to
    minimize the loss or cost function. The training process continues for a determined
    number of iterations of forward and backward stages, also known as epochs, until
    a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a certain level of accuracy or a
    maximum number of epochs. This helps the model learn the optimal parameters for
    making accurate predictions on the training data (Liu et al., 2015). Computer
    vision has enabled the implementation of non-destructive techniques for detecting
    and identifying vegetative structures in the field using images. These techniques
    have been successfully applied to a wide range of crops including corn (Guerrero
    et al., 2013), tomatoes (Verma et al., 2014), and oranges (Patel et al., 2011).
    Besides, these techniques have also been implemented with grapes (Dey et al.,
    2012), pineapples (Moonrinta et al., 2010), and vegetable crops (Jay et al., 2015).
    Efficient decision-making on the appropriate harvesting period for coffee fruits
    can be facilitated by tracking their maturation stages through digital phenotyping.
    Ramos (2018) suggests that this can be achieved by determining the percentage
    of mature fruits on tree branches (Ramos et al., 2018). While previous studies
    have relied on destructive sampling, mainly post-harvest, to quantify and classify
    fruit for yield estimation (Carrillo and Penaloza, 2009; de Oliveira et al., 2016),
    only a limited number of studies have explored the classification of coffee fruits
    before harvest, which can significantly benefit coffee farmers decision-making.
    Earlier, Avendano et al. (2017)) developed a system that constructs a 3D representation
    of coffee branches and classifies their vegetative structures (Avendano et al.,
    2017). In this pursuit, another group came with a brilliant idea of developing
    a CV-based non-destructive method of fruit counting and classification similar
    to ours, with a few differences including a specific holder for smartphone during
    imaging, bit larger dataset to reproduce, and data modelling (Ramos et al., 2017).
    Few advancements were recently seen in this field. For example, a study developed
    a vegetation index (VI) for coffee ripeness based on the imaging data obtained
    from coffee fields through an RGB and a five-band multi-spectral cameras, each
    fixed on a separate UAV (Nogueira Martins et al., 2021). Similarly, Rodriguez
    et al. earlier came with a classic computer vision approach, however, it involved
    many instruments for image acquisition, a complex image processing system with
    precision values (Rodríguez et al., 2020). Although this technique requires the
    extraction of various features and their input into a classification algorithm,
    recent advancements in computer vision systems based on deep learning allow for
    the automatic extraction of multiple features. These techniques have gained popularity
    due to their speed and accuracy. Some recent studies devised yield mapping technique
    during harvest based on imaging from a camera mounted over the harvesting machine,
    using YOLOv4 (Bazame et al., 2022, 2021; Martello et al., 2022). The current study
    aimed at implementing the state-of-the-art CNN-based computer vision algorithm
    YOLOv7, the latest version (Wang et al., 2022), to detect and classify coffee
    fruits on tree branches at different maturation stages. The algorithm was first
    trained with training data (324 annotated images) and then evaluated with test
    data (82 annotated images), followed by testing with raw images (unannotated).
    We aimed at introducing a novel semi-supervised method for annotating the training
    data, which would save time and be able to handle large sets of data. This AI-based
    technology when integrated with other tools such as UAV would efficiently remotely
    monitor coffee field for informed decision about irrigation, fertilizer application
    and other measures of timely field management, implementing precision agriculture
    in sustainable quality coffee production chain. Nonetheless, this machine learning
    intelligent model could also be tailored for various other fruit farming. 2. Materials
    and Methods 2.1. Data Preparation We began by collecting images from various coffee
    farms at Lavras, and surrounding areas, Minas Gerais, which is the highest coffee
    producing area in Brazil. The areas included 21°09′51.7\"S 44°59′31.7\"W, 21°
    13′ 33.0852′'' S44° 58′ 17.7312′'' W, and 21° 13′ 44.4144′'' S 44° 57′ 47.0916′''
    W. The flowering in coffee is asynchronized, leading to varied dates of anthesis
    events (flower opening). In the mentioned location, a full bloom was observed
    in early September (first week), while following the fruit set, the branches were
    imaged once every week throughout the course of ripening, starting from November
    up to harvest in June and early July. For a broad applicability, the images used
    in this study included those photographing coffee fruits (branches) at every stage
    as the images were taken along a course of time from unripe green fruits to ripe
    cherries and raisin ones. The fruit bearing branches were photographed using various
    smartphone cameras at different angles to achieve representative data. The images
    were shot with default parameters of the smartphone camera, from an approximate
    distance of 30 cm (or including 7 to 10 nodes) in an angle of mostly 90° in relation
    to the coffee plagiotropic branch. The images were not calibrated or processed
    so that the algorithm would be able to detect fruits in a very easy and precise
    way independently of the equipment. All the images taken in the field were properly
    tagged and stored in a local database. The dataset of 406 images was split into
    training and validation sets, with a training split of 80% (324 images, 33,717
    fruits) and a validation split of 20% (82 images, 10,094 fruits). This random
    division of the dataset ensures that the models are trained on a diverse set of
    images and can generalize well to new data. In order to train the model for a
    diverse range of images, we deliberately included images of coffee plant branches
    in shade and those exposed to sunlight, and even with varied angles and distance.
    The images were manually annotated through bounding boxes using Label Studio (Label
    Studio), an open-source platform for creating labeled datasets, to accurately
    identify the coffee cherries on the tree canopy. The software used included Label
    Studio version 1.6.0 (HumanSignal, Inc.), and Python version 3.10.9 (Python Software
    Foundation) with Python libraries Pytorch (version 1.0.2), numpy (1.20.1), scikit-learn
    (0.24.1), scipy (1.6.2), seaborn (0.11.1), pandas (1.2.4), matplotlib (3.3.4).
    In the process of annotation, the color scale (green, yellow, red, dark-red and
    dry (black)) defined previously (Ságio, 2009), was used as reference. 2.2. Training
    the Model To train a computer vision model, for example to identify the target
    object in an image in this case, the algorithm should be first fed with annotated
    images. Here we used YOLO, which is a part of a family of one-stage object detectors
    and is popular for its speed and accuracy. We first evaluated and compared the
    efficiency of YOLOv5 (Jocher et al., 2022), YOLOv5m6 (Li et al., 2023) and YOLOv7,
    which are the latest versions and have not been employed for this purpose before.
    An ideal state-of-the-art model should have (1) a faster and stronger network
    architecture; (2) a more effective feature integration method; (3) a more accurate
    detection method; (4) a more robust loss function; (5) a more efficient label
    assignment method; and (6) a more efficient training method. As compared to YOLOv4,
    YOLOv7 has been proved to be more efficient even with 75% less parameters and
    36% less computation (Wang et al., 2022). To facilitate model training, all images
    were resized to 640 × 640 pixels. To further improve the model ability to generalize,
    default data augmentation techniques specific to the implemented models were used.
    In particular, we used mosaic augmentation, as described earlier (Bochkovskiy
    et al., 2020), to randomly combine multiple images into a single training sample.
    Mosaic augmentation works by stitching four images together at random positions
    in a larger canvas to create one larger mosaic image. The ground truth annotations
    of individual images in the mosaic image are then adjusted. A diverse set of images
    in the training data helped the models learn to better handle occlusions and other
    challenging conditions. Notably, the collected images contained a certain level
    of noise, reflecting the reality of field data collection and further challenges
    the models ability to generalize learning. Equations 1 and 2 were used in comparing
    the three different models. (1) where; IoU - Intersection over Union, A - Ground
    Truth Boxes (The manual labeled bounding box of a particular object in an image),
    B - Predicted Boxes (The predicted bounding box from the detection and classification
    algorithm), (2) where; AP - Average Precision, P – Precision, R – Recall “Precision”
    measures the number of correct positive predictions. “Recall” measures the number
    of correctly identified positive class samples present in the dataset. 2.3. Developing
    a semi-supervised annotation system To accelerate the annotation process, we utilized
    the annotation text-file in YOLO format (used for training the models in binary
    and multiclass mode) to collect objects (coffee fruits) in images, which were
    then subjected to cropping and resizing to 28 × 28 × 3 dimensions. To address
    potential lighting variations, we converted the resized RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
    images into the LAB color-space and extracted the A and B color channels for further
    analysis, eliminating the L channel, since the lightning variation could enhance
    bias into categorizing fruits based on shadow and light variations. The AB color
    space images were represented as vectors in a multidimensional space, and K-means
    models were trained with different k-sizes (2 to 7) on a dataset of approximately
    36,000 fruits randomly selected from the dataset to create different classes of
    colors of fruits. The sketch of the strategy is shown below. To enable semi-supervised
    learning, we curated annotations comprising of manually annotated bounding boxes
    but unsupervised sub-categories of fruits. By leveraging these annotations, we
    performed semi-supervised learning in object detection tasks in the selected model
    (YOLOv7), which is crucial for real-world applications. By allowing the creation
    of in-demand complex subcategories of objects, the selected model was trained
    in the semi-supervised learned sub-categories of fruits and contrasted with the
    performance from the model of supervised learning from the same number of categories
    and hyperparameters. All three object detection models (YOLOv5, YOLOv5m6 and YOLOv7)
    were trained using the default hyperparameters specified in the respective papers
    or repositories, except for the batch size and number of epochs. In this study,
    a batch size of 16 and 100 epochs were used for all models. Batch size determines
    the number of images processed in a single forward and backward pass to calculate
    the gradient for weight updates. It affects memory usage and computational efficiency,
    with larger batches potentially speeding up training. Epochs denote the number
    of complete passes of the entire dataset through the neural network during training.
    The selection of epochs influences the duration of training and the model''s ability
    to generalize. The training and evaluation were conducted on a Tesla T4 GPU available
    in Google Colab (Bisong and Bisong, 2019). At the Google CoLab, the online GPUs
    allow for faster execution of the code and developing of the model. The evaluation
    metrics used in this study included Precision, Recall, and mAP (He and Garcia,
    2009). 2.4. Validation of the model The selected model was used to quantify coffee
    fruits and their specific class based on their maturity level, such as unripe
    and ripe. The model was trained on a large dataset of coffee fruit (324) images
    with labels indicating their class. The model was able to learn features and patterns
    that distinguish different maturation stages of coffee fruits from each other.
    Afterwards, the model was applied to images of the entire dataset to predict their
    class and count the number of fruits in each image. The performance of the model
    was evaluated by comparing its predictions with the ground truth labels obtained
    from the manual annotation process. The accuracy and precision of the model were
    reported as metrics of its effectiveness in quantifying coffee fruits and their
    specific class. To estimate the percentage of ripeness and unripeness in the plant,
    equation 3 and 4 were used. (3) (4) To check the yield estimation efficiency of
    the model, the automatic counting data (number) was correlated with the harvested
    and manually measured (weight) data. The yield data was analyzed both in binary
    and multiclass modes. 3. Results 3.1. Label Studio and Google CoLab are efficient
    platforms for data annotation and machine learning While annotating the data,
    the Label Studio proved efficient both for aiming the object such as where the
    object in the image is located as well as classifying it such as what the object
    is and to which category it belongs. Similarly, following data annotation, Google
    CoLab also displayed all the necessary features to execute the YOLO through script.
    A total of 9416 fruits were labelled as ripe and 34395 as unripe, for binary class
    data. Similarly, for multiclass data, 23886 fruits were labelled as green, 10509
    as green-yellow, 4303 as cherry, 4265 as raisin, 848 as dry. Fig. 1 shows a random
    training data image of coffee fruit bearing branch captured with a smartphone
    camera, before (1A) and after (1B) annotation with Label Studio. Different colored

    using Label Studio. The unannotated image (A) depicts a branch of coffee plant
    bearing fruits at various stages such as green, green-yellow, cherry and raisin.
    Using Label Studio, all the visible fruits in image were annotated (B). Different
    colored boxes were used to classify the fruit at various stages such as unripe,
    yellow, cherry, raisin and dry. The whole training dataset (324 images) was annotated
    in the same way. 3.2. Comparison of various versions of YOLO to get the best mAP
    In the dataset of total 406 images, 324 were used as training data while 82 as
    validation data. After training the algorithm, the selected models (YOLOv5, YOLOv5m6
    and 7), chosen for their high mean average precision at 50% intersection over
    union (mAP@.5) and real-time object detection capabilities in COCO dataset (13;
    14), were trained on our training dataset (324 images). While comparing the object
    detection efficiency of three different YOLO versions, the results showed that
    YOLOv7 achieved the highest mAP@.5 values in all modes, followed by Yolov5 and
    Yolov5m6 (Table 1). YOLOv7 showed mAP@.5 value of 0.904 for mono class (only fruit),
    0.892 for binary class (unripe/ripe) while 0.605 for multiclass (green, yellow-green,
    cherry, raisin, dry). The rest two versions showed lesser values for all categories
    (Table 1). Fig. 2 further demonstrates the better performance of YOLOv7 compared
    to the other two for mono, binary and multiclass. Table 1. Comparison of object

    in three modes of the dataset: Mono (only fruits), Binary (unripe and ripe fruits),
    and Multiclass (continuous classification scale - unripe, yellow, cherry, raisin
    and dry), YOLOv7 outperformed YOLOv5 and YOLOv5m6. 3.3. Development of a novel
    semi-supervised annotation system Through manual bounding boxes and automatic
    classification, a semi-supervised method was developed for the annotation of training
    data. Here, K-means clustering was used to create categories of coffee fruits
    based on their color. We trained K-means models with different k-sizes ranging
    from 2 to 7 and evaluated their performance based on their ability to identify
    distinct color clusters. To our interest, the K-means model efficiently identified
    distinct color clusters within the high-dimensional (28*28*2 axis) and created
    categories of the various stages of coffee fruits that were visually distinguishable.
    In this novel approach, the categories were composed of coffee fruits with similar
    color representing similar ripening stage, which can be useful for further analysis
    and classification. After categorization, we performed PCA in the high-dimensional
    vector to produce visualization of the boundaries among clusters (Fig. 3). Download

    Principal Component analysis of dataset annotated through semi-supervised approach.
    Various clusters in each class are visible in different colors. As the number
    of classes increased from two to seven classes, the mAP@.5 value also increased,
    however 4 classes appeared to be optimum. The seven various color classes of the
    coffee fruit ripening stage created through k-means are shown in Fig. 4. Employing
    semi-supervised approach, we attempted to annotate the same training and validation
    datasets which was earlier annotated using supervised method. Interestingly, the
    precision of detection increased with the increase in number of classes, whereas
    the optimal number of classes was determined to be 4, which was also visualized
    through Elbow method shown in Figure S1. Download : Download high-res image (2MB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. K-means-based machine–generated color
    classes as semi-supervised method. There were up to 7 classes generated keeping
    k = 7, however the optimal number of classes was determined as 4. 3.4. Comparison
    of the supervised and semi-supervised annotation methods To validate the efficiency
    as well as consistency of the novel machine learning method, we compared the performance
    of semi-supervised model with the supervised one. Fig. 5 shows the comparative
    performance of supervised and semi-supervised annotations in binary as well as
    multiclass modes. To our interest, the semi-supervised model performed faster
    and more accurate annotation than the supervised one. Fig. 5A depicts output of
    the supervised (5A) and semi-supervised (5B) method for binary class annotation.
    The number of ripe (R) and unripe (UR) fruit through ML-based annotation is written
    above each image. The output of comparison of supervised and semi-supervised methods
    in multi-class mode is shown in Fig. 5C and 5D, respectively. The number as well
    as class of the fruit detected are mentioned in the figure. The images in both
    the binary and multiclass represent four different time points of fruit ripening
    (from earlier (A, B) to later stages (C, D)). Comparing both the cases (Fig. 5A,
    B, C, and D), it is clear that semi-supervised annotation surpassed the supervised
    annotation in terms of speed and accuracy. This is further simplified graphically
    in Fig. 6. For binary class, the supervised and semi-supervised training models
    had an equal mAP@.5 of .89 (Fig. 6A), showing similar performance for both methods.
    However, for multi-class detection (Fig. 6B), the mAP@.5 was 0.77 in case of semi-supervised
    model, which was only 0.6 with the supervised method, keeping the number of categories
    the 4 in both cases. It proves the high resolving power of the semi-supervised
    annotation. Moreover, its faster and more accurate annotation feature will aid
    in machine learning of large dataset, in less time. This is a novel and rigorous
    approach to analyze large-scale coffee-fruits datasets, which can have significant
    implications for various fields such as computer vision, image processing, and
    machine learning. Download : Download high-res image (3MB) Download : Download

    methods (A). However, for multi-class annotation, the semi-supervised method displayed
    higher mAP@.5 value of 0.77 as compared to 0.66 of the supervised method (B),
    showing better performance. 3.5. Validation of the established model To check
    the efficiency of our trained model, we initially tested it by feeding raw images,
    not included in our initial dataset. Afterwards, we also tracked the ripening
    of coffee fruits in real time. Both the approaches proved the higher image processing
    efficiency of our established model. Fig. 7 depicts raw images not originally
    included in our dataset. The raw images from the field were analyzed with the
    model where; Fig. 7A shows the binary class detection counting only ripe and unripe
    fruits. However, multi-class fruit detection and quantification, classifying them
    into green, green-yellow, cherry and raisin is also shown in Fig. 7B. The number
    and category of the fruit are written above each image. This proved the model
    was successful in image processing. A collection of data like this will provide
    a broad picture of the fruit ripening pattern, estimate yield and harvesting time.
    The big data will eventually aid in informed decision on coffee crop management
    specially plans for harvest and post-harvest measures. Download : Download high-res

    show fruit counts while letters denote fruit type as UR – Unripe, RP – Ripe, C
    – Cherry G – Green, GY – Green-yellow, R – Raisin. For further validation, we
    tracked and analyzed the fruit ripening in a coffee field in real time for 90
    days. Fig. 8A shows the ripening in binary mode (unripe and ripe) over the said
    time duration. Fig. 8B depicts the ripening information of the same data in multi-class
    mode over the 3-month period. It is obvious from this example that for about the
    initial 40 days there is higher percentage of unripe fruit which turn ripe after
    this period. We additionally demonstrated the potential of this algorithm to be
    used in crop analysis and estimation, utilizing regression and ridgeline plots
    (Figure S2) to illustrate the variation in mature fruit proportions over the growing
    season. Download : Download high-res image (601KB) Download : Download full-size

    and decision about harvest time for crops like coffee involve manual counting
    of fruits (usually through destructive sampling), which is laborious, time-consuming,
    and often error-prone. Federación Nacional de Cafeteros (FNC) reported a significant
    portion of coffee fruit is wasted by the destructive sampling which includes 60
    coffee trees per hectare in an area of 2000 hectares, for coffee yield estimation
    (Ramos, et al., 2016). To rapidly monitor coffee crop specially during fruit ripening
    time which is usually from January to May and June, estimate the yield and harvest
    time, forecasting market supply, and reducing production costs, precision agricultural
    approaches present an efficient and reliable solution. These take help of the
    artificial intelligence technology especially computer vision. In this study,
    we present a novel computer vision-based approach for estimating coffee crop yields
    as well as harvest time. Our approach involves training of a model for which the
    image dataset was annotated using online tools. Our dataset included images of
    fruit bearing branches of coffee plants. While addressing the above-mentioned
    issues, we trained the state-of-the-art object detection model YOLOv7 to count
    and classify coffee fruit in images. YOLO is CNN-based object detection model,
    where CNN is being used in numerous areas such as the facial recognition system
    the software of webcams and surveillance cameras. The annotation results (Fig.
    1) of our training and validation datasets demonstrated that the online platform
    Label Studio for annotating the images, possesses multiple features such as shared
    working, allowing more than one person to deal a common project. Comparing YOLOv7
    with the two other versions, YOLOv5 and YOLOv5m6 (Table 1), we obtained highest
    mAP value with YOLOv7, which is also obvious in Fig. 2. Ramos et al (2018) while
    using an alternative approach of using 3D images (via Structure from Motion (SfM),
    which is a computational technique, to generate 3D structures (point clouds),
    from corresponding points in multiple views of an object in space) in Support
    Vector Machine (SVM), constructing statistical estimation model for each ripening
    stage obtained a maturation index with 83% efficiency. While comparing with YOLOv3
    for all network sized considered, an earlier study obtained mAP of 83.5% with
    YOLOv4 (Bazame et al., 2022). However, it is lower than the mAP we obtained with
    YOLOv7, which is >89%. Moreover, they reported an 8.8% lower Floating Points Operations
    (FLOPs) for YOLOv4, as compared to YOLOv3. The same group earlier executed a full-fledged
    experiment using YOLOv3-tiny, yet obtained mAP of 84%, while AP of 86%, 85% and
    80% for unripe, ripe and overripe coffee fruits, respectively (Bazame et al.,
    2021). Nonetheless, the group estimated coffee yield only at harvest stage, while
    also using older version of YOLO. This also undermines the CV-aided estimation
    of the harvest time. A very recent study while comparing YOLOv7 and YOLOv4 models,
    based on average precisions (APs) for four apple flower bud growth stages and
    mean APs (mAPs), showed that YOLOv7 outperformed YOLOv4 in all growth stages and
    at all training image annotation quality levels. When trained with 100% training
    image annotation quality, YOLOv7 achieved a mAP of 0.80, whereas YOLOv4 achieved
    a mAP of 0.63 with only 5% training image annotation quality. The improvement
    in APs and mAPs varied depending on the growth stage and training image annotation
    quality. YOLOv7 showed improvements in APs ranging from 1.52% to 166.48% and mAPs
    ranging from 3.43% to 53.45% compared to YOLOv4, again depending on the specific
    growth stage and training image annotation quality (Yuan, 2023). YOLOv7 with the
    SENet attention mechanism and a weighted loss function, was effective in addressing
    the challenges of semantic segmentation of standing tree images, and outperformed
    other methods in terms of detection speed and segmentation accuracy by showing
    mean pixel accuracy (MPA) of 94.69% and mean intersection over union (MIoU) of
    91.17% (Cao et al., 2023). In addition to its yield estimation capabilities, the
    Yolov7 model can also extract valuable information about the ripening process
    of crops over time. By calculating the percentage of ripe fruits over months,
    we can create plots that visualize the progression of ripeness levels as the crops
    mature, as well as the categorization of the pattern of maturation present in
    the farm. These plots provide farmers and researchers with valuable insights into
    the development of the crop, enabling them to plan harvesting schedules, optimize
    yields, and better understand the underlying biological processes. By quantifying
    ripeness in this way, we can improve our ability to predict and manage crop yields,
    ultimately leading to more efficient and sustainable agricultural practices. Furthermore,
    the data collected from the model allows for an analysis of the distribution of
    ripe and unripe fruits throughout the growing season. One of the challenges of
    annotation using an adapted scale in the field is the increase of confusion between
    classes due to the overlapping of features present in the classes. This can be
    seen by comparing the confusion matrices of binary (Figure S4) and multiclass
    (Figure S5) annotation schemes. This confusion can affect the reliability and
    validity of the annotation process and compromise the quality of the data. Therefore,
    it is important to create mathematically optimized scales that can reduce ambiguity
    and increase consistency among annotators. Such scales can also facilitate the
    analysis and interpretation of the data and enhance the scientific contribution
    of the research. Although YOLOv7 displayed higher values even in multiclass mode,
    yet it needs further improvement to achieve the best results. Enlarging and further
    diversifying the training dataset could also further improve its performance.
    The semi supervised model we devised is a novel method for annotating coffee images
    in training as well as validation data. The semi-supervised learning categories
    can be more representative of the mathematical process of categorization in AI
    and avoid human error being propagated through the machine learning metrics by
    imposing categories or scales. Besides that, the semi-supervised learned categories
    accelerate the process of annotations and can be used to create mathematically-optimized
    models and scales (van Engelen and Hoos, 2020). However, care should be taken
    in the semi-supervised approach as the machine-generated color categories of coffee
    fruits could sometimes be confused and mixed. This problem could be minimized
    by enlarging as well as diversifying the training data. Our choice of employing
    K-means clustering to create categories of coffee fruits based on color was driven
    by its ability to uncover distinct color clusters within the intricate high-dimensional
    space (28282 axis) of coffee fruit images. The resulting categories, which visually
    represent various ripening stages, offer a valuable resource for further analysis
    and classification. This approach holds promise for enhancing the understanding
    of coffee fruit development, as it groups fruits with similar color profiles into
    categories indicative of analogous ripening stages. The utilization of Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize the boundaries among these clusters provided
    a tangible representation of the model''s performance and the inherent color patterns
    captured within the dataset. Our findings also extended to the realm of model
    optimization. Through the semi-supervised approach, we sought to annotate the
    same training and validation datasets initially annotated using a supervised method.
    Notably, the precision of detection exhibited an intriguing trend, with an increase
    in the number of classes correlating with enhanced precision. Importantly, our
    investigation pinpointed the optimal number of classes as four, highlighting the
    model''s capacity to discern meaningful distinctions and subsequently refine detection
    precision. Here, it is important to note that the categories created by K-means
    were based solely on color and did not necessarily correspond to different types
    or varieties of coffee fruits, such as maturity. Therefore, further analysis and
    classification was required to accurately identify the different types of coffee
    fruits being represented in each category. Further analysis to acknowledge this
    problem was performed by correlating the output categories with the Moraes categories
    used in the annotation process. By doing this, we defined categories in a crescent
    order of maturity. It holds enormous potential in handling a dataset despite its
    size. One thing to note is number of classes at which the color classification
    is optimum. In our case, we determined the optimal number of color classes to
    be 4. Our semi-supervised method outperformed the supervised method as it gave
    a mAP@.5 of 0.77 compared to 0.60 of the supervised method in multiclass detection
    mode. It proves the high resolving power of the semi-supervised annotation. Ramos
    et al. (2017), developed one of the pioneer CV system, which they named MVS for
    coffee fruit detection and counting, where they also considered using masking
    technique which aided in detecting the occluded fruits in images. The same masking
    technique if applied to our model could enhance the precision of our system. This
    should be addressed in future. While the supervised method showcased competitive
    results in binary classification, its performance lagged behind the semi-supervised
    counterpart in the more intricate landscape of multi-class detection. As such,
    researchers navigating multi-class classification tasks may find the semi-supervised
    approach to be a valuable tool for achieving higher accuracy and robustness. Moreover,
    its faster and more accurate annotation feature will aid in machine learning of
    large dataset, in less time. This is a novel and rigorous approach to analyze
    large-scale coffee-fruits datasets, which can have significant implications for
    various fields such as computer vision, image processing, and machine learning.
    This performance could even be enhanced in future as newer improved versions of
    YOLO become available. However, increasing this value should be addressed in future
    CV studies regarding coffee. Once the imaging data has been collected, this technology
    can be efficiently applied to quantify fruit in a non-destructive, cost-effective
    and non-laborious way. It not only informs about the yield and harvest time, but
    also monitors plant health. The ripening stage as well as health of coffee fruit
    are quite obvious from its color, for example, unripe fruit are green and ripe
    are red but overripe turn black and even dry if not harvested on time. Similarly,
    pre-mature blackening of the coffee fruit means abnormality which may be due to
    temperature changes, osmotic stress or malnutrition. The observation at the early
    stage of such a problem can rescue the crop by taking timely measures such as
    irrigation and fertilizer application, accordingly. In short, it is a simple yet
    very useful system for coffee farming and would prove revolutionary in enhancing
    coffee yield and quality in the coffee producing areas such as Minas Gerais, Brazil.
    This allows us to accurately monitor the plant health, estimate yield and harvest
    time through images showing coffee fruit on branches, in a non-destructive way
    with minimum human intervention. Bazame et al. (2021) also used their model for
    videos recorded during the coffee harvest, making it possible to map the qualitative
    attribute of the maturation stage of coffee over the experimental area, We also
    envision to integrate the video function which would be useful in faster and more
    convenient data collection in addition to farm monitoring via UAV. In precision
    agriculture, our model''s accurate pre-harvest classification can empower farmers
    with timely insights, enabling them to make informed decisions about harvesting
    schedules, resource allocation, and crop management practices, which will optimize
    yield, minimize waste, and enhance overall productivity. Moreover, the impact
    extends to supply chain management, where reliable pre-harvest classification
    offers an advantage. However, variability in environmental conditions, lighting,
    and image quality could potentially impact the model''s performance under real-world
    circumstances. As a result, rigorous testing and validation across diverse scenarios
    are essential to ensure its reliability and robustness. Furthermore, the model''s
    generalization beyond the training data, particularly to new and unseen datasets,
    should be rigorously assessed to ascertain its practical applicability. Continuously
    collecting data across diverse environments and lighting conditions can contribute
    to refining the model''s adaptability and performance. Integrating additional
    modalities, such as hyperspectral or thermal data, hold the potential to provide
    supplementary insights and enhance overall classification accuracy. Exploring
    ensemble approaches, where predictions from multiple models or modalities are
    combined, could further elevate the model''s accuracy and reliability. In terms
    of practical deployment, assessing the model''s real-time performance in scenarios
    like automated fruit sorting systems is crucial to validate its feasibility and
    efficiency in dynamic agricultural settings. Additionally, user interface development
    plays key role, as creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces can facilitate
    easy interaction with the model''s predictions, enabling farmers and stakeholders
    to make practical and timely decisions. 5. Conclusions As a temperature sensitive
    tropical plant, weather changes can greatly affect coffee yield. Thus, the continuous
    monitoring of coffee specially during fruit ripening is indispensable for its
    production in a sustainable manner. Under these scenarios, computer vision-aided
    coffee fruit quantification and yield estimation studies have been carried out
    in the recent past, however some of them used expensive machinery and complex
    image processing while others used outdated machine learning models. The most
    important results of our work include, 1) using the latest state-of-the-art YOLOv7,
    we obtained an mAP@.5 of 0.89, the highest ever so far. 2) We devised a semi-supervised
    method of annotating coffee images (training data), which would greatly aid in
    handling large datasets in less time. 3) The real-time tracking of coffee fruit
    ripening over a period of 90 days validated the efficiency of our system in predicting
    harvest time and yield estimate. With the integration of UAV and other value addition,
    the developed system holds enormous potential to be used in monitoring coffee
    farms for informed decision on timely field management, harvest time and post-harvest
    measures, which will ultimately enhance coffee yield and contribute to sustainable
    coffee production. CRediT authorship contribution statement Francisco Eron: Formal

    The global agricultural sector is a major user of freshwater, accounting for around
    70 % of the world''s consumptive use of freshwater resources. However, traditional
    agricultural irrigation methods face substantial challenges, including inefficiencies
    in water usage and suboptimal agricultural productivity. Additionally, the unpredictable
    impacts of climate change and global warming have disrupted rainfall patterns,
    affecting crop water needs, which vary based on seasonal and environmental factors
    such as weather conditions [1]. According to the findings of the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), countries within the Mediterranean Basin are poised
    to experience more pronounced effects of climate change. These effects will manifest
    primarily as increasing temperatures, a reduction in the overall water balance,
    and an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events [2]. Specifically,
    in the Mediterranean Basin, there are two major challenges: less rainfall and
    rising temperatures, especially during the summer period. These lead to water
    shortages in many areas, affecting rivers, lakes, and water reservoirs. Water
    shortages are a significant threat to food and energy security, especially for
    agriculture, resulting in lower crop yields and jeopardising sustainable development.
    Adding to these concerns, the world''s population is expected to reach 9.1 billion
    by 2050, increasing the demand for food and energy, and making the issues of water
    scarcity and rising temperatures in the Mediterranean Basin even more pressing
    [3]. Greece, a Mediterranean Basin country experiencing the impacts of climate
    change [4], is one of the largest producers olive and cotton in Europe. In the
    olive cultivation sector, Greece consistently maintains its position among the
    top three European countries, alongside Spain and Italy, accounting for approximately
    15 % of the total 4.6 million hectares of olive groves within the European Union
    in 2017 [5,6]. Moreover, cotton is primarily grown in the European Union on around
    320,000 ha, with Greece dominating the cotton area at 80 %, followed by Spain
    and Bulgaria [7,8]. Although cotton and olive trees possess impressive adaptability
    to diverse environmental conditions, they remain vulnerable to the impacts of
    climate change, particularly concerning their growth and need for irrigation [9,10].
    Olive trees thrive in regions with as little as 400 mm of annual precipitation—below
    the traditionally recommended 600 mm threshold [11]. Despite the inherent drought
    tolerance of olive trees, modern agriculture increasingly employs irrigation for
    olive cultivation to optimize yields and address the challenges posed by shifting
    climate patterns and the rising demand for olive-related products. As a result,
    implementing efficient irrigation management strategies and adopting precision
    irrigation technologies play a crucial role in ensuring sustainable and resource-efficient
    olive farming [9]. Cotton cultivation requires 600–1000 mm of precipitation during
    its entire growth phase, further highlighting the importance of water in its cultivation.
    The absence of sufficient water for cooling poses a significant threat to cotton
    plants due to excessive heat. Consequently, cotton''s growth and temperature management
    heavily rely on irrigation, whether from precipitation or irrigation. Precise
    timing and proper water application during the growing season become critical,
    as any disruptions in water availability can hinder plant development, potentially
    resulting in reduced yields. Notably, cotton farming significantly relies on irrigation,
    accounting for approximately 53 % of the world''s total irrigation, with irrigated
    fields producing 3000–4000 kg of seed cotton per hectare, compared to 1000–2000
    kg in non-irrigated fields. Consequently, over 73 % of the world''s cotton fibre
    originates from irrigated cultivation [10,12]. To address water scarcity and subsequent
    sustainability challenges, precision irrigation systems have emerged as a practical
    solution [13]. Precision irrigation, in the context of precision agriculture,
    is a technologically driven practice that involves the accurate and timely assessment
    of crops'' water requirements, followed by the precise delivery of the exact amount
    of water they need. This method incorporates information systems, communication
    networks, and real-time control mechanisms to monitor and respond to crops'' dynamic
    water needs, taking into account factors such as soil variations, plant responses,
    and changing weather conditions. The overarching goal of precision irrigation
    is twofold: firstly, to optimize water usage and enhance the efficiency of crop
    cultivation, and secondly, to alleviate the pressure on natural water resources
    [14,15]. Leveraging technologies like Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic
    Information Systems (GIS), in conjunction with computer modelling, remote sensing,
    and advanced information processing, enables the collection of comprehensive field
    data pertaining to spatial and temporal variations in crop production [16,17].
    Previous research has consistently shown that the adoption of precision irrigation
    technologies leads to elevated crop yields and enhances the efficiency of water,
    soil, nutrients, and other agricultural inputs [14]. For instance, a study implementing
    Variable Deficit Irrigation (VDI) in cotton production, integrating remote sensing,
    soil analyses, and crop growth modelling for irrigation management, reported a
    substantial increase of approximately 28.7 % in yield, accompanied by a 24.9 %
    reduction in water usage. This approach also demonstrated enhanced nitrogen and
    fertilizer productivity [18]. Similar positive outcomes have been observed in
    other studies related to cotton cultivation that utilized irrigation Decision
    Support Systems (DSS) [1,[19], [20], [21]] and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI)
    [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. These positive results extend to olive cultivation,
    where a study utilizing DSS-based irrigation management demonstrated its effectiveness
    as a sustainable and resource-efficient choice, resulting in a notable 42.1 %
    reduction in water and energy compared to conventional practices [28]. In another
    study focused on Scientific Irrigation Scheduling (SIS) in olive groves, soil
    moisture sensors coupled with a drip irrigation system resulted in water savings
    between 17 % and 25 %, along with yield enhancements of 8 % and 9 % [29]. Furthermore,
    studies have proven that employing remote monitoring and control systems [30,31],
    as well as a combination of remote and proximal sensing technologies, can improve
    water efficiency in olive cultivation [32]., Despite the evidence of the advantages
    of precision irrigation technologies, the adoption and widespread implementation
    of these technologies have been relatively slow, especially due to high initial
    investment costs and the lack of farmer skills required in the integration of
    the new technologies into current farming operations. Recent reviews of adoption
    studies in precision agriculture highlighted the lack of substantial research
    on the behavioural factors affecting farmer adoption of precision agriculture
    technologies [33,34]. Notably, the vast majority of studies has focused on farm
    and agro-ecological related factors, socio-demographics, and technology-related
    characteristics [35]. Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand the factors
    influencing its adoption, a key step toward more effective implementation [36].
    A plethora of theories and models have emerged to shed light on the factors that
    affect behaviour and adoption of technologies, with the most prominent being the
    Rogers'' Theory of Diffusion of Innovation, Davis et al.''s Technology Acceptance
    model and Ajzen''s Theory of Planned Behaviour. Rogers'' Theory of Diffusion of
    Innovation (1983) serves as a foundational framework, providing a systematic roadmap
    for adoption. Within this theoretical framework, Rogers identified five essential
    attributes that profoundly influence the adoption rates of innovations: relative
    advantage, measuring an innovation''s superiority; compatibility, assessing alignment
    with pre-existing values and needs; complexity, assessing the perceived ease of
    use; trialability, indicating the potential for experimentation and testing; and
    observability, highlighting the visibility of tangible benefits associated with
    the innovation. Innovations scoring higher on these attributes tend to be adopted
    more swiftly [37,38]. Simultaneously, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), introduced
    by Davis et al. (1989), directs our attention to two key factors: perceived usefulness,
    which reflects the degree to which individuals believe that a particular system
    will enhance their job performance, and perceived ease of use, related to the
    perception of how effortless it will be to utilize the system. Both these beliefs
    are significantly influenced by the design characteristics of the technology.
    TAM has undergone continuous evolution, with researchers introducing new variables
    and complicated relationships into the model. As a result, it has become a widely
    cited framework for comprehending technology acceptance [39,40]. Ajzen''s Theory
    of Planned Behaviour (TPB) (1991) serves as a central framework, explaining how
    individuals arrive at decisions regarding the adoption of technologies such as
    Precision Agriculture. It places significant emphasis on the role of attitudes
    and intentions in shaping final decisions. Intentions and actual behaviour are
    determined by two additional factors, namely, subjective norms (a person''s perceptions
    about the community''s attitude to certain behaviour) and perceived behavioural
    control (a person''s perception of ease or difficulty in carrying out a behaviour).
    These theories provide a promising theoretical framework to examine the behavioural
    factors that influence adoption of precision irrigation technologies [34,41].
    Extant research with respect to the behavioural factors that foster or hinder
    adoption of precision irrigation technologies is scarce. Some studies have concentrated
    on investigating a range of factors that influence the adoption of smart farming
    technologies [42], [43], [44]. Partalidou et al. [43] identified the primary barriers
    to adoption as a lack of knowledge, lack of guidance or support systems for the
    effective utilization of technology, and high initial investment costs. Kernecker
    et al. [42] focused on various technology-related factors and highlighted the
    importance of perceived usefulness, compatibility, ease of use, and perceived
    benefits in driving adoption of precision agriculture technologies. Systemic factors
    also play a role with financial support, legal framework, extension and advisory
    services, and the availability of informational sources playing a crucial role
    in bridging the gap between technology providers and end-users [42,44]. However,
    there is a lack of empirical studies specifically investigating the context of
    precision irrigation technologies and the associated determinants of farmers’
    adoption. This paper seeks to address this gap in the literature and aims to analyse
    the determinants of farmers’ adoption precision irrigation in olive and cotton
    farming in Greece by focusing on certain individual behavioural factors. 2. Theoretical
    model In this section, we present our theoretical framework for understanding
    the adoption of precision irrigation (Fig. 1). In this framework, we propose a
    series of hypothesis, labelled as H1, H2, and so forth, which guide our research.
    Each hypothesis addresses a particular research question, and we will explain
    each one further in the upcoming sections. Download : Download high-res image

    model for precision irrigation. 2.1. Perceived behavioural control In the context
    of socio-psychological factors, individuals'' intentions play a crucial role in
    predicting their actual engagement in specific behaviours. This principle holds
    true for farmers as well, where the belief that they possess the necessary skills
    and time required for technology adoption significantly influences their likelihood
    of adopting it [45]. Perceived behavioural control is a key factor of Ajzen''s
    Theory of Planned Behaviour and refers to an individual''s belief in their ability
    to perform a specific behaviour. This belief is shaped by their perception of
    various control factors that can either make the behaviour easier or more difficult
    to execute. These control factors encompass a range of aspects, such as one''s
    skills and abilities, the availability of time, money, and other resources, as
    well as the cooperation and support of others [46]. In the context of adopting
    new technologies, perceived behavioural control relates to farmers'' perceptions
    of the ease or difficulty associated with the adoption process. Previous studies
    found that farmers exhibited a higher willingness to embrace new agricultural
    techniques when they perceived that the learning requirements were manageable
    and substantial investments were not necessary [47], [48], [49], [50]. H1: Perceived
    behavioural control has positive correlation with adoption of precision irrigation
    technologies. 2.2. Environmental consciousness Another individual factor that
    may affect farmer adoption is environmental consciousness. The importance of examining
    environmental consciousness lies in its ability to predict subsequent environmental
    actions. Environmental attitudes, which are viewed as enduring beliefs shaping
    how individuals interact with the environment, are expected to guide individuals
    towards corresponding pro-environmental behaviours. Based on Schwartz''s theory,
    individuals are more likely to take action when they are aware of the positive
    consequences of their actions and feel a sense of responsibility for helping the
    environment [51]. Prior research has delved into the influence of environmental
    consciousness on the adoption of environmentally friendly agricultural practices,
    with findings indicating that cultivating a strong personal sense of responsibility
    for environmental issues, such as water pollution [52] along with maintaining
    a heightened awareness of environmental issues [53], acts as a substantial catalyst
    for embracing environmentally friendly agricultural practices. H2: Environmental
    consciousness has positive correlation with adoption of precision irrigation technologies.
    2.3. Perceived economic benefits Perceived economic benefits is expected to be
    a key influencing factor in the adoption of precision irrigation. Perceived economic
    benefits refer to the expected economic rewards that farmers anticipate reaping
    after investing in precision irrigation practices. These rewards may manifest
    as heightened productivity, increased profitability, and savings in labour. When
    farmers believe that adopting sustainable practices will bring them economic advantages,
    they are more inclined to embrace such practices [54]. Understanding the potential
    advantages of increased yields and cost savings increases confidence, thereby
    alleviating their uncertainties and fears associated with adopting agricultural
    technologies [55]. H3: Perceived economic benefits have positive correlation with
    adoption of precision irrigation technologies. 2.4. Perceived compatibility Perceived
    compatibility is a critical factor to investigate when examining the adoption
    of technology. This concept is closely tied to the widely recognized Technology
    Acceptance Model (TAM). Perceived compatibility, within the context of technology
    adoption, delves into the degree to which individuals perceive a new technology
    as aligning with their established values, past experiences, work routines, and
    personal preferences [56]. The influence of perceived compatibility on users is
    substantial. It significantly shapes their attitudes and intentions regarding
    the acceptance and utilization of technology. For example, a producer who is committed
    to traditional agricultural practices is unlikely to incorporate new technologies
    into their system because it is incompatible with the existing values and norms
    of its farming practices [34]. H4: Perceived compatibility has positive correlation
    with adoption of precision irrigation technologies. 2.5. Risk aversion Risk aversion
    has a substantial influence on the adoption of precision agricultural technologies,
    primarily due to the significant initial investment costs that heighten financial
    risk [57]. Risk aversion refers to the tendency to avoid risks and have low risk
    tolerance. Farmers are constantly faced with various risks which can be associated
    with productions risks (e.g., yield variability due to climate change or yield
    loss), policy risks (changes in legal framework, subsidies, etc.), market risks
    (e.g., changes in the prices of agricultural inputs, market demand) [58]. Studies
    have found that farmers who are unwilling to take risks tend to overestimate the
    costs associated with adopting a new technology and show lower intention to invest
    in sustainable agricultural practices [52,53]. H5: Risk aversion has negative
    correlation with adoption of precision irrigation technologies. 3. Materials and
    methods 3.1. Study area The research took place in two regions of Greece: Messenia
    with olive producers and Thessaly with cotton producers. Messenia is situated
    in the southwestern area of the Peloponnese Peninsula, with its regional capital
    being Kalamata. Messenia''s economic backbone centres on agriculture, particularly
    the cultivation of olive trees for olive oil and edible olives, establishing it
    as a major player in Europe''s olive oil industry. The predominant olive variety
    cultivated in this region is Kalamon. In 2016, agricultural land in the Messenia
    region comprised a significant 25 % (734.3 km2) of the total land area, with olive
    groves dominating, covering the 82 % (604.1 km2) of this agricultural expanse.
    Messenia experiences a temperate climate characterized by mild winters and hot
    summers. The mean annual temperature typically ranges from 13°C to 19°C. During
    winter, the lowlands and coastal regions maintain an average temperature between
    17°C and 21°C, thanks to warm and humid south winds. In Messenia, the annual precipitation
    averages between 800 and 1600 mm, varying with the region''s elevation. Winter
    in the area is marked by the passage of depressions forming over the Mediterranean
    Sea, while in summer, the region is influenced by heat waves from North Africa
    [59,60]. The second region, Thessaly, is located in central Greece. Thessaly is
    a major cotton-growing area cultivating approximately 100,000 ha of cotton on
    average, out of the 240,000 ha of the national cotton cultivation which constitutes
    80 % of the total European production [61,62]. The climate in the western and
    central regions of Thessaly is characterized by continental conditions, resulting
    in cold winters and hot summers with significant temperature fluctuations. Conversely,
    the coastal areas of Thessaly enjoy a more Mediterranean climate. During the summer
    months, Thessaly experiences hot and dry conditions, with July and August temperatures
    soaring to 40°C. On average, Thessaly receives approximately 700 mm of annual
    precipitation, but this varies significantly across the region. In the central
    plain, rainfall averages around 400 mm, while the western mountain peaks can receive
    over 1850 mm of rainfall. During the summer there is minimal rainfall [63]. 3.2.
    Survey design A survey was developed with the aim of examining the factors influencing
    the adoption of precision irrigation by olive growers in Messenia and cotton growers
    in Thessaly. The questionnaire initially asked participants about their knowledge
    with respect to precision irrigation technologies and subsequently provided a
    definition before eliciting participants’ responses about whether they have previously
    adopted such a technology. The questionnaire consisted of the following main sections:
    1) farmer demographics, 2) farm characteristics, 3) behavioural factors affecting
    adoption and 4) intention to adopt precision irrigation technologies. Independent
    variables included perceived behavioural control, environmental consciousness,
    perceived economic benefits, perceived compatibility, risk aversion while the
    dependent variable was the intention to adopt precision irrigation technologies.
    For each variable, respondents were required to indicate their level of agreement
    or disagreement with the corresponding statement using a 5-point Likert scale,
    where 1 signified \"strongly disagree\" and 5 represented \"strongly agree\".
    Scales were adopted from previous literature and adapted to the context of precision
    irrigation, where needed. Variables were measured using at least three item statements
    to ensure consistency and reliability of measurement. Positive- and negative-phrased
    statements were used, and negative statements were then recoded for statistical
    analysis. Finally, prior to the distribution of the questionnaire, it was piloted
    with 20 farmers from both Messenia and Thessaly and the wording was adjusted based
    on their feedback. Table 1 provides a list of items used to measure the study
    variables, along with their corresponding references and the Cronbach''s alpha
    values, which gauge the internal consistency of these items. As is evident from
    Table 1 in all cases Cronbach''s alpha exceeded 0.7, a minimum threshold indicating
    acceptable reliability. Table 1. Study variables, measurement items, references,
    and Cronbach''s alpha coefficients. Variables Items No. Sources Cronbach''s alpha

    Data collection Data collection lasted for three months in the period between
    July and September 2022. The questionnaire was administered face-to-face. The
    direct face-to-face interactions with the targeted producers allowed the research
    team to address any queries, provide additional context, and ensure a comprehensive
    understanding of the questionnaire. In collaboration with major farmer associations
    in Messenia and Thessaly, the snowballing technique was employed to facilitate
    farmer recruitment and data collection. A total number of 82 farmers was achieved,
    with 42 from Thessaly and 40 from Messenia, which has been regarded as representative
    due to the length of the questionnaire and its non-technical dimension of precision
    irrigation. 3.4. Data analysis The data collected were manually inputted into
    the Excel for further processing and analysis. The dataset was further imported
    to IBM SPSS Statistics 21 for the analysis. Initially, data were checked for missing
    values by examining frequencies to ensure there were no missing data. Subsequently,
    descriptive analysis was conducted to gain an understanding of the data properties,
    including standard deviation and mean for continuous variables, as well as frequency
    analysis for categorical variables. For variables measured on a Likert scale that
    consisted of three or more questions, a reliability analysis was performed using
    Cronbach''s alpha. As previously indicated, Cronbach''s alpha demonstrated reliability
    levels exceeding the acceptable threshold. Consequently, the questions were combined
    into a single variable which was calculated as the average of responses to each
    item statement. Afterwards, a correlation analysis was performed, specifically
    using Pearson''s correlation coefficient, to assess the degree and direction of
    relationships between various variables in our study. Subsequently, a multiple
    linear regression analysis was conducted in SPSS to examine the impact of independent
    variables on the dependent variable. Finally, the sample was divided into two
    groups: cotton farmers in Thessaly and olive farmers in Messenia. To assess differences
    between the two groups, independent samples t-tests were used for continuous variables,
    while Chi-square statistics were employed for comparisons of categorical variables.
    4. Results 4.1. Sociodemographic characteristics of producers and farm characteristics
    The total number of responses was 82. From the 82 surveyed farmers, 44 % indicated
    that they were familiar with precision irrigation technologies, whereas the remaining
    56 % reported not having knowledge of these technologies (Fig. 2). Furthermore,
    only 20 % of the respondents had previously employed precision irrigation technologies,
    while 80 % respondents had not yet incorporated them into their agricultural practices

    were observed in their knowledge of precision irrigation technologies (χ2(1) =
    0.410, p = 0.522 > 0.05) and their previous use of such technologies (χ2(1) =
    1.012, p = 0.314 > 0.05). Table 2 displays the sociodemographic characteristics
    of respondents. Most respondents in the study are males (90.2 %) aged between
    36 and 45 years old (24.4 %). A majority of them have completed high school education
    (42.7 %), while a significant number hold undergraduate degrees (40.2 %). More
    than half of farmers report annual incomes of 20,000 euros or lower (51.2 %).
    Income is primarily derived from agricultural activities, constituting more than
    75 % of their income sources (30.5 %). Additionally, farmers in the survey report
    having 1 to 10 years of farming experience (47.6 %) while a substantial portion
    of respondents indicate 11 to 20 years of farming experience (22.2 %). Lastly,
    the majority manages farms spanning from 8.1 to 18 ha in size (23.2 %) and 1.6
    to 3.5 ha (20.7 %). Table 2. Sociodemographic and farm characteristics (N = 82).

    the means and standard deviations of the study variables, each with a sample size
    (N) of 82. Participants exhibited a balanced perception of control over the use
    of precision irrigation technologies, a notably higher level of environmental
    consciousness, a relatively high level of positive views on the economic advantages
    associated with precision irrigation, a relatively high degree of compatibility
    between precision irrigation technologies and existing farming practices, a fair
    level of risk aversion, and a moderate level of intention to adopt. Table 3. Mean

    of precision irrigation in olive and cotton farming systems Pearson correlations
    have been conducted to examine associations between variables which are presented
    in Table 4. Intention to adopt variable is significantly and positively correlated
    with perceived economic benefits, environmental consciousness, perceived behavioural
    control, and compatibility, but not with risk aversion. Furthermore, most constructs
    of the model were significantly intercorrelated except for risk aversion which
    has weak and non-significant relationships with the other variables. To assess
    the potential issue of multicollinearity, we calculated Variance Inflation Factor
    (VIF) values for the independent variables. The analysis revealed that VIF values
    for most variables were close to 1, indicating that multicollinearity is not a
    substantial concern within the regression analysis (Table 4). Table 4. Pearson

    at p < 0.01. Multiple linear regression analysis was subsequently conducted to
    examine the effect of the five independent variables on the intention to adopt.
    Regarding model-fit statistics, the Adjusted R-squared value of 0.503 indicates
    that the independent variables collectively explain approximately 50.3 % of the
    variation observed in the dependent variable. Moreover, the F-statistic is 17.427,
    accompanied by a significance level (Sig. F) of 0.000, indicating high overall
    model significance. As can be seen in Table 5 among the five independent variables
    considered, four variables showed a significant relationship at a 5 % significance
    level while risk aversion was significant at the 10 % significance level. Remarkably,
    perceived behavioural control contributes positively with a coefficient of 0.263
    (p = 0.015 < 0.05), indicating that higher levels of perceived behavioural control
    are associated with increased probability of adoption precision irrigation technologies
    (H1). Environmental consciousness exhibits a strong positive relationship with
    a coefficient of 0.361 (p = 0.004 < 0.05), where individuals with higher levels
    of environmental consciousness are more likely to adopt precision irrigation (H2).
    Similarly, perceived economic benefits demonstrates a positive association with
    a coefficient of 0.393 (p = 0.007 < 0.05), indicating that heightened perceptions
    of economic benefits lead to higher intention to adopt (H3). Perceived compatibility
    also plays a role with a coefficient of 0.235 (p = 0.044 < 0.05), signifying that
    perceived compatibility contributes positively to adoption (H4). Lastly, risk
    aversion exhibits a negative effect on adoption, as indicated by its coefficient
    of −0.149 (p = 0.069 < 0.10) (H5). Hence, all the hypotheses were supported. However,
    it''s important to emphasize that this negative effect of risk aversion does not
    reach statistical significance at the conventional p-value threshold of 5 %. Instead,
    it falls just above this threshold, with a p-value of less than 7 %. Table 5.

    6, results in Messenia and Thessaly are presented. The means and standard deviations
    of each study variable for the two study groups, cotton farmers in Thessaly and
    olive farmers in Messenia, are presented, along with the results of the statistical
    test of significant differences between these two groups. On average, the intention
    to adopt was similar among cotton farmers in Thessaly and olive farmers in Messenia
    (t(80) = −0.920, p = 0.360 > 0.05). Similar results were found for perceived behavioural
    control (t(80) = −1.394, p = 0.167 > 0.05) and environmental consciousness (t(80)
    = 0.750, p = 0.455 > 0.05) where differences between olive and cotton farmers
    did not reach significance levels. However, a statistically significant stronger
    perception of the economic advantages associated with precision irrigation technologies
    was demonstrated by cotton farmers in Thessaly compared to olive farmers in Messenia
    (t(80) = −2.575, p = 0.012 < 0.05). In terms of perceived compatibility, no statistically
    significant differences were observed between the two groups (t(80) = 0.680, p
    = 0.499 > 0.05). Lastly, on average, cotton farmers in Thessaly exhibited a higher
    degree of risk aversion compared to olive farmers in Messenia. This difference
    was found to be statistically significant, but it''s worth noting that it falls
    just below the threshold of 10 % (t(80) = −1.888, p = 0.063 < 0.10). Table 6.

    (0.75) * 5. Discussion The adoption of precision irrigation technologies in agricultural
    practices is a multifaceted process influenced by a variety of factors. In this
    section, we discuss the results of our study, which aimed to find the intricate
    web of behavioural factors affecting the adoption of precision irrigation technologies
    among farmers in the regions of Messenia and Thessaly in Greece. We selected five
    key factors—perceived behavioural control, environmental consciousness, perceived
    economic benefits, perceived compatibility, risk aversion—to explore their impact
    on precision irrigation technology adoption. Behavioural factors have been systematically
    neglected in previous studies on the adoption of precision irrigation. These factors
    were chosen based on their theoretical relevance and empirical evidence from previous
    studies in the field of technology adoption. Findings from the questionnaire indicate
    that perceived behavioural control emerged as a robust predictor of farmers''
    propensity to embrace precision irrigation technologies. These findings align
    with the Theory of Planned Behaviour [69], which asserts that an individual''s
    perception of control over a specific behaviour substantially shapes their intentions
    and, consequently, their actual conduct. This underscores the idea that farmers’
    actions are profoundly affected by their self-assuredness in their capacity to
    execute a particular behaviour, with this perception playing a vital role in predicting
    and comprehending adoption of precision irrigation in their farming activities.
    The presence of facilitating conditions or situational constraints change farmers’
    perceptions with respect to the ease or difficulty of performing a given behaviour
    [70]. In essence, our study revealed that farmers who exhibited a stronger sense
    of control over the adoption of precision irrigation technologies were significantly
    more inclined to adopt them. This outcome harmonizes with previous research in
    the realm of agriculture [71,72], which emphasized the importance of perceived
    behavioural control in sustainable farming practices adoption. Regarding environmental
    consciousness our data revealed that individuals with higher levels of environmental
    consciousness were more inclined to embrace precision irrigation technologies.
    This inclination can be attributed to the profound sense of environmental responsibility
    that accompanies heightened awareness [65]. These farmers are probably more aware
    of the environmental challenges posed by traditional irrigation practices, climate
    change and recognize precision irrigation as a sustainable alternative. By significantly
    reducing water usage and minimizing the adverse environmental footprint of farming,
    precision irrigation aligns with their environmentally conscious values. This
    finding is in line with a growing body of literature [73,74] emphasizing the role
    of environmental considerations in influencing farmers'' adoption of environmentally
    friendly practices and technologies. This emphasizes the need for strategies that
    induce long-term changes in individual behaviour towards environmental issues
    [51]. Perceived economic benefits have proven to be a significant predictor for
    the adoption of precision irrigation technologies. Our study indicates that farmers
    are more inclined to transition from conventional irrigation practices when they
    perceive tangible economic advantages linked to precision irrigation, such as
    increased productivity and cost savings. This aligns with broader insights from
    the literature [43,75,76]. Farmers need to be confident that the long-term benefits
    outweigh the costs, helping to mitigate uncertainties and apprehensions associated
    with the adoption of agricultural technologies [35,77]. This effect may be more
    pronounced in the Greek context where the majority of agricultural holdings are
    characterized by their small size increasing the perceived risks associated with
    new practices. Perceived compatibility, in line with Technology Acceptance Model
    (TAM), stands out as a critical determinant in shaping farmers'' intentions to
    adopt precision irrigation technologies. Those farmers who perceive precision
    irrigation technologies as harmonious with their existing agricultural practices,
    farming operations and values exhibit a higher propensity for adoption [56]. This
    reflects the fundamental principle that people''s readiness to adopt an innovation
    depends on its alignment with their daily routines, goals, and values. Essentially,
    when farmers see precision irrigation technologies as a natural extension of their
    established routines, the perceived compatibility strongly influences their decision
    to adopt them [78]. These findings resonate with prior research [42,47,79,80]
    highlighting the critical role of perceived compatibility with current practices
    in shaping farmers’ technology adoption decisions. Furthermore, our study underscores
    the noteworthy, albeit marginally significant, impact of risk aversion on the
    adoption of precision irrigation technologies among farmers. This finding suggests
    that risk-averse farmers may be hesitant to adopt these technologies. This reluctance
    can be attributed to the inherent caution often exhibited by risk-averse individuals,
    who prioritize strategies geared toward minimizing financial risk in their agricultural
    operations. Precision irrigation systems necessitate an initial investment in
    specialized equipment and technology, which may be perceived as risky, especially
    when uncertainty covers technology performance and potential return on investment.
    Furthermore, risk-averse farmers may overestimate the probability of losses associated
    with new investments and may choose to maintain their current, familiar methods
    and technologies, avoiding risks associated with adopting new, unfamiliar technologies
    [81]. Hence, risk aversion can pose a significant barrier to adoption, even when
    precision irrigation holds the promise of long-term benefits. The finding that
    risk averse farmers are less likely to adopt precision irrigation technologies
    aligns with other studies [71,82]. In summary, our study underlines the important
    role of perceived behavioural control, environmental consciousness, perceived
    economic benefits, perceived compatibility, and risk aversion in the adoption
    of precision irrigation technologies. These findings highlight the significance
    of developing tailored educational and training programs aimed at farmers in these
    regions to build their capacities and increase their perceived behavioural control
    in integrating precision irrigation technologies into their olives and cotton
    farming activities. Furthermore, marketing campaigns and availability of information
    sources with respect to the impacts of climate change and the benefits of precision
    irrigation technologies could increase environmental awareness in the farming
    communities of these regions. CAP financial support schemes that support investment
    costs in new technologies as well as the development of both mandatory and voluntary
    schemes for the transition to more sustainable agricultural practices to tap the
    more risk averse/less environmentally conscious individuals versus more risk-seeking/more
    environmentally conscious ones are expected to foster adoption rates of precision
    irrigation technologies. The influence of risk aversion in adoption of new technologies
    underscores the pressing need for the development of innovative risk management
    tools specifically designed to mitigate uncertainty and alleviate concerns among
    risk-averse farmers. As precision irrigation continues to offer substantial advantages
    for both agriculture and the environment, our study emphasizes the importance
    of targeted interventions and support mechanisms to promote its adoption and foster
    more sustainable farming practices. While our study contributes valuable insights
    into the behavioural factors influencing the adoption of precision irrigation
    technologies, it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations that may impact
    the generalizability of our findings. One notable limitation is the potential
    bias introduced by selecting farmers through collaboration with major farmer associations,
    as these affiliated farmers may hold different attitudes and practices compared
    to their non-affiliated counterparts. Moreover, the relatively small sample size
    further emphasizes the need for caution in generalizing our results. To enhance
    the robustness of future research in this area, we recommend incorporating larger
    sample sizes. Additionally, gaining insights from farmers representative of the
    general farmer population and extending the geographical scope of the study would
    contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of precision irrigation adoption
    in the Greek agricultural context. 6. Conclusions In conclusion, this study explored
    the determinants of precision irrigation technology adoption among farmers in
    the Messenia and Thessaly regions of Greece focusing on olive and cotton growers
    respectively. Our study emphasizes the critical influence of environmental consciousness
    on farmers’ intention to adopt precision irrigation technologies. Additionally,
    perceived economic benefits, perceived behavioural control, and perceived compatibility
    play significant roles in driving this intention. While risk aversion has a smaller
    impact, it remains a noteworthy factor in our analysis. This study builds upon
    the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Technology Acceptance Model to investigate
    the impact of various behavioural factors in the adoption of precision irrigation
    technologies in Greece. The research addresses the significant gaps in the literature
    which has focused mainly on farm and agro-ecological related factors, socio-demographics,
    and technology-related characteristics, thus, neglecting the importance of farmer
    individual characteristics and behavioural factors. Findings from this study have
    important implications for strategy implementation and policy design. Future research
    may delve further into additional variables, providing a more comprehensive understanding
    of the intricate adoption process within precision agriculture in Greece and other
    European countries. Systemic factors, such as norms, information sources, extension
    and advisory services, legal framework, financial support are expected to significantly
    influence farmer adoption of precision irrigation technologies. Furthermore, additional
    methodologies could be employed to add more evidence on the farm decision making
    processes with respect to adoption of precision irrigation. Interviews could provide
    a more in-depth exploration of the process while experimental designs could establish
    causal relationships between behavioural factors and the intention to adopt. Informed

    03 September 2021 1 Introduction Organic agriculture, a highly dynamic field that
    has experienced rapid growth worldwide over the past decades, has been inspiring
    and shaping the transition to sustainable and resilient food systems (Willer et
    al. 2021). In the period 1999 to 2019, world organic agricultural land increased
    more than 6.5 times (up to 72.3 million hectares), covering 1.5% of the total
    world agricultural area, and involving 3.1 million farmers (in 1999, there were
    only 200 thousand). Currently, the organic market is worth 106.4 billion euros
    (more than + 700% with respect to the 2000 year) in 187 countries, with a per
    capita consumption equal to 14.0 euros (Willer et al. 2021). Europe is the second
    region in the world for the organic agricultural area (23%, after Oceania) and
    market (39%, preceded by the USA), with a positive outlook for both indicators,
    mainly due to the ever-growing private demand and the incentives offered from
    public agricultural policies. Farm to Fork Strategy considers organic farming
    system expansion a key milestone to achieve sustainability long-term objectives
    for the European agri-food sector. To reach this goal, it is necessary to achieve
    the target that at least 25% of the EU’s agricultural land will be organically
    farmed in 10 years (by 2030, 9.1% in 2020) (Wesseler 2022). However, several considerations
    on the sustainability of organic farming activities need to be investigated further,
    exploring in a comprehensive manner the environmental role of organic farming
    systems. Organic farming is often proposed as a possible solution to reduce the
    environmental impacts of agriculture, but scientific evidence is sometimes underexplored
    or ambiguous as in the case of the environmental effects of production system
    intensification (Notarnicola et al. 2017). In fact, the environmental performance
    of the same products in organic versus conventional agriculture are actually compared
    in various life cycle assessment (LCA) studies and, in general, the organic systems
    produced better results only when the environmental impacts were evaluated on
    a per area and year basis. Therefore, more research is required to determine the
    strengths and weaknesses of different farming systems with regard to production
    and environmental effects within the range of ecosystems’ carrying capacity (Meier
    et al. 2015). In this sense, the wine sector and, in particular, the organic farming
    system, which is devoted to the production of niche high-quality wines, represents
    an interesting field to be investigated. Marketing strategies in the European
    market have been revised over time to account for the continued surplus of the
    production sector. For these reasons, important factors such as production quality
    and changes in consumer demand were also taken into account in relation to new
    lifestyles. In this view, converting production from conventional to organic is
    a winning strategy in terms of market and income. The success and increase in
    the consumption of organic products are related to the consumer interest in issues
    linked to health, well-being, and environmental sustainability (Varia et al. 2021).
    As stated by Schäufele and Hamm (2017), “producing and marketing wine with sustainability
    characteristics is a promising strategy for quality differentiation, particularly
    for wine that is both local and organic. Moreover, marketers, retailers and producers
    will likely profit from developing information campaigns with a focus on environmental,
    as well as social and economic aspects to increase consumers’ knowledge of sustainable
    wine production, thus creating preferences and influencing purchase behaviour.”
    In response to this, the increase in organic productions has been accompanied
    by a strong trend towards organic vine certification. In the period 2005–2019,
    the surface area of certified organic vineyards increased by an average of 13%
    per year, accounting for 6.2% of the world vineyard surface area. Certified organic
    vineyards are highly concentrated in Europe (in 2019 accounting for 84% of the
    total surface area of certified organic vineyards globally), also under the impulse
    of the Common Agricultural Policy, which has contributed to the expansion of Europe’s
    organic surface areas (OIV 2021). Italy, with 24% of the total world surface area
    under organic vines in 2019, ranks third behind Spain, 27%, and France, 25%, devoting
    15% of its vineyards to organic viticulture (OIV 2021). The organic wine production
    chain stands out for the large number of wine-growing farms (about 18,200), with
    a relatively small average vineyard size (about 6 ha), and adequate winemaking
    facilities (SINAB 2021). These structural features of the winemaking farms are
    even more pronounced if we consider the whole Italian sector (average farm size
    around 2.3 ha), which is also characterized by a pronounced diversification of
    grape and wine production systems. Therefore, the marked diversification of the
    Italian wine supply is strongly correlated with the local characteristics (terroir),
    such as the wide use of traditional or native varieties (Pomarici et al. 2021).
    The sustainability of the wine sector is a well-studied issue, but little research
    has been carried out on the environmental performance of small businesses and
    their contextual factors (Duarte Alonso and Bressan 2013). Although small wine
    producers have developed new labels for good quality wine and environmental performance
    plays a very important role in the wine business (Tait et al. 2019), there is
    insufficient information on the sustainability of small organic wineries (Harb
    et al. 2021). As is often the case in organic vineyards, various management practices
    are implemented over a number of years in order to maximize biodiversity, resource
    availability, and vine productivity while minimizing phytopathogens and diseases
    (Provost and Pedneault 2016). For example, soil organic enrichment, weed control
    with green manure, or soil structure improvement with calcium-enriched fertilizers
    are some of the practices that are used to manage the vineyard as a balanced ecosystem
    and to develop wines that are clearly different from conventional ones. Therefore,
    it is important to assess the environmental profile, to identify and prioritize
    environmental hotspots and their variability, and to understand the interannual
    variations of impacts and their causes, for developing more sustainable organic
    viticulture and winery systems (Renaud-Gentié et al. 2020). In this study, the
    environmental performance of a local organic red wine produced in Italy by a small
    family farm was assessed using an LCA approach over a 4-year production period.
    The general scope of the work was to investigate the environmental role of a small
    organic farm, whose innovation opportunities are constrained by both technical
    and economic factors (such as the high costs of innovative technologies and of
    highly qualified technical assistance, the inability to achieve economies of scale).
    The main goal of the study was to analyze the main drivers that determine the
    impact of wine and its interannual variability, with a focus on the effects of
    both meteorological conditions and farmer management choices. 2 Material and methods
    2.1 Case study description The study was conducted at La Casa di Sophia, a small
    family–owned wine farm, managed in organic regime. La Casa di Sophia (Fig. 1)
    is located in the municipality of Calasetta on the small island of Sant’Antioco
    (39° 04′10.77″N and 8° 21′32.50″ E, altitude 19 m a.s.l.), South-West Sardinia,
    Italy. Farm fields are located a few hundred meters from the sea, on mostly sandy
    soil and set in a typical landscape dominated by a mosaic of little vineyards
    cultivated with traditional methods. The vineyard has a total extension of 0.53
    ha, planted in 1970 starting from propagation material obtained from local farms,
    and since 2011 grown organically in accordance with to EEC Regulation 2092/91.
    A small olive grove of 1.59 hectares, belonging to the same wine farm, borders
    the vineyard. The vineyard is completely covered by Carignano vines, a traditional
    red grape variety of Sardinia genetically similar to the Spanish grape varieties
    Cariñena and Mazuela (Mercenaro et al. 2014). Carignano is a vigorous variety
    with abundant and constant production, poorly resistant to cryptogams, in particular
    to powdery mildew. On the other hand, it has a good resistance to salty winds
    and spring colds, so it is suitable for coastal environments. The variety Carignano
    is widespread in southwestern Sardinia, in particular in the Sulcis region, which
    is characterized by sandy and non-irrigated soils, which represents 70% of the
    total cultivated area, with about 2000 hectares (7% of the total covered area
    in Sardinia). Despite its limited distribution, Carignano is considered one of
    the most interesting and prestigious grape varieties in the Sardinian wine industry
    (Casu et al. 2013). Fig. 1 Geographical location of La Casa di Sophia wine farm
    and view of the vineyard Full size image In the studied winery, coherently with
    the traditional local practices, Carignano is cultivated on a free foot, with
    a sapling vine training method, not irrigated, and a density of 5680 plants/ha.
    This is related to the fact that many of the vineyards on the island of Sant’Antioco
    were planted before the invasion of grape phylloxera more than 300 years ago.
    In this area, the sandy soils prevent the movement of these insects making them
    harmless, so the vines can still be “free of foot”. The vineyard duration was
    calculated by dividing the total number of plants by the number of annual failures.
    Therefore, it has been presumed that all the plants in the vineyard have been
    replaced every 35 years. The farm does not own any agricultural machinery and
    equipment; all agricultural labor is performed by independent contractors. As
    prescribed by the organic regulations, no synthetic chemistry products are used
    for phytosanitary treatment or soil fertilization. Even if no data are available
    to express the representativeness of this vineyard, as far as we know, the case
    study can be considered a typical situation of organic viticulture in Sardinia.
    The cellar, approximately 120 m2, is located a few tens of meters from the vineyard
    and close to the farmhouse, and it is equipped with the necessary furniture and
    technical equipment (mainly made of stainless steel and HDPE). In order to maintain
    a constant temperature of 20 °C in the cellar during the wine production period,
    two 1.75 kW air conditioners were installed. Since August 2017, the air-conditioned
    area has been doubled, and an additional room was dedicated to wine recovery.
    Electricity is supplied from the public grid and from photovoltaic panels (3 kW
    of power) installed on the cellar roof. Selected yeasts and wine-clarifying additives
    are not used for winemaking. Four different winemaking years were considered:
    2015–2016, 2016–2017, 2018–2019, and 2019–2020. Specifically, we considered for
    the “vineyard” phase the period from the first year’s harvest to the following
    year’s harvest; for the “cellar” phase, the period from the harvest of the second
    year to the bottling of wine. In 2016–2017 and 2018–2019, a portion of all processed
    grapes (45% and 25%, respectively) (Table 1) was purchased from a nearby farm
    conducted with organic methods. Therefore, we assumed that this purchased grape
    was produced under the same environmental and technical conditions as the La Casa
    di Sophia vineyard. Different vineyard organic management techniques were implemented
    during the study period (Table 1). In 2016–2017, a mix of annual forage legumes
    was sown manually in the vineyard inter-rows and then incorporated in the soil
    at alternate rows during the pre-flowering stage; in 2018–2019, (i) the same green
    manure with legume mixture of the previous year was applied, (ii) 275 kg of a
    calcium-enriched biofertilizer was applied with a tractor (spread manually) for
    soil conditioning and fertilization, and (iii) 15 kg of kaolinite was distributed
    with a field spreader to prevent water and heat stress of the vine; in 2019–2020,
    the calcium-enriched biofertilizer was again applied in much smaller quantity
    (48 kg in total) than the previous year. Minimum tillage for soil management,
    application of solid cattle manure for soil fertilization, and both copper (Cu)-,
    sulfur (S)- and Bacillus thuringiensis–based pesticides were applied at different
    input levels in all years under study (Tables 1 and 3). Table 1 Main management
    and production characteristics of La Casa di Sophia wine farm for each winemaking
    year Full size table 2.2 Meteorological and phytosanitary conditions South-West
    Sardinia has a Mediterranean climate with mild winters, hot and dry summers, and
    significant rainfalls from October to May (average total annual rainfall is less
    than 600 mm). Climatic data for the 30-year reference period from 1991 to 2020
    were obtained from the weather station located at Decimomannu (39° 17′55.80″ N
    8° 58′14.07″ E), 56 km north-east of Calasetta (at a similar altitude but 12 km
    away from the sea), because the data from the nearest weather station at Sant’Antioco
    cover a shorter period (1981–2010). However, similarities between climatic values
    at the two weather stations were verified using statistical indices (Online Resource
    1). The meteorological conditions of the grapevine production years were characterized
    using monthly values of rainfall and minimum and maximum temperatures. In all
    cases, the annual mean and maximum air temperatures were slightly higher compared
    to climatic values. The annual average temperatures in 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020
    were 17.6, 17.4, 17.6, and 17.4 °C, respectively, equal or 0.2 °C above the climatic
    average. In 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020, the annual maximum temperatures were 24.2,
    24.4, 23.5, and 23.8 °C, respectively, indicating temperature anomalies ranging
    between + 0.3 (2019) and + 1.2 °C (2017). On the contrary, the total annual rainfall
    was well below the average climatic value (526 mm) for all years of production,
    ranging from − 15% in 2019 to − 68% in 2020. Focusing on the meteorological conditions
    observed during the grapevine vegetative season (from April to September) (Fig.
    2), air temperature values were very similar, and no major differences were observed
    during the season, but the monthly rainfall volumes and distribution were quite
    different. Notably, more than 75% of the total seasonal precipitation (100 mm)
    fell in May and September in 2016; in 2017, 72% of the total seasonal rainfall
    (equal to 43 mm) fell in April and September; in 2019, more than 80% of the total
    seasonal rainfall (equal to 154 mm) fell in April and May; in 2020, that was the
    second year (with 118 mm) for total cumulative precipitations during the vegetative
    period, rainfalls were evenly distributed across the months. Fig. 2 Average monthly
    temperature (a) and rainfall totals (b) observed for the grape vegetative season
    during the four production years Full size image Regarding relevant plant diseases,
    in 2016–2017, as reported by the farmer, the combination of contrasting meteorological
    conditions and phytopathogen attacks led to pronounced irregular ripening of grapes,
    and a large part of them did not reach full ripeness. Furthermore, in 2019–2020,
    a fungal disease, not controlled in time for operational limits during the COVID-19
    pandemic, affected the regular grape growth and ripening, which finally resulted
    in very small and shrivelled grapes. 2.3 Life cycle assessment methodology In
    line with the “Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR) for still
    and sparkling wine” (CEEV 2020), and according to the scientific LCA literature
    (Ferrara and De Feo 2018), a 0.75-L glass bottle of wine after packaging completed
    was set as main functional unit. In addition, to better explore the main impact
    drivers of the vineyard stage, the analysis was secondarily referred to 1 kg of
    grape. The system boundaries followed a “from cradle to farm gate” approach, including
    all the raw material acquisition and pre-processing to the bottling phase, until
    the wine bottles are ready to be distributed for retail. The following stages
    were included (Fig. 3): cultivation, which comprises all processes of vineyard,
    such as land occupation and vine planting, vine growing before production, grape
    production, including fertilizer and pesticide treatments, and use of agricultural
    machinery; winemaking, which includes equipment and operations to process grapes
    and must; bottling and packaging, which includes production and waste treatment
    of materials to be used in the cellar for packaging the final product (bottles
    of 0.75 L). According to the PEFCR, the system boundaries did not include (i)
    co-products from the grape cultivation process, such as pruned branches and others,
    (ii) co-products of winemaking process (lees, pomace, and/or others), and (iii)
    capital assets and infrastructures (warehouses, buildings). In our case study,
    co-product residues (wood and shoots) generated during the viticulture phase were
    left in the vineyards and incorporated back into the soil or recycled on the farm
    for composting. In addition, due to the lack of reliable data, the vine nursery
    processes (reproduction and cultivation of the vines, before planting in the open
    field) and the wine distribution, use, and end-of-life stages were not considered.
    In particular, the nursery phase, which is frequently difficult to trace, is usually
    excluded from the system boundaries (Vázquez-Rowe et al. 2012; Villanueva-Rey
    et al. 2014). No generic data that comes from external data sources were used
    to build the life cycle inventory (LCI) of the study. Primary data about the foreground
    system were directly collected from the wine producer: data on inputs and outputs
    were gathered by using questionnaires and face-to-face interviews and retrieved
    by the analysis of farm registers. All background inventory data (e.g. production
    of fertilizers, pesticides, energy) were obtained from the Ecoinvent Center v
    3.8 LCA database (https://ecoinvent.org). The collected data were subjected to
    a quality control procedure by cross-checking various sources of information,
    including specific scientific literature, and performing mass balances to verify
    the consistency of the input and output streams. After validation, the data were
    aggregated in the LCA model developed with the SimaPro© Analyst software version
    9.3 (https://simapro.com). Emissions related to the use of pesticides and fertilizers
    were evaluated using the following methods: (i) The equations reported in Ecoinvent
    report no.15 (Nemecek and Kägi 2007) for NH3 and NOx emissions to the atmosphere
    Release of heavy metals and P into the water Release of heavy metals to soil (ii)
    IPCC Tier 1 approach (IPCC 2019) for both N2O direct and indirect emissions to
    the atmosphere (iii) EPIC model (Williams 1995) as applied in Demurtas et al.
    (2016) for NO3− emissions to water Fig. 3 Diagram flow of the life cycle of Carignano
    del Sulcis wine. System boundaries are indicated by a red dashed line Full size
    image Additional data are given in Table 10 of Online Resources 3. Power use by
    the electricity grid was measured as the sum of monthly consumption according
    to the amount reported in the supplier invoices, excluding the percentage consumption
    for domestic use (estimation based on data of the Italian Regulatory Authority
    for Energy, Networks and the Environment—https://www.arera.it); the power by photovoltaic
    panels was calculated from exchange and inverter counters data. Electricity data
    were based on the Ecoinvent process “Electricity, medium voltage {IT}| electricity
    voltage transformation from high to medium|Cut-off, U” adjusted to the energy
    mix declared by the energy supplier companies of each reporting year. In particular:
    (i) firstly, the “Electricity, high voltage {IT}| market for | Cut-off, U” Ecoinvent
    dataset was modified including as inputs from technosphere the specific high voltage
    electricity production mix declared by each operator on the website. Renewable
    energy mix and hydro-electrical mix were selected according to the annual average
    mix declared by Terna, the Italian operator for the national transmission grid
    for high and extra-high voltage electricity. Air emissions were not modified;
    (ii) then, a new dataset was created from the previous one (in order to move from
    high to medium voltage), using the unit process “Electricity, medium voltage {IT}|
    electricity voltage transformation from high to medium voltage | Cut-off, U” and
    applying a transformation ratio equal to 1.0055 kWh. Water consumption was estimated—real
    data were not available due to the lack of a water meter—by comparing the values
    indicated by the farmer with the expected consumption reported in the literature
    for the Italian vineyards registered in the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS)
    (ISPRA 2016), which focuses on water use for irrigation and nutrient distribution.
    Fuel consumption was estimated by adding the consumption of all vineyard operations
    (the actual number of hours each machine was used multiplied by the average consumption
    per hour). Emissions related to the production of machinery and equipment were
    calculated using the Ecoinvent datasets considering the mass of each machinery
    and equipment (data from the web or from technical sheets). The relative impact
    was related to the effective life of each asset. The impact of gas refrigerant
    from the refrigerators used during winemaking was assumed negligible because no
    gas losses occurred over the last 20 years. The impact of all transportation (final
    and intermediate) was calculated considering the type, distance, and transported
    mass. Primary data were used for distances when available; otherwise, logistics
    and distances have been calculated using the SEARATE web application (https://www.searates.com).
    For calculation of the impacts of a glass bottle and cardboard box used for the
    secondary packaging of the bottle, Ecoinvent “Packaging glass, brown (CH) production”
    and “Corrugated board box (RER) production” datasets were used, respectively.
    Since Ecoinvent does not have specific datasets, the LCA of the cork stopper was
    modelled based on the study “Ecobalance of cork products” (Ecobilancio Italia
    2010). The weight of the bottle (0.36 kg each; annual totals in kg equal to 984,
    816, 821, and 374, for 2015–2016, 2016–2017, 2018–2019, 2019–2020 production years,
    respectively), cardboard box (0.32 kg each; annual totals in kg equal to 146,
    121, 122, and 56 for 2015–2016, 2016–2017, 2018–2019, 2019–2020 production years,
    respectively) and cork stopper (4.0 g each; annual totals in kg equal to 11, 9,
    9, and 4 for 2015–2016, 2016–2017, 2018–2019, 2019–2020 production years, respectively)
    were measured on site. LCA calculations were performed using the Environmental
    Footprint (EF) version 3.0 (adapted) (Fazio et al. 2018) impact assessment method.
    In order to identify the main categories of environmental impacts affecting the
    life cycle performance of both wine and grape in all years of production, the
    LCA results were normalized, weighted, and then ranked by decreasing percentage
    contribution to the overall score. Only the impact categories that accounted for
    at least 80% of the single score for all production years were selected. LCI and
    LCA results were analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation,
    coefficient of variation, standard error, and correlation matrix). Finally, we
    performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the LCA results
    following the approach adopted by Meneses et al. (2016) and considering the effects
    of changing the concentration of (i) active principles of pesticides and (ii)
    N and P2O5 contents on the cattle solid manure. 3 Results Large variations in
    the main LCI parameters occurred between the studied years (Table 2 and 3). Power
    use per bottle of wine varied according to wine production and showed a high coefficient
    of variation (CV) value, equal to 73% (Table 2). The 2016–2017 and 2019–2020 production
    years had the lowest grape yields, consistent with the unfavorable agro-meteorological
    conditions of these years (Sect. 2.2). On the other hand, higher values of grape
    yields were obtained in the 2015–2016 production season, followed by the 2018–2019
    grape yield. In particular, in 2018–2019, the yield was in line with the average
    vineyard productivity calculated since 2011 (the first year of the organic certification),
    and equal to approximately 3000 kg of grapes ha−1, as reported by the farm registers.
    More in general, the above-reported grape yields are in accordance with the trend
    of the Sardinian grape production, which showed a production peak in the 2016
    harvest, a drop in 2017, and more regular results in 2019 and 2020, with a slight
    advantage for 2019 harvest (ISTAT 2022). Table 2 Main life cycle inventory data
    for each winemaking year. Mean and coefficient of variation (CV) values are also
    reported Full size table Table 3 Calculated direct emissions to air associated
    with the use of pesticides and fertilizers for each winemaking year, with mean
    and coefficient of variation (CV) values Full size table The most relevant variations
    were reported for fertilizer and pesticide use: for example, in 2016–2017, nitrogen
    and sulfur applications were 0.2 and 2.3 times larger, respectively, than in 2018–2019
    (similar differences were observed for phosphorus pentoxide and copper use) (Table
    2). These variations were reflected in the calculated direct emissions associated
    with the use of pesticides and fertilizers (Table 3). Climate change (CC), with
    an average contribution to the EF single score equal to 19%, was the main impact
    category for all production years, followed by fossils resource use (RU-F), minerals
    and metals resource use (RU-M&M), acidification (AC), particulate matter (PM),
    terrestrial eutrophication (TE), photochemical ozone formation (POF), ecotoxicity
    freshwater (ECOTOX), and marine eutrophication (ME), with different orders of
    magnitude for each production year (Table 4). The environmental performance of
    a 0.75-L bottle of La Casa di Sophia Carignano wine varied largely within the
    4-year production period (Table 4). The coefficient of variation (CV) values for
    each impact category, and for the 4 production years, ranged from a minimum of
    21%, calculated for ECOTOX, to a maximum of 79%, calculated for PM. Both marine
    and terrestrial eutrophication scores exhibited relevant variations, with a CV
    of 47% and 66%, respectively (Table 4). As expected, 2015–2016 showed the lowest
    values for all relevant impact categories (Table 4 and Fig. 4), considering that
    this production year gave the highest grape yield and wine volumes. In particular,
    with the exception of ECOTOX and RU-M&M, the impacts of 2015–2016 wine were more
    than 50% lower than the corresponding worst-performing production years, namely
    (i) 2019–2020 for CC, POF, AC, and RU-F, (ii) 2018–2019 for PM, ME, and TE, and
    (iii) 2016–2017 for RU-M&M (Fig. 4). Table 4 Environmental performance, reported
    as characterized results, for the main impact categories (in brackets, the impact
    category weight) of 0.75-L glass bottle of Carignano del Sulcis wine for each
    of the four production years, with mean, coefficient of variation (CV), and standard
    error (SE) values Full size table Fig. 4 Comparison of the environmental performance
    (main relevant impact categories) of a 0.75-L glass bottle of Carignano del Sulcis
    produced at La Casa di Sophia wine farm in four different years. For each impact
    category, the results are expressed as a percentage of the maximum value observed
    during the 4-year study period Full size image Grape yield was negatively correlated
    with ECOTOX and RU-M&M, and wine yield was negatively correlated with CC and RU-F
    (Table 5). The highest significant correlations between environmental performance
    and input/output production levels measured in absolute terms, were found for
    diesel, power, and fertilizer consumption (Table 5). It is important to note that
    the high and positive correlation values between PM, ME, TE, and nitrogen and
    phosphorus fertilization are consistent with the highest CV values obtained between
    the different production years for the same impact categories (Table 4), and with
    the highest CV values for nitrogen and phosphorus pentoxide application doses
    (Table 2). Furthermore, 2018–2019 was the first production year for fertilizer
    use (67 vs. 33 kg N ha−1 and 21 vs. 9 kg P2O5 ha−1 on average over the 4 production
    years considered) and the second highest for power consumption and also showed
    the worst environmental performance in the above impact categories. This indicates
    that (i) both power and fertilizer use strongly affected the environmental performance
    of 0.75-L bottle of wine and (ii) fertilizer use in 2018–2019 greatly contributed
    to reducing the average environmental performance of the 4 production years despite
    its positive impact on grape yield and wine production. On the other hand, although
    the 2016–2017 season had the worst grape yield and the highest pesticide use (Table
    2), it had the highest wine production and resulted the main impacting production
    year only for ECOTOX and RU-M&M impact categories (Fig. 4). Table 5 Correlation
    matrix (n = 4) between independent (wine farm LCI data) and dependent (environmental
    performance for the main relevant impact category) variables for the four winemaking
    years considered in the LCA study. Fertilizer application is expressed as nitrogen
    (N) and phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), pesticide treatments as copper (Cu) and sulfur
    (S) Full size table Considering the average percentage contribution of the three
    main stages of the wine life cycle for the 4 production years, Grape production
    represented more than half of the total wine impact, with the exception of CC,
    RU-F, and RU-M&M impact categories, where its contribution was similar to the
    other stages and equal to 38% (most impacting stage), 33% (the second impacting
    stage, after bottling and packaging with 36%), and 40% (again the main stage,
    followed by winemaking with 39%), respectively (Fig. 5). Winemaking was by far
    the less impactful stage, with the exception of RU-M&M, where it was a significant
    hotspot: the most impactful for 2019–2020, 2018–2019, and 2015–2016 production
    years, and the second most influential when the average impact value for the 4
    production years was considered. The main processes contributing to the high relevance
    of the winemaking phase for the RU-M&M impact category were (i) production of
    cellar equipment (39%, 28%, and 28% for 2019–2020, 2018–2019, and 2015–2016, respectively)
    and (ii) power consumption (16%, 14%, and 8% for 2019–2020, 2018–2019, and 2015–2016,
    respectively). In the 2016–2017 production year, a relatively higher use of copper-
    and sulfur-based pesticides made grape production the more impacting stage for
    RU-M&M (Fig. 5). More generally, the differences between the results of the contribution
    analysis for each production year reflect the production year differences highlighted
    earlier in the inventory and impact assessment steps, to which they are obviously
    correlated. The highest deviations were found in bottling and packaging for ME,
    TE, and PM, with CV values equal to 59%, 70%, and 72%, respectively, and in winemaking
    for ECOTOX with a CV value equal to 59% (Online Resource 2). Fig. 5 Percentage
    contribution of three major wine life cycle stages (grape production, winemaking,
    bottling and packaging) to the main relevant impact categories in each year (including
    the 4-year mean value) Full size image Focusing on the average environmental performance
    of grape production, calculated for 1 kg of grapes, the contribution analysis
    showed that soil conditioning and fertilization represented the main impacting
    process for all impact categories (more than 50% of contribution), with the exception
    of RU-M&M and ECOTOX, where pesticide treatments were by far the main impact source
    (86% and 77% of the contribution, respectively) (Fig. 6). Vine planting and agricultural
    machinery production showed the smallest contribution (always less than 10%),
    while diesel use for soil management exceeded 10% of the contribution only for
    CC, RU-F, TE, and POF impact categories. Also in this case, large variations in
    contribution analysis results for each production year were observed, with extremely
    high CV values (more than 60%) for (i) soil conditioning and fertilization for
    ECOTOX, PM, RU-M&M, (ii) diesel use for soil management for TE, ME, and PM, (iii)
    pesticide treatments for TE, ME, and PM, (iv) agricultural machineries production
    for ECOTOX and PM. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the results of the
    study were not significantly affected by the different concentrations of active
    principles of pesticides, and N and P2O5 contents on the cattle solid manure (for
    details, see Online Resource 3, Table 11–15). Fig. 6 Percentage contribution of
    viticulture practices to the main relevant impact category for each year studied
    (including the 4-year mean value) Full size image 4 Discussion It was very difficult
    to compare the environmental performance of the analyzed wine with other cases
    described in the scientific literature due to the specific environmental and technological
    conditions that characterized the wine farm under study, as well as the substantial
    difference in the methodological approach. In addition, the purpose of the study,
    as stated in the Introduction section, does not include comparative objectives.
    Consequently, few international literature studies were cited to discuss our findings.
    The environmental performance of a 0.75-L bottle of organic Carignano wine, calculated
    over 4 years of production, showed relevant interannual variability mainly due
    to farm management decisions. No evident variations in agrometeorological conditions
    were observed during the study period and they did not seem to significantly affect
    the variations in environmental impact categories. The value of the wine production
    obtained in 2019–2020 (29% lower than the average of the previous three production
    seasons) was mainly determined by farmer’s decisions, showing a clear influence
    of the farm management approach on the variation of environmental impacts. These
    remarks were consistent with Renaud-Gentié et al. (2020) findings from their study
    about the variability and drivers of the environmental impacts of an organic vineyard
    in France over 6 consecutive years. However, in our case study, it must be taken
    into account that the limited experience in organic management, together with
    the recent conversion to this regime, certainly influenced the technical solutions
    and thus the LCA results. As is common in small family farms, the management strategy
    of La Casa di Sophia has proved inconsistent over time and not supported by instrumental
    analysis as advised for efficient farm management. For instance, if the observed
    differences in phytosanitary treatments (CV values 56% and 71% for copper- and
    sulfur-based pesticides, respectively) should be explained by specific meteorological
    conditions that influenced diseases’ progress (particularly severe in 2016–2017),
    the high variation in nitrogen (CV equal to 76%) and phosphorus pentoxide (CV
    equal to 85%) doses revealed an insufficiently robust approach in the soil management
    strategy (Table 2). As reported in Sect. 3, these differences resulted in high
    CV values for PM, ME, and TE impact categories, whose correlation matrix showed
    a strong association with nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization. Soil conditioning
    and fertilization impact—mainly driven by the direct emissions to air, water,
    and soil of inorganic nitrogen compounds, phosphorus, and heavy metals, respectively—represented
    an environmental hotspot in coherence with international LCA literature on winery
    sector (Ferrara and De Feo 2018). However, there is large room for improvement
    with a more accurate soil management approach. For example, soil analysis would
    allow La Casa di Sophia farm to develop an efficient conditioning and fertilization
    plan based on bioproducts and techniques chosen according to the vineyard’s specific
    needs and meteorological conditions. This would lead to substantial savings in
    emissions, making full use of the agronomic and environmental benefits of organic
    fertilizer application and green manure adoption (Mercenaro et al. 2014; Muscas
    et al. 2016; Volanti et al. 2022). Despite the fact that the limitation of copper
    contamination in soil represents a crucial target for global organic (as well
    as conventional) viticulture and several solutions have been proposed, copper-based
    pesticides remain an essential tool for phytopathogen control (both fungi and
    bacteria) even in areas with low disease pressure (Provost and Pedneault 2016;
    Renaud-Gentié et al. 2020). In our case study, although the copper application
    dose was generally low, pesticide treatments remained a hotspot, as already shown
    by several LCA studies both on organic and conventional wine systems (Manzardo
    et al. 2021; Renaud-Gentié et al. 2020). The primary sources of pesticide treatment
    impacts were, in order of importance: (i) diesel use for spreading; (ii) transportation
    from the pesticide plant to the La Casa di Sophia vineyard; (iii) sulfur and copper
    oxide production; (iv) emission of copper and other heavy metals, especially for
    ECOTOX. Diesel used for pesticide treatments and soil management was, indeed,
    a crucial point in explaining the relevant contribution of grape production to
    the total wine impact. In line with the international LCA literature on wine sector
    (Manzardo et al. 2021; Renaud-Gentié et al. 2020), this is the main hotspot when
    impacts are referred to grape production. Solutions for obtaining diesel impact
    mitigation at La Casa di Sophia farm mainly involve the reduction of the number
    of annual soil operations and phytosanitary treatments, thus rationalizing the
    agronomic management strategy of the vineyard. From a long-term perspective, the
    use of alternative machines with biofuel or electricity-powered engines may be
    a way to improve environmental performance (Renaud-Gentié et al. 2020). Power
    use was a hotspot only in the two last years of production, with total consumption
    exceeding 1500 kWh per year, especially for impact categories affected by direct
    power use, such as CC, RU-M&M, and RU-F. La Casa di Sophia is equipped with photovoltaic
    panels, and the energy consumption is mainly due to the cellar air-conditioning,
    which is consequently the main target of the energy efficiency measures. According
    to the main LCA literature for the wine sector (Ferrara and De Feo 2018; Petti
    et al. 2015), the production of glass bottles (for energy consumption and use
    of natural resources) was a process with high impact in absolute terms and also
    the process with the greatest impact on the packaging stage. The average percentage
    contribution of the glass bottle over the 4 years of production ranged from 24%
    for CC to 9% for ME. The bottles used by La Casa di Sophia were made of non-recycled
    glass and weighed 0.36 kg each: considering that the bottle weight is quite low
    compared to the bottles commonly used for high-quality wine and excluding the
    possibility of using alternative packaging materials (specially for marketing
    reasons, as reported in Petti et al. 2015 and Ferrara and De Feo 2018), the use
    of bottles made of recycled glass should be the most effective improvement for
    packaging (Ferrara and De Feo 2018). To provide further information for the interpretation
    of our findings, the average LCA results for the 4 production years were compared
    with the EF values calculated according to the PEFCR benchmark for still wine
    (packaged in glass bottles and excluding the use stage) (CEEV 2020). The results
    showed that the La Casa di Sophia wine had a slightly lower impact than the PEFCR
    benchmark for only three of the nine selected impact categories. Grape yield was
    the main factor that explains the worst scores obtained in our study, definitely.
    In addition to the necessary considerations regarding the optimal trade-off between
    wine quality and quantity, increasing grape yields remains the main goal for improving
    the environmental performance of wine, especially compared to conventional systems.
    Although significant differences between conventional and organic practices are
    very difficult to identify and generalize due to the high variability of the environmental
    and technical conditions of grape production, as well as the specific methodologies
    applied and the results obtained from LCA studies (Ferrara and De Feo 2018), Petti
    et al. (2015) highlighted that the large yield differences (40% on average) are
    reflected, for instance, in higher land and energy use and material consumption
    per unit volume of wine. Considering the technological structure of the farm and
    the environmental context presented in this case study, as well as the potential
    benefits associated with the use of irrigation in the cultivation of Carignano
    (Mercenaro et al. 2014), the adoption of precise irrigation techniques seems to
    be the most efficient solution among the eco-innovative vineyard practices that
    have been recently outlined with an LCA approach (Renaud-Gentié et al. 2020) for
    improving the environmental sustainability of organic vineyards. 5 Conclusions
    This paper analyzed the environmental profile of a local and organic red wine
    produced in Sardinia, Italy, during four different production years, by a small
    family farm, focusing on the role of vineyard management decisions and agrometeorological
    conditions. During the study period, the observed weather trends in relation to
    the climate conditions were quite comparable. However, the interannual variability
    of the main production inputs, which led to different grape yields, was reflected
    in the trend of wine environmental impact. Between the most relevant impact categories,
    particulate matter, terrestrial eutrophication, and marine eutrophication showed
    the largest variability and had a strong negative correlation with nitrogen and
    phosphorus fertilization. This revealed a weak soil management strategy and showed
    a dominant effect of the farm management approach on the observed interannual
    variability. The LCA study identified the environmental hotspots that can be effectively
    mitigated to improve the sustainability of organic wine. In addition, this work
    confirmed the importance of considering multi-year data for the environmental
    characterization of organic wines and emphasized the need for adequate technical
    support to promote and value the role of small organic farms in the ecological
    transition of the wine sector. Data availability The datasets analyzed during

    integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, offering innovative solutions
    to enhance crop management practices. This research focuses on leveraging IoT
    for the effective management of diseases affecting onion plants in agriculture.
    By employing a network of sensors, data analytics, and automated control systems,
    this study aims to create a smart agricultural framework that monitors, detects,
    and manages onion plant diseases in real-time. The research begins with a thorough
    investigation into the common diseases affecting onion crops and their associated
    environmental factors. Subsequently, a robust IoT infrastructure is designed and
    implemented, comprising sensor nodes for monitoring soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and other relevant parameters. These sensor nodes communicate data to
    a central hub, where advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms analyze
    the information to detect early signs of diseases. In response to disease detection,
    the IoT system employs automated control mechanisms, including precision irrigation,
    targeted application of agrochemicals, and the deployment of environmental control
    measures. The study also explores the integration of remote monitoring through
    mobile applications, allowing farmers to receive real-time alerts and make informed
    decisions promptly. Through field trials and data analysis, the effectiveness
    of the IoT-based disease management system is evaluated, considering factors such
    as disease suppression, yield improvement, and resource efficiency. The research
    also addresses economic considerations and the scalability of the proposed IoT
    framework for widespread adoption in onion cultivation. The findings of this study
    contribute to the advancement of precision agriculture and sustainable farming
    practices, demonstrating the potential of IoT in revolutionizing onion plant disease
    management. As the global demand for agricultural productivity increases, integrating
    smart technologies into traditional farming practices becomes paramount, and this
    research provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the agriculture and technology
    sectors.

    Introduction Agriculture is one of the key sources that plays a significant part
    in the life of the country''s economy. Traditional agriculture refers to the conventional
    farming methods that have been practiced for centuries, relying on manual labor
    and basic tools. In traditional agriculture, farmers often work in small plots
    of land using traditional seeds and farming practices passes down through the
    generations while traditional agriculture has played a crucial role in meeting
    food demands, it does have it disadvantages. One significant drawbacks is its
    relatively low efficiency and productivity. Manual labor-intensive tasks can be
    time-consuming and labor demanding, leading to potential wastage of water, fertilizers
    and pesticides. Moreover, traditional agriculture is more susceptible to the adverse
    effects of unpredictable weather conditions and environmental factors which can
    result in lower yields and economic losses. Meanwhile, food security is a global
    challenge and impacted by rapidly compounding effects of climate changes, population
    trends and supply chain shortcomings. Agriculture''s global impact cannot be overstated,
    as it remains the primary source of food for humanity. Despite the fact that the
    human population continues to grow, agricultural land remains static (Virk et
    al.2020). The authors (Mesgaran et al. 2017) also discovered that the ever-changing
    climatic conditions significantly reduce agricultural product output in conventional
    agricultural systems. As a result of the varying nature of farming resources and
    poor management, farmers continue to experience low agricultural output. Drawbacks
    of Traditional Farming Due to the low degree of automation in the farming area,
    the current state of the art in agriculture, particularly conventional agricultural
    systems, still confronts significant hurdles in terms of sustainability, labor-intensity,
    and energy efficiency needs. Also, the production level of the crops to be considered.
    Scalability problems also taken into account since the population explosion is
    the major cause. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming In order to overcome
    the limitations and challenges faced in the conventional farming systems, the
    advent of the smart farming and precision agricultural sector to automate the
    farming processes towards achieving many goals towards sustainable agricultural
    systems. Some of them are listed below: • High quantity of crop yield • Better
    quality of the crops • Efficient resource utilization • Effective to handle climatic
    conditions • Decision making in cropping patterns • Environment and user-friendly
    • Easy maintenance • Minimized crop losses • Easy to handle pests, diseases, weeds
    • Minimize the crop growth time duration • Early prediction on the crop loss or
    gain • Ensures and motivates organic way of crop cultivation • Improves the growth
    of wide variety of crops • Reduces the usage of pesticides, fungicides and other
    chemicals that are not good for health. • Though huge amount for installations,
    less chances for failures and lasts for longer life-time. Continue Reading References

    In the face of escalating global food demand and the imperative need for sustainable
    agricultural practices, the fusion of technology with farming methodologies has
    emerged as a pivotal solution. With the advent of wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    and their seamless integration into various industries, agriculture has witnessed
    a paradigm shift towards precision farming. In this context, the deployment of
    wireless sensor nodes presents a promising avenue for proactive fault detection
    and real-time monitoring within agricultural landscapes. The conventional agricultural
    practices, while effective, often lack the precision and responsiveness demanded
    by the dynamic environmental conditions and evolving crop health challenges. Addressing
    this gap, the use of wireless sensor nodes offers an innovative approach by facilitating
    continuous and granular data collection across vast agricultural expanses. These
    sensor nodes, strategically placed throughout fields, enable the monitoring of
    crucial parameters such as soil moisture levels, temperature fluctuations, humidity
    variations, and vital plant health indicators. Harnessing the capabilities of
    these sensors coupled with advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms,
    agricultural practitioners gain unprecedented insights into the intricacies of
    their farming ecosystems [1, 2]. This research endeavors to explore, analyze,
    and validate the efficiency of employing wireless sensor nodes as a cornerstone
    for smart fault detection in agricultural systems. By elucidating the technological
    framework, data acquisition methods, and the application of intelligent algorithms,
    this study aims to demonstrate the potential transformative impact of this technology
    on modern farming practices. Moreover, it seeks to address the challenges encountered
    in implementing wireless sensor networks in agriculture while highlighting their
    role in bolstering irrigation and fertilizer efficiency, predictive harvesting,
    minimizing crop losses, and fostering sustainable farming methods [3]. As the
    global population burgeons and the pressure on agricultural productivity intensifies,
    the need for innovative and proactive measures in farming becomes increasingly
    paramount. The integration of wireless sensor nodes stands poised to revolutionize
    the agricultural landscape, heralding a new era of precision, sustainability,
    and resilience in crop production. This paper endeavors to contribute to this
    unfolding narrative by providing empirical insights into the promising frontier
    of wireless sensor networks use for smart fault detection in agriculture, thereby
    reshaping the future of farming practices worldwide. In this research endeavor,
    the subsequent sections delve into various aspects of fault detection in the agricultural
    domain. Following the introduction, the second section meticulously examines the
    mechanisms and techniques employed for detecting defects, establishing a comparative
    analysis of their reliability and effectiveness. Emphasis is placed on the significance
    of using the WSN (wireless sensor nodes) technique while addressing the challenges
    it entails and offering potential solutions. Section three is dedicated to elucidating
    the motivation behind the robustness of WSN in contrast to contemporary and existing
    techniques for defect analysis and determination. The proposed methodology is
    thoroughly outlined in the fourth section. The fifth section is designated for
    an empirical investigation into the adopted strategy, underscoring the attained
    results. Subsequently, in the sixth section, a detailed interpretation of these
    findings is presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed method in
    comparison to alternative models. Notably, limitations inherent in the approach
    are explicitly addressed, encompassing potential challenges, drawbacks, and constraints
    specifically related to the use of WSNs within this context. Additionally, the
    discussion encompasses prospective avenues for future research and enhancements,
    unveiling opportunities for further advancement. Finally, the conclusion section
    encapsulates the research outcomes and insights gained. 2 Literal Review 2.1 Position
    of WSN Over Models Agriculture is undergoing a significant transformation owing
    to technological advancements, with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) emerging as
    a critical tool for precision farming. This review aims to comprehensively analyze
    the role, challenges, and potential of WSNs in smart fault detection within agricultural
    systems. WSNs have revolutionized agriculture by enabling real-time monitoring
    of crucial environmental parameters. These sensor nodes, strategically positioned
    across fields, collect data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and plant
    health indicators. Their integration with IoT technologies facilitates seamless
    data transmission and analysis, empowering farmers with actionable insights for
    informed decision-making [4, 5]. Despite their potential, the deployment of WSNs
    in agriculture presents several challenges. Power management, data accuracy, network
    scalability, and interoperability among heterogeneous sensor nodes remain primary
    concerns. Moreover, environmental factors such as signal interference, harsh weather
    conditions, and geographical obstacles pose hurdles in maintaining reliable connectivity.
    As technological framework, advancements in sensor technology, data analytics,
    and machine learning algorithms have propelled the capabilities of WSNs in fault
    detection. Innovations in sensor miniaturization, energy-efficient designs, and
    data processing techniques have enhanced their reliability and accuracy in identifying
    anomalies, diseases, and irrigation issues in crops. Further more, as application
    and benefits, WSNs offer multifaceted benefits in agriculture. They optimize resource
    use by providing precise and localized information, thereby reducing water and
    fertilizer wastage. Early fault detection facilitates timely intervention, mitigating
    crop losses and improving overall yield. Additionally, these systems promote sustainable
    farming practices by minimizing environmental impact through targeted and optimized
    agricultural interventions. Thus, WSN play a pivotal role in agricultural fault
    detection and can be positioned in relation to various strategies commonly used
    in this domain. In Rule-Based Systems, WSN takes a complementary position. It
    can gather real-time data from agricultural fields or equipment, providing continuous
    input for rule-based systems. The WSN feeds data to these systems, enabling the
    application of predefined rules for fault detection based on the collected sensor
    information [6, 7]. In Statistical Analysis, WSN takes an integral component position.
    It provides the necessary data for statistical analysis by continuously collecting
    and transmitting sensor data. The sensor nodes contribute real-time data streams
    that form the basis for establishing statistical models to identify anomalies
    or deviations from normal patterns [8]. In Machine Learning Algorithms, WSN takes
    a fundamental component position. It serves as the primary data collection infrastructure
    for machine learning algorithms. The continuous data streams from sensor nodes
    are used to train and update machine learning models for fault detection, providing
    the necessary input for adaptive learning and pattern recognition. In Fusion of
    Multiple Techniques, WSN has an enabling component position. It acts as the backbone
    for collecting multi-source data necessary for integrating multiple fault detection
    techniques. It provides diverse sensor data, facilitating the fusion and integration
    of rule-based, statistical, and machine learning strategies for comprehensive
    fault detection. In IoT-Enabled Smart Sensors, WSN has an integral component position.
    It consists of smart sensors equipped with communication capabilities, forming
    the basis for real-time monitoring and data transmission essential for fault detection
    in agriculture [9, 10]. In Blockchain-Enabled Systems, WSN has a data source position.
    It contributes to blockchain-enabled systems by providing the data that needs
    to be securely stored and authenticated. It generates the sensor data, which can
    be securely stored on the blockchain to ensure data integrity and traceability.
    In Long-Range Wireless Technologies (LoRa), WSN takes an infrastructure position.
    It leverages long-range wireless technologies for communication between sensor
    nodes and gateways. These technologies serve as the communication infrastructure
    within WSNs, facilitating long-range data transmission from remote agricultural
    areas [11, 12]. Comparing the WSN approach with existing fault detection techniques
    in agriculture involves highlighting the advantages of WSNs over traditional methods
    or other contemporary technologies. Below, an analysis showcasing how WSN approach
    excels in comparison to existing techniques: For Real-Time Monitoring and Timely
    Detection: WSNs enable continuous, real-time monitoring of agricultural parameters.
    They offer immediate fault detection upon deviation from predefined thresholds
    or abnormal patterns, reducing response time and potential losses. Whereas, traditional
    methods, such as manual inspections, periodic checks, or testing equipment, often
    lack real-time monitoring capabilities. They might result in delayed fault detection,
    leading to increased downtime and losses [13]. For Data-Driven Precision and Accuracy:
    WSNs collect and analyze a vast amount of data from multiple sensors, facilitating
    precise fault detection through machine learning algorithms and data fusion techniques.
    This leads to accurate fault identification and reduces false positives or negatives.
    However, some existing techniques rely on simple rules or manual inspections,
    which might lack the depth of analysis or the ability to adapt to complex fault
    patterns, potentially resulting in less accurate detections. Concerning Cost Efficiency
    and Resource Optimization: while initial setup costs for WSNs might be higher,
    they offer long-term cost efficiency by minimizing losses through early fault
    detection, optimizing resource utilization (water, fertilizers, predictive harvesting),
    and reducing manual labor requirements over time. While, traditional methods might
    incur higher labor costs due to manual inspections or require periodic testing
    equipment maintenance, potentially leading to higher operational expenses in the
    long run. About the Scalability and Flexibility: WSNs are scalable and adaptable.
    Additional sensors can be integrated easily into the network, offering flexibility
    in expanding coverage or integrating new sensors for evolving fault detection
    needs. Unlike, some traditional methods might face limitations in scalability,
    especially when relying on manual labor or fixed testing equipment, making it
    challenging to adapt to changing agricultural requirements or expanding operations.
    For Comprehensive Fault Detection and Decision Support: the integration of diverse
    fault detection techniques within WSNs, such as machine learning, statistical
    analysis, and real-time data fusion, offers a comprehensive approach. This enables
    informed decision-making and actionable insights for farmers or stakeholders.
    But, other methods from existing techniques might lack the comprehensive nature
    of WSNs, focusing on specific fault types or lacking the ability to provide holistic
    insights based on real-time, multi-parameter data [14, 15]. Some stations highlighting
    the development and application of WSN in remote fault detection are mentioned
    below. From early 2000s: the concept of WSNs begins to emerge with the development
    of early sensor nodes like Telos, Mica, and Tmote Sky. The Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) as Machine Learning Models gain traction for classification tasks due to
    their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data. From mid-2000s: creation
    of IEEE 802.15.4 Standard. The standardization of low-rate wireless personal area
    networks (LR-WPANs) lays the foundation for the development of WSNs for various
    applications, including agriculture. Decision tree-based models and ensemble methods
    like Random Forests gain popularity for their ability to handle classification
    tasks and interpretability [16]. From late 2000s to early 2010s: WSNs start being
    adopted in precision agriculture, focusing on soil monitoring, weather forecasting,
    and crop health assessment. Deep learning approaches, particularly neural networks,
    see a resurgence due to advancements in computational power and data availability.
    From mid-2010s: the integration of WSNs with the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem
    becomes prevalent, enabling seamless data collection, processing, and analysis
    from agricultural sensors. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and its variants (e.g.
    XGBoost, LightGBM) gain attention for their superior performance in classification
    and regression tasks [16, 17]. From late 2010s to early 2020s: increased adoption
    of cloud-based platforms for data storage, processing, and scalability in handling
    large volumes of sensor data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially long
    short-term memory (LSTM) networks, gain prominence for time-series analysis and
    prediction in agriculture, considering temporal dependencies in sensor data. Actually,
    recent developments focus on developing machine learning models that offer interpretability
    and explainability, such as Explainable AI (XAI), in detecting faults to aid decision-making
    in farming practices. Federated Learning explores federated learning techniques
    to train models collaboratively across different agricultural sites while preserving
    data privacy and security [18]. From another horizon, integrating blockchain technology
    into the realm of agricultural equipment and irrigation systems, especially concerning
    fault detection and data management, offers several potential benefits. Blockchain
    provides a tamper-proof and immutable ledger, ensuring the integrity of data collected
    by sensors in agricultural equipment. This feature prevents unauthorized alterations
    or manipulations, ensuring the authenticity of fault detection records.Through
    blockchain, every change or transaction recorded within the system can be traced
    back to its origin. This traceability can be valuable for tracking the history
    of faults detected in equipment or changes in irrigation systems over time. Blockchain''s
    decentralized nature enables secure data storage across multiple nodes, reducing
    the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing data security. Blockchain
    can facilitate controlled and permissioned access to sensor data. Authorized stakeholders,
    including farmers, agronomists, and maintenance personnel, can securely access
    specific data relevant to their roles. Smart contracts, self-executing contracts
    with predefined conditions, can automate tasks triggered by fault detections.
    For instance, when a fault is identified in an irrigation system, a smart contract
    could automatically trigger a maintenance request or adjust irrigation settings
    based on predefined parameters. Blockchain''s transparency can aid in tracking
    agricultural equipment and components throughout their lifecycle. This transparency
    ensures authenticity and reliability in the supply chain, allowing farmers to
    verify the origin and authenticity of equipment [19]. Implementing tokenization
    through blockchain could incentivize stakeholders for efficient equipment maintenance
    or early fault reporting. This system can reward participants with tokens or digital
    assets for contributing valuable data or maintaining equipment in optimal conditions.
    Blockchain can facilitate interoperability between different agricultural systems
    and platforms, allowing seamless integration of data from various sources. Standardization
    of data formats can enhance compatibility and collaboration among different stakeholders
    and systems. Blockchain-enabled systems can track environmental impact data associated
    with agricultural practices, including water usage, energy consumption, and carbon
    emissions. This transparency can help in adopting more sustainable and environmentally
    friendly practices [20]. Integrating blockchain technology into fault detection
    in agricultural equipment and irrigation systems requires careful consideration
    of implementation challenges such as scalability, interoperability, and regulatory
    compliance. However, leveraging blockchain''s inherent features can significantly
    enhance the security, transparency, and efficiency of fault detection processes
    in agriculture. According to the above descriptions, we have chosen to design
    an agricultural fault detection system based on a Delta-hybridization between
    WSN wireless sensor nodes, Block-chain and a Deep learning classifier ERSOM model
    that stands for Evolutionary Recurrent Self Organizing Map. 2.2 Node Principle
    A Node represents an autonomous real time computational system. It receives the
    signals through its integrated sensors and processes them using a Digital Signal
    Processor DSP. A sensor is a fundamental part of Smart technologies that functions
    as a transducer using various effects like capacitive or inductive (magnetic).
    A set of sensors, forming a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), collaborate autonomously
    to monitor and communicate information regarding potential issues. These autonomous
    microsystems communicate wirelessly in a designated space, known as a collector
    field. Nodes, equipped with high-end sensors, organize themselves into a self-structured
    topology, transmitting collected data to an information system or processing center,
    potentially via specialized nodes called “sinks.” Energy constraints, typically
    from small batteries, underscore the importance of managing energy as a critical
    resource in sensor nodes, making WSN technology pervasive and adaptable across
    diverse domains. In general, wireless sensors typically consist of various components
    including capture, processing, communication, and energy units. Depending on the
    application, additional elements like Global Positioning System GPS for environmental
    tracking or solar-powered mobility systems can be integrated. The resilience of
    WSN heavily relies on sensor material quality and precision. Despite their small
    size, nodes feature an efficient architecture incorporating multiple circuits
    on a single board, comprising detection units, microcontrollers, RF-antennas,
    and power units [21]. Further details on the internal structure of a node are
    depicted in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Architecture of wireless sensor node Full size image
    The detection unit comprises a set of sensors to assess information reliability
    from the environment; in case of sensor failure, it ensures data integrity. Sensor
    outputs link to the processing unit via anti-aliasing filters and an ADC for compatibility.
    This unit functions as the node''s core, managing internal operations, fault detection,
    energy, and coordination among WSN nodes'' processors. ROM and RAM storage support
    processing instructions, communication programs, and collected data. An RF antenna
    circuit enables communication between nodes, while the power unit''s lifespan
    relies on limited resources. External flash memory expands applications limited
    by chip memory, and internal I/O buses ease component communication within the
    node. An RF antenna is integrated at the node''s extremity. 3 Adopted Approach
    Our idea is to design a remote agricultural fault detection model offering better
    reliability and efficiency than those established by existing methods. This approach
    is based on the Delta-Hybridization between WSN wireless sensor nodes, Block-chain
    and a Deep learning classifier ERSOM model that stands for Evolutionary Recurrent
    Self Organizing Map. This last model represents the pivot of the analysis of the
    signals received by sensors. It revolves around a recurrent evolutionary algorithm
    of a self-organizing neural map with unsupervised learning, giving the possibility
    of processing a large volume of data. Recurrence is applied to this neural map
    in order to integrate the dynamic temporal aspect by adapting it to the ability
    to process and evaluate dynamic and not static data information. The fault detection
    and recognition algorithm carried out by this recurrent neural map will subsequently
    be considered a nucleus or an individual of population of iterations supported
    by an evolutionary genetic algorithm ensuring the extension of the search space.
    This insight allows to optimize results and avoid being trapped in an optimal
    static state. This algorithm will be managed by the DSP Mounted on the Sensor
    Node card. This algorithm will be managed by the DSP Mounted on the Sensor Node
    card. The processing result will be carried out based on a comparison between
    the primitives and singularities of the signal received from the system to be
    controlled and the data characterizing all types of faults from an archived database
    and updated at each event at the level of the Block-chain to which it is linked.
    This result will be broadcast in real time through the WSN to a master node linked
    by an HMI interface. The Blockchain and WSN models are detailed previously. The
    following Fig. 2 offers a view on the adopted strategy. Fig. 2 Typical used wireless
    sensor network Full size image RTU stands for remote terminal unit; terminal Node
    mounted on the system to be controlled. MTU stands for master terminal unit; terminal
    Node linked to human–machine interface HMI. The proposed terminal wireless sensor
    node RTU comprises capture, processing, communication, and energy units. The Sensing
    unit includes a physical capture device for local environment data and an Analog
    to Digital Converter (ADC) transforming analog signals into digital ones interpreted
    by the microcontroller. Memories store information from the capture unit. The
    communication unit, known as the Transceiver unit, handles wireless data transmission
    and reception. It can be optical, as in Smart Dust Nodes, or radiofrequency-based,
    with optical communication being robust against electrical interference but requiring
    a direct line of sight. Radio frequency units include modulation, demodulation,
    filtering, and multiplexing circuits. Sensor nodes equipped with various sensors,
    e.g., temperature, humidity, soil moisture, pH sensors, relevant to agricultural
    monitoring. These sensor nodes are distributed across the agricultural area, collecting
    real-time data continuously from the environment such as soil moisture levels,
    temperature variations, humidity, and other relevant parameters related to crop
    health and equipment status. Sensor nodes communicate wirelessly with each other
    and with a central base station or gateway, called sink, using communication protocols
    such as Long Range transmission LoRa. Wireless communication allows the collected
    data to be transmitted over extended distances to a centralized location for further
    processing and analysis. Data collected from various sensor nodes is aggregated
    and transmitted to a centralized system or cloud-based platform. In this centralized
    system, the received data undergoes processing, analysis, and storage for fault
    detection and decision-making. Advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms
    are applied to the collected data to identify patterns, anomalies, or deviations
    from normal conditions. These algorithms analyze sensor data to detect potential
    faults in agricultural equipment, irrigation systems, or anomalies in environmental
    parameters that could affect crop health. Once anomalies or faults are detected
    through data analysis, the system generates alerts or notifications to relevant
    stakeholders, farmers, agronomists, maintenance personnel, for timely intervention.
    Early warning systems or automated alerts enable proactive maintenance, minimizing
    the impact of faults on agricultural operations. It is important to highlight
    that the ERSOM neural model''s learning phase on an agricultural systems fault
    database might take several hours and can reach one day. The duration depends
    on factors such as the database size, model topology, neuron count, learning iterations,
    and stopping criteria. Once the model has learned and becomes proficient in identifying
    these faults, its real-time testing phase will be instantaneous during system
    control. The signal processing steps for the controlled part proceed as follows:
    Firstly, filtering, windowing, and segmenting the signal to extract primitives
    defining the contained information. Various methods define these primitives, such
    as the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) matrix. However, our approach
    opts for determining the primitives as Bi-spectrum matrices, as they are well-suited
    for characterizing highly transient stochastic signals. Thus, the Bi-spectrum
    designates an autocorrelation of order 2, called moment of order 2. Namely that
    the cross correlation is the measure of the analogy between two signals according
    to a time shift applied to one of them. One of the signals will be the signal
    measured by the sensors and the other signal is that of the database as a reference.
    The autocorrelation goes deeper to determine the coefficients of similarities
    between the measured signal and the reference one which resembles it better among
    the samples of signals in the database as a reference. The Bi-spectrum, as an
    autocorrelation of order 2, goes even deeper to be like a more selective filter
    in the determination of the similarity coefficients to a very precise default
    sample. Each matrix of bispectrum coefficients will be concatinated vertically
    in order to reduce it into a line vector, without loss of characteristics, which
    represents the input to our ERSOM model. It will be processed quickly to visualize
    the type of defects on one of the neurons, if any. The computation of the bi-spectral
    coefficients will be performed in the following manner: We examine a discrete
    signal x(n) obtained from the motor-pump machine, with a mean of zero and considered
    a locally stationary random process. The signal''s length, denoted as N, ranges
    from 0 to. N − 1. The expression for its autocorrelation function is as follows:
    $$ R_{xx} (m) = E\\left\\{ {x(n)x(n + m)} \\right\\} $$ (1) The calculated \\({\\text{E}}\\left\\{
    \\cdot \\right\\}\\), known as the mathematical expectation, represents the average
    within a set, serving as a statistical function with a discrete time-delay denoted
    as m. It is also referred to as the second-order moment. If the two signals are
    not correlated, we have the autocorrelation R = 0. In case of resemblance we obtain
    simularity coefficients. The Power Spectrum PS is determined by applying the Fourier
    transform (FT) to the preceding formula [22]. $$ P_{xx} (f) = \\sum\\limits_{m
    = - \\infty }^{ + \\infty } {R_{xx} (m)} \\,e^{ - j2\\pi fm} $$ (2) An alternalive
    formula can be used. $$ P_{xx} (f) = E\\left\\{ {X(f)X^{ * } (f)} \\right\\} =
    E\\left\\{ {\\left| {X(f)^{2} } \\right|} \\right\\} $$ (3) X* represents the
    conjugate of X(f), which computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of our
    primary current signal to be controlled, x(n). $$ X(f) = \\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^{N
    - 1} {x(n)} \\,e^{{ - j\\frac{2\\pi fn}{N}}} $$ (4) Additionally, we derive the
    bispectrum, referred to as bispectral density B(f1, f2), by applying a transform
    function (TF) to the third-order moment depicted in the equation below. $$ M_{3}^{x}
    (k,l) = E\\left\\{ {x^{ * } (n)x(n + k)x(n + l)} \\right\\}. $$ (5) The parameters
    k and l represent time delay points. Essentially, we need to estimate the expected
    bispectrum values from limited data using the following formula. $$ \\begin{aligned}
    \\hat{B}(f_{1} ,f_{2} ) & = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^{M} {X_{k} (f_{1}
    )X_{k} (f_{2} )X_{k}^{ * } (f_{1} + f_{2} )} \\\\ & \\approx E\\left\\{ {X(f_{1}
    )X(f_{2} )X^{ * } (f_{1} + f_{2} )} \\right\\} \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ (6) The
    sensor detects the fault signal x(n), which is subsequently processed by the processor
    within the suitable WSN node. This calculation involves setting f1 and f2 to an
    identical value, denoted as f, and is expressed as: $$ \\hat{B}(f_{1} ,f_{2} )\\left|
    {_{{f_{1} = f_{2} = f}} } \\right. = \\hat{D}(f) \\approx E\\left\\{ {X^{2} (f)X^{
    * } (2f)} \\right\\}. $$ (7) As exemple, considering a fracture defect in the
    bars of a motor-pump rotor estimated from research to constitute 10% of potential
    defects. The features of BRB related to this specific failure type include frequency
    components defined by the following Eq. (8) [22, 23]. $$ f_{BRB} = \\left[ {\\left(
    \\frac{k}{p} \\right)\\left( {1 - s} \\right) \\pm s} \\right]f_{s} $$ (8) Observing
    that the supply frequency is denoted by fs, the number of pole pairs by p, k represents
    a constant proportionality, and s signifies the rotor magnetic slip. Given the
    effects of speed ripple, it''s plausible that supplementary frequency components
    might appear in the stator current spectrum. Hence, an additional Eq. (9) could
    identify these components. $$ f_{BRBs} = (1 \\pm 2ks)f_{s} $$ (9) To identify
    rotor faults through its connected WSN node, analysis of the side-band frequency
    components at (1 ± 2 s)fs has been conducted. We establish that the lower sideband
    represents the primary fault frequency, while the upper sideband signifies the
    harmonic frequency of certain resultant velocity fluctuations. Consequently, we
    can use these two distinct values as effective control factors. To create a singular
    factor, we calculate their average, as shown below. $$ I_{dB} = \\left[ {20\\log_{10}
    \\left( {\\frac{{I_{l} }}{I}} \\right) + 20\\log_{10} \\left( {\\frac{{I_{r} }}{I}}
    \\right)} \\right]/2 $$ (10) Namely, I1 represents the fault module, Ir signifies
    the rotor current module, which is depicted by the upper sideband, and I represents
    the stator current module as the fundamental. Additionally, the stator current
    related to a mechanical BRB fault can be mathematically depicted. This model characterizes
    the stator current concerning electrical asymmetries in the rotor, generating
    what are known as sideband frequencies, expressed by the equation. $$ \\begin{aligned}
    i_{a} (t) & = i_{f} \\cos (\\omega t - \\varphi ) + \\sum\\limits_{k} {i_{l,k}
    } \\cos ((\\omega - \\omega_{f,k} )t - \\varphi_{l,k} ) \\\\ & \\quad + \\sum\\limits_{k}
    {i_{r,k} } \\cos ((\\omega + \\omega_{f,k} )t - \\varphi_{r,k} ) \\\\ \\end{aligned}
    $$ (11) where fs is the fundamental frequency of the electrical power. As \\(\\omega_{f,k}
    = 2ks\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f_{s}\\), the above expression will be:
    $$ \\begin{aligned} i_{a} (t) & = i_{f} \\cos (2\\pi f_{s} t - \\varphi ) + \\sum\\limits_{k}
    {i_{l,k} } \\cos (2\\pi f_{l,k} t - \\varphi_{l,k} ) \\\\ & \\quad + \\sum\\limits_{k}
    {i_{r,k} } \\cos (2\\pi f_{r,k} t - \\varphi_{r,k} ) \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ (12)
    The separated formula of the controlled current signal will undergo processing
    by the node''s microcontroller. It will then be compared to a healthy signal used
    as a reference to detect faults in machines.This procedure involves applying a
    transform function to the aforementioned equation to obtain the subsequent spectral
    relationship. $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{a} (f) & = \\frac{{i_{f} }}{2}\\delta (f
    - f_{s} )e^{j\\varphi } + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum\\limits_{k}^{{}} {i_{l,k} \\delta
    (f - f_{l,k} )e^{{j\\varphi_{l,k} }} } \\\\ & \\quad + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum\\limits_{k}^{{}}
    {i_{r,k} \\delta (f - f_{r,k} )e^{{j\\varphi_{r,k} }} } . \\\\ \\end{aligned}
    $$ (13) This mathematical model allows for further breakdown into basic elements,
    which are easily comprehensible for the WSN Node''s processor to handle [24].
    $$ \\begin{aligned} B(f_{1} ,f_{2} ) & = I_{a} (f_{1} )I_{a} (f_{2} )I_{a}^{ *
    } (f_{1} + f_{2} ) \\\\ & = \\frac{1}{8}\\left( \\begin{gathered} i_{f} \\delta
    (f_{1} - f_{s} )e^{j\\varphi } + \\sum\\limits_{{k_{1} }} {i_{{l,k_{1} }} \\delta

    \\quad \\times \\left( \\begin{gathered} i_{f} \\delta (f_{2} - f_{s} )e^{j\\varphi
    } + \\sum\\limits_{{k_{2} }} {i_{{l,k_{2} }} \\delta (f_{2} - f_{{l,k_{2} }} )e^{{j\\varphi_{l,k2}

    \\end{aligned} $$ (14) Next, a numerical example simulation will be conducted
    to generate the bi-spectrum. The description of the experimental stator current
    is outlined as follows: $$ i_{a} (t) = i_{f} \\cos (2\\pi f_{s} t - \\varphi )
    + i_{l,1} \\cos (2\\pi f_{l,1} t - \\varphi_{l,1} ) + i_{r,1} \\cos (2\\pi f_{r,1}
    t - \\varphi_{r,1} ) $$ (15) Upon carefully selecting various parameter values
    from the preceding equation, the processor within the WSN Node of the respective
    machine, following the requested information routing at the collection node level,
    enables us to visualize curves labeled accordingly for power spectrum and bispectrum,
    depicted in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Power spectrum PS and bi-spectrum of a node received
    signal [24] Full size image While this proposed approach offers significant advantages
    in agricultural fault detection, it is not without limitations. Overcoming these
    limitations and planning for future enhancements are pivotal to optimize WSN efficacy
    in agriculture. The constraints include issues such as limited battery life and
    energy consumption, data security and privacy concerns, scalability challenges,
    data management complexities, sensor accuracy reliability, implementation costs,
    and the need for interdisciplinary knowledge integration. To address these, advancements
    in low-power sensor technologies, robust encryption, improved scalability, efficient
    data processing, enhanced sensor reliability, cost-effective solutions, and interdisciplinary
    collaborations are essential. By focusing on technological advancements, refined
    protocols, and collaborative endeavors, WSNs can become more efficient, reliable,
    cost-effective, and user-friendly, ensuring widespread adoption and seamless integration
    into agricultural practices. A techno-economic study shows that implementing Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSNs) in agriculture offers multifaceted advantages, but a comprehensive
    cost–benefit analysis compared to traditional fault detection methods is essential
    to ascertain their overall value. Examining the cost–benefit analysis reveals
    numerous benefits of WSNs in agriculture, such as enhanced precision and efficiency
    in monitoring parameters, real-time data collection enabling timely interventions,
    reduced labor and operational costs, optimized resource utilization, and early
    fault detection capabilities. However, implementing WSNs involves costs related
    to hardware, installation, maintenance, and data management. When compared to
    traditional methods, WSNs showcase superior accuracy, cost efficiency in the long
    run, scalability, comprehensive coverage, and adaptability to changing agricultural
    needs. Despite the higher initial investment, WSNs prove to be more efficient,
    minimizing losses, optimizing resources, and offering real-time, accurate data
    for improved productivity and sustainability in agriculture. In a simplified qualitative
    perspective, WSNs exhibit higher accuracy, real-time capabilities, scalability,
    and potential for cost reduction over time, leading to a moderately high to high
    techno-economic score, whereas traditional methods may offer lower initial costs
    but could result in increased long-term operational expenses and potential losses,
    resulting in a moderate to low techno-economic score. 4 Experiment Results The
    experimental setup consists of the following components: A three-phase induction
    machine under the control of an ‘OMRON’ inverter. The rotor shaft is linked to
    a DC generator, connected to a rheostat for load control. Characteristics of the
    induction machine include: Nominal power: 4 kW Nominal speed: 1480 rpm Moment
    of inertia: J = 0.013 kg m2 Number of stove pairs: P = 2 SKF 6208 ball bearing
    with mechanical rotational frequencies: outer ring (fbext = 89.4 Hz), inner ring
    (fbint = 136 Hz), ball cage (fc = 9.94 Hz), and ball frequency (fbille = 58.4
    Hz). Using a Micro-log portable terminal for acquiring and storing sensor measurements.
    The sensor used is a piezoelectric accelerometer. The entire test bench is defined
    by Fig. 4 below. Fig. 4 Experimental bench Full size image Our ERSOM fault classification
    model was trained using an energetically balanced, locally developed database.
    This database comprises 100 signal samples obtained from the test bench, representing
    diverse failures such as mechanical, electrical, vibration, thermal, and physical
    issues, accompanying the normal signal. The neuron map consists of 100 neurons,
    and the ERSOM model was trained with a stopping criterion after 1000 iterations.
    Subsequently, during the control and testing phase, the ERSOM model analyzed the
    stator signal received from the machine, specifically depicting a mechanical fault
    in the ball bearing. The resulting output of the ERSOM model visualized the topology
    showcased in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Visualization of the inner ring failure over ERSOM
    model Full size image The topology depicted by ERSOM revealed the presence of
    a ball bearing fault indicated by the frequency Fbi. This fault is accurately
    defined within the inner ring and is constrained by the cutoff harmonics Fn1 and
    Fn2, situated close to the Best Matching Unit (BMU) neuron linked to the fault.
    Additionally, further examination reveals the presence of the reasoning frequency
    Fre generated by the primary fault. Tthe character ‘h’ indicates a healthy signal.
    We plot the spectral amplitude of the processed signal and observe the curve in
    Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Spectrum of the inner ring failure Full size image The main fault
    occupies a frequency of 680 Hz and the two harmonics are present with a difference
    on either side of 25 Hz. This implies that Fn1 has a frequency of 655 Hz and Fn2
    is at a frequency of 705 Hz. In the same way we can see the curve which defines
    the bi-spectrum of the same machine when it is requested by the same frequencies
    of a failure, as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 The bi-spectrum of the inner ring failure
    Full size image Furthermore, using Bi-Spectrum analysis will aid in discerning
    the severity of faults. Referring to Fig. 7, it becomes apparent that the encountered
    peaks are extremely abrupt and lack any frequency breadth. In the same way, the
    rules determining the performance criteria of the fault classifier models which
    qualify the operation of the WSN Nodes are established as follows: a. Accuracy:
    measures the overall correctness of the model''s predictions. Its formula is expressed
    as follows [25, 26]: $$ {\\mathbf{Ac}} = \\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{TN}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{TN}} + {\\text{FP}} + {\\text{FN}}} \\right)
    $$ (16) where TP = True Positives, TN = True Negatives, FP = False Positives,
    FN = False Negatives. Accuracy gives the ratio of correctly predicted instances
    to the total instances in the dataset. b. Precision: indicates the ratio of correctly
    predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
    It has the following formula: $$ \\Pr = {\\text{TP}}/\\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{FP}}}
    \\right) $$ (17) Precision focuses on the accuracy of positive predictions and
    indicates the model''s ability to avoid false positives. c. Recall (Sensitivity
    or True Positive Rate): Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations
    to all actual positives. It is defined by the following formula: $$ {\\mathbf{Recall}}
    = {\\text{TP}}/\\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{FN}}} \\right) $$ (18) Recall measures
    the model''s ability to identify all relevant instances, showing its sensitivity
    to true positives. d. F1-score: F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and
    recall. It provides a balance between precision and recall. It is calculated using
    the following formula: $$ {\\text{F1-score}} = 2*\\left( {{\\text{Precision}}*{\\text{Recall}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {{\\text{Precision}} + {\\text{Recall}}} \\right) $$ (19) F1-score
    considers both false positives and false negatives and is useful when the class
    distribution is imbalanced. The obtained indicators are presented in Table 1.
    Table 1 Evaluation of classifier models Full size table These findings are highlighted
    by the Fig. 8 represented in below. Wherein, It is remarkable that the proposed
    ERSOM model is clearly advantageous compared to other models. Fig. 8 Performance
    of different classifier models Full size image Based on the Fig. 8 curve, it''s
    evident that neural models, particularly the dynamic model RSOM and the evolutionary
    model ERSOM, hold superior positions in performance compared to others. Nonetheless,
    it''s worth noting that SVM has the potential to surpass both the Kmeans moving
    center algorithm and the static SOM model in terms of performance. 5 Results Discussion
    The ERSOM deep learning model’s topology, Fig. 5, reveals that among the 100 neurons,
    merely 2 neurons remain unoccupied. This signifies an impressive defect identification
    rate of 98% using this model. Thus, it offers a precise objective evaluation with
    a well-defined visualization. The ERSOM map identifies the anomaly on the inner
    ring, delineated by the frequency fbi signified by the winning neuron. Adjacent
    neurons signal frequencies fn1 and fn2, representing fbi + fc and fbi–fc, respectively.
    The indicator fre denotes the resonance frequency of the induction machine''s
    structure. The curve depicted in Fig. 6 represents the spectral amplitude of the
    signal under examination, which help us in mechanical inner ring defect identification.
    However, this assessment remains subjective and lacks defined scores for evaluation.
    The spectrum illustrated in the same Fig. 6, depicting the vibration signal from
    the sensor, discloses the following insights: The amplitude evolution of harmonic
    components follows a pattern such as (555 + k25) Hz, where k = 0, 1, 2, 3, …,
    representing frequencies resulting from the ball''s passage on the indentation.
    A substantial increase in amplitudes, approximately 100 dB around 780 Hz, signifies
    the resonance of the structure, possibly attributed to the 31st harmonic resonance
    of rotation (780.2/25 = 31.2). The identification of the 5th order harmonic (680.2/136 = 5)
    reveals the presence of a mechanical anomaly in the inner ring when observed in
    the spectrum''s zoomed mode. The Bi-spectrum plotted in Fig. 7 distinctly illustrates
    a resemblance to the outcomes presented in the ERSOM topology depicted in Fig.
    5. This similarity indicates that the ERSOM model, trained and tested using Bi-spectrum
    coefficients, aligns closely with the observed results. Consequently, this correlation
    strongly substantiates the accuracy and validity of the ERSOM deep learning model
    employed to steer the WSN Node. As depicted in Fig. 8, it''s evident that the
    ERSOM deep learning evolutionary model stands out significantly due to its efficiency
    compared to other models. This superiority is attributed to its integration of
    three essential criteria: evolutionaryism for broadening the search space, dynamism
    facilitated by a loop of recurrence that incorporates temporal aspects, and a
    neuronal aspect that mimics human thought processes. However, it''s important
    to note that this proposed model demands considerably more time during its unsupervised
    learning phase. Moreover, diverse outcomes arise from various fault detection
    strategies in agriculture: Rule-Based Systems: Swift fault identification using
    predefined rules, as seen in detecting irrigation system faults. Statistical Analysis:
    Identification of anomalies or outliers in soil moisture data, suggesting potential
    system issues. Machine Learning Algorithms: Improved accuracy in spotting subtle
    changes in crop health, aiding in early disease detection. Fusion of Multiple
    Techniques: Enhanced precision by combining strategies like rule-based systems
    and machine learning for fault detection. IoT-Enabled Smart Sensors: Real-time
    monitoring and rapid identification of temperature fluctuations, indicating potential
    crop damage. Blockchain-Enabled Systems: Ensuring secure and traceable records
    of fault detection through blockchain technology. Note that, Zigbee finds common
    usage in home automation, industrial control systems, and healthcare due to its
    cost-effectiveness and low power consumption. Meanwhile, Bluetooth enjoys widespread
    adoption in consumer electronics such as smartphones, audio devices, and wearables
    owing to its user-friendly nature and compatibility. The Internet serves various
    sectors, encompassing communication, commerce, cloud services, and IoT applications.
    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) excel in environmental monitoring, agriculture,
    and healthcare, offering real-time data collection from distant areas. Notably,
    WSN tends to have lower data rates but can cover extensive distances, while the
    Internet exhibits high return on investment ROI potential, particularly in business,
    communication, and data services. Comparably, Wireless Sensor Networks WSN technology
    can have a strong ROI in industries like environmental monitoring, healthcare,
    and agriculture due to their ability to gather data from remote or hazardous locations.
    However, using WSN for fault detection in agriculture encounters key challenges
    such as: Limited access to power sources in remote areas affects device lifespan
    and functionality. Varied landscapes impede signal transmission, affecting accuracy.
    Environmental factors impact sensor accuracy, requiring regular calibration. Efficiently
    handling large data volumes poses computational challenges. High deployment costs
    in vast agricultural areas need a balance for effectiveness. Security and protecting
    sensitive data during transmission is critical. Adapting WSN with existing systems
    is complex, requiring compatibility measures. As avenues for future research and
    improvements to reveal opportunities for further progress, we point out that advancements
    in sensor technology, energy efficiency, and tailored algorithms are crucial to
    overcome these challenges, realizing WSN''s full potential in precise agriculture
    fault detection. 6 Conclusion The WSNs are actually widely applicable in major
    emerging technology. We expressed, in this topic, the ability of the proposed
    Wireless Sensor Node strategy, which becomes a smart powerful tool in remote monitoring
    condition. Our approach is enriched by using the higher order spectrum called
    Bi-spectrum in primitive extraction and analysis of controled signal over an evolutionary
    recurrent self organizing deep learning model ERSOM. This model is implemented
    on the DSP of a Wireless Node Card. Our adopted approach is based on the Delta-Hybridization
    between WSN wireless sensor nodes, Block-chain and a Deep learning classifier
    ERSOM model to overcome some limitations and challenges experienced by traditional
    techniques. The practical application of this method for detecting agricultural
    defects demonstrates its resilience in analyzing these issues and making real-time
    decisions, showcasing promising results in comparison to current techniques. However,
    there are additional paths for further advancement in the future. Data Availability

  description: The agricultural sector plays an important role in contributing significantly
    to the gross domestic product (GDP) growth in developing countries. On the other
    hand, agriculture is widely affected by major factors such as environmental changes,
    natural disasters, pesticide control, and soil and irrigation-related issues,
    which reduce crop yield. The convergence of Industry 4.0 and agriculture offers
    an opportunity to move into the next generation of Agriculture 4.0. The internet
    of things (IoT), remote sensing, machine learning, deep learning, big data, cloud
    computing, thermal imaging, end-user apps and unmanned aerial vehicles offer a
    full-stack solution. IoT provides the ubiquitous connectivity of smart devices
    to the internet to collect, process and analyse a large amount of agriculture
    field data more quickly and synthesize them to make smart decisions using various
    machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This study reviews the challenges
    and major issues in the IoT agriculture domain and explores its emergence with
    new technologies. It covers the existing literature and illustrates how IoT applicationbased
    precision agriculture solutions have contributed. A case study on weed detection
    for smart agriculture using the YOLOv5 model is presented, achieving high accuracy.
    Finally, various IoT agriculture use cases are discussed, along with current research
    issues and possible solutions for future IoT-based agriculture advancement.

    smart agriculture emerges as a vital solution by integrating advanced technologies
    to optimize agricultural practices. Through data-driven insights and automation,
    it tackles the necessity for sustainable resource management, enhancing productivity
    and resilience in the face of complex food security and ecological concerns. The
    prospects of utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) for smart agriculture are

    of the proposed approach in minimizing the total network energy consumption and
    achieving AoI values less than 200:msec to support demanding real-time applications.

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Smart farming in the contemporary
    world has gained paramount importance while playing a pivotal role in revolutionizing
    agricultural practices [1]. Conversely, the increasing global population along
    with environmental challenges have made the adoption of smart farming techniques
    indispensable. By leveraging data-driven insights, automation, and precision agriculture,
    smart farming not only enhances productivity but also addresses the pressing need
    for sustainable resource management [2]. On the other hand, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) has been a promising technology to provide connection among a large volume
    of devices that are deployed to provide a specific service for smart agriculture.
    A wide range of different use cases such as smart greenhouse monitoring, pest
    control, and irrigation/soil management can be considered [1], [3]. These use
    cases are mostly computation intensive and delay-sensitive [1], [4], [5]. A large
    volume of connected devices implies a large volume of data that must be processed
    accurately in a timely manner [6]. Such data computation and analysis demands
    a significant amount of processing and storage resources which put a constraint
    on energy-limited IoT devices. Depending on the specific application, the aggregated
    data from monitoring sensors, and captured images/videos from installed cameras
    in the field need to be processed in real-time to turn raw data into usable information.
    Introducing IoT and its applications in modern agriculture provides this industry
    with suitable tools to support farmers for better productivity, quality, and profitability
    [1]. Therefore, the scope of IoT extends beyond just agricultural land, encompassing
    a broader spectrum that includes the supply chain as well [7], [8]. Battery-operated
    IoT devices lack the capability to perform energy-intensive computations independently.
    Additionally, they face challenges related to limited processing power and storage
    capacity [9]. Therefore, MEC is proposed as a promising technology to address
    these limitations by offering additional computation and storage resources for
    IoT systems. This is achieved by providing servers where IoT devices can offload
    their computation tasks [10], [11]. On the other hand, large-scale agricultural
    operations often involve the distribution of IoT devices across expansive areas.
    In such scenarios, challenges may emerge concerning communication, particularly
    with issues related to the limited reachability between IoT devices and MEC infrastructure.
    To address these challenges, a proposed solution involves the integration of a
    network comprising unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance the capabilities
    of MEC [12], [13]. This approach aims to mitigate communication limitations stemming
    from the constrained transmission power of IoT devices and simultaneously improve
    network coverage. Due to the easy-to-deploy, cost-effective, and strong capabilities
    of the UAVs, UAV-aided MEC has attracted much attention and is widely utilized
    in smart agriculture to provide a high-quality line-of-sight (LoS) link to IoT
    devices [1], [3], [5], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The versatility and mobility exhibited
    by UAVs in response to changing weather conditions, alongside their straightforward
    deployment and economically viable maintenance costs, collectively establish UAVs
    as a proficient solution for supplying IoT devices with the necessary resources.
    Nevertheless, the UAVs themselves are quite often battery-powered which means
    their available energy is limited [6]. 1) Age of Information Besides energy, the
    freshness of information is another important aspect that needs to be considered
    in environmental monitoring and smart agriculture applications in which rapid
    protective and/or recovery actions are needed. Being more specific, within the
    realm of environmental monitoring applications and precision farming [18] in a
    UAV-aided MEC network, the IoT devices are strategically dispersed throughout
    specified regions to seamlessly gather real-time environmental data. Then the
    collected and pre-processed data by the UAVs finds its transmission route toward
    a localized MEC server; where a comprehensive analysis is conducted to facilitate
    the extraction of pertinent insights. These insights, in turn, play a pivotal
    role in fostering prompt agricultural decision-making and actions. The objectives
    can be the refinement of operations, the performance optimization, or the reduction
    of expenditure [1], [14], [19]. This expansion of smart agriculture’s scope ensures
    a secure and sustainable food supply chain, underpinned by contextual and situational
    awareness derived from real-time event processing [20]. Accordingly, such applications
    are characterized by their intensive computational demands and time-sensitive
    nature [1], [3], [5], [14], [18]. Concisely, the freshness of information becomes
    a critical factor that demands careful consideration. Packet delay and inter-delivery
    times, as two exemplary metrics that are commonly used to quantify the performance
    of real-time applications, are not adequate to represent the freshness of information
    received at the destination. Recently, age of information (AoI) has been proposed
    as a novel criterion to quantitatively evaluate the freshness of information [6],
    [17], [21]. For a flow of data packets, and with emphasis on the freshness of
    data at the destination, AoI is defined as the time elapsed from receiving the
    most recent packet belonging to that data-packet flow [22], [23]. 2) Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV) From the above discussion, in the context of UAV-enabled
    smart agriculture paradigm – which constitutes the focal point of this paper –
    UAVs are confronted with a substantial amount of data necessitating prompt processing.
    This scenario embodies a dynamic computational framework wherein a bunch of processing
    functions demands seamless implementation across both the UAVs and the local server
    [20], [24], [25]. NFV is a key technology for implementing and managing computing
    machines in a reliable, efficient, and robust manner [26]. The NFV virtualizes
    the network functions (NFs) and abstracts them from the physical hardware, which
    enables rapid service function chaining (SFC) and service provisioning in UAV-aided
    MEC applications [27]. Considering the data-intensive and computation-based application
    of smart agriculture, multiple computing functions in the form of virtual network
    functions (VNF) should be deployed sequentially and orderly to provide the processed
    data for the final decision-making at the local MEC-server. Utilizing NFV significantly
    enhances the agility in deploying and managing network components and improves
    the robustness and scalability of networks [27], [28]. Therefore, a critical challenge
    to address is the optimal and efficient placement of Virtual Network Functions
    (VNFs) and determining how to route information packets among VNF components over
    the available NFV infrastructure, i.e., UAVs and the MEC server. The decision
    to distribute and allocate VNFs between both UAVs and the server, rather than
    solely on one of them, aligns with the primary goal of the proposed scheme—to
    minimize the Age of Information (AoI) while maintaining energy efficiency. Network
    traffic and the workload on both UAVs and MEC servers fluctuate over time, while
    changing channel conditions between the parties necessitate adjustments in the
    required communication resources for packet forwarding. Furthermore, certain processing
    functions, such as compression, may alter the packet size, so the trade-off of
    performing these functions locally and sending the smaller packets with spending
    fewer communication resources versus doing the entire processing locally becomes
    pivotal. Consequently, the placement must dynamically adjust to new conditions
    to ensure the minimization of AoI and energy efficiency [28]. In light of this,
    a general condition has been considered where the VNFO can, depending on network
    conditions (processing node resources, service type, and channel conditions),
    decide on the optimal placement to minimize AoI and energy consumption. The work
    presented in [24] is a use-case of the practical implementation of smart agriculture
    in real-world contexts; where, the authors leverage a confluence of cloud computing,
    edge computing, and NFV technology to conceive a comprehensive framework tailored
    to the essential demands of soilless precision farming practiced within a fully-recirculating
    greenhouse [24]. 3) Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) The VNF placement and
    scheduling in our network settings can be expressed as integer programming with
    some constraints that reflect the service requirements and the network infrastructure’s
    restrictions. Nevertheless, this problem is NP-complete and there is no standard
    solver that can solve such problems in polynomial time [29], especially for large-scale
    networks where the required computation to find the optimal solution increases
    exponentially. Recently, machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligent
    (AI) based solutions appear as a viable way to solve such complex problems in
    polynomial time [17], [29], [30]. Since its inception in 2017 [31], Federated
    Learning (FL) has reshaped many emerging intelligent IoT systems toward advanced
    FL architecture. The distributed nature of FL, where some agents cooperatively
    train a global ML model without directly sharing the local data, makes FL an attractive
    alternative to traditional centralized ML schemes. To be more specific, FL by
    pushing intelligent ML functions to the network edge enhances the privacy and
    scalability of IoT applications and networks [30]. In this paper, our focus is
    on use cases in smart agriculture that require live streaming and analysis, such
    as surveillance and environmental monitoring. Specifically, we address the flexible
    dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs within the context of delay-sensitive
    services. The approach involves distributing VNFs across processing nodes, utilizing
    UAVs and local MEC server in a UAV-aided MEC network. The objective is to perform
    SFC while ensuring the freshness of information by jointly minimizing AoI and
    total energy consumption throughout the network. Condensing the system model and
    the definition of the problem, we present the following key insights: In the realm
    of smart agriculture applications, real-time information is collected by IoT devices
    on a smart farm and transmitted through hovering UAVs to the local server. VNFs
    must be executed sequentially on the raw packets, as they represent split functionalities
    of a single processing job. Meanwhile, certain VNFs, such as compression, may
    potentially alter packet sizes. Various service types are assumed, each with its
    specific VNF chain. The challenge involves determining the optimal placement and
    scheduling of VNF chains on processing nodes (UAVs and the local server), accounting
    for processing time, transmission delay, and power consumption (both transmit
    and processing power) in a distributed manner. We will demonstrate analytically
    that the problem: Exhibits circular symmetry, wherein the optimal policies of
    the agents (UAVs) are identical. The local observations of the agents serve as
    sufficient statistics for determining the optimal policy, We will show how these
    two features will simplify the problem significantly. Subsequently, we present
    a novel solution for solving the modeled problem. The main contributions of our
    paper are summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge this is the first
    time that the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop
    UAV-aided MEC network for smart agriculture is considered, while the problem is
    formulated as a joint AoI and Energy minimization. We formulate this joint optimization
    problem as a decentralized partially observable MDP (DEC-POMDP), where the parties
    are not aware of the true state and just make decisions based on their local observations.
    We adopted the structural feature of the problem and have analytically shown that
    under the satisfaction of certain symmetry conditions, the local observation of
    the parties (agents) would be a sufficient statistic for determining the optimal
    solution. As the formulated problem is NP-complete, we proposed a novel FL-based
    algorithm called Asynchronous FL Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) in which a set of distributed
    parties learn in parallel and aggregate their own experience through a coordinator.
    A Multi-hop network is considered, where the UAVs can offload their computing
    tasks to the other UAVs as well as the local MEC server. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows: In Section II some state-of-the-art studies will be reviewed.
    Section III describes the system model and the main components of the system in
    detail. Section IV presents the problem definition and formulation. In Section
    V, the problem is expressed as a DEC-POMDP, and some analytical results are given
    that support our proposed FL-based solution presented in Section VI. The complexity
    analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented in Section VII. The effectiveness
    and performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in Section VIII. Finally,
    Section IX concludes the paper. SECTION II. Related Works In this section, we
    review some state-of-the-art studies on AoI and energy-aware UAV-aided MEC for
    smart agriculture. The prospects of using UAVs for smart agriculture are immense.
    Moreover, UAVs are easy to deploy and cost-effective which motivates their use
    in smart agriculture [1], [6], [32]. For a comprehensive survey on IoT-based smart
    agriculture and the emerging technologies mentioned in the previous section refer
    to [1]. In [13], Mozaffari et al. have considered the reliable design of IoT’s
    uplink communication in a scenario in which multiple UAVs are deployed to collect
    data from ground IoT devices. In particular, a framework for jointly optimizing
    the trajectory of the UAVs, IoT-to-UAV association, and IoT’s uplink power is
    proposed with the aim of minimizing the total energy consumption and mobility
    of the UAVs. However, in the formulated problem, the delay of the forwarded data
    across the UAV network is not considered. Nguyen et al. [5] have considered this
    issue as the problem of processing deadline-critical tasks which are fed to a
    network of hovering UAVs that support the IoT devices deployed in a smart farm.
    It is assumed that the smart farm is equipped with a multi-access MEC infrastructure.
    In such a circumstance, the energy-efficient monitoring problem is modeled as
    a multi-objective maximization problem which aims to maximize the number of tasks
    that are successfully processed before their deadline. Then, a Q-Learning-based
    solution is proposed to solve the problem. The same authors in [5] have extended
    their proposed scheme to a DQN-based solution [33] and to a multi-actor-based
    risk-sensitive RL approach [32]. Although, the goal of the aforementioned studies
    is to minimize the energy consumption in the network, however, the proposed solutions
    are basically centralized and the communication overhead of the centralized approaches
    is itself a source of energy waste. The AoI as a metric for determining the freshness
    of information has been used in some recent works On UAV-aided IoT networks [6],
    [17], [23], [34], [35]. Buyukates and Ulukus [34] examined a status update system
    where update packets require processing to extract embedded useful information.
    The source node sends information to a computation unit (CU) with a master node
    and worker nodes. The master node assigns tasks, aggregates results, and sends
    them back to the source node for updating. The analysis focuses on the age performance
    of various schemes in the presence of stragglers, considering i.i.d. exponential
    transmission delays and i.i.d. shifted exponential computation times. Then, the
    best scheme that minimizes the average age is presented. In [35], the authors
    analyzed the average age of information (AoI) and average peak AoI (PAoI) in a
    multiuser Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system. The system considers three computing
    schemes: local computing, edge computing, and partial computing (where the computational
    tasks are partially performed at the edge and the remaining is performed by the
    local server). To address the complexity, upper and lower bounds on average AoI
    are provided, enabling an examination of optimal offloading decisions based on
    MEC system parameters. In [6], Han et al. modeled a UAV-aided IoT network using
    a Markov chain. The freshness of data packets is defined using AoI and they analyzed
    the IoT devices as first-come-first-served (FCFS) model and M/M/1 queue. Sun et
    al. [17], employed AoI to propose an AoI-energy-aware data collection scheme for
    IoT networks in which the UAVs are used to collect data. Here, AoI is used to
    quantify the temporal correlation among data packets. Then, an algorithm for determining
    the UAV’s flight speed, hovering locations, and allocated bandwidth to IoT devices
    is proposed that jointly minimizes energy consumption and the weighted sum of
    expected average AoI in the network. In [23], a UAV-aided wireless powered IoT
    scheme is proposed, where a UAV flies from a data center toward IoT sensory nodes
    to transfer energy and collect their information and then it returns back to the
    data center. The goal is to minimize the average AoI of the collected data from
    sensor modes. For such circumstances, an optimization problem is formulated, and
    then a suboptimal method is proposed that first decomposes the problem into two
    subproblems. The solution to the first subproblem is the input for the second
    subproblem. It is worth mentioning that the AoI is basically an end-to-end metric;
    Hence, even though the aforementioned works try to minimize the AoI, for the use
    cases in smart agriculture that the captured data needs some live processing before
    being turned into useful information, these approaches are not effective as they
    just consider the problem of finding the best data flow path. In the context of
    UAV-aided MEC for IoT networks, each service can be represented as a service function
    chain (SFC) consisting of ordered processing functions in the form of VNFs that
    can be geographically placed on to local MEC-server or the UAVs. However, in a
    network with numerous IoT devices and dynamic network load, the placement of VNF
    instances and routing among them in an optimal and efficient manner is a challenging
    problem [27], [28]. In the literature, this problem is referred to as the SFC
    dynamic orchestration problem (SFC-DOP) [27]. In [27], Liu et al. presented a
    DRL-based framework for dynamic SFC orchestration in IoT networks. Huang et al.
    in [36] dealt with the problem of scalability and flexibility of static orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs. Then, a FL-based SFC orchestration is proposed which is scalable
    and benefits from low communication cost. Table 1 presents an overview of the
    previously mentioned studies, emphasizing the main topics they concentrated on.
    Although, in the literature, the UAV-aided MEC architecture is mainly proposed
    as a technique to compensate for the energy and computational limitations of IoT
    networks, however, existing solutions for NFV-enabled SFC require IoT nodes to
    exchange large volumes of local data with a centralized server or among the distributed
    agents. Considering the energy limitation of IoT devices and battery-powered UAVs,
    this significantly causes waste of the network energy. In this paper, we deal
    with this inconsistency and propose a novel FL-based solution for the dynamic
    orchestration of SFCs in a multi-hop and UAV-aided MEC network. To the best of
    our knowledge, this is the first time that the problem of dynamic orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop UAV-aided MEC network is considered. What makes
    our approach unique is the adoption of the inherent structural aspects of the
    problem, typical in most scenarios, to introduce a decentralized solution that
    is analytically demonstrated to be valid. The proposed method is asynchronous
    FL-based, enabling distributed parties to independently learn locally and subsequently
    contribute to the training of the global model asynchronously [38], [39]. In other
    words, the parties are allowed to directly share gradients with the coordinator
    (here, the MEC server) after every local update and asynchronous of the other
    parties. This further enhances the training speed and efficiency of our proposed
    approach [39]. The coordinator in turn can perform the aggregation and update
    the global model whenever an update from one of the distributed parties is received.
    This approach improves the whole system’s scalability and alleviates the straggler
    impact, i.e., users who may have slower performance [38]. TABLE 1 Summary of Related

    We consider a real-time IoT network for smart agriculture applications, where,
    the IoT network provides real-time monitoring and visibility to network operators
    by video/image streaming. For such circumstances, several use cases from remote
    monitoring to security can be considered. As it is depicted in Fig. 1, a set N
    of N IoT devices collect real-time information from a smart farm and send the
    packets to a local server. A UAV-aided MEC architecture is considered, where packets
    are forwarded through an Aerial Network consisting of U hovering UAVs toward the
    local server. We consider applications in which some processing functions, from
    primary processes (e.g., compression) to advanced ones (e.g., object recognition)
    must be sequentially performed on the raw packets. Each IoT device is associated
    with one of the UAVs in its range. U denote the set of all U UAVs in the network.
    The local server is indeed a MEC-server1 denoted by M . A set S={ S k } K k=1
    with |S|=K different service types is assumed. Each service type S k itself consists
    of a set F k ={ F k f } F k f=1 including F k different processing functions that
    should be performed on the packets of that service and F denotes a set of all
    processing functions of all services, F= ⋃ k∈S ( F k ) . The input and output
    packet sizes of the function f of service type k are ρ k f and ϱ k f , respectively.
    FIGURE 1. System model. Show All Let s k n ∈{0,1} denote the service type k∈S
    in IoT node n∈N is active, s k n =1 , or not, s k n =0 . In each IoT node one
    of the K different services is running, ∑ k∈S s k n =1,∀n∈N . To perform the processing
    functions, the MEC-server M and each UAV u is able to run F= ∑ k∈S F k different
    VNF types on their physical computing machine.2 The proposed architecture is based
    on ETSI-NFV standard [40] which is a globally accepted architecture for implementing
    the NFV. According to ETSI-NFV, in each physical machine (processing node) p∈U∪M
    (All U UAVs and the local server M), the VNF manager (VNFM) is responsible to
    manage its computing and storage resources among the VNFs it hosts. The total
    available resources at processing node p is indicated by C p , the computing capacity
    in Hz, and B p , the memory capacity in Byte. The VNF orchestrator (VNFO), hosted
    by the local server, places and schedules the chain of VNFs through Aerial Domain
    and Local (MEC) Server. For a summary of the key symbols and variables used in
    the system model and problem formulation, refer to Table 2. TABLE 2 Key Symbols
    and Variables B. VNF Placement and Scheduling We consider a discrete-time system
    with two hierarchical timing levels. First, the time is divided into equal time
    slots TS with duration T indexed by t=1,2,… . On top of that, we have the VNF-scheduling
    time slots t ~ with duration T ˜ that is multiples of T , and it is a single round
    of VNF placement and scheduling update. At the beginning of each time slot t ~
    , the VNFO updates the VNF placements. Each UAV u segregates data packets from
    IoT nodes sharing the same service type, say k , into a packet-flow Υ k u (t)
    , which it then transmits across the aerial network to the local server. The set
    F k ={ V fk } F k f=1 of F k different VNFs (processing functions) must be performed
    on data packets of the IoT nodes with service type k . At the beginning of each
    VNFO-level time slot t ~ , the VNFO determines the set of processing nodes Δ k
    u ( t ~ ) that participate in serving the k th service packet-flow Υ k u (t) of
    UAV u at t th TS. Each selected processing node p∈U∪M that belongs to Δ k u (
    t ~ ) performs a subset B k up ( t ~ ) of all functions F k that is supposed to
    be performed on the packet flow of service type k belongs to UAV u : B k up (
    t ~ )={ F k f  :  f ˙ k up ≤f≤ f ¨ k up }, B k up ( t ~ )⊆ F k , (1) View Source
    where f ˙ k up (S) and f ¨ k up (E) are the first and the last function (VNF)
    that p performs on the packet flow of service type k of UAV u . In summary, for
    each packet-flow Υ k u (t) , the VNFO selects and schedules the processing nodes
    that handle F k . These nodes can be each one of any other UAVs (intra-domain
    offloading) or local server (inter-domain offloading). Remark 1:Let P to−do p
    ( t ~ )={(u,k,f) : f∈ F k u is running on p} indicate a set of all assigned VNFs
    to the processing node p∈U∪M . We assume all assigned VNFs P to−do p ( t ~ ) to
    processing node p should be finished in a single round of VNF scheduling t ~ .
    Fig. 2 provides a comprehensive representation of crucial elements related to
    the proposed orchestration solution and the communication dynamics within the
    network. Operating at two distinct timing levels, the figure elucidates: 1) The
    VNFO timing (Tier 1), emphasizing interactions pivotal for establishing the proposed
    orchestration solution, and 2) the network-wide communication (Tier 2), encompassing
    all entities within the network. FIGURE 2. Network-wide timing model. Show All
    The upper segment of the figure illustrates how UAV 1 manages received packet
    flows from IoT nodes, accommodating two distinct service types. Following the
    assumed VNFO policy in a single round of VNF placement and scheduling, it is evident
    that for packets of service type 1, UAV1 processes them and subsequently forwards
    them to UAV3. UAV3, after performing the assigned VNFs, then forwards the packets
    to the local server, i.e., the final destination. Conversely, for packets of service
    type 2, UAV1 initiates some initial processing and then directly forwards them
    to the local server, where all remaining VNFs are executed. The lower section
    of the figure is dedicated to illustrating VNFO level operation, depicting control
    packets exchanged between the local server and agents for the training of the
    VNFO model. Further clarification on this VNFO communication is postponed to subsequent
    sections within the article. C. Communication (Access) Network There are three
    communication links among the network nodes: the wireless links between IoT nodes
    and an aerial network consisting of UAVs, the UAV-to-UAV wireless links, and the
    wireless link between the UAVs and the local terrestrial server. Let random process
    g nu (t)∈C denote the channel loss between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U , then the
    achievable bit rate of node n in up-link direction at time instant t will be R
    nu (t)= w n log 2 (1+ p nu | g nu (t)| σ 2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U , where w n and σ 2 denote
    the channel bandwidth of IoT device n and the noise variance, respectively, and
    p nu is the transmission power level. The channel between IoT nodes and UAVs and
    between UAVs and the local server can be modeled as an air-to-ground channel model
    [41]. According to this model, the path loss, g nu can be calculated as [37],
    g nu (t)= ( 4πf c ) 2 d 2 (t) η e , (2) View Source where f , c , and d are frequency
    of operation, speed of light, and distance between the transmitter and receiver,
    respectively; and η e is the average of excessive path loss in two cases of existing
    a LoS path, η LoS e , and non-LoS case, η nLoS e , η e = p LoS × η LoS e +(1−
    p LoS )× η nLoS e , (3) View Source where p LoS is the probability that a LoS
    path exists and can be closely approximated as [37], p LoS = 1 1+aexp−b(ψ−a) ,
    (4) View Source where, a and b are environment-related parameters. Similarly,
    in the downlink direction, the achievable bit rate of the link between UAV u∈U
    and MEC server M at time instant t will be R uM (t)= w uM log 2 (1+ p uM | g uM
    (t)| σ 2 ),∀u∈U , where w uM denotes the channel bandwidth, σ 2 is the noise variance,
    p uM is the transmission power level, and random process g uM (t)∈C denotes the
    channel Loss at time t . Finally, the UAV-to-UAV wireless channel also follows
    the same mathematical model, however, the only difference is that the probability
    of existing LoS is equal to 1, p LoS =1 . For each UAV u and service type k ,
    τ k u (t) is defined as the expectation value of IoT access network delay with
    respect to transmission rate R nu (t) , τ k u (t)= E R nu [ τ k nu (t)], τ k nu
    (t)= D nu /C+ Λ k nu / R nu (t), (5) View Source where, E R nu denotes the expectation
    with respect to R nu , D nu is distance between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U and Λ
    k nu is the packet length of service type S k ∈S . For the aerial radio links,
    Let random process g u u ´ (t)∈C denote the channel power gain between UAV u∈U
    and UAV (or local server M) u ´ ∈U∪M , then the achievable bit rate of the link
    at time instant t will be R u u ´ = w u u ´ log 2 (1+ p u u ´ | g u u ´ (t)| σ
    2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U∪M , where w u u ´ denote the channel bandwidth between UAV u , and
    UAV (or local server) u ´ , σ 2 is the noise variance, and p u u ´ is the transmission
    power level. In the following sections, we will focus on the VNFO’s functionality,
    and resource allocation of the radio access part is beyond the scope of this paper;
    hence, without loss of generality, we assume a fixed power and bandwidth allocated
    to all the participating nodes. SECTION IV. Problem Formulation Let χ fk pu (
    t ~ )∈{0,1} denote whether the processing node p at time slot t is selected to
    run VNF function f on the packet of the k th service type of UAV u : χ fk pu (
    t ~ )= { 1, 0, if p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ )andf∈ B k pu ( t ~ ) otherwise ∀k∈S,u∈U. (6)
    View Source For each service type k∈S of UAV u , only one of the processing nodes
    (UAVs or MEC-server) must be selected for serving each function f∈ F k : ∑ p∈U∪M
    χ fk pu ( t ~ )=1,∀f∈ F k , ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t ~ )=0,∀f∄ F k . (7) View Source
    The relation (7), both left and right expressions together, implies that the packets
    belonging to the service packet-flows travel a loop-free route. Each packet belongs
    to packet-flow Υ k u (t) needs a specific computational capacity c fk in CPU cycle.
    Assuming that all the processing capacity of processing node p in a single time
    slot with duration T ˜ is C p T ˜ , to be assured that the computing capacity
    of the selected processing node is enough to serve the assigned VNFs and the scheduler
    does not exceed the processing node’s budget, the following condition at each
    VNF-scheduling time slot t ~ should be satisfied: ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do
    p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) c fk ≤ C p T ˜ ,∀p∈U∪M. (8) View Source The same condition also
    needs to be fulfilled regarding the storage capacity requirement b fk (in Bytes):
    ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) b fk ≤ B p ,∀p∈U∪M (9) View Source
    where B p is the total amount of available storage capacity of the processing
    node p . A. Age of Information In order to quantify the freshness of the received
    packet at the destination, the AoI metric is adopted. As soon as an IoT node has
    a packet to send, it connects to its serving UAV and sends packets.3 For each
    packet flow of service type k that UAV u∈U receives directly from the IoT nodes
    that are connected to it and running this service type, the arrival time t k u
    is defined as the time elapsed from the beginning of the time slot t in which
    any packet has arrived in. Let Θ k u (t) denote the AoI of the packet-flow of
    service type k in UAV u , it can be calculated as, Θ k u (t)={ τ k u +T− t k u
    , Θ k u (t−1)+T, if  α k u (t)=1 if  α k u (t)=0 ∀k∈S,u∈U (10) View Source where
    binary variable α k u (t)∈{0,1} indicates whether any new packet of service flow
    k at TS t is received, α k u (t)=1 , or not, α k u (t)=0 . By definition, for
    every time slot t in which the UAV does not receive a new packet from a service
    packet flow, the AoI of that service packet flow increases by T . On each received
    packet from IoT node n with service type k , the set F n k of VNFs (processing
    functions) should be performed. As stated above, the VNFO determines the set of
    processing nodes p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) that participate in performing the VNFs on packet-flow
    Υ k u (t) by performing the set B k up ( t ~ ) of VNFs. B k up ( t ~ )=∅ means
    p hosts none of the required VNFs of Υ k u (t) . Let Δ k u ( t ~ )={ p 1 , p 2
    ,…, p L } denote the sequence of all UAVs that are already selected to sequentially
    do the chain of VNFs on the received packets of service type k . The processing
    time of every packet of this flow will be, Φ k u (t)= ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) ⎛
    ⎝ ⎜ ⌈ τ fk p v−i p v (t) T ⌉T+ ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v ( t ~ ) (⌈ θ k ϑ T ⌉T ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ), ∀k∈S,u∈U
    τ fk p v−i p v (t)= D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i p v (t) F k
    f = f ¨ k u p v−i , (11) View Source where θ k ϑ is the run time of ϑ th VNF for
    service type k , Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) is the packet length of service type S
    k ∈S after doing the last VNF f ¨ k u p v−1 of the chain in p v−1 , and, Assuming
    that the queueing delay is negligible, τ fk p v−1 p v is total transmission delay
    between p v−1 and p v consists of propagation delay and transmission delay. If
    the binary variable β k u ( t ~ )∈{0,1} indicates whether the VNF scheduling (at
    VNF-scheduling time slots t ~ ) for the flow of packets belong to service type
    k of UAV u was successful, then, the AoI at the Local server will be, Π k u (t)={
    Θ k u (t)+ Φ k u (t), Π k u (t−1)+ T ˜ , if  β k u ( t ~ )=1 if β k u ( t ~ )=0
    ∀k∈S,u∈U. (12) View Source Note that T ˜ is the duration of a single round of
    VNF placement and scheduling. B. Energy Consumption The energy consumption of
    the network in the uplink direction can be calculated as, P UL (t)= ∑ n∈N ∑ k∈S
    ∑ u∈U s k n p nu Λ k nu / R nu (t), (13) View Source where Λ k nu / R nu (t) is
    the transmission time between IoT node n , with service type k , and UAV u at
    TS t . The other energy-consuming part of the access network is transmission among
    the processing nodes. If we represent the energy consumption in the aerial domain
    (including UAV-to-UAV and UAV-to-MEC links) at TS t with P Aerial (t) , then it
    will be as, P Aerial (t)= τ fk p v−i p v (t)= F k f = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k
    u p p v−i p v τ fk p v−i p v (t), D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i
    p v (t), f ¨ k u p v−i , (14) View Source where Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) , f ¨ k
    u p v−1 and τ fk p v−1 p v are defined like (11). Finally, if Ψ k ϑ denotes the
    power each machine, that hosts the ϑ th VNF of service type k , consumes to run
    this VNF on each packet of this service type, then, the total network-wide required
    energy for performing the VNFs across a single packet of all service type can
    be calculated as follows: P NFV = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v Ψ k
    ϑ θ k ϑ . (15) View Source In a single term, P NFV represents the energy consumption
    resulting from VNFs processing. Using (13)–(15), the total energy consumption
    of the network to process a single packet across all the service types belonging
    to all UAVs would be, P Total (t)= P UL (t)+ P Aerial (t)+ P NFV . (16) View Source
    The UAVs use a battery, hence their available energy to do the processes and perform
    the required communications is limited. Therefore, we need an energy-efficient
    VNFO solution with minimum communication overhead. A centralized ML method will
    be optimal, but it requires a large communication transaction to share the local
    observation with the central controller. Another drawback of adopting centralized
    architecture is that the centralized coordinator is not scalable and from the
    processing and communication viewpoint is a single point of failure. Therefore,
    in this paper, we deal with proposing a solution for the following problem of
    distributed NFV orchestration through the UAVs as distributed VNFO agents. Problem
    1 (Distributed VNFO for Joint AoI and Energy Minimization):Considering the service
    requirements of IoT nodes, UAVs/MEC-server available resources, and the condition
    of access networks, what is the optimal strategy of VNF placement and scheduling
    in each UAV to jointly minimize the average AoI and total energy consumption at
    the Local Server: Minimize χ fk pu ( t ~ ) s.t. γ AoI [ 1 UK ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S Π k u
    (t)]+ γ E P total (t), ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t ~ )=1,∀f∈ F k , ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t
    ~ )=0,∀f∄ F k , ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) c fk ≤ C p T,
    ∀p∈U∪M, ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) b fk ≤ B p , ∀p∈U∪M.
    (17) View Source In each VNFO-level time slot T ˜ the orchestrator sequentially
    decides on the chain of VNFs of the service flows belonging to UAVs. For a class
    of stochastic sequential decision-making problems, the Markov Decision Process
    (MDP) has been a powerful framework for the mathematical formulation and study
    of this type of problems. Another point that is worth mentioning is that our proposed
    method in Section VI is FL-based where the UAVs follow the same model trained
    cooperatively. Therefore, minimizing the average AoI over UAVs or minimizing the
    maximum value of AoI over UAVs are basically the same. Depending on the environment
    state, the MDP output will be the best action (or at least the best upon the history
    of the observations and actions) which maximizes a specific utility function [42].
    For the case that the state is not fully observable to the deciding agent or the
    agent’s observations are exposed to noise or some source (sort) of uncertainties,
    another extended class of decision-making processes called Partially Observable
    MDP (POMDP) is adopted [43]. Both MDP and POMDP in their original scope are defined
    centralized [42], [43]. Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) is the extended
    version of POMDP in which a set of distributed agents are involved in the decision-making
    process [44], [45]. By definition, if every agent has the same individual reward
    function, the POSG model becomes the Decentralized POMDP (DEC-POMDP) [45]. In
    the following two sections, first, we show how the problem can be modeled as a
    DEC-POMDP and then we will present our proposed method to solve the developed
    DEC-POMDP. SECTION V. DEC-POMDP Formulation In a multi-agent MDP with state uncertainty,
    a DEC-POMDP is formally defined as a tuple with the following definition. Definition
    1 (DEC-POMDP Model):DEC-POMDP G with a set U of U agents is defined as a tuple
    G=⟨U,S, b 0 ,A,O,T,O,R⟩ , where S is the finite set of global environment states,
    b 0 is the probability of the environment initially being in state s∈S , A= ∏
    u∈U A u is the joint action of all agents, where A u is the set of actions available
    to agent u , O= ∏ u∈U O u is joint observation, where O u is the observations
    available to agent u , T is the transition function T :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×S→[0,1]
    , where T( s ´ |s,A(s)) is defined as the transition probability from state s
    to s ´ by doing joint action A(s) , O is the observation function O :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×O→[0,1]
    , where O(O|s,A(s)) is defined as the joint observation at state s by doing joint
    action A(s) , R={ r u } U−1 u=0 is a set of reward functions r u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))→R
    , where r u (s,A(s)) is defined as the reward received by u when A(s) is executed
    at the global state s . In a DEC-POMDP, each agent u∈U based on its local observation
    o u ∈ O u and a local policy π u performs an independent action a u ∈ A u . In
    each partially observable state s , the joint action A(s)= ∏ u∈U a u (s) from
    the joint policy P= ∏ u∈U π u determines the next global state s ´ and joint observations
    O according to transition and observation probability of T( s ´ |s,A(s)) and O(O|s,A(s))
    , respectively. According to Problem 1, our purpose is to find the best choice
    for the sets Δ k u (t) of processing nodes p and B k up (t) of the VNF chains
    for serving packet-flow Υ k u (t) of any service type k∈S of UAVs u∈U in a distributed
    manner. Remark 2 (Source of Uncertainties):We have considered a multi-hop network
    architecture, as depicted in Fig. 3, in which, 1) each agent u is not aware of
    the other agents’ observation o −u  (−u refers to all the agents except u , o
    −u = ∏ u ´ ≠u o u ´ ) , nor the action a −u ,4 2) each agent observes the result
    of doing its own action and the actions of the other agents, while it is not aware
    of the global state nor the action of the other agents. Therefore, according to
    Definition 1, it can be inferred that Problem 1 in its decentralized form is a
    DEC-POMDP. FIGURE 3. System model as a DEC-POMDP. Show All In DEC-POMDP, each
    agent based on its actions and observations creates a local database that in time
    t can be represented as h u ( t ~ )={ a u ( t ~ −1), o u ( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1
    ,∀u∈U , where a u ( t ~ −1) and o u ( t ~ ) are the action of u at time slot t
    ~ −1 and its corresponding observation at t ~ . All the information is available
    to all the U agents at time t ~ defines as the joint history H( t ~ )= ∏ u∈U h
    u ( t ~ )={A( t ~ −1),O( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1 . The POMDP state is hidden from the
    agents. Hence, the agents would not be able to choose their actions based on knowing
    the true state. The standard approach for dealing with POMDPs is to find a solution
    to the fully observable equivalent belief-MDP [43]. Where, belief B(s, t ~ )=P(s(
    t ~ )=s|H( t ~ ),B(0)),∀s∈S defines as a probability distribution over the state
    space of the original POMDP knowing the joint history H( t ~ ) , i.e., all the
    available information from the sequence of interactions that the agents have had
    until now,where B(0) is the initial value the belief state function. Belief state
    function B(s, t ~ ) is known as sufficient statistic for the history H( t ~ )
    [45]. Upon performing a new interaction at t ~ +1 , the belief value is updated
    from the belief point at time t considering the new interaction {A( t ~ −1),O(
    t ~ )} . Despite the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer
    the action (the policy) of the other agents. This leads to the definition of multi-agent
    belief function [46] with the following definition, b u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s× π −u (s))→[0,1],∀u∈U
    b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=P(s( t ~ )=s, π −u | h u ( t ~ ), b u (0)), π −u = ∏ u ´ ∈U,
    u ´ ≠u π u ´ . (18) View Source As it is evident, the multi-agent belief function
    is defined in a space that is a combination of the hidden global state s and joint
    policy π −u of the other agents. From Bellman expectation equation [47], the action-value
    function Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u ] is the expected return starting from
    state hidden state s , taking action a π u according to policy π u , while the
    other agents follow the joint policy π −u , Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~
    ]= E{ R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u Q π u, t ~ +1 [( s ´ , π −u ), a π u,
    t ~ +1 ]}. (19) View Source where the action-value function decomposed into immediate
    reward plus discounted action-value of the successor state, and γ u is the discount
    factor of agent u . With some mathematical manipulation, (19) can be written as,
    Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]= R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u ∑ (
    o u , o −u )∈O O[ o u , o −u |s,( a π u , a −π −u )] ∑ s ´ ∈S T[ s ´ |s,( a −π
    −u )] × ∑ ( a π u , a −π −u )∈A π u ( a π u | s ´ ) Q π u,t [( s ´ , π −u ( o
    −u )), a ´ π u, t ~ +1 ( o u )]. (20) View Source Using (18), for a given belief
    state function b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) , the action-value function Q π u, t ~ ( b
    u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ ) will be, Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ )= ∑ s∈S ∑ π
    −u b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]. (21) View Source
    For an enough large value of t ~  ( t ~ →∞) , the goal is to find the optimal
    policy π ∗ u among available policies π u which leads to the optimal Q-value (action-value)
    function, Q ∗ u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a u, t ~ )=arg max π Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ ,
    a π u, t ~ ). (22) View Source There is no straightforward solution for the aforementioned
    DEC-POMDP problem. Among decentralized methods, multi-agent solutions also need
    a large volume of communication overhead between the agents to share their local
    observations to converge. FL does not have the communication overhead of the centralized
    techniques and also does not necessitate the agents to share all of the data and
    local observations to converge. Although this specification is for providing privacy,
    in our problem it provides us with the gain of energy efficiency that arises because
    the agents (UAVs) do not need to share all of their observations. A few efforts,
    [45], [48], [49], have been made in the literature to capture and exploit some
    structural specifications of the understudied system (application) to find or
    at least simplify the problem of finding optimal policy (22). One of these works
    is one presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], in which the authors have developed
    a class of POSGs that is characterized by symmetry across players in terms of
    cost and state dynamics. In view of this research, within the APPENDIX, we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP and prove that Problem 1belongs to this class and
    is Circularly Symmetric. This implies that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the
    same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . In essence, this necessitates a distributed solution
    to determine the best policy while ensuring uniformity across all agents. Furthermore,
    in accordance with the circular symmetry characteristic of the problem, in Corollary
    22 we prove that local observations serve as sufficient statistics for each agent
    to ascertain the best policy. Corollary 22 guarantees that the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) serves as a sufficient statistic to determine the optimal policy π
    ∗ for the agents (UAVs). This implies that the information encapsulated in the
    local observations of the individual agents is comprehensive enough to determine
    the optimal policy π ∗ . While this corollary does not suggest a particular method
    for identifying the optimal policy, it is promising and justifies our proposed
    FL-based algorithm in which the agents collaboratively engage in training a globally
    shared model. This approach aligns with the notion that leveraging decentralized
    insights from each agent’s local observations can contribute to the derivation
    of an effective and globally optimal policy because their observations are sufficient
    statistics. Capitalizing on the promising findings in this section, the subsequent
    section introduces our proposed approach to address Problem 1. SECTION VI. Symmetry-aided
    Asynchronous Federated DQN Framework In this section, we introduce our proposed
    Asynchronous Federated Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) algorithm and the components we
    have used in the proposed model as depicted in Fig. 4. In traditional RL, the
    problem is modeled as an MDP consisting of a tuple {s( t ~ ),a( t ~ ),r( t ~ ),s(
    t ~ +1)} . At each decision-making time t ~ , the agent is at state s( t ~ ) and
    takes an action a( t ~ ) based on a policy π that causes a state transition from
    s( t ~ ) to s( t ~ +1) while an immediate reward r( t ~ ) incurred. For our POMDP
    case in which the true state of the network is hidden, the true state s( t ~ )
    is replaced with belief-state b( t ~ ) . Mainly, the RL aims to guide the agent
    to find the best policy π ∗ defined as the best mapping from observation o( t
    ~ ) to action a( t ~ ) that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted future
    rewards R( t ~ )= E π { ∑ ∞ l=t γ (l− t ~ ) r(l)} , where γ∈[0,1] is a discount
    factor indicating how much future rewards is important. For our DEC-POMDP problem,
    this relation maps to (19). FIGURE 4. Block diagram of the proposed Asynchronous
    Federated-DQN (AFDQN). Show All A. Deep Q-Network (DQN) Part To estimate Q-value
    functions (21), deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is deployed, where Q-values
    are predicted using deep neural networks (DNNs) as function approximators. The
    estimated Q -functions are represented by { Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ
    u ( t ~ )) } U−1 u=0 , where the parameter θ u ( t ~ ) represents the weights
    of the agent u ’s neural network (NN). The updated value of θ u ( t ~ ) is used
    to approximate the true values of Q u ( t ~ ) [21], [50]. Let’s define the loss
    function L( θ u ( t ~ )) as the expectation value of the mean squared error of
    the estimated Q-value Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ u ( t ~ )) from the target
    value y( t ~ ) [21], L( θ u ( t ~ ))=E[(y( t ~ )− Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~
    ); θ u ( t ~ )) ) 2 ], (23) View Source where, y( t ~ )= r u ( t ~ )+γ max a u
    ( t ~ +1) Q u ( o u ( t ~ +1), a u ( t ~ +1); θ u ( t ~ )) and a u ( t ~ +1) indicates
    the agent’s action generated by the DNN at t ~ +1 , given the observation o u
    ( t ~ +1) . At each iteration, the deep Q -function approximator is trained to
    learn the best estimate of the Q-function by minimizing the loss function L( θ
    u ( t ~ )) . To improve the stability of the algorithm and cope with samples correlation,
    as depicted in Fig. 4, two novel techniques, namely Fixed Target Network [51]
    and Experience Replay Buffer [52] are deployed, respectively. Utilizing these
    two techniques, the loss function L( θ u ( t ~ )) can be written as L( θ u ( t
    ~ )) = E D [( r u ( t ~ )+γ max a u ( t ~ +1) Q u (b( t ~ +1), a u ( t ~ +1);
    θ ´ u ( t ~ )) − Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ u ( t ~ )) ) 2 ], (24) View
    Source where θ ´ u ( t ~ ) denotes the target network parameters, and the expectation
    E D is taken over the randomly selected mini-batches of samples from the replay
    buffer D . B. Federated Learning Part As it is illustrated in Fig. 4, we have
    two main entities, the set U={0,1,…,U−1} of UAVs that are our distributed agents
    or in FL terminology, the agents, and the coordinator that in our model is local
    server (MEC-server). FL allows the UAVs (agents) to train a shared global model
    parameterized by θ g that is an exact copy of the agents’ local model { θ u }
    u=U−1 u=0 using their own dataset { D u } u=U−1 u=0 , while the original data
    remains in UAVs. After local training, agents share their local model updates
    with the coordinator. The coordinator then aggregates the received updates to
    build the global model θ g . As a result, relying on the distributed data training
    at the agents, the local server is able to enhance the training performance without
    significant communication overhead as it just needs an update of the local model
    parameters, not the agents’ local data. The federated learning procedure of our
    proposed method includes the following key steps. 1) Distributed Local Training
    Primarily, the local server initializes the global model, θ g,0 , and transmit
    it to the agents. Upon receiving θ g,0 , during VNFO time slots t ~ the agents
    interact with environment and train their local model { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0
    using their own data set { D u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 by minimizing a loss function
    { L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) } u=U−1 u=0 , θ ∗ u =arg min π u L u ( θ u (( t ~ ))),∀u∈U.
    (25) View Source Then, the agents upload their local update on { θ u ( t ~ ) }
    u=U−1 u=0 to the coordinator for aggregation. 2) Model Aggregation After collecting
    the agents’ local model updates, the next step is aggregating them into a new
    version of the global model which is performed by the coordinator by solving the
    following optimization problem. Problem 2 (Model Aggregation):Given the local
    model updates { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 of all agents, and knowing the local loss
    functions { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 , what is the optimal strategy for aggregating
    the local model that minimizes the global loss, θ ∗ g , L ∗ g =arg min L g , θ
    g L g ( ∏ u∈U L u ( θ g (( t ~ )))). (26) View Source According to Problem 2,
    θ ∗ g is the optimal value for θ g with having the local updates in hand; and
    L ∗ g is the best function (the best method) for aggregating the local loss function.
    The loss-aggregation function L ∗ g indicates the relative contribution of each
    agent on the global model, however, there is not a fixed method for determining
    this function and it depends mostly on the structure and specific features of
    the problem. Corollary 1:According to Lemma 2, The best setting for loss functions
    is (24) and { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 =L(⋅) , The optimal way for aggregating the
    local updates is averaging among the agent’s contributions, thus (25) can be rewritten
    as, θ ∗ g = ∑ u∈U ω u θ u , where ω u represents the relative contribution of
    each agent on the global model. After the derivation of a new update of θ g the
    coordinator broadcasts it to all agents. Upon receiving the update from the coordinator,
    the agents upgrade their local model accordingly. Until achieving a predefined
    level of accuracy or convergence of the global loss function, this process is
    continued. C. Asynchronous Networking The communication among the network entities
    follows the time slots t , but slot scheduling in which the agents share their
    own local model with the coordinator is distributed and asynchronous. Upon receiving
    an update, the coordinator aggregates it with the global model and updates the
    agents with the newly updated global model. In this way, we do not impose a strict
    constraint on synchronous communication with the local server (the coordinator).
    This significantly decreases the networking overhead in comparison with synchronous
    federation among distributed agents. During the training phase, we consider episodes
    in which the agent presets to a random initialization setting and starts interaction
    with the environment, and learns from its experience. Each episode contains T
    ˆ VNF scheduling round t ~ . In the deployment phase, the stream of packets that
    belong to different services is assigned based on an optimally determined VNF
    placement/scheduling policy. To avoid service interruption any fine-tuning and
    policy adaption to environmental changes, including the time the algorithm spends
    on fine-tuning and finding the optimal solution by coordinating multiple agents
    to train the global model, can be done in parallel. Definition 2 (Global Update
    Period):global update period 1≤η≤ T ˆ is defined as the period of updating the
    coordinator by the agents. We have two special settings, AFDQN-SGD ( η=1 ): In
    this case, every VNF scheduling slot t ~ , the agent sends the locally calculated
    SGD, ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator uses the
    received local data to perform one step of gradient descent: θ g ( t ~ +1)= θ
    g ( t ~ )− γ ˙ ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )). (27) View Source AFDQN-Avg ( η= T ˆ ):
    In this case, only one time during each episode, the agent sends the whole parameter
    θ u ( t ~ ) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator updates θ g ( t ~ ) accordingly,
    θ g ( t ~ +1)=(1− γ ¨ ) θ g ( t ~ )+ γ ¨ θ u ( t ~ ), (28) View Source where,
    γ ˙ and γ ¨ are AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg forgetting factors, respectively. Introducing
    the forgetting factors γ ˙ and γ ¨ allows for the adjustment of learning rates
    during model updates. Rather than updating the global model instantly upon receiving
    a local update, it is beneficial to employ a weighted average approach, considering
    both the most recent update and the previous value of the Agent’s NN weight θ
    g . This approach, known as Asynchronous Weight Averaging [53] in the literature,
    proves advantageous in alleviating the impact of outdated updates, commonly referred
    to as stale weights, and consequently, it enhances overall stability. The only
    point is that the forgetting factors should be chosen small enough. Another worth
    mentioning point is that the AFDQN-SGD and a centralized approach doing mini-batch
    SGD in the local server are essentially different as the former is asynchronous,
    distributed, and fully based on local data. The details of the proposed AFDQN
    algorithm are described in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: AFDQN- η Algorithm Show All
    Considering our optimization problem, for each agent u∈U at VNF scheduling round
    t ~ , we define the observation space O u , the action space A u , and the reward
    function R u as follows: Observation: We define the observation space as a vector
    of: 1) CPU and storage requested by the local service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } k as { c fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k and { b fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k , respectively, 2)
    available CPU { C p } p and storage { B p } p of the processing nodes, 3) service
    arrival time { t k u } k , and 4) the transmission rate { R u p ´ } U∖ u ´ ∪M
    of the links between agent u and the other processing nodes. Therefore, the observation
    o u ( t ~ ) can be written as O u ( t ~ )= {{ c fk (t) } f,k ,{ b fk (t) } f,k
    , { C p } p ,{ B p } p ,{ t k u } k ,{ R u p ´ } U∖u⋃M } t= t ~ . (29) View Source
    Action: The action space is defined as all possible placement of the required
    VNFs for service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ } k as A u ( t ~ )={ χ fk pu ( t ~ )},∀p∈U∪M,k∈S,f∈
    F k . (30) View Source Reward: Our objective is to orchestrate the VNFs in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and total energy consumption over the network.
    So we define the reward as a linear combination of three terms as follows: R u
    ( t ~ )= ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ u ( t ~ )= Π ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( t ~ )= ζ k u ( t ~ )= δ NFV ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ u
    ( t ~ )+ δ AoI Π ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( t ~ )+ δ E P total ( t ~ ), 1 K ∑ k∈S ζ k u ( t ~ )
    1 UK ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S Π k u ( t ~ ) { +1, −10, if (7)-(9)are satisfied otherwise. (31)
    View Source where δ NFV , δ AoI and δ E are the normalization factors for NFV
    scheduling result, AoI, and the energy consumption, respectively; ζ k u ( t ~
    ) is defined as the reward assigned to the result of NFV placement for service
    flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ . SECTION VII. Complexity Analysis In this section, we determine
    the computational complexity of the proposed Algorithm 1. We analyze the algorithm’s
    complexity through two distinct phases: Model Training and Action Selection, which
    occur during the deployment of the trained model. During each iteration of the
    global update period η , the process involves the training of local models by
    the agents (UAVs) and subsequently, the asynchronous aggregation of these local
    models by the MEC server to form the global model. The complexity of the local
    model training conducted by the agents can be expressed as the sum of two components:
    the complexity of action selection and the complexity of the back-propagation
    algorithm for each sample within the replay buffer. This sum is then further multiplied
    by the mini-batch size and η . It is worth noting that the multiplication by the
    mini-batch size accounts for the fact that, in each training iteration, the local
    agent randomly selects a mini-batch of samples from its own local replay buffer.
    The computational complexity of action selection in a fully connected neural network
    with a fixed number of hidden layers and neurons in each hidden layer is directly
    proportional to the sum of the input size and the output size of the neural network
    being used [54], [55]. The input size of the neural network is equivalent to the
    size of the state space, which from (29) is given by 2KF+2(U+1)+K+(U−1)+1 ; and,
    the output size of the neural network is equal to the size of the action space.
    which from (30) is given by KF(U+1) . It’s worth recalling that F= ∑ k∈S F k represents
    the overall count of distinct VNFs required to be executed across all service
    types. Hence, the computational complexity associated with action selection is
    represented by O(KFU) . Conversely, as indicated in equation [54], [55], for a
    specific sample extracted from the replay buffer, the computational complexity
    of the back-propagation process is directly proportional to the product of the
    neural network’s input and output sizes. Consequently, in our specific scenario,
    derived from the preceding computations, the overall algorithmic complexity for
    each agent can be expressed as O(ηO K 2 F 2 U) , where, O denotes the batch size.
    From Algorithm 1, each agent repeats the whole process of local model training
    η times preceding sharing the results with the local server. The last step is
    the aggregation process. While our algorithm conducts asynchronous aggregation,
    it’s important to note that the processing load escalates proportionally with
    the number of UAVs, U . As a result, the overall computational complexity for
    the training phase across the entire network is given by O(ηO F 2 K 2 U 2 ) .
    Based on the prior discussion, the complexity associated with the action selection
    for all U agents during the deployment phase is denoted as O(KF U 2 ) . SECTION
    VIII. Performance Evaluation In this section, the performance of the proposed
    algorithm is evaluated. The performance results are compared for four different
    methods of AFDQN-SGD, AFDQN-Avg, AFDQN with parameter η≠{1, T ˆ } , and a centralized
    case. In the centralized DQN method, all the observations are forwarded to the
    local server and the local server performs the VNF scheduling. Hence, its performance
    can be considered as an upper bound for the proposed AFDQN method. A. Simulation
    Setup The simulation is implemented by Python using OpenAI gym [56], a widely
    used tool for developing RL algorithms, and conducted in a computer with Intel
    Core i7–10700 CPU 2.90 GHz and 64 GB RAM. Using simulation, the impact of parameter
    η , the number of IoT nodes, and the effect of the received load by the agents
    are evaluated. To this purpose, while T ˆ =60 , five different values for the
    parameter of η consisting of 1 (corresponds to AFDQN-SGD), 10, 20, 30, and 60
    (corresponds to AFDQN-Avg) are considered. The other model parameters and simulation
    settings are summarized in Table 3 and Table 4. The proposed system model entirely
    matches none of the existing related works. However, the simulation parameters
    have been chosen to be in line with the typical values commonly used in similar
    studies within this context [6], [32], [33], [36], [37]. TABLE 3 Model Parameters
    and Simulation Settings Part I TABLE 4 Model Parameters and Simulation Settings
    Part II B. Simulation Results In Fig. 5, the convergence behavior of the AFDQN
    method is compared with the centralized method as a baseline. The two extreme
    cases of AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg are considered. As is evident from this figure,
    for the AFDQN method we have some variations around the value where it converged.
    The absolute value of these variations in AFDQN-Avg is more than AFDQ-SGD, and
    in AFDQN-SGD’s case, they are around the value achieved by the centralized method.
    Also, the AFDQN-Avg converged to a smaller value for total return, we expect this
    result will also be reflected in the performance of AFDQN-Avg against AFDQN-SGD.
    This will be investigated in the following experiments. In Fig. 6(a) and Fig.
    6(b), the minimum achievable average AoI and total energy consumption are investigated.
    The AoI value is averaged over all the agents and the total energy consumption
    is defined as the total energy consumption for sending a single packet of each
    service flow through the network from IoT nodes toward the local server. As can
    be seen, the maximum energy consumption of the three methods is limited to a maximum
    value corresponding to the maximum value of resources that the processing nodes
    can allocate to the requests. As a result, the negative side effect of the methods’
    drop in performance is mostly reflected in the value of the averaged AoI. For
    the AFDQN-Avg, this point is evidenced in Fig. 6(a), where we can see that at
    several points the values of the averaged AoI are more than 1 second. However,
    this is the worst-case choice for selecting the global update period η . Form
    Fig. 6(a), for the proposed AFDQN, we could achieve an average AoI of less than
    200 msec, which is acceptable for most real-time applications. Therefore, performance
    close to the centralized case can be achieved by the proposed method in a distributed
    manner, relying solely on the local observations of the UAVs and the sharing of
    trained local models, thus eliminating the need for exchanging the local observations,
    which can be time and energy-consuming. FIGURE 5. Episodic reward of agent 1 for
    the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All FIGURE 6. (a) Average episodic AoI. (b) Average episodic total energy consumption
    of the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All In Fig. 7(a) and Fig. 7(b), the network energy efficiency versus service availability
    is drawn. The network-wide energy efficiency is defined as the total number of
    successfully-supported service flows divided by the total energy consumption throughout
    the network to send a single packet from each one of the services flows. Also,
    service availability is defined as the percentage of the service flows that are
    supported successfully. In Fig. 7(a), the average network energy efficiency and
    the sample values in our simulation, as well as the standard deviation of the
    value, for AFDQN- 20 (η=20) are shown. The averaged network efficiency with increasing
    the value of the service availability increases in a way that for the service
    availability of more than 80 percent, it converges to around 82 percent. This
    convergence for large value of service availability shows that we were eventually
    able to provide energy efficiency as one of our objective functions. In Fig. 7(b),
    where the proposed AFDQN method with different values of η∈{20,30,60} is compared
    with the centralized approach, it can be seen that the energy efficiency of the
    centralized approach degrades as the availability reaches 100%. This behavior
    is because the centralized method has a single NN for all UAVs. For the availability
    values near 100%, the centralized agent is not able to do the job as efficiently
    as the AFDQN method where each agent has its own NN. FIGURE 7. Network-wide energy
    efficiency vs. percentage of service availability. The shaded area represents
    the standard deviation (SD) from the average value: (a) For AFDQN with η=20 .
    Sample values are shown for more illustration. (b) For AFDQN with η=20 , η=30
    , AFDQN-Avg and centralized architecture. Show All As illustrated in Table 3,
    the load of services (in terms of requested CPU and storage resources) is modeled
    as a normalized uniform random variable. The standard deviation (SD) of the values
    for both CPU request values and storage is 1.3 percent. In Fig. 8, the impact
    of increasing this value, up to 6 times the primary value of 1.3, on the network’s
    performance is examined. The network is first trained with the primary input-load
    SD value of 1.3, and then, we incrementally raised the SD of the input load. This
    can be implicitly considered as a test under non-stationary load. It is evident
    that in this situation the AoI will increase, as illustrated in Fig. 8. To be
    more specific, we considered a threshold of one second for the acceptable AoI.
    Hence, we have also drawn a graph of AoI violation (in percentage) in conjunction
    with the bar chart of averaged AoI to better reflect the effect of the load SD.
    The results demonstrate that the AFDQN-Avg method has better performance in this
    situation, which appears to contradict our previous observations where we concluded
    that decreasing the global update period improves the performance. This observation
    can be explained using the non-stationary behavior of the input load. In this
    case, the AFDQN-Avg lets the agents learn the variations and input model better,
    in comparison with AFDQN-10, which was chosen as an example for a case between
    two extreme cases, AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg. FIGURE 8. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation
    percentage for AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg versus standard deviation (SD) of the load
    normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All The effect of increasing
    the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and Energy consumption is investigated
    in Fig. 9. For this experiment, two AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg cases are considered.
    The results show that AFDQN-10 had better performance than AFDQ-Avg. Another important
    point that should be mentioned relates to the behavior of the network for a large
    number of IoT nodes, e.g., 120 or more. As the number of IoT nodes increases,
    the load of the agents increases directly, this means that there are more CPU
    and storage requests. Because the resources in the processing nodes are limited,
    there comes a point where an increase in the number of IoT nodes will lead to
    more request rejection responses. In this situation, the fresh packets will drop,
    and that causes an increase in the AoI value. However, the network energy consumption
    does not change because the volume of the active processes does not change and
    remains equal to the maximum capacity of the processing nodes. FIGURE 9. The effect
    of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and energy consumption.
    Show All For further exploration, Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 compare the performance
    of the proposed algorithm against two baseline algorithms: Multi-agent DQN (MDQN)
    [57] and the adapted version of heuristic Minimum-Delay algorithm [58]. In MDQN
    the agents operate independently based on locally trained models without coordination.
    The agents are equipped with an identical neural network featuring the same specifications
    as AFDQN. Conversely, the Minimum Delay algorithm selects actions at each VNF
    scheduling round t ´ to minimize end-to-end delay (not AoI) between IoT nodes
    and the local server. FIGURE 10. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation percentage for
    AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay versus standard deviation (SD)
    of the load normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All FIGURE
    11. The effect of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and
    energy consumption for AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay. Show All
    In Fig. 10, a comparison similar to Fig. 8 assesses the impact of increasing load
    standard deviation (SD) on network performance in terms of AoI and AoI violation.
    Generally, an increase in SD raises the average AoI and AoI violation percentage
    for all methods, as larger SD values force agents to find the best action across
    a larger state space. As it is evident, the proposed AFDQN method exhibits the
    smallest average AoI and AoI violation percentage compared to baseline methods.
    However, the Minimum Delay method performs the worst due to its localized short-term
    target. Finally in Fig. 11, the impact of increasing the number of IoT nodes per
    agent (UAV) on the proposed method’s performance in terms of AoI and energy consumption
    is explored and compared with MDQN and Minimum Delay algorithms. Results demonstrate
    the superior performance of the proposed AFDQN method compared to baselines. Additionally,
    as the number of IoT nodes reaches 120 and beyond, there is an increased demand
    for CPU and storage; limited resources in processing nodes eventually lead to
    increased rejection of requests, causing a rise in AoI. However, network energy
    consumption remains unchanged, as the volume of active processes remains equal
    to the maximum capacity of processing nodes. SECTION IX. Conclusion We considered
    the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in smart agriculture
    applications to jointly minimize the AoI and energy consumption throughout the
    network. Especially, the problem is formulated as a decentralized POMDP. Then,
    adopting the symmetric structure of the network, we analytically proved that the
    optimal policy among the agents is behaving similarly. Accordingly, a novel federated-based
    DQN method was proposed to solve the problem efficiently. The proposed method
    is distributed and energy efficient, as the local agents just need to share the
    parameters of their locally trained model with each other. Although the primary
    goal of this method is to provide privacy among the agents, in our problem, this
    significantly decreased the communication overhead, and additionally, the total
    energy consumption of the network. In terms of freshness of information, the AoI
    is minimized jointly, and the achieved value for the AoI, while the parameter
    setting is set to be close to real values, is appropriate for most real-time applications.
    Appendix In this section, we aim to simplify the problem of determining the optimal
    policy (22) by utilizing some structural specifications of the developed system
    and problem. Inspiring by the work presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP based on the Definition and Lemma presented below.
    Definition 3 (Symmetric DEC-POMDP):A DEC-POMDP is called symmetric if the following
    conditions hold: A u = A u ´ and γ u = γ u ´ , ∀u, u ´ ∈U∀u∈U , ∀a∈A , and an
    arbitrary permutation function σ(.) : r u (s,σ(a))= r σ(u) (s,a) , and T(⋅|s,σ(a))=T(⋅|s,a)
    . Lemma 1:Let G be a symmetric DEC-POMDP, for any u, u ´ ∈U , if π u = π u ´ ,
    then, π u is ϵ -best-response to π −u if and only if π u ´ is ϵ -best-response
    to π − u ´ , where ϵ -best-response (for an arbitrary ϵ≥0) defines as a policy
    that achieves (reach) a reward (cost) within ϵ of the maximum (minimum) value.
    In our VNF scheduling problem, as it is depicted in Fig. 3, at each VNF scheduling
    round t ~ , each distributed agent u∈U , has K packet-flow { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } K k=1 belong to different services each of which requires running F k different
    VNFs on their packets. The agents decide on how to place these VNFs into available
    processing nodes, i.e., other U−1 UAVs, the local server, or itself, in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and energy consumption according to (17).
    All the agents follow the same goal and the priorities among the agents are the
    same. Without loss of generality, we assume that the agents have chosen the same
    discount factor, { γ u } u∈U =γ . Thus, it can be found that the agents conceptually
    have the same model; an intuitive inference that can be figured out better using
    the following Index Mapping rule. Definition 4 (Index Mapping):For each function
    f∈ F k of packet-flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ , by definition we assume that the policy
    π u ( t ~ ) outputs I fk u ∈{0,1,…,U−1,M} is the i th candidate processing node,
    I i , as depicted in Fig. 12. The actual selected processing node among p∈{u∪{
    u ´ } u ´ ≠u ∪M} , will be, p u ( t ~ )={ [(u+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M
    if  I i = I M , ∀ I fk u = I i . (32) View Source Then, χ fk pu (|t= t ~ )=1 ,
    and X k u , B k pu will be updated accordingly. FIGURE 12. Index mapping mechanism.
    Show All Now, according to Definition 3and Definition 4, the following lemma can
    be driven. Lemma 2:Problem 1is a symmetric DEC-POMDP. Proof:According to Definition
    4, the agents have the same set of actions { A u } u∈U ={ I i } i∈U∪M , so the
    condition (i) of Definition 3 is met. Let define C ℓ as circular shift operand
    with arbitrary value of ℓ , C ℓ (⋅)=[⋅+ℓ]modU . Considering a circular shift of
    ℓ over joint action A , C ℓ (A) , we will have, a C ℓ (u) = a u , thus from (32),
    for each I fk C ℓ (u) = I fk u = I i the selected processing node p C ℓ (u) (t)
    will be, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )={ [( C ℓ (u)+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M if  I
    i = I M , ∀ I fk C ℓ (u) = I i . View Source Or, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )= C ℓ ( p u
    ( t ~ )). (33) View Source Equation (33) means Problem 1 is circularly symmetric.
    To be more specific, we do not have any special dependency on the identity of
    the agents and the state transitions depend only on the profile of joint actions
    performed by all agents. Accordingly, permuting the agents’ actions does not change
    the conditional transition probabilities, T(⋅|s, C ℓ (A))=T(⋅|s,A) , and this
    permutation will lead to a corresponding permutation of rewards, r C ℓ (u) (s,A)=
    r u (s, C ℓ (A)) . Hence, the second condition of Definition 3 is also satisfied
    and the proof is complete. According to Lemma 2, being circularly symmetric means
    that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . For such
    a condition, Lemma 1implies that the problem of finding the best policy can be
    reduced to finding π ∗ u , the best response to ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ´ , while π u ´ =
    π u ,∀ u ´ ≠u . Although this result is promising, from an implementation viewpoint,
    proposing a distributed solution for finding the best policy while requiring the
    same policy for all the agents is challenging. Recalling (18), in addition to
    the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer the action (the
    policy) of the other agents. The subsequent Corollary establishes a connection
    between this inference and solely relying on the local observations of the agents,
    thereby rendering it feasible. Corollary 2:With the same initialization of the
    belief function, { b u (0) } U−1 u=0 =b(0) , for a circularly symmetric DEC-POMDP,
    the local observation h u ( t ~ ) is a sufficient statistic for determining the
    optimal policy π ∗ . Proof:Assume that using a mechanism, the agents peruse the
    same policy π u ( t ~ ) , while they are learning the optimal policy π ∗ . Then,
    the multi-agent belief state b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) would be, b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=
    = = b u, t ~ ⎛ ⎝ s, ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ⎞ ⎠ P(s( t ~ )=s| h u ( t ~ ), b u (0), π u )
    b π u u (s, t ~ ).∀u∈U (34) View Source So, for each agent u , the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) and knowing its local policy π u is enough for determining the belief-state
    b π u u (s, t ~ ) . In a DEC-POMDP, the set { b π u u (s, t ~ ) } U−1 u=0 is sufficient
    statistic for the joint history H , and the proof is complete. Authors Figures

  description: Collaborative systems with multiple robots strategies are frequently
    cited as promising solutions to increase efficiency and system resilience in the
    agricultural area, where robotics is anticipated to play a significant role. Swarm
    robotics, one of the multi-robot techniques, emphasizes factors like adaptability,
    scalability, and resilience in completing complicated tasks and is seen to be
    particularly useful for precision farming and large-scale agricultural applications.
    This paper discusses the agri-bot as a cutting-edge technique for monitoring the
    quality of crops and watering the crops with the least amount of work and labor,
    making it a useful machine. Also IoRT (Internet of Robotic Things) is used among
    four robots for swarm robotics. The proposed design and its implementation are
    discussed in the paper for state-of-the-art swarm-based agriculture. The robots
    designed with sensors and control mechanism will monitor the field and using IoT
    will transfer the data to cloud. The synchronizing robot will acts as gateway
    for other robots. It will receive commands from server and all the robots will
    act accordingly to complete the task. So this work implements the swarm robotics
    technology and hence will have future scope in many other critical applications
    like surveillance, medicine, and food delivery sentinel swarm robotics for defense
    applications as well.

    promising solutions to increase efficiency and system resilience in the agricultural
    area, where robotics is anticipated to play a significant role. Swarm robotics,
    one of the multi-robot techniques, emphasizes factors like adaptability, scalability,
    and resilience in completing complicated tasks and is seen to be particularly
    useful for precision farming and large-scale agricultural applications. This paper
    discusses the agri-bot as a cutting-edge technique for monitoring the quality
    of crops and watering the crops with the least amount of work and labor, making
    it a useful machine. Also IoRT (Internet of Robotic Things) is used among four
    robots for swarm robotics. The proposed design and its implementation are discussed
    in the paper for state-of-the-art swarm-based agriculture. The robots designed
    with sensors and control mechanism will monitor the field and using IoT will transfer
    the data to cloud. The synchronizing robot will acts as gateway for other robots.
    It will receive commands from server and all the robots will act accordingly to
    complete the task. So this work implements the swarm robotics technology and hence
    will have future scope in many other critical applications like surveillance,
    medicine, and food delivery sentinel swarm robotics for defense applications as
    well. Keywords Multisensory robot Swarm robotics Agriculture IoRT Access provided

    Chapter © 2023 1 Introduction In India, agricultural sector problems and their
    solutions affect about 80% of total population. Multiple sensors-based movable
    multifunctional robot can be used for deciding the next crop cultivation in the
    field, soil quality monitoring, crop health monitoring, and based on these data
    should be able to make intelligent decisions. Also, if more than one such robot
    will work in a swarm, then will be called as swarm robotics (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Swarm
    robotics from https://makezine.com/article/science/swarm-farming-explained/ Full
    size image Here the robots work as distributed with each robot having its own
    power and capability and also can work by coordinating among themselves. The intelligent
    swarm robotics algorithms are derived from the natural phenomenon of a bird swarm,
    fish swarm, ant swarm, etc., for carrying out any task. In the initial phase,
    the synchronization among swarm bots is to be established. In farming, the multisensory
    swarm robots are used for plowing, sprinkling fertilizers, crop monitoring, soil
    monitoring, and hence for countless applications. This paper explores the fundamental
    requirements of the users in the background research section. The work describes
    the design method followed to develop a simple, low-cost system for tracking agricultural
    environmental data through swarm robots. The second section of paper gives literature
    survey and motivation, third section discusses the objectives and problem statements,
    fourth section discusses the work flow and implementation, and fifth section discusses
    the results and final prototype model. 2 Literature Survey In [1] swarm intelligence
    and its use in swarm robotics is discussed. Due to the flexible, durable, decentralized,
    and self-organized nature of critical thinking systems, swarm robotics presents
    an exciting alternative to conventional approaches to robotics. Swarm Intelligence
    includes Control Approach, Self-assembly robots, Object clustering, swarm guided
    route, self-development, & Mechanism. In [2], the status of the current trends
    and implementation of agricultural and autonomous systems and outline of the potential
    for future applications are discussed. Three main teams of field operations are
    crop institution, plant care, and selective harvesting. The Arduino Uno, agri-bot,
    android application, and Bluetooth are some of the major characteristics of paper.
    In [3], an overview of the issues of swarm robotics and its application in various
    fields: swarm robotics advantages, swarm robotics applications, and swarm robotics
    issues are discussed. In [4], author explains how to set up a farming robot that
    can move automatically through a field while also spying on its surroundings with
    a camera and sending the information to a computer via Wi-Fi network, Arduino,
    ultrasonic sensor, agri-bot, android application, IR sensor, obstacle detection,
    IP webcam, Wi-Fi. In [5], author discusses the swarm robotics research and identifies
    precision agriculture, infrastructure inspection and maintenance, defense, space
    missions, entertainment, and precision medicine as the application fields that
    will most likely drive the science and technology of robot swarms intelligence.
    In [6], the swarm behavior of the social insects led to development of swarm robot
    technology. With the help of the sensors, we can avoid the obstacles. The prototype
    of robots consists of Arduino Uno which control unit for both main robot and follower
    robot, Arduino Uno ATMEGA328P, Transceiver pair NRF24L01, Swarm. In [7], author
    offers a thorough analysis of ground-based agricultural robotic systems, applications,
    and enabling technology, with a focus on harvesting in particular. The majority
    of work focuses on the difficulties in developing crop recognition and field navigation
    by vision. Regular tasks include weeding, seed sowing, yield calculation, water
    inspection, and health monitoring. Author discusses in [8], robotic vehicle as
    agricultural machine that uses swarm intelligence to perform tasks. In [9], an
    approach to collective robotics that takes inspiration from the self-organized
    behaviors of social animals is discussed. References [10,11,12] provide basic
    knowledge about the swarm robotic system, system-level properties, characteristics,
    mechanisms, problems, and research directions. Reference [13] gives an overview
    of recent developments in agricultural robotics, with a focus on those that use
    high-tech sensors, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and simulation environments
    for (i) targeted weed control and spraying, (ii) field scouting and data collection,
    and (iii) automated harvesting. [14] describes the use of this robotic system
    as one of the significant advancements in this generation of robotics and how
    it will revolutionize the farming industry. The major focus of this summary is
    on how this fully autonomous system is used for tasks like harvesting, watering,
    scouting, and plowing. In [15], the following is an author’s discussion of swarm
    robotics. Swarm intelligence and robotics are the sources of inspiration for the
    relatively new field of swarm robotics. It results from the integration of multi
    robotics with swarm intelligence approaches. Despite numerous planned studies,
    there is still a long way to go before they may be used in real life. An overview
    of swarm robotics is provided in the current study to help readers comprehend
    this multi-robot domain research and to make clear the broad themes that are being
    addressed in this area. The sections offered in this paper might easily direct
    those who are just starting to get interested in this area, i.e., swarm robotics
    applications, simulators, and classification of swarm robotics issues. 2.1 Motivation
    The study of swarm robotics focuses on how many physically embodied agents can
    be produced, and how this may be done in a way that a desired collective action
    emerges from the local interactions of the agents and their environment. The operation
    of a swarm robotic system should exhibit three functional properties. Robustness—A
    number of factors is responsible for the robustness of the operation. First, the
    absence of one robot may be promptly replaced by another. Second, because there
    are many different parts of the robot working together, it is unlikely that one
    of them would stop working. Third, all swarms are rather straightforward, which
    lessens the likelihood that they will fail. Fourth, the swarm is resilient to
    local environmental disturbances because sensing is dispersed across it. Flexibility—It
    helps the system to tackle different problems with the coordination of an individual
    swarm. With this property, the swarm robotic system works very fast to carry large
    prey through the utilization of different coordination strategies. Scalability—The
    robot should be able to handle a variety of group sizes and carry a sizable number
    of individuals without interfering with other operations. This refers to the coordination
    techniques and processes that must be created for swarm systems to guarantee swarm
    operation at various swarm sizes. 2.2 Features Task enablement: Multiple robots
    can do certain tasks that are impossible for the single robot. Improved performance:
    If tasks can be decomposable, then by using parallelism, groups of robots can
    make tasks to be performed more efficiently. Fault tolerance: Under certain conditions,
    the failure of a single robot within a group does not imply that the given task
    cannot be accomplished, thanks to other one. Distributed action: The group of
    robots can actuate in various places at the same time. Communication: The robots
    have to support wireless communication which helps to avoid the plugging cables
    to the robots. Physical interaction: The robots should be able to physically interact
    with each other and the environment for self-assembly construction. 3 Problem
    Statement Farmers are seeking for ways to lessen their burden and improve the
    productivity of their fields. Data gathering is the main force behind the need
    for labor. In order to make well-informed decisions that will increase the productivity
    of their farm, farmers require data. Our project is built on the work of a previous
    MQP team to develop an IOT SWARM (stands for self-assembling wireless autonomous
    reconfigurable modules) agriculture system that would allow farmers to monitor
    environmental conditions in their fields with sensor nodes and manage and maintain
    the nodes using autonomous rovers. This system would deal with the socioeconomic
    difficulties that farmers have. The battery-powered nodes measure the following
    variables to provide data on the agronomic conditions in the fields: temperature,
    humidity, light intensity, and air quality. Farmers would be able to evaluate
    the state of their farms precisely and affordably. It supports the farmer’s ability
    to keep an eye on field conditions and make well-informed decisions to boost output,
    cut expenses, and preserve the environment. 3.1 Objectives To develop four robots
    in swarm architecture for precision agriculture. To use the swarm robots in the
    field for obtaining plow, irrigation, seed sowing, harvesting, and soil moistening.
    Based on the data available on one synchronizing BOT, apply intelligent algorithms
    for appropriate action. Swarm robotics implies that the instructions we provide
    to the one robot will be followed by the other robots. We have four robots in
    our project in distributed architecture. 3.2 Model Implementation The proposed
    swarm robotic design, the robots of the swarm should be autonomous bodies to sense
    the field and should be able to send the data to the server. The autonomous robot
    must coordinate and collaborate to complete the task efficiently like soil monitoring
    and irrigation, or harvesting a field, etc. The design of single robot for precision
    agriculture is shown as in Figs. 2 and 3. Fig. 2 Circuit diagram of robot Full
    size image Fig. 3 Prototype model of multisensory multifunctional robot Full size
    image 3.3 Process of Monitoring Temperature Start the application. Connect the
    one and slave robots with the cloud where readings are visible. If the temperature
    is below 10 ℃, then seed fails to grow, we need to turn ON the water pump and
    when above 10 ℃ it turns OFF. If the temperature is in between 20 and 32 ℃ the
    crop will grow, so we need to plow the field after turning it OFF and seeding
    ON in the field. If the temperature is more than 32 ℃ in the field, then the crop
    needs some amount of water, so turn ON the water pump and give sufficient water
    to the crop. If the temperature is remaining more than 32 ℃ the crop is damaged
    and harvesting cutter is ON to remove the damaged crop from the field. Store the
    data automatically on cloud. Stop the app and shows the result on cloud. 3.4 Monitoring
    Soil Moisture Start the Blynk Application. Connect the robots to the Blynk or
    cloud. Now, robot starts working and soil moisture data reading shows on Blynk
    app. If the soil moisture of field is below 30% then crop does not grow or becomes
    damage, crop field needs water, so pump is ON and OFF after pumping when the soil
    moisture is up to 30%. If the soil moisture of the crop is in between, it remains
    30–50%, then crop grows faster after that harvesting cutter is ON for cutting
    the crop. If the soil moisture is more than 50% crop is damaged, then harvesting
    cutter is ON and OFF after a time to cutting damage crop. Stop the Blynk application
    after sensing soil moisture in the whole field and store the data on cloud. Blynk
    cloud shows the data of the fields on mobile screen or presenting all data of
    soil moisture in excel sheet format in percentage. 3.5 Plow We use a stand for
    plow or that stands are also called a type of thing for plowing the field. It
    is connected through the servo motor which is connected through the motor and
    controlled by the Arduino. When we give or press the plow button ON then the one
    robot starts to plow after some nano seconds, other slave robots take this command
    to the same function. We use servomotor for take up and down plow stand. 3.6 Seeding
    In this function, we use a servo motor (2), we call servo motor 2 which is used
    for seeding function. This servo motor is also connected to motor driver to drive
    this motor. Use servo motor for seeding purpose, the box is rotated in up and
    down direction. We press seed ON button in Blynk App then Arduino shows this operation.
    3.7 Temperature and Soil Moisture Sensing We use temperature and soil moisture
    sensor to check the quality of crop. These sensors are connected to servo motor
    which is derived by motor drive or performed by Arduino. This servo motor is connected
    from motor driver which drives the direction of sensor up and down. We press ON
    button of the temperature or soil moisture sensor, then it performs the operation
    and stores the reading in the Blynk App. 3.8 Water Pumping We use water pump that
    is connected through Arduino or motor driver for water pumping in the field. When
    we give command through Blynk App then Arduino performs the task. As, we press
    pump button ON, the irrigation starts and if we again press the same button, then
    pump is OFF. 3.9 Harvesting We use DC geared motor which is connected through
    motor driver. We can connect a blade on DC geared motor for cutting the crops.
    When we push ON button of cutter on the Blynk App then Arduino takes command and
    performs this operation. After completing this task, we press OFF button to stop
    harvesting process. 3.10 Humidity Sensing We use DHT sensor for sensing the humidity.
    When we press ON button for humidity sensing, it starts sensing. This sensor is
    connected through Arduino. Arduino UNO performs this operation wisely. It takes
    reading of humidity and stores in Blynk App from where it appears on the mobile
    screen. After sensing the humidity, we press OFF button to stop the operation.
    4 Working of SWARM Agriculture System Firstly, we download Blynk application from
    Play Store in mobile. Make necessary configuration using SSID network and password
    and make a layout of remote and provide ON and OFF buttons with operation name
    and direction buttons. Then connect the One Robot first using the SPOT network
    to control the movements. In the One Robot we have the uses, node MCU, RF module,
    servo motor, DC geared motors, Arduino UNO board, motor drivers, step down buck
    converter and OP Amp for soil moisture sensors. The same components are used for
    the other three slave robots. Firstly, upload the required code in node MCU and
    now connect the RF transmitter with the node MCU. Using Radio Frequency module
    (RF module), we can transmit and receive the radio signal between two devices
    or even more than two devices that maintains the coordination between robots and
    to provide the communication between remote control and actual robots. Then node
    MCU ESP: 8266 has Wi-Fi module that can be connected to our smartphone/smart devices
    by using Blynk Application which is a big IOT platform and it helps to control
    the robots remotely. Then Arduino UNO board is connected with node MCU as well
    as RF transmitter in the One Robot and RF receiver in the slave robots. It is
    used to control robot motors and sensors by using embedded C programming in the
    Arduino UNO board. The motor board controls the motors and stores the reading
    and decides how to operate all robots. The whole process is controlled by a microcontroller.
    Then we use two motor drivers in the one robot or other slave robots to control
    all the motors and maintain speed and direction at the same time according to
    Arduino coding In one robot and slave robots, we have used three servo motors
    and four DC geared motors, DC geared motors are capable of high starting torque.
    We have used two sensors, DTH (for measuring the temperature and humidity) and
    soil moisture sensor (for measuring the moisture of the soil). OP Amp for soil
    moisture sensor is used in one robot or slave robots to convert the incoming analog
    signal from soil probe to digital. Step down buck converter is used to maintain
    power supply of 3A and voltage of motors. Then operations are performed by the
    one robot and slave robots—harvesting, pumping, soil moisture sensing, seeding,
    plowing, temperature, and humidity sensing. In our project we have four robots,
    one robot is used for sending the data to server and issuing commands to other
    three robots, swarm robotics means the instruction we give to the one robot will
    be followed by other robot (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Proposed swarm robotics design for
    agriculture Full size image 5 Workflow of the Prototype Model See Fig. 5. Fig.
    5 Flowchart Full size image 6 Results The objective of this work was to design
    the swarm robotic system for agriculture. This system works well with three slave
    robots and one robot in the field. Due to the parallel operation of numerous robots
    and their cooperation, the application of swarm intelligence principles to agricultural
    robotics has the potential to result in innovation. The one robot gets the sensing
    parameters from slave robots visiting and monitoring the field. On receiving the
    data, the one robot issues commands to slave robot for seeding, harvesting, and
    irrigation. The datasheet mentioned below has shown the reading of temperature
    and soil moisture which helps to operate the various operations like plowing,
    seeding, water pumping, and harvesting. It performs all the functions and gives
    the result accordingly. It starts with one robot then followed by other three
    slave robots as far as the process goes on, in the field. The fully developed
    robots are shown in Fig. 6 (Table 1). Fig. 6 a Multisensory multifunctional robots
    in field. b Multisensory multifunctional robots in field Full size image Table
    1 Readings Full size table 7 Conclusion and Future Scope A multi-purpose agricultural
    robot that can mow, seed, plow, and sprinkle water has been successfully tested
    and implemented. The key conclusion of this study is that the majority of these
    self-government-supporting frameworks are more adaptable than traditional frameworks.
    Multifunctional horticulture robot advantages include a decrease of human involvement,
    assurance of a sufficient water supply, and effective resource use. In the future,
    similar activities will be completed without the need for a human supervisor due
    to the use of ultrasonic sensors and cameras to monitor things like soil quality,
    the area the robot is guarding, and leveling. The data collected from the robots
    for different parameters will be uploaded on the cloud for different applications.
    Commands will be issued by One Robot for the respective function. Also the data
    collected on the server will be analyzed using machine learning for intelligent
    decisions regarding soil quality, fertilizers requirement, harvesting of crop,
    irrigation, etc. So the system will be smart in future with further application
    of machine learning algorithms. References Kharje S, Wahaj SM, Fatma SS, Prof.

  description: Water sustainability will be scarce in the coming decades because of
    global warming, an alarming situation for irrigation systems. The key requirement
    for crop production is water, and it also needs to fulfill the requirements of
    the ever-increasing population around the globe. The changing climate significantly
    impacts agriculture production due to the extreme weather conditions that prevail
    in various regions. Since urbanization is increasing worldwide, smart cities must
    find innovative ways to grow food sustainably within built environments. This
    paper explores how precision agriculture powered by artificial intelligence (AI)
    can transform crop farms (CF) to enhance food security, nutrition, and environmental
    sustainability. We developed a robotic CF prototype that uses deep reinforcement
    learning to optimize seeding, watering, and crop maintenance in response to real-time
    sensor data. The system was tested in a simulated CF setting and benchmarked.
    The results revealed a 26% increase in crop yield, a 41% reduction in water utilization,
    and a 33% decrease in chemical use. We employed AI-enabled precision farming to
    improve agriculture’s efficiency, sustainability, and productivity within smart
    cities. The widespread adoption of such technologies makes food supplies resilient,
    reduces land, and minimizes agriculture’s environmental footprint. This study
    also qualitatively assessed the broader implications of AI-enabled precision farming.
    Interviews with farmers and stakeholders were conducted, which revealed the benefits
    of the proposed approach. The multidimensional impacts of precision crop farming
    beyond measurable outcomes emphasize its potential to foster social cohesion and
    well-being in urban communities.

    Water sustainability will be scarce in the coming decades because of global warming,
    an alarming situation for irrigation systems. The key requirement for crop production
    is water, and it also needs to fulfill the requirements of the ever-increasing
    population around the globe. The changing climate significantly impacts agriculture
    production due to the extreme weather conditions that prevail in various regions.
    Since urbanization is increasing worldwide, smart cities must find innovative
    ways to grow food sustainably within built environments. This paper explores how
    precision agriculture powered by artificial intelligence (AI) can transform crop
    farms (CF) to enhance food security, nutrition, and environmental sustainability.
    We developed a robotic CF prototype that uses deep reinforcement learning to optimize
    seeding, watering, and crop maintenance in response to real-time sensor data.
    The system was tested in a simulated CF setting and benchmarked. The results revealed
    a 26% increase in crop yield, a 41% reduction in water utilization, and a 33%
    decrease in chemical use. We employed AI-enabled precision farming to improve
    agriculture’s efficiency, sustainability, and productivity within smart cities.
    The widespread adoption of such technologies makes food supplies resilient, reduces
    land, and minimizes agriculture’s environmental footprint. This study also qualitatively
    assessed the broader implications of AI-enabled precision farming. Interviews
    with farmers and stakeholders were conducted, which revealed the benefits of the
    proposed approach. The multidimensional impacts of precision crop farming beyond
    measurable outcomes emphasize its potential to foster social cohesion and well-being
    in urban communities. Keywords: smart cities; artificial intelligence; urban agriculture;
    intelligent precision farming; irrigation sustainability 1. Introduction 1.1.
    Background on Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture has become an important
    strategy for the sustainable feeding of growing urban populations. However, efficiently
    cultivating food within space-constrained city environments requires innovative
    techniques to optimize limited land and resources. Precision agriculture, which
    utilizes data and technology to target interventions, shows promise if adapted
    for urban farming contexts. As urban spaces continue to expand, the integration
    of precision farming has emerged as a pioneering approach, representing a significant
    departure from traditional agricultural practices to more specialized, data-guided
    strategies. The main aim of precision farming within an urban context is to refine
    plot-level management concerning plant health and production efficiency. This
    is achieved through state-of-the-art technologies like satellite imaging, sensor
    technology, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and data analytics, which help to
    monitor and regulate urban green spaces and crops more efficiently for the betterment
    of public health. Historically, decisions on irrigation, seed sowing times, and
    the quantity of fertilizer used in traditional farming were primarily based on
    human intuition and previous records. On the other hand, urban precision farming
    leverages real-time data to foster better decision making. This leads to enhanced
    productivity, improved sustainability, and reduced costs by applying the right
    treatments at the right time and place. To deepen our understanding of these novel
    practices, Table 1 comprehensively compares various agricultural methods, briefly
    summarizing the benefits and drawbacks of each technique. This valuable decision-making
    tool helps identify potential research areas for autonomous farm robots, especially
    within urban landscapes. Table 1. Comparison of different methods in agriculture.
    1.2. Need for Sustainable Farming Practices The need for food is anticipated to
    increase significantly as the world population approaches 10 billion by 2050.
    This creates considerable hurdles for the agricultural industry, which is already
    under pressure from causes like climate change, water scarcity, and land degradation.
    Furthermore, conventional agricultural methods have frequently been linked to
    harmful environmental effects such as soil erosion, excessive water use, and pollution
    from pesticides and fertilizers. Figure 1 shows the evolution of agricultural
    machinery over time. Figure 1. Evolution of agricultural machinery. Therefore,
    addressing these issues requires the use of sustainable farming techniques. Sustainable
    agriculture aims to enhance food production without sacrificing the ability of
    future generations to meet their own needs. It encompasses a broad spectrum of
    ethical, socially responsible, and commercially successful actions. For instance,
    they reduce water waste through wise irrigation techniques while minimizing pollution
    through specific fertilizers and pesticides. 1.3. Introduction to Deep Reinforcement
    Learning (DRL) A sophisticated machine learning method, DRL, combines deep learning
    and reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is concerned with how agents
    should behave in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards, whereas deep learning
    is designed to handle high-dimensional data. In DRL, an agent gains decision-making
    skills through interaction with its surroundings. In contrast to supervised learning,
    where the model is trained on a dataset with labelled examples, an agent learns
    via feedback based on its behaviors in reinforcement learning. As it interacts
    with the environment, the agent gains rewards, and it aspires to increase the
    total of these rewards over time. Deep learning’s function is to make approximations
    of the mathematical formulae that calculate potential rewards or recommend the
    optimal course of action. DRL has succeeded in several fields, including autonomous
    driving, robotic control, and superhuman video game skill. DRL is exceptionally
    well suited to dynamic and unpredictable contexts like agriculture because of
    its capacity to manage complicated, high-dimensional environments. The main objective
    of this research is to investigate how Deep Reinforcement Learning may be incorporated
    into autonomous agricultural robots for adaptive seeding and water management.
    Our goal is to create a system that can make wise judgments in real time based
    on environmental variables by fusing precision agricultural concepts with the
    cutting-edge capabilities of DRL. This study focuses on implementing the Proximal
    Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a cutting-edge DRL method renowned for its
    sample efficiency and simplicity, in an autonomous agricultural robot outfitted
    with multiple sensors. The PPO algorithm uses these sensors’ vital information
    to decide upon the seed sowing depth, density, and irrigation schedules. This
    research lays the framework for a new generation of intelligent agricultural systems
    that can help address today’s food issues while advancing efficiency and sustainability
    in farming methods. Precision agriculture can be advanced by incorporating DRL
    into autonomous robots, making farms more productive and resistant to the difficulties
    presented by a changing global climate. The structure of this study begins with
    an introduction, moves through a literature review, a description of the Proximal
    Policy Optimization algorithm, a description of the robot design, an experimental
    setup, a performance evaluation, and ends with conclusions and recommendations.
    2. Literature Review Autonomous agricultural robot development began in the late
    20th century. According to [1,2,3], early agricultural robots mainly concentrated
    on straightforward tasks like weeding. Agricultural robots started employing increasingly
    advanced technologies, such as GPS, computer vision, and sensor technology, as
    technology advanced. There was a rush of research on the automation of harvesting
    procedures in the early 2000s. These studies developed robotics for the fresh
    fruit industry to automate fruit harvesting [4,5]. Agricultural robots have become
    more versatile over time as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) have advanced.
    The necessity of giving agricultural robots various sensors and decision-making
    abilities was emphasized by [3]. More recently, in 2017, Duckett et al. introduced
    the idea of “Agricultural Robotics for the Real World”, examining various applications
    and the possible use of robotics in agriculture. Most traditional seed-sowing
    techniques involve physical work. Initially, it was common to scatter seeds by
    hand; later, row-sowing equipment like seed drills were created [4]. Decisions
    about the seed sowing depth and density were frequently based on experience and
    were, therefore, imprecise. Farming has always depended heavily on effective water
    management. When fields were flooded by water in the past, flood irrigation was
    frequently practiced [5]. This approach could be more effective. Technology led
    to the creation of sprinkler and drip irrigation systems. Although these techniques
    required manual intervention and decision-making, they were more effective. The
    ability of DRL to make decisions in complicated contexts has lately led to its
    use in agriculture. Refs. [6,7,8,9,10] explored deep learning’s multiple agricultural
    applications, such as in crop and weed detection. DRL was used by [7] to optimize
    irrigation scheduling. They created a DRL agent that considers the trade-off between
    crop productivity and water usage when learning how to irrigate an agricultural
    field. Similarly, ref. [8] suggested a DRL-based precision irrigation system,
    demonstrating significant water savings while preserving crop output. A DRL-based
    telepresence robot with the ability to maneuver around was discussed in detail
    in [9,10,11,12]. Table 2 shows the comparison of different published works related
    to smart and sustainable farming with the usage of different technologies, and
    the advantages and disadvantages of those technologies. Table 2. Comparison of
    different published works in the related field. Despite improvements in DRL and
    agricultural robotics, they have not yet been integrated for adaptive seed planting
    and water management. The majority of DRL implementations have concentrated on
    discrete activities like scheduling irrigation. Most of the potential of DRL in
    adaptive seed sowing, where the robot chooses the sowing depth and density in
    real time based on environmental circumstances, has yet to be thoroughly investigated.
    Additionally, there is a requirement for more complete systems that integrate
    different components like seeding, water management, and fertilizer management
    into a single autonomous robotic system. Through DRL, such systems can be equipped
    to make integrated decisions while concurrently considering several elements [18,19,20,21,22,23,24].
    The need for the real-world testing and validation of these systems is another
    flaw. Although numerous studies include simulated environments, there are fewer
    cases of substantial real-world deployments, which is essential for comprehending
    real-world difficulties and limitations. Furthermore, creating algorithms that
    can effectively function with little data is required. The majority of DRL algorithms
    require data that may need to be more practical in some agricultural contexts,
    particularly in underdeveloped countries where data are scarce. It is also important
    to consider the practicality and scalability of agricultural robots built using
    DRL technology. Large-scale deployments need to be explored to comprehend these
    systems’ economic effects and scalability across many types of crops and diverse
    geographical regions. Even if the development of autonomous agricultural robots
    and the use of DRL in agriculture have advanced significantly, there is still
    a need to bridge the gap between these two by creating integrated systems. This
    integration should concentrate on real-world applicability, scalability, economic
    viability, and technological improvement. By creating an autonomous agricultural
    robot that uses DRL for adaptive seed sowing and water management, and deploying
    and evaluating the system in a real-world environment on a 1-acre test farm, our
    project intends to fill some of these gaps. Through this, we intend to open the
    door for further study and advancements in intelligent and sustainable precision
    agriculture. 3. Deep Reinforcement Learning 3.1. Overview of Deep Reinforcement
    Learning A branch of machine learning known as DRL combines deep learning and
    reinforcement learning (RL). The core tenet of RL is that agents operate in ways
    that maximize some sort of concept of cumulative reward. DRL develops this concept
    by approximating the functions required for difficult decision making using a
    neural network, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. DRL architecture and process.
    A set of states 𝑆 , a set of actions 𝐴 , and a policy, which is a mapping from
    states to actions, make up the basic context for RL: 𝜋: 𝑆 → 𝐴 . The agent interacts
    with environmental interaction by observing a state 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 , acting 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 , obtaining
    a reward r, and then changing to a new state 𝑠 ′ . Finding a policy that maximizes
    the predicted cumulative reward is the objective. The Q-function, which is designated
    as 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎) and calculates the predicted cumulative reward of acting in state s
    and then following policy, is an essential part of RL. DRL uses deep neural networks
    to approximate the Q-function. Mathematically, the Q-function is defined by the
    Bellman equation in Equation (1): 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎)=𝑟+𝛾𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑄( 𝑠 ′ ,  𝑎 ′ )) (1) where 0
    ≤ 𝛾 ≤ 1 is the discount factor. Here, 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑄( 𝑠 ′ ,  𝑎 ′ )) represents the maximum
    predicted reward that can be achieved from the next state 𝑠 ′ , considering all
    possible actions 𝑎 ′ in that state. This term is a key component of the Bellman
    equation used in reinforcement learning, specifically in the context of Q-learning.
    It encapsulates the idea of an agent (in this case, the agricultural robot) learning
    to predict the total amount of reward it can expect in the future, given its current
    state and action. In order to approximate the Q-function, 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎; 𝜃) , DRL uses
    a neural network, which stands for the weights of the network. 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎; 𝜃) is a
    function approximated by a neural network, where 𝜃 represents the network’s weights,
    that is used to predict the expected rewards for taking action 𝑎 in state 𝑠 ,
    guiding the decision-making process of the agent. 3.2. Proximal Policy Optimization
    (PPO) Algorithm A policy optimization technique in DRL called Proximal Policy
    Optimization (PPO) aims to update the policy without making significant changes.
    Compared to other policy optimization techniques, it is distinguished as being
    more stable and effective with regard to sample complexity, as shown in Figure
    3. PPO works in two stages: Figure 3. PPO working principle. First, by interacting
    with the environment while employing the present policy, data are gathered. Second,
    the policy is optimized by maximizing an objective function. With each update,
    the policy can vary excessively, hindering learning. The PPO algorithm explicitly
    solves this problem. This is accomplished by optimizing a surrogate objective-containing
    modification of the policy gradient objective function, as shown in Equation (2):
    𝐿(𝜃)=𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑟(𝜃) 𝐴 𝑎𝑑𝑣 , 𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝(𝑟(𝜃),1−𝜀,1+𝜀)  𝐴 𝑎𝑑𝑣 ) (2) Here, 𝐴 𝑎𝑑𝑣 is the advantage
    function evaluating how good the action is compared to the average action; this
    function evaluates how much better an action is compared to the average action
    under the current policy. The advantage function is crucial in reinforcement learning
    as it helps to determine the relative quality of the actions taken by the agent.
    𝜀 is a hyperparameter controlling how much the policy is permitted to change.
    𝑟(𝜃) is the ratio of the probability of the action under the new and old policies.
    When incorporated into autonomous agricultural robots for adaptive seed planting
    and water management, PPO has various benefits in agricultural contexts. Sample
    Effectiveness: PPO is renowned for its sample effectiveness. Being able to make
    sense of few data is essential in agriculture because of the short growing season.
    Stability: By preventing the policy from shifting too much, the clipping in the
    objective function promotes more stable learning. This translates into long-term
    decision making that is trustworthy and consistent in the context of agriculture.
    Handling Continuous Action Spaces: Making decisions in agriculture, such as how
    much water to use for irrigation or how deep to plant seeds, must be performed
    continuously. PPO is well suited to making these kinds of decisions since it performs
    well in continuous action spaces. Real-time Decision Making: PPO’s effectiveness
    and stability make it capable of making judgments in real time, which is essential
    for adaptive water management and seed sowing, where conditions might change quickly
    due to the weather or other factors. Mathematically, these advantages can be crucial
    for optimizing the yield 𝑌 , given by Equation (3): 𝑌=𝑓(𝑋, 𝑊,𝑑, 𝑃) (3) Where 𝑋
    represents the seed sowing density, 𝑊 is the amount of water utilized, 𝑑 is the
    sowing depth, and P is the policy (in this instance, PPO optimization). The objective
    is to maximize 𝑌 while considering the agricultural environment’s limitations
    and unique characteristics. PPO is particularly favourable for adaptive seed sowing
    and water management in agriculture; this is because it can integrate autonomous
    agricultural robots due to its sample efficiency, stability, competence in handling
    continuous action spaces, and real-time decision making. These benefits help to
    optimize important agricultural variables, resulting in higher yields and more
    environmentally friendly farming methods. 4. Autonomous Agricultural Robot 4.1.
    Robot Design and Components In this study, DRL is used in the multidimensional
    design of an autonomous agricultural robot focused on adaptive seed sowing and
    water management. Our robot, Agrorobotix, includes an intelligent decision-making
    system, a reliable mechanical structure, and sensor integration, as shown in Figure
    4. Figure 4. Agrorobotix structure. The mechanical setup of Agrorobotix consists
    of a chassis, four wheels, four motors, a mechanism for drilling holes in the
    ground, a seed dropper, a flattener, and a watering system. The robot’s chassis,
    which serves as its main body, is strong enough to support its parts while it
    moves around an agricultural field. It houses the sensors, control unit, motors,
    battery, and other components required for autonomous operation. The robot has
    four wheels, each propelled by a different engine, as shown in Figure 5. This
    enhances the control of the movement, including rotation and navigating various
    terrains. A mathematical model of the motors is as follows, as described in Equation
    (4): 𝑇=𝑘(𝑉−𝑤𝑅) (4) Figure 5. Agrorobotix mechanism and working. 𝑘 is the motor
    constant, 𝑉 is the applied voltage, 𝑤 is the angular velocity, 𝑅 is the resistance,
    and 𝑇 is the torque. A motorized arm and a drill make up the drilling mechanism.
    The component can move vertically, enabling it to drill holes in the ground at
    different depths based on the information provided by the sensors. Let us use
    𝑑 as the drilling depth, 𝑇 𝑑 for the torque needed for drilling, and 𝑃 𝑑 for the
    power required for drilling. They have a relationship that can be modelled as
    shown in Equations (5) and (6): 𝑇 𝑑 =𝐹𝑟 (5) 𝑃 𝑑 = 𝑇 𝑑 𝑑𝜔 (6) where 𝐹 is the applied
    force, and 𝑟 is the drill’s radius and 𝜔 is the angular velocity. The next step
    is attaching a seed dropper to the drilling mechanism. The seeds are carefully
    dropped into the drilled holes. The seed dropper system is set up to distribute
    seeds according to the DRL system’s predetermined intervals and dosages. The flattener,
    a component with a flat surface placed over the soil to ensure the seeds are adequately
    coated, performs this. Finally, the robot has a sprinkler system. The ideal amount
    of water will be provided over the sown area. The water flow rate 𝑄 can be computed
    as shown in Equation (7): 𝑄= 𝐴 𝑐𝑠 𝑣 (7) where 𝐴 𝑐𝑠 is the cross-sectional area
    of the flow and 𝑣 is the velocity of water. 4.2. Power Management To ensure that
    the Agrorobotix robot always has enough power to return to its base for recharging
    or maintenance, several strategies can be implemented as part of its energy management
    system. Here are some approaches used by Agrorobotix: Energy Monitoring System:
    Implement a real-time energy monitoring system that continuously tracks the robot’s
    power levels. This system alerts the robot when its energy levels drop below a
    predefined threshold, prompting it to return to the base for recharging. 2. Automated
    Recharging Stations: Set up automated recharging stations strategically in the
    field. The robot can autonomously dock and recharge when needed, minimizing downtime,
    and ensuring constant operational readiness. 3. Battery Health Management: Implement
    a battery health management system that monitors the battery condition, optimizes
    charging cycles, and prevents deep discharges, thereby extending the battery life
    and reliability. 4.3. Sensor Integration 4.3.1. Soil Moisture Sensors Agrorobotix
    incorporates soil moisture sensors to gauge the water in the soil. These are essential
    in letting the DRL system know if watering is required. The estimates for soil
    moisture are as described in Equation (8): 𝜃 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙 = ( 𝑚 𝑤𝑒𝑡 − 𝑚 𝑑𝑟𝑦 ) 𝑚 𝑑𝑟𝑦 (8)
    where 𝑚 𝑤𝑒𝑡   is the mass of the wet soil and 𝑚 𝑑𝑟𝑦 is the mass of dry soil. 4.3.2.
    Weather Sensors Weather sensors are crucial for detecting environmental factors
    like temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Making judgments on irrigation timing
    and the sowing depth require the use of this information. 4.3.3. Global Positioning
    System (GPS) The robot has a GPS module that enables precise field navigation.
    This is essential to ensuring that the robot follows the best courses for irrigation
    and sowing. The tuple (latitude, longitude) can indicate the robot’s position
    𝑃 . The DRL system continuously receives data from various sensors and uses the
    PPO algorithm to make real-time decisions about the seed sowing depth, density,
    and irrigation. In this study, Agrorobotix, an autonomous agricultural robot using
    the newest sensors and Deep Reinforcement Learning technology, is painstakingly
    designed. Its sturdy construction and thoughtful decision-making capabilities
    enable adaptive seeding and water management, which promote more effective and
    sustainable agriculture methods. Agrorobotix’s advanced decision-making capabilities
    and structural robustness have received particular attention during development,
    as these are essential for adaptive seeding and water management. A key component
    of these capabilities is the integration of GPS technology. Thanks to this technology,
    Agrorobotix can move and position itself in the best possible ways to accomplish
    its tasks while accurately navigating a variety of agricultural landscapes. Because
    GPS enables accurate data collection and the execution of learned strategies in
    real-time field conditions, it is essential for the effective implementation of
    deep reinforcement learning algorithms. As a result, the system’s robust design,
    astute decision making, and accurate GPS-guided navigation work together to greatly
    improve agricultural practices’ sustainability and efficiency. 4.4. Integration
    of PPO in the Robot A key feature of Agrorobotix is the PPO algorithm, which enables
    the robot to make wise and adaptable decisions for seed sowing and water management
    in real time. The integration establishes the connection between the robot’s mechanical
    parts, the PPO algorithm, and its sensory inputs. 4.4.1. Data Acquisition and
    Preprocessing Data serve as the foundation for PPO. Agrorobotix has several sensors,
    including GPS, weather sensors, and soil moisture sensors. Let us denote the raw
    sensory data at time 𝑡 as 𝑆 𝑡 . These data need to be pre-processed to create
    the state space that will be used as input by the PPO algorithm. The state space,
    denoted as 𝑋 𝑡 , can be represented as a vector in Equation (9): 𝑋 𝑡 =[ 𝑠 𝑚𝑡 ,
    𝑠 𝑤𝑡 ,  𝑝 𝑡 ] (9) where 𝑠 𝑚𝑡 represents the soil moisture, 𝑠 𝑤𝑡 represents weather
    information (such as temperature, humidity), and 𝑝 𝑡 represents the robot’s position,
    obtained from GPS data. 4.4.2. Action Execution and Feedback The robot’s components
    are actuated per the action 𝐴 𝑡 selected by the PPO algorithm. For example, if
    𝐴 𝑡 calls for sowing seeds at depth 𝑑 , the drilling machine would be activated
    to produce the holes at depth 𝑑 , the seed dropper would dispense the seeds, the
    flattener would cover the holes, and the sprinkler might be activated depending
    on the moisture levels. Let us denote the action space as 𝐴 𝑡 =[𝑑, 𝑛, 𝑤] , where
    𝑑 represents the depth of seed sowing, 𝑛 represents the number of seeds, and 𝑤
    represents the amount of water to be sprinkled. 4.4.3. Reward Calculation and
    Policy Update After executing the action, Agrorobotix observes the immediate reward
    𝑅 𝑡 , which is a function of various factors such as the soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and seed sowing depth. The cumulative reward 𝐺 𝑡 is calculated as
    in Equation (10): 𝐺 𝑡 =𝛴 (𝛾^𝑖 ∗  𝑅 𝑡+𝑖 ) (10) where 0 ≤ 𝛾 ≤ 1 is the discount
    factor. The policy is updated using the collected rewards, and the process is
    repeated. Real-time Adaptation Agrorobotix gathers new data as it continues interacting
    with the environment, which are then used to update the policy. As a result, the
    PPO algorithm improves its decision making over time by adjusting to the surroundings.
    4.4.4. Mathematical Optimization for Resource Consumption A secondary objective
    can be integrated into PPO to ensure minimal resource consumption. The robot can
    be optimized for the minimal use of water and energy. Minimize in Equation (11):
    𝛴( 𝑤  𝑡 + 𝑒 𝑡 ) (11) Subject to Equation (12): 𝐺 𝑡 ≥𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 (12) where 𝑤  𝑡
    is water consumption, and 𝑒 𝑡 is the energy consumption at time 𝑡 . In the context
    of Agrorobotix’s operations, the reward function 𝑅 𝑡 plays a pivotal role in guiding
    the robot’s learning and decision-making process. After executing an action 𝐴
    𝑡 , such as sowing seeds or managing water, Agrorobotix calculates the immediate
    reward 𝑅 𝑡 . This reward is a multi-faceted function that incorporates several
    critical agricultural factors, including, but not limited to, the following: Soil
    Moisture: Agrorobotix measures the moisture level of the soil, aiming for an optimal
    range that ensures adequate water for the crops without over-irrigation. The closer
    the soil moisture is to this optimal range, the higher the reward 𝑅 𝑡   received.
    Weather Conditions: The algorithm considers current and forecasted weather conditions.
    Favourable weather that promotes healthy crop growth contributes positively to
    the reward. Seed Sowing Depth: The accuracy of the seed sowing depth, as per the
    agronomic standards for different crops, influences 𝑅 𝑡 . A precise sowing depth
    ensures better seed germination and contributes to a higher reward. The cumulative
    reward 𝐺 𝑡  is then calculated based on these immediate rewards over time, as
    outlined in Equation (10). This approach enables Agrorobotix to adapt its actions
    dynamically, aiming to maximize 𝐺 𝑡  by optimizing these key factors, thus ensuring
    efficient and sustainable agricultural practices. In general terms, processing
    sensory data to create a state space, using the PPO algorithm to choose actions,
    carrying out these actions using the robot’s mechanical parts, and changing the
    policy using the incentives earned are the steps involved in incorporating PPO
    into Agrorobotix. This makes it possible for Agrorobotix to modify its water management
    and seed-sowing plans in real time, resulting in higher yields and sustainability.

    the robot observes the state 𝑠 t from its sensors (soil moisture, weather sensors,
    GPS). The action 𝑎 t is selected based on the policy 𝜋( 𝑎 t | 𝑠 𝑡 ; 𝜃) and executed
    by the robot (drilling, sowing, flattening, and watering). The robot observes
    the immediate reward 𝑟 t and the new state 𝑠 t+1 . The advantage estimate 𝐴 t
    is computed, which represents how good the taken action is compared to the average
    action. The policy parameters 𝜃 are updated by optimizing the surrogate objective,
    which is a clipped version of the objective; this is to prevent policy updates
    that are too large. This process is repeated over multiple iterations and epochs
    for stable learning. 5. Experimental Setup 5.1. Description of the Test Farm The
    experimental setup was carried out on a test farm spanning an area of 1 acre,
    as shown in Figure 6. The farm is in a region of Faisalabad, Pakistan, with a
    temperate climate that is characterized by moderate rainfall and a growing season
    typically from early spring to late fall. The soil is loamy and has been traditionally
    used for growing a variety of crops including wheat, maize, and vegetables. The
    test farm was specifically chosen for its representativeness of typical agricultural
    conditions. The field experiments with Agrorobotix spanned over a period of 30
    days, enabling comprehensive data collection and algorithm refinement. Figure
    6. The 1-acre test farm. 5.2. Data Collection and Training Historical information
    about the farm, such as its weather patterns (temperature, humidity, and precipitation),
    soil moisture, and crop yield records, was gathered before the experiment began.
    Agrorobotix uses an array of sensors to gather these data, which form the basis
    of the algorithm’s decision-making process. Our autonomous agricultural robot,
    Agrorobotix, collected data in real time throughout the trial using its built-in
    sensors. Gazebo was used in the simulation environment to replicate the conditions
    on a farm. A high-fidelity model of Agrorobotix and the test farm were used in
    the simulation. The various environmental situations could be replicated using
    Gazebo, and the robot’s behaviours could be examined. Through a continuous feedback
    loop, the robot adapts its actions based on the outcomes of previous actions,
    enhancing its efficiency and accuracy over time. The collected data were pre-processed
    to be fed into the DRL model. The state space vector 𝑋 t is defined as described
    in Equation (13): 𝑋 t =[ 𝑠 𝑚𝑡 , 𝑠 𝑤𝑡 ,  𝑝 𝑡 ] (13) where 𝑠 𝑚𝑡 represents the soil
    moisture, 𝑠 𝑤𝑡 represents weather information, and 𝑝 𝑡 represents the robot’s
    position, which was obtained from GPS data. The PPO algorithm was employed as
    the DRL model, which was trained using both historical data and real-time data
    collected from Gazebo simulations. The objective was to maximize the cumulative
    reward 𝐺 𝑡 . The learning curves for these tasks are given in Figure 7. During
    training, we simulated an Agrorobotix in parallel for each sampling and collected,
    in total, a thousand time steps for each task. The policy 𝜋(𝜃) was modified iteratively
    through epochs, and the training continued until convergence. Figure 7. Learning
    curve of PPP for Agrorobotix. Following training, Agrorobotix was used on the
    test farm’s 1-acre property. Its primary responsibilities included water management
    and adaptive seed sowing. As instructed by the PPO algorithm, the robot used its
    drilling machine to create holes, seed droppers, flatteners to level the field,
    and sprinklers to water the crops. It was crucial to adjust the model with actual-world
    data while Agrorobotix moved through the test farm. The robot functioned at the
    test farm throughout two growing seasons and continuously adjusted its irrigation
    and seeding policies. The model tuned itself to the test farm’s actual environmental
    conditions and limits, as shown in Figure 8. Figure 8. Agrorobotix working in
    1-acre test farm. The crop yield and water use were the two main criteria for
    assessing Agrorobotix’s performance. Water use was calculated in liters, while
    crop production and the shoot length in particular were calculated in centimeters.
    The crop production and water usage of Agrorobotix were compared to traditional
    farming methods to examine the results. The effectiveness and advantages of using
    a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based strategy in agriculture were established through
    this comparison. PPO’s integration into Agrorobotix and implementation on the
    test farm produced positive outcomes. The robot could manage water resources and
    plant seeds flexibly and efficiently. The experimental set-up that combined physical
    and virtual settings greatly honed and tested Agrorobotix’s performance in actual
    agricultural situations. The use of autonomous robots and deep reinforcement learning
    offers a significant step towards sustainable and effective farming practices.
    6. Results and Discussion In this study, the ‘conventional’ method refers to traditional
    agricultural practices, which typically include manual labor and basic mechanization
    without advanced automation or data-driven decision-making systems. This method
    has been optimized based on standard agricultural practices, which involve routine
    watering and fertilization schedules, regular pest control measures, and traditional
    soil management techniques. These practices serve as a benchmark for comparing
    the efficiency and effectiveness of the Agrorobotix system in enhancing sustainable
    agriculture. 6.1. Comparison with Conventional Farming Techniques 6.1.1. Crop
    Yield One of the essential metrics in this study is the crop yield, which directly
    impacts the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural practices. The crop
    yield was quantified as the total shoot length of crops produced per unit seed,
    as shown in Figure 9. Let us denote the crop yield using Agrorobotix as 𝑌 𝑟 and
    the crop yield using conventional farming techniques as 𝑌 𝑐 , as shown in Equation
    (14). 𝑌 𝑟 =𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑠 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝐴𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑥 (𝑐𝑚/𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑)  𝑌
    𝑐 =𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑙𝑒𝑔𝑡ℎ 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑠 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑓𝑎𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔 (𝑐𝑚/𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑑)
    (14) Figure 9. Shoot length in (a) 0 month, (b) 1st month, (c) 2nd month and (d)
    3rd month. According to the results, there was a 16.3% increase in shoot length
    with the use of Agrorobotix, as shown in Equation (15): ( 𝑌 𝑟 − 𝑌 𝑐 .)/ 𝑌 𝑐 .
    ∗ 100=16.3% (15) This can also be visualized through the graph in Figure 10: Figure
    10. Shoot length comparison of Agrorobotix and conventional method. 6.1.2. Water
    Usage Another critical metric is the water usage, which is crucial for sustainable
    agriculture. Let us denote the water usage using Agrorobotix as 𝑊 𝑟 and the water
    usage using conventional farming techniques as 𝑊 𝑐 , as shown in Equation (16):
    𝑊 𝑟 =𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 𝑏𝑦 𝐴𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑥 (𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠/𝑎𝑐𝑟𝑒)  𝑊 𝑐 =𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙
    𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 𝑏𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑓𝑎𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔 (𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠/𝑎𝑐𝑟𝑒) (16) According
    to the results, there was a 21.7% reduction in water usage with the use of Agrorobotix,
    as described in Equation (17): ( 𝑊 𝑐 − 𝑊 𝑟 )/ 𝑊 𝑐  ∗ 100=21.7% (17) This can also
    be visualized through the bar graph in Figure 11: Figure 11. Comparison of water
    usage when using Agrorobotix and conventional method. 6.2. Insights and Implications
    The results demonstrate that Deep Reinforcement Learning increases crop productivity
    while reducing water use in an autonomous agricultural robot. The graphs and mathematical
    model show that Agrorobotix performs better than conventional agricultural methods.
    The DRL model’s reward improvement demonstrates how the robot can grow intelligent
    and acquire sound judgement. Adaptation is crucial in agriculture since environmental
    conditions can be unpredictable. During field trials, a number of operational
    parameters were evaluated in order to determine the usefulness and effectiveness
    of Agrorobotix in agricultural settings. These parameters include the average
    speed at which the robot operates and the total amount of time needed to finish
    typical agricultural tasks on a field of one acre. Agrorobotix was entrusted with
    a number of standard farming tasks during these trials, including planting, watering,
    and crop health monitoring. The mean velocity of the robot was measured, taking
    into account different kinds of terrain and operational circumstances. Agrorobotix’s
    operational performance across a range of agricultural tasks is summarised in
    Figure 12. The robot’s average speed, which ranges from 3 to 4 km/h, is shown
    on the left for tasks like watering, seeding, and crop monitoring. These velocities
    are designed to strike a balance between effectiveness and the dexterity needed
    for fine farming tasks. Agrorobotix’s time efficiency is demonstrated by the graph
    on the right, which shows how long it takes to finish each task on a one-acre
    field. The durations, which vary from 5 to 7 h, demonstrate the robot’s ability
    to complete tasks quickly, possibly lowering labour hours and increasing the overall
    productivity of the farm. This information highlights how Agrorobotix is used
    in the field in a way that is consistent with sustainable farming methods and
    precision agriculture. Figure 12. Agrorobotix: speed and time metrics for farming
    tasks on a 1-acre field. Figure 13 illustrates a comparison between the chemical
    usage of traditional farming methods and those employed with Agrorobotix. The
    bar chart clearly shows a 33% reduction in chemical usage when utilizing Agrorobotix’s
    precision application system, as indicated by the decrease from 100% (representing
    the baseline chemical usage in traditional methods) to 67%. This significant reduction
    underscores the benefits of efficiency and sustainability offered by Agrorobotix
    in agricultural practices. Figure 13. Chemical usage comparison: traditional vs.
    Agrorobotix. A comparative study was conducted to validate the algorithm’s soil
    moisture estimation against traditional methods. This involved performing parallel
    measurements over the experimental period, demonstrating the algorithm’s precision.
    The graph in Figure 14 compares the soil moisture estimation over a 30-day period
    using the Deep Learning Reinforcement (DLR) algorithm implemented in Agrorobotix
    with traditional methods. The blue line represents the soil moisture levels as
    estimated by the DLR algorithm, while the green line illustrates the estimates
    obtained through traditional methods. This visual representation offers a clear
    comparison of the two approaches, demonstrating the DLR algorithm’s ability to
    accurately estimate soil moisture over an extended period, which is crucial for
    informed and efficient agricultural practices. Figure 14. Soil moisture estimation:
    DRL algorithm vs. traditional methods (30 days). The results of this study indicate
    that autonomous robots may revolutionise agricultural practices. Such robots can
    tackle some of agriculture’s most serious issues, such as resource optimisation
    and sustainability, by making data-driven decisions. Additionally, as technology
    advances, the capabilities and application of these robots may be enhanced, ushering
    in a new era of precise and sustainable agriculture. The findings of this study
    serve as a basis for further investigation and development in the fields of agricultural
    robotics and artificial intelligence. 7. Conclusions In conclusion, this research
    article shows that implementing new sustainable irrigation methods improves crop
    farming and reduces water consumption. The potential of Agrorobotix to transform
    urban agriculture is demonstrated by its integration into smart city frameworks.
    Agrorobotix makes a substantial contribution to the sustainability and efficiency
    of urban farming practices, which are essential to the creation of smart cities,
    by utilizing cutting-edge AI and robotics. By maximizing the utilization of resources
    to minimize environmental effects and improve food security in urban areas, this
    system is in line with the smart city objective; as a result, the Agrorobotix
    system has shown that integrating deep reinforcement learning into autonomous
    agricultural robots provides significant advantages for adaptive seed sowing and
    water management. The Agrorobotix design prioritizes water sustainability, but
    it also makes a major contribution to effective land management and the optimization
    of fertilizer usage. Agrorobotix guarantees sustainable resource utilization beyond
    water conservation by carefully dousing fertilizers and monitoring soil health.
    The outcomes of considerable experimentation and comparison with traditional farming
    methods reveal significant benefits. Crop yield rose by an average of 16.3%, outpacing
    conventional techniques and boosting food production. Additionally, the Agrorobotix
    system’s deployment led to a stunning 21.7% decrease in water usage, successfully
    addressing the significant problem of resource conservation. These figures highlight
    the enormous potential for enhancing agricultural practices using deep reinforcement
    learning algorithms, particularly the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm.
    The Agrorobotix system provides a sustainable and effective solution for modern
    agriculture, opening the way for higher production and environmental stewardship
    by intelligently optimizing seed sowing and water management procedures. This
    study also qualitatively assessed the broader implications of AI-enabled precision
    farming. Interviews with the farmers and stakeholders were conducted, which revealed
    the benefits of the proposed approach. Acknowledging Agrorobotix’s limitations,
    like terrain navigation difficulties and maintenance needs, we plan to explore
    these areas in future work to enhance the practical applicability and operational
    efficiency of agricultural robotics. The multidimensional impacts of precision
    crop farming beyond its measurable outcomes emphasize its potential to foster
    social cohesion and well-being in urban communities. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction In Recent decades, modern agriculture
    has grappled with the need to balance the growing demand for high-quality food
    with the preservation of the environment and natural resources. A crucial step
    in this direction is represented by the adoption of new digital technologies,
    which serve as essential tools for addressing the challenges posed by this complex
    intersection of needs [1], [2]. The emergence of sensors and smart equipment has
    particularly revolutionized the agricultural sector, opening up new prospects
    for enhancing the sustainability of production processes and mitigating environmental
    impacts [3]. In this context, precision agriculture (PA) emerges as a fundamental
    pillar, offering innovative solutions to enhance agricultural production [4],
    [5], [6], [7]. PA aims to address the variability within cultivated fields with
    the goal of standardizing yields and maximizing overall efficiency [8]. This approach
    represents a synergistic integration of computer science and agronomic management,
    paving the way toward quality and sustainable production. The goal of PA is to
    become a decision-support tool for comprehensive and sustainable farm management
    [9]. Fig. 1 illustrates a typical PA scenario. Fig. 1. PA ecosystem. Show All
    Within the realm of PA, precision viticulture (PV) is a specific application area
    in vineyards [10], [11]. Viticulture holds a significant position within both
    the agricultural and food industries due to its considerable economic impact.
    It stands out as one of the most extensively cultivated crops, spanning approximately
    7.3 million hectares. This vast area is dedicated to cultivating various grape
    varieties, encompassing those specifically for wine production, table consumption,
    and raisin production. Addressing these challenges requires a profound recognition
    of the dynamic nature inherent in agricultural systems. This dynamism stems from
    substantial temporal and spatial variations in responses to various production
    factors. Consequently, implementing site-specific management strategies becomes
    essential. The progression of PV is intricately linked to technological advancements
    that have enabled tailored management practices for specific sites. Significant
    strides have been made in developing user-friendly software capable of handling
    spatial and geographic data. Furthermore, there has been a proliferation of remote
    sensing platforms boasting high spatial and temporal resolutions. The emergence
    of proximal sensors has further facilitated focused and continuous monitoring
    of crops within specific areas [12]. The objectives of PV encompass achieving
    finer control over crop yields, minimizing the occurrence and spread of grapevine
    diseases, and elevating the overall quality of produce. PV involves a cycle of
    activities that begins with the collection of accurate data related to vine cultivation,
    proceeds to the interpretation of such data, and culminates in the application
    of targeted agronomic techniques. Incorporating wireless sensor networks and remote
    sensing technologies constitutes a crucial aspect of PA, leveraging the potential
    of data acquisition, analysis, global positioning systems, and the Internet of
    Things (IoT) for optimized solutions [13], [14], [15]. These methods enable remote
    monitoring of production processes, providing a wide range of real-time information
    about the surrounding environment. The variety of available sensors is remarkable,
    ranging from measuring basic parameters, such as temperature and humidity, to
    more sophisticated elements, such as images, acoustic data, and microradars, among
    others. Variables, such as temperature, atmospheric humidity, and soil conditions,
    are aspects that PV particularly focuses on. This approach plays a central role
    in frost prevention thanks to continuous climate monitoring that allows for the
    anticipation of potential critical situations. At the same time, soil moisture
    analysis is fundamental to optimizing irrigation systems, enabling the delivery
    of the right amount of water in the most targeted manner possible. Another significant
    challenge is the prevention of grapevine diseases, where climatic factors exert
    a significant influence on the development of plant pathologies. As a result,
    anticipating the conditions of the vineyard and constant monitoring of every part
    of it are concrete tools to prevent the onset of pest infestations, or at least
    to intervene in the early stages [16]. In the abovementioned context, a significant
    point concerns the application of artificial intelligence (AI) [17], [18], [19].
    The ability demonstrated by machine learning (ML) to solve a wide range of challenges,
    regardless of the context, has highlighted it as one of the most significant and
    promising research fields. When the problem can be adequately formulated as input,
    ML algorithms exhibit surprising flexibility in recognizing underlying rules and
    hidden connections among the provided information. This range of applications
    spans from categorizing data into specific classes (classification) to predicting
    numerical values (regression). Recently, even in the viticulture sector, the use
    of ML methodologies to address various challenges has been observed [20], [21],
    [22]. In many parts of the world, traditional farmers have historically relied
    on the experience and wisdom of industry professionals to make operational decisions.
    However, this method exposed them to the uncertainty of weather conditions, which
    have become increasingly unstable due to climate changes and variations in precipitation.
    Manual and indiscriminate pesticide use, for example, led to resource waste and
    environmental damage. The introduction of AI and IoT in agriculture has ushered
    in a new paradigm, eliminating the random factor. This new era provides farmers
    with tools to optimize every phase of the process, surpassing the randomness of
    a tradition-based approach. This lays the groundwork for more informed and targeted
    decisions. Based on these premises, this study explores the use of a series of
    regression models capable of learning from historical data collected from weather
    stations. These datasets include various parameters, such as air temperature,
    relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and solar radiation. Information
    from time-domain reflectometry (TDR) probes, such as soil temperature and moisture,
    is also considered. The main goal is to generate valuable information and data
    to equip agronomists with predictive tools aimed at enhancing land yield and product
    quality. Therefore, the main contributions can be summarized as follows. Mitigating
    potential frost damage by accurately predicting the minimum temperatures for the
    following day. Optimizing irrigation scheduling through soil moisture forecasts,
    ensuring the efficient utilization of water resources for the highest crop yield.
    Proactive grape disease management by developing a classification model that forecasts
    the onset of key factors contributing to the spread of major pathogens, including
    downy mildew and powdery mildew. This prediction considers current weather conditions.
    The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II provides a comprehensive
    review of the related literature, and Section III outlines the test vineyard area
    along with a comprehensive overview of the available data. Section IV details
    the experimental protocol employed for each forecasting module. Section V presents
    and analyzes the results obtained. Section VI critically examines the current
    limitations of this study, providing a foundation for future research directions.
    Finally, Section VII concludes this article. SECTION II. Literature Review This
    section provides an overview of the technologies and concepts relevant to frost
    prediction and protection systems. The concepts of soil moisture forecasting for
    smart irrigation (SI), along with an examination of current algorithms for predicting
    diseases in vineyards, are also discussed. A. Frost Prediction The crop damage
    caused by frost constitutes a significant economic challenge for farmers globally.
    In the viticulture industry, frosts introduce a significant threat, capable of
    causing extensive damage to wine production across expansive regions or entire
    territories in a single occurrence. Such damage can have adverse and long-lasting
    effects on plant growth and yields for multiple growing seasons. The severity
    of the damage is contingent upon the lowest temperature recorded and the duration
    of exposure to critical temperature thresholds. During winter, dormant plant buds
    can withstand temperatures as low as −10 ∘ C (down to −20 ∘ C), but in spring,
    they can sustain damage even at temperatures slightly below 0 ∘ C. Numerous studies
    have drawn attention to the role of climate change in altering the growth patterns
    of various plant species. For example, grapevines are exhibiting a propensity
    toward earlier spring budbreak due to milder winter temperatures. Common strategies
    to address frost-related issues include the use of wind turbines, fuel combustion,
    and heating enclosed environments, such as greenhouses. However, these methods
    come with a significant cost in terms of installation and management, potentially
    eroding the grower''s profits. In addition, to avoid unnecessary expenses, it
    is essential for farmers to accurately recognize when a frost episode poses an
    actual threat. In this context, access to precise meteorological data and frost
    risk forecasts assumes an invaluable role [23]. Predicting the next day''s minimum
    temperature based on key indicators, such as solar radiation, dew point, wind,
    rainfall, and humidity, could help mitigate frost damage [24]. However, it should
    be emphasized that climate prediction is a complex process due to its numerous
    dynamic and chaotic variables. Addressing this complexity requires the use of
    advanced computer models, field observations, and an understanding of meteorological
    patterns-aspects that have garnered the attention of researchers from a wide range
    of scientific disciplines [25], [26]. Most research regarding frost prediction
    relies on simulating partial differential equations or conventional statistical
    models to anticipate weather conditions. These methods are computationally intensive
    and necessitate constant theoretical refinement to incorporate meteorological
    and atmospheric assumptions. The use of ML models is now widely adopted for detecting
    frost episodes, as well as being applied in various other meteorological fields
    [27]. Employing ML techniques trained on specific data from a given area has enabled
    the creation of tailored models for local situations. In contexts, where factors,
    such as terrain complexity or other elements, could compromise the accuracy of
    existing meteorological models, these approaches prove particularly valuable.
    Previous studies have achieved encouraging results in complex scenarios, and further
    research has highlighted how integrating data from nearby weather stations can
    further improve the models'' predictive capabilities. However, adopting such algorithms
    poses some challenges. For instance, variable local frost-related conditions make
    it difficult to obtain detailed information from weather stations. Furthermore,
    to obtain effective results, data must be collected over an extended period of
    time (greater than 7 years). In addition, the paucity of specific data on frost
    events makes modeling a challenging task. All these considerations have led to
    preferring the use of temperature regression-based models rather than those based
    on frost classification (frost/no frost) [28]. B. Soil Moisture Prediction Soil
    moisture content plays a fundamental role in regulating water balances and ecological
    processes in various ecosystems [29]. These processes encompass phenomena, such
    as evaporation, transpiration, biological diversity, and rainfall runoff. Within
    the viticulture industry, soil moisture levels hold crucial importance in preventing
    water stress situations for crops and in monitoring drought conditions [16]. Insufficient
    moisture can impede plant growth, reduce production, intensify sugar content,
    and lead to an acidity deficiency in wines. Conversely, excessive moisture adversely
    affects grape growth, yield, and quality, heightening susceptibility to winter
    damage and diseases. Therefore, prudent irrigation management is essential for
    achieving high-quality grapes, underscoring the significance of continuous soil
    moisture monitoring and understanding the spatial and temporal patterns that underlie
    predictions. In the past, onsite detection technologies were both expensive and
    unreliable. Consequently, this prompted the adoption of indirect methods, which
    estimated water consumption by considering plant evaporation and transpiration,
    with precipitation as the primary water source. However, with the emergence of
    the IoT, the era of SI began, allowing for more precise direct measurements and
    automated monitoring. SI systems utilize wireless sensor networks to precisely
    control irrigation operations. This emerging field employs data-intensive methodologies
    to enhance agricultural productivity while simultaneously mitigating environmental
    impacts. Leveraging a variety of sensors, contemporary agricultural practices
    collect large amounts of data, providing meaningful information in operational
    contexts. As a result, this promotes more accurate and precise decision-making.
    Through the application of SI strategies in response to real-time soil and weather
    conditions, farmers can efficiently meet their water needs while preserving water
    consumption for the irrigation process [30]. SI has demonstrated its capacity
    to enhance water utilization, decrease energy consumption, and increase crop yield
    [31], [32]. These advancements have revolutionized the process of soil moisture
    monitoring and prediction, offering a viable alternative to indirect methods reliant
    on water balance. Moreover, given the various data sources available, the application
    of ML has emerged as a promising approach for soil moisture prediction [33], [34],
    [35], [36]. Over the years, various studies have compared conventional methodologies
    with ML techniques, including linear regression (LR), support vector machines
    (SVM), random forests (RF), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems. Despite
    the variances in applications across different investigations, accounting for
    factors, such as input data, locations, and specific crop types, the results presented
    in Section V align cohesively with the existing literature. C. Grapevine Diseases
    Prediction Downy mildew and powdery mildew represent the main microbial diseases
    that devastatingly affect grapevines (see Fig. 2). Plasmopara viticola is the
    pathogenic agent responsible for downy mildew in grapevines. This microorganism,
    native to the United States, causes a reduction in the photosynthetic efficiency
    of the affected green tissues, contributing to early leaf drop. At the same time,
    Uncinula necator, responsible for powdery mildew, also originates from North America
    and affects green tissues, including the berries, causing significant losses in
    yield and a decrease in the wine quality [37]. In Italy, the effects of downy
    mildew are becoming increasingly severe. Due to heavy spring rains that are affecting
    several Italian regions, the Italian Wine Union Observatory has anticipated losses
    in some areas of up to 40% in the upcoming imminent grape harvest season. According
    to [38], these infections can destroy 40% –90% of plants in the field at optimal
    humidity and temperature. Fig. 2. Example of powdery mildew (left-hand side) and
    downy mildew (right-hand side) infection. Show All Downy mildew and powdery mildew
    can manifest severe symptoms in grapevines in the early stages of infection, prompting
    farmers to resort to fungicide treatments. However, concerns regarding the negative
    impacts of chemicals on the environment and human health have led to the implementation
    of restrictions to regulate the use of such fungicides. Weather conditions emerge
    as one of the main threats capable of triggering diseases in crops [39]. Adverse
    climatic conditions, such as frequent precipitation and high humidity levels,
    increase the risk of fungal disease development. In Table I, a summary of the
    main factors favoring the growth and spread of P. viticola and U. necator diseases
    in grapevines is provided, with particular attention to climatic conditions and
    the time interval necessary for the onset of infection. Therefore, continuous
    monitoring of weather conditions is of fundamental importance in detecting indicative
    signs of potential infections. In response to these challenges, various models,
    both empirical and based on climatic parameters, have been developed to predict
    grapevine diseases and assist farmers in making decisions regarding crop protection
    [40]. TABLE I Overview of the Key Elements That Favor the Proliferation and Dispersion
    of P. Viticola and U. Necator Diseases in Grapevines, Along With the Timing of
    Infection [37] Expanding computing capacity is revolutionizing data collection
    and processing. By employing ML techniques, it becomes possible to investigate
    a wide range of factors, integrating different real-time data sources to evaluate
    interactions among the pathogen, host plant, and climatic variables, often before
    any visible signs of disease emerge [41], [42], [43], [44]. This in-depth analysis
    aims to guarantee the efficient and sustainable management of fungicidal treatments.
    Nevertheless, the efficacy of statistical models and ML algorithms in forecasting
    the onset of grapevine diseases has received limited attention in the current
    literature. SECTION III. Materials and Methods A. Data Acquisition and Overview
    The test vineyard is located within the Taurasi DOCG area, in the province of
    Avellino (Campania, Italy), specifically in the municipality of Montemiletto,
    at the Donna Elvira Estate (Latitude: 41.0118, Longitude: 14.9323, Elevation:
    328 m). The dataset employed in this research is categorized into two primary
    categories: meteorological data and soil moisture data. Data were collected over
    a span of approximately 2 years, from 2021 to 2023, with a frequency of 5 min.
    The professional Davis Vantage Pro2 Plus wired weather station is responsible
    for the collection of meteorological data, including key parameters, such as air
    temperature, air humidity, dew point, wind speed and direction, precipitation,
    and solar radiation. Three TDR probes (Acclima TDR-315H model) have been positioned
    at varying depths of 30, 60, and 90 cm, enabling precise data acquisition (soil
    temperature and moisture) at multiple levels. WeatherLink serves as the specialized
    software for managing data from Davis weather stations. One of WeatherLink''s
    notable features is its capacity to present meteorological variables in standardized
    formats, facilitating data interpretation and thereby simplifying the comparison
    and analysis of information. B. Data Processing During the preprocessing phase,
    the data were grouped into daily 24-h intervals. Subsequently, it was necessary
    to perform certain statistical operations, including calculating the mean, maximum,
    and/or minimum of the climatic variables, along with determining the total daily
    precipitation by summing the daily values. The soil moisture content was also
    adjusted to its daily average. In terms of data cleaning, NaN values were introduced
    to replace missing values, and outliers were removed. Additional details can be
    found in the following sections. 1) Frost Forecast Due to the significant variability
    in minimum hourly temperature and the common practice of developing frost mitigation
    strategies in viticulture on a daily scale, a rolling 24-h window was introduced
    to forecast the minimum temperature for the next day. The meteorological variables
    included are temperature ( ∘ C), humidity (%), dew point ( ∘ C), solar radiation
    (W/m 2 ), wind speed (km/h), wind run (km), and precipitation (mm). Table II provides
    the complete list of parameters. The input data for each of the ML models are
    structured into an array featuring eight distinct columns. The first column indicates
    the daily mean temperature (TAVG), followed by parameters, such as solar radiation
    at 14:00 h (RAD14), dew point and humidity at 23:00 h (DP23 and H23, respectively),
    daily averages of wind speed and wind run (WSAVG and WRAVG), along with the accumulated
    daily precipitation (RSUM). Finally, the last column contains the minimum air
    temperature for the next day (TMIN). The rows of each array correspond to the
    daily temporal evolution from 2021 to 2023. TABLE II Variables Used as Input Features
    in ML Models for Frost Prediction 2) Soil Moisture Forecast For effective predictive
    irrigation scheduling, a one-day-ahead (D + 1) forecast of soil moisture is essential
    [29]. In this context, the involved variables encompass the daily mean temperature
    (TAVG), accumulated daily precipitation (RSUM), daily average humidity (HAVG),
    the daily average of each sensor in relation to soil temperature and soil moisture
    (STAVG and SMAVG, respectively), and finally, the overall daily average for soil
    moisture of the next day. The parameters'' details are presented in Table III.
    TABLE III Variables Used as Input Features in ML Models for Soil Moisture Prediction
    3) Grapevine Diseases Forecast Grapevine disease prediction plays a crucial role
    in promoting sustainable vineyard cultivation and the production of high-quality
    grapes. In the proposed model, data collected from sensors serve as input for
    ML algorithms, while the presence (or absence) of conditions that favor grapevine
    diseases acts as the target variable. Consequently, in the preprocessing phase
    of the time series, it was necessary to label the database. This process led to
    the creation of three columns, each with 24-h sliding windows, including meteorological
    factors contributing to the development of grape diseases, namely, precipitation,
    temperature, humidity, and wind speed. In accordance with the conditions outlined
    in Table I, two additional columns are introduced: “DownyMildew” and “PowderyMildew,”
    respectively. The assigned value in these columns is 1 when the initial infection
    conditions are met; otherwise, it is 0. Variables involved include the highest
    daily temperature (TMAX), maximum solar radiation (RADMAX), highest wind speed
    (WSMAX), maximum humidity (HMAX), and cumulative daily precipitation (RSUM). For
    further details, refer to Table IV. TABLE IV Variables Used as Input Features
    in ML Models for Grapevine Disease Prediction During database labeling, it is
    important to analyze the imbalance between the two classes. This imbalance can
    significantly impede model accuracy, increasing the chances of misclassifying
    an instance as part of the majority class. To mitigate this issue, utilizing data
    oversampling techniques, such as SMOTE [45], is fundamental, as it balances class
    distributions by oversampling minority-class data. This approach results in a
    significant enhancement of ML models performance, allowing them to adeptly handle
    the minority class with precision and dependability. SECTION IV. Experimental
    Setup The experiments were conducted utilizing the free version of the PyCharm
    integrated development environment software on a MacBook Pro 2.6 GHz Intel Core
    i7 6 Core, 16 GB, 2667 MHz DDR4 Intel UHD Graphics 630, 1536 MB, with Python 3.7.6.
    The algorithms employed for model training were sourced from the scikit-learn
    repository, a Python module equipped with useful functions for ML. During the
    experimental phase, several well-known ML algorithms were applied to address regression
    and classification tasks. For regression, the algorithms included LR, RF regressor,
    XGBoost (XGB), support vector regression (SVR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP)
    regressor. In the domain of binary classification, the models considered were
    RF, SVM, and XGB. To enhance performance, the grid-search tuning technique was
    employed to identify the most effective hyperparameters for the considered models.
    For each database, a random dataset split was performed, allocating 80% for training
    and reserving the remaining 20% for constructing the test set. A. Evaluation Metrics
    To assess the performance of regression models, four performance measures are
    utilized, including the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE),
    mean squared deviation (MSE), and the coefficient of determination (R-squared,
    R 2 ), according to the following equations: MAE= MSE= RMSE= R 2 = 1 n ∑ i=1 n
    | y i − y ^ i | 1 n ∑ i=1 n ( y i − y ^ i ) 2 1 n ∑ n i=1 ( y i − y ^ i ) 2 −
    − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ 1− ∑ n i=1 ( y i − y ^ i ) 2 ∑ n i=1 ( y i − y ¯ )
    2 . (1) (2) (3) (4) View Source In the given formulas, y ^ i denotes the forecasted
    value, y i stands for the actual value, and y ¯ represents the mean of the observed
    value. The MAE evaluates the average of absolute prediction discrepancies, where
    lower values indicate superior model performance. The MSE measures the mean squared
    errors. Its square root, known as the RMSE, is particularly sensitive to outliers.
    A lower RMSE implies higher model accuracy. R 2 quantifies the proportion of total
    data variability attributable to the model. Values close to 1 suggest that the
    model adeptly accounts for observed data variations. When dealing with classification
    tasks, the results are classified into four distinct groups: true positives (TP),
    true negatives (TN), false negatives (FN), and false positives (FP). Accordingly,
    each algorithm''s performance was evaluated using different metrics, specifically
    accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are defined mathematically
    as Accuracy Precision Recall F1-score = TP+TN TP+TN+FP+FN = TP TP+FP = TP TP+FN
    = 2⋅Precision⋅Recall Precision+Recall . (5) (6) (7) (8) View Source Accuracy quantifies
    the percentage of correct predictions among the entire prediction set. Precision
    evaluates the percentage of correctly predicted positive outcomes relative to
    all predicted positives. Recall computes the percentage of correctly predicted
    positive outcomes in comparison to the total instances within that class. The
    F1-score considers both precision and recall, enabling an analysis of FP and FN
    values. SECTION V. Results and Discussion A. Results for Regression Problem Frost:
    Table V provides the one-day-ahead forecast results for the minimum temperature.
    It can be observed that for all configurations, both MAE and RMSE are lower, at
    1.28 ∘ C and 1.72 ∘ C, respectively. These values are clearly inconsequential
    when compared with the current thermal variability. Specifically, during the test
    phase, the LR and RF regression models yielded the most promising outcomes. The
    R 2 values indicate strong correlations between the models and observations (0.91–0.93),
    underscoring the effectiveness of the algorithms employed in capturing the variability
    of the minimum temperature. Importantly, the LR model excels in performance relative
    to more intricate algorithms, offering a distinct advantage in terms of model
    interpretability. Fig. 3 illustrates the prediction error plot, allowing for a
    visual comparison between the model''s projected outcomes and the actual results;
    the closer the data points align with the regression line, the more accurate the
    model proves to be. Finally, Fig. 4 shows the LR model prediction results, while
    Table VI reports some forecasted minimum temperature values compared with the
    actual ones. TABLE V One-Day-Ahead Forecast Minimum Temperature: ML Algorithms
    Results TABLE VI One-Day-Ahead Forecast Minimum Temperature: Comparisons of Actual
    and Predicted Values—LR Fig. 3. One-day-ahead minimum temperature: Prediction
    error plot. Show All Fig. 4. One-day-ahead minimum temperature: Actual versus
    prediction values. Show All Table VII provides the evaluation metrics obtained
    from employing the LR model across different forecast lead-days. The D + 2 prediction
    horizon yielded a temperature forecast with an RMSE of 2.22 ∘ C, whereas the D
    + 3 time horizon produced an RMSE of 2.82 ∘ C. As expected, the model''s performance
    worsened as the prediction lead-time increased. When dealing with longer forecasting
    periods for minimum temperature, encountering a low R 2 value is not unusual.
    This can be attributed to multiple factors, including variability in weather patterns,
    the impact of seasonal shifts, and the potential for unforeseen events. Although
    the model may not explain as much of the variation, it can still provide valuable
    insights for planning and preparation. TABLE VII Minimum Temperature: LR Model
    Prediction at Various Lead-Days The RF regression model assesses feature importance
    to identify the key parameters contributing to the frost forecast model''s accuracy.
    Results reveal that predicting minimum temperatures greatly depends on the dew
    point (0.8), which represents the temperature at which air reaches saturation
    and water vapor condenses. When the minimum temperature aligns closely with or
    matches the dew point, it indicates nearing air saturation, paving the way for
    dew or fog formation. Hence, in weather forecasting, the dew point is pivotal
    for accurate predictions concerning temperature lows. Soil moisture: The soil
    moisture prediction results presented in Table VIII are high across all models,
    with R 2 values surpassing 0.96. By incorporating precipitation, climatic factors,
    as well as current-day soil moisture and soil temperature as inputs, ML models
    can accurately foresee soil moisture average levels for the next day. Although
    MLP and SVR exhibit superior performance, the preference is for LR due to its
    interpretability and ease of explanation. This choice facilitates direct comparisons
    with more complex models and enables an evaluation of the model''s complexity
    in relation to the inherent nature of the regression problem. Fig. 5 demonstrates
    the LR model''s ability to capture soil moisture dynamics, with very few outliers
    in the predictions. The predicted soil moisture values compared with the actual
    target are shown in Fig. 6. Table IX reports some forecast soil moisture values
    and the effective observed measurements. TABLE VIII One-Day-Ahead Forecast Soil
    Moisture: ML Algorithms Results TABLE IX One-Day-Ahead Forecast Soil Moisture:
    Comparisons of Actual and Predicted Values—LR Fig. 5. One-day-ahead soil moisture:
    Prediction error plot. Show All Fig. 6. One-day-ahead soil moisture: Actual versus
    prediction values. Show All The results of the LR model for forecasting at D +
    3 and D + 7 time horizons are also discussed. Predicting soil moisture beyond
    a single day in advance is essential for effectively implementing a precision
    irrigation system. A time frame exceeding one day enables more advanced and strategic
    planning of irrigation activities. In addition, accounting for the inertia of
    hydrological processes within the soil, these projections offer a more precise
    understanding of soil moisture variations over time. As reported in Table X, the
    results exhibit highly satisfactory performance, characterized by an average R
    2 value of approximately 0.93. TABLE X Soil Moisture: LR Model Prediction at Various
    Lead-Days Furthermore, an investigation comparing data utilization from one probe
    (TDR probes 1 and 2) to data from three probes was conducted. Excluding the deeper
    TDR probe 3, which could incur higher replacement costs, did not impact prediction
    accuracy. The R 2 values for TDR probes 1 and 2 are 0.96 and 0.95, respectively.
    While acknowledging the potential benefits of using more probes for better insights,
    the results emphasize that utilizing data from a single probe can yield exceptional
    predictions and potentially reduce maintenance expenses associated with additional
    probes. B. Results for Classification Problem Grapevine diseases: Tables XI and
    XII give the performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score) obtained
    during the testing phase for each algorithm utilized in the downy and powdery
    mildew grapevine disease prediction. Specifically, the XGB algorithm accurately
    anticipated the initiation of downy and powdery mildew infection cycles (D + 1
    time frame) with an accuracy of 96% and 97%, respectively. Further experiments
    were performed to assess potential infectious initial conditions using various
    prediction time horizons, i.e., D + 3 and D + 5. Tables XIII and XIV provide the
    results achieved using the XGB algorithm. TABLE XI One-Day-Ahead Forecast Downy

    Prediction at Various Lead-Days SECTION VI. Limitations AI and IoT-driven PA have
    introduced a level of precision that allows modern farmers to optimize every aspect
    of the agricultural process. Among these technologies, wireless sensor networks
    play a vital role in collecting data, including parameters, such as temperature
    and humidity. These variables are essential for predicting soil properties, meteorological
    conditions, crop yields, and diseases. However, traditional ML models encounter
    some challenges in estimating soil parameters and weather data across different
    ecosystems. They may also be influenced by historical trends, which makes forecasting
    extreme weather events more complex. Advances in image processing and the rise
    of AI, particularly in the field of deep learning (DL), have revolutionized the
    analysis of complex scenarios and the automation of specific tasks [46], [47].
    Compared with conventional remote sensing tools, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
    enable near-real-time field monitoring. The development of remote sensing technology
    has also improved the use of multispectral imagery, which has become an effective
    tool for assessing and monitoring crop health, crop stress, and making yield predictions.
    Looking to the future, further advances in remote sensing technology and the application
    of DL algorithms are expected to continue to revolutionize the field of PA [48],
    [49], [50]. This could lead to even more effective management of agricultural
    resources, enabling a more sustainable and efficient food production process.
    SECTION VII. Conclusion As the agricultural landscape undergoes rapid transformation,
    the integration of IoT and ML in PA emerges as a promising avenue for the future
    of smart and sustainable farming. This study exemplifies the potential of merging
    IoT-generated data with ML techniques to revolutionize agricultural practices,
    particularly in vineyards. This wealth of information empowers us to rely on ML-driven
    forecasts for frost damage and soil moisture, surpassing conventional methods
    for weather monitoring and irrigation planning. To mitigate economic losses and
    reduce environmental impacts, this research also incorporates a predictive model
    for the onset of grapevine diseases. This enables accurate and confident forecasts
    of the initial stages of infections, facilitating timely and effective interventions.
    Despite the data being collected over a limited time period, the results are highly
    promising. In the future, we plan to change the time measurements, analyzing hourly
    rather than daily intervals. The goal is to determine whether this leads to advantages,
    especially for crops that will benefit from a continuous irrigation method. Forecast
    models should be extended to also include rainfall. This will ensure that irrigation
    practices are meticulously adjusted to yield even greater water savings, maximizing
    the efficient utilization of anticipated rainfall volumes. The proposed approach
    has the potential to be seamlessly integrated into an IoT sensor network or a
    localized alarm system. In addition, we intend to incorporate UAVs for near-real-time
    field monitoring, alongside advanced DL algorithms, to further improve efficiency
    and diversify data sources. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics Footnotes

  description: In today’s digital age, the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining popularity.
    IoT has made everything smart, for example, smart cities (smart buildings and
    smart homes), smart healthcare (personal monitoring, smart wearables), industrial
    automation (especially manufacturing), commercial (shopping systems, retail),
    and even that agriculture too. IoT is becoming increasingly important in today’s
    digital age, resulting in a rapid rise in the number of devices connected to it.
    Massive amounts of data will be produced by such widely distributed IoT devices
    at the network’s edge. Processing these massive amounts of data in the centralized
    cloud is expected to result in increased 400bandwidth utilization, latency, and
    network congestion. Edge computing has become a popular paradigm in recent years
    for reducing network congestion and serving real-time IoT applications by providing
    services close to enduser devices. Agriculture is the foundation of the economy
    of any nation in the world. By 2050, the world population will need a 70% increase
    in food production to feed an estimated global population of more than 9 billion
    people. Potatoes are consumed all over the world and its production plays an important
    role in agriculture. The two primary diseases that adversely affect the yield
    of potato crop production are early blight and late blight. Therefore, in this
    work, we used containerized microservices to deploy machine learning models to
    resource restricted edge nodes on agricultural land for real-time disease and
    irrigation water requirement prediction in potato crops. Containers are lightweight
    and easy to deploy, making them the ideal choice for running machine learning
    models on resource-constrained edge nodes. We examined AlexNet, MobileNet, and
    VGG16, three deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), to detect these diseases
    automatically. A dataset of 7128 images containing healthy and diseased leaves
    of potato plants was used to train all three CNN models on the cloud. Even if
    training is outsourced, trained models need a lot of RAM; hence, the first aim
    of this study is to find a lightweight CNN model that can easily fit into resource-constrained
    devices. To improve potato crop yield and reduce economic losses, we found and
    deployed lightweight CNN model at the edge node to identify diseases in real time
    using leaf pictures recorded by in-place camera devices. The advantage of the
    developed technique is that by classifying potato leaf pictures in real time on-premises,
    there is no need to transfer images to the cloud for probable disease identification,
    which increases network congestion. The lightweight CNN model achieved 99.87%
    accuracy for both train and test images, according to the results. Precision (P),
    Recall (R), and F1 score (F1) are also displayed, to visualize the model’s efficiency.
    Similarly for real-time prediction of irrigation water requirement in potato crop,
    we trained two machine learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic
    Regression (LR) on 100,000 values of records. Each record has four input parameters
    (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and how many days the crop was planted
    before). With four input parameters in each record (soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and how many days before the crop was planted), the model decides whether
    the water pump should be turned on or off. The SVM model and the LR model attained
    92 and 73% accuracy, respectively, in determining whether the water pump should
    be turned ON or OFF.

    harvestingNB-IoTSDN 1. Introduction One of the most important pillars of human
    society is agriculture. According to the food and agriculture organization (FAO),
    to cater the needs of growing population, food (FAO, 2009) production need to
    be increased by 70–65 % in 2050. Farmers must put in more effort while using the
    traditional agricultural approach, which also uses resources inefficiently. Several
    issues, including population expansion, climatic circumstances, a shortage of
    resources, etc., occur from this ancient farming approach. The term smart agriculture
    refers to digital farming practices that are used to maximize effectiveness instead
    (Javaid et al., 2022) of capability. This system performs structured and optimal
    input and output analytics through smart technologies, objective-focused analysis,
    planning, and monitoring. As a result of collecting and pooling analytical data
    using advanced sensor, a methodology group is built that is optimized for achieving
    this objective-oriented analysis. For monitoring and managing agricultural operations,
    this cutting-edge technology combines Internet of Things (IoT) networks, devices,
    AI, and big data analytics. Through the use of diverse electronic, biochemical,
    and electrical sensors and actuators, various farming field data can be collected,
    and through this data, different sub-operations of farming applications can be
    developed. Using IoT to monitor crops (Sreekantha and Kavya A.M., 2017), detect
    diseases and pests, predict crop yields, robotics-based harvesting of crops, and
    much more. The creation of a wireless sensor network (WSN) can be accomplished
    using various types of wireless connections, each with a range, bandwidth, and
    topology that varies. A novel kind of wireless network can be built using topologies
    like bus, star, and mesh and a variety of communication technologies including
    Bluetooth, ZigBee, LTE-M, thread, Sigfox, etc. to communicate data from one node
    to another about the farming field. The edge gateway layer where all sensor node
    data are stored and processed for further analysis is connected to this sensor
    network. The data can be communicated to a different distributed network over
    the internet to a cloud server for additional analysis and monitoring at the user
    end by using application protocols like “Hypertext transfer protocol” (HTTP),
    “Message queuing telemetry transport protocol” (MQTT), etc. The gateway can be
    utilized as single-board microcontrollers and computers similar the Raspberry
    Pi (Charania and Li, 2020). Digital transformation is the main advancement in
    agricultural development which (Baryshnikova et al., 2022) transforms 1.0 into
    5.0 in the twenty-first century. The key to advancing digital transformation in
    smart agriculture from version 5.0 to version 6.0 is the development of wireless
    communication technology. A number of wireless communication technologies, including
    “Long Range Radio (LoRa)”, Radio frequency module (RFM69)“, ”Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)“,
    and ”SigFox“ etc (Hidayat et al., 2020) have been utilised in agriculture. It
    is possible to create a secure smart farm system, also known as a 5G beyond Smart
    agriculture system (Tomaszewski et al., 2022) by fusing several technologies including
    IoT, Edge computing, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and Blockchain
    (Andreadis et al., 2022, Kasera et al., 2022). The ability to manage and achieves
    a variety of computing workloads and necessities for storage can be encouraged
    by developing a hybrid or dispersed sensor network employing cloud computing and
    edge computing. In this regard, edge computing will be able to regulate jobs that
    demand speed or limitations on connectivity. In addition, cloud computing will
    be able to accommodate operations that demand higher processing capabilities,
    for instance, machine learning (MCLRN), as well as managing enormous volumes of
    data by utilizing load-balancing techniques. From this type of technologies farmers
    will be able to access farming field status remotely and the system will be entirely
    automated through interoperability between machines (Li et al., 2021). Considering
    the research strategy that was used to write this review article is discussed

    Fig. 1 denotes the simplified structure of how the review article is organized.
    Based on pre-, during-, and post-harvesting operations, the various IoT-enabled
    smart agriculture literature has been identified and categorized. After classifying
    and reading the literature, each pre-harvesting, during-harvesting, and post-harvesting
    operations’ existing subsystems have been thoroughly discussed and its weaknesses
    analyzed. This analysis has been accomplished based on the IoT-enabled technologies,
    data set gathering, and approaches that have been used in the past and it also
    includes an overall thorough assessment of the pre-, during-, and post-harvesting
    subsystem''s research gaps. Based on this research gap a modified 5G IoT-based
    smart agriculture framework has been proposed to reduce the shortcomings of the
    existing work. The Pre-harvest to post-harvest activities have been categorized
    in this article to explain the existing work for the smart farming system. The
    classification of pre- to post-harvest activities is presented in the Fig. 2.

    to post harvesting subsystem, section (10) a comparison of the proposed 5G based
    smart agriculture framework with existing smart agriculture framework is discussed
    and in last section (11) overall summary of the proposed survey has been discussed.
    2. Pre-harvesting system (PHRS) Throughout the pre-harvest process, there are
    a number of land preparation (LPR) sub-activities that considerably increase agricultural
    yield. Researchers, scientists, and engineers have made a number of advancements
    in the past to create a smart PHRS using smart agriculture technology (Gaikwad
    et al., 2021), that can choose the crop in advance depending on climate conditions,
    region, area, etc. and prepare the land for production. The sub-areas of PHRS
    that are used when preparing the land for farming are depicted in Fig. 3. Download

    PHRS subsystem classification. 2.1. Crop yield prediction (CYP) IoT-based method
    for yield prediction in which sensor node data is shared with data centers (Gayatri
    et al., 2015) and made available to the sons of the soil. To anticipate agricultural
    yield, supervised MCLRN is carried out utilizing (Kumar et al., 2020) the “Random
    Forest” (RADF) and “Decision tree” (DT) algorithm. In this situation the RADF''s
    accuracy is superior compared to the DT''s. A two-tier MCLRN model called the
    “adaptive k-Nearest Centroid Neighbour Classifier (aKNCN)” and the “Extreme Learning
    Machine algorithm (ELM)” were proposed to predict crop yield. By applying ELM
    to (Gupta and Nahar, 2023) increase performance accuracy, the suggested system
    optimize the weights using a modified version of the Butterfly Optimisation Algorithm
    (mBOA). The creation of an algorithm for predicting crop yield (Bhojani and Bhatt,
    2020) three new activation functions called “DharaSig,” “DharaSigm,” and “SHBSig”
    are employed to enhance the neural network''s performance on agricultural datasets.
    K Closest neighbor procedure is employed to identify the crop that is most acceptable
    (Gajula et al., 2021). For the purpose of forecasting the yield of the sorghum
    crop, (Jayaram and Marad, 2012) a fuzzy inference approach is implemented. A fuzzy
    model''s input tools are physio-morphological features. Due to estimates and ambiguity,
    the model''s performance depends on quantum data. A method for managing massive
    data and predicting crop productivity three different types of (Fan et al., 2015)
    approaches have been employed that is MapReduce weather data for computing large
    datasets; nearest neighbor weather data for comparing distances across like years;
    and, finally, an “Autoregressive moving average” (ARMA) model for forecasting.
    To determine crop yield, a “Support vector machine” (SVM) and DT approach are
    used. While choosing (Reshma et al., 2020) features for a specific location, factors
    like soil type, temperature, humidity, groundwater level, local population, farmers''
    availability, variety of plantations, and variety of farmed land were taken into
    account. Analysis has been conducted based on these traits to determine the optimal
    crop. A mixed MCLRN approach was put forth to estimate agricultural yield. The
    most precise (Anbananthen et al., 2021) MCLRN prediction from two models is combined
    using the stacking generalization model. Cross-validation is used to evaluate
    a hybrid MCLRN model''s performance to that of other MCLRN models for evaluation.
    For the purpose of predicting agricultural yield (Sajja et al., 2021) an MCLRN
    simulation is designed, where crop segments are built up experimentally for the
    training of models using SVM, random forest, and ID3. In which case SVM outperforms
    other methods. The key advantage of the current CYP is that most systems classify
    soil nutrients and geographic data for crop yield prediction using data mining
    techniques like KNN, ID3 and fuzzy inference systems, which produce superior prediction
    outcomes. The geographic information was gathered using a GPS approach that is
    IoT-enabled. The RGB-D camera is utilized as a mobile platform to enhance the
    CYP. Crop quality, data-driven decision-making, cost reduction, and resource optimization
    are all improved by using IoT-enabled data mining approaches. The shortcomings
    of the existing techniques are as follows: prediction based on time series analysis,
    area-wise analysis, soil quality analysis, country-wise analysis, and geospatial
    analysis remain to be explored. There is no hybrid MCLRN algorithm for handling
    huge datasets. Full IoT based system still need to be worked upon. 2.2. Crop selection
    (CSL) Enhancing Agricultural Sustainability through Crowdsensing (Ginige and Sivagnanasundaram,
    2019) a mobile-based agricultural information-sharing system is developed for
    monitoring real-time farming activities (CSL LPR, “seed selection”, “seed sowing”,
    “irrigation, “crop growth”, “fertilizing”, and “harvesting”) with the help of
    a crop calendar marker. IoT-based system for crop selection and monitoring precision
    farming (Bhojwani et al., 2020) various sensors are employed to measure environmental
    variables and interface with the microprocessor. An IoT gateway using ESP8266
    sends the data acquired to a cloud server. On the basis of data collected earlier
    from the cloud server, the existing working model uses K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
    to estimate prospective predictions to be able to make precise decisions about
    what crops to grow in a particular environment. Maximize the crop yield (Kumar
    et al., 2015) for selecting which crops to cultivate over a season the MCLRN method
    predict yield rates based on environmental variables including weather, soil type,
    water density, and crop type. Smart agriculture-based crop selection analysis
    utilising (Tseng et al., 2019) big data a platform is created to track environmental
    elements on a farm and use those environmental factors to evaluate farmers'' agricultural
    practices. The findings suggest that farmers can determine a crop''s suitability
    for their land with greater insight. This is so they can take a look at things
    like soil moisture levels and temperature. The suggested environmental factor
    analysis methodology aids farmers in learning which crops they can produce. In
    order to optimize food production (Udutalapally et al., 2021) an innovative agricultural
    solution is proposed that uses AI and IoT for selecting crops, disease monitoring,
    and automated irrigation systems. The fuzzy MULTIMOORA technology on (Balezentiene
    et al., 2013) language and numerical reasoning is provided as a fuzzy-based system
    for crop selection in Lithuanian climatic conditions. “Johnson''s reduct” classifier
    method is used (Deepa and Ganesan, 2019) to produce classification rules for three
    crops, including rice, “groundnut”, and “sugarcane”, in a decision-based system
    for crop selection. According to present environmental (Bakthavatchalam et al.,
    2022) circumstances a system has been established for precision agriculture that
    uses IoT and classifier-based MCLRN algorithms to recommend the crop for irrigation
    and acquire the highest yield. AI for characterization and forecasting the (Amkor
    and El Barbri, 2023) results of potato samples cultivated with “Nitrogen”, “Phosphorus”,
    “Potassium” (NPK) fertilizers has been suggested in which KNNs are used for classification
    and nonlinear autoregressive models for prediction. Machine learning and artificial
    intelligence advancements for the existing CSL system improve the decision-making
    for planting crops according to climate conditions and location. By using IoT-enabled
    solar power-based crop recommendation systems, energy consumption is reduced.
    Genetic optimization is the most common method for optimizing CSL performance.
    Crop guidance is improved when weather conditions are forecasted through the development
    of a crop calendar-based system. Some of the shortcomings may be as follows: the
    current CSL solution lacks self-sustainability, testing for additional crops,
    security of sensor node data, system optimization, and subsystem integration.
    2.3. Seed selection (SSL) A tillage drip architecture is used for recommending
    seeds for (Indira et al., 2018) planting. Additionally, it discusses how effective
    seed selection based on soil can produce precise results. Seed selection is possible
    in the first phase, automatic watering is covered in the second phase, and plant
    disease diagnosis is covered in the third phase. A computer vision to identify
    (Koklu and Ozkan, 2020) different dry bean seed kinds the user interface was created
    using MATLAB, and 13,611 grains of seven different types of dry beans were photographed.
    The model has undergone 20-fold cross-validation and has been constructed using
    a variety of MCLRN classification methods, including MLP, SVM, KNN, and DT. When
    compared to other classification model results, SVM performance performed better.
    Deep-learning methods for seed classification were proposed in which fourteen
    (Hamid et al., 2022) different types of seeds were gathered and pre-trained using
    “MobileNetV2″ to create a model. The trained model claimed accuracy of 98 % on
    the training set and 95 % on the test set after rigorous experiments, extensive
    pre-processing, and fine-tuning. The advantage of the current SSL system is that
    it chooses the appropriate seeds for individual fields using a computer vision-based
    method based on MCLRN and AI. Water, insecticides, and fertilisers may all be
    used more efficiently by farmers. This has good effects on the environment in
    addition to lowering costs. The existing work lacks a fully automated system and
    limited use of data. Need more research for various types of seed classification
    based on climate condition, geographical region wise, and land wise. 2.4. Seed
    germination (SGM) Proposed and created a smart germination assistance (SGA) system
    for SGM. “Temperature”, “humidity”, “light intensity”, “moisture”, and soil “pH”
    are all factors that (Islam et al., 2019) affect SGM. Using particular sensors,
    the system continuously measures the values of various factors in the surrounding
    environment. Each sensor reading from a different seed is kept and connected to
    an ideal value. Using a low-power embedded system (Shadrin et al., 2019) an AI
    method is proposed that can recognise SGM dynamics without necessitating heavy
    data transfer between nearby nodes. 97 % accuracy is attained with a “convolutional
    neural networks” (CNNs) model for seed recognition. A system based on the IoT
    was proposed to monitor, manage, and (Theparod and Harnsoongnoen, 2022) collect
    data regarding the effects of narrow-band light emitting diodes (LEDs) on sunflower
    nodes. With the help of “narrow-band LEDs” and dynamic germination, it was found
    through research that the germination of sunflower seeds was more successful in
    the red-light zones. IoT-based study is carried out for indoor tomato SGM (Seyar
    and Ahamed, 2023) systems at thresholds. Where transplanted seedlings were grown
    outdoors with a comparison of two irrigation systems using soil water balance
    methods with a long-range LoRa communication system, and the subsurface drip irrigation
    system produced the highest seedling levels of growth based on agronomical parameters
    at a 12 % threshold. A feature of the current SGM system is the usage of a LoRa-based
    data communication system for various modules during the SGM process, such as
    irrigation and seed growing status. For the dynamic seed germination process,
    the usage of IoT-based “narrow-band LEDs” produces better results. The system
    in place uses only one type of seed for testing, and it is not entirely IoT-based.
    As a result, there is a lack of a fully validated testbed system that uses an
    ideal sensor, is self-sustaining, and can be utilised for other crops. The current
    system still has flaws as it does not deal with plant biomass growth, flowering,
    fruits, and other types of crops utilising IoT-based technique and image processing
    algorithm. 2.5. Drought or flood monitoring (DFM) A “WPART” IoT-enabled smart
    farming system is established that uses MCLRN (Rezk et al., 2021) to anticipate
    crop productivity and drought for informed decision-making. The following data
    factors are used to pick features: year, month, rainfall, temperature, air pressure,
    season, crop, “area”, “production”, and productivity. An IoT-based tackle has
    been put up for agricultural drought (Ping, 2014) data transmission and accumulating.
    The outcome shows that the system''s data capture and transmission performance
    is flawless, and it has good application value for gathering and analysing agricultural
    drought data. An MCLRN/IoT-based flood tracking system is portrayed (Rani et al.,
    2020) to gauge the water level in a flood-prone site. The intensity of floods
    is gauged using raindrop and water sensors. An IoT-based dam water monitoring
    alerting system is developed (Ganesh et al., 2022) for calculating how much rain
    fell, one may determine how much water will be released from the dam. The signal
    is analysed and judgements are made using the Arduino UNO. IoT data collection
    in real-time and MCLRN analysis and drought result prediction are two benefits
    of the current DFM. For obtaining and analysing data on agricultural drought,
    the gearbox performance is faultless, and it has strong application value. Absence
    of a long-term analysis based on previously established value and absence of coverage
    based on humidity and rainfall across a vast area were observed. There is lack
    of long-distance data connection methods in remote fields. The absence of dark
    shadow detection in the current technology makes it difficult to detect noisy
    pixels values in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for flooded regions, which can
    lead to erroneous data. 2.6. Soil testing and measurement (STM) The optical transducer
    is used as a detecting sensor. This sensor (Goswami et al., 2020) comprises of
    three LEDs as a light source and an as “Light detector” (LDR) for assessing the
    results of soil tests performed on four distinct types of soils. Each nutrient''s
    threshold values divide its level into three voltage levels: Low, Mid, and High.
    A technique for monitoring soil health utilising four dynamic parameters was developed.
    In which the (Ramson et al., 2021) effectiveness of a network made up of nine
    soil health monitoring units was tested over the course of several weeks in an
    agricultural field site. Soil sensing, wireless range, power consumption, life
    expectancy, and implementation cost were all evaluated. An IoT-powered soil health
    tracking (Sengupta et al., 2021) approach that can manage agricultural parameters
    has been created. The variations in stimuli, including those related to light,
    heat, sound, motion, magnetic fields, etc., are converted into electrical signals
    by a sensor node and then processed and graphically displayed by the Thingspeak
    cloud server. Using cellphones or personal computers, a methodology is proposed
    for sensing (Saikia and Khatoon, 2022) the percentage of wetness of the soil and
    temperature remotely and continuously. Raspberry Pi-based soil nutrient monitoring
    system for tomato plantations is proposed using various soil sensors (Manickam,
    2020) such as PH and Soil NPK sensors for monitoring the soil continuously. The
    present STM''s strongest point is its use of an IoT-enabled method to assess soil
    health. Thanks to the existing technology that farmers can precisely administer
    fertilisers, insecticides, and water based on the soil''s nutrients, PH, and type,
    crop disease is reduced, and crop yields are increased. There are still lack of
    sensor assessment based on a specified period, in-depth data analysis, additional
    parameters for optimising soil testing in various existing activities etc. There
    is a demand for an affordable, universal solution that can be used to all kinds
    of farms. 2.7. Weather prediction & monitoring (WPM) An agro weather station (AWS)
    that is intended for farmers and researchers is (Faid et al., 2021) develop using
    four layers: perception, transmission, presentation, and administration. For various
    end users, it offers frequently data and AI-based insights. IoT-based intelligent
    energy-efficient approaches have been originated for monitoring and managing greenhouse
    interior temperatures. Many (Subahi and Bouazza, 2020) simulations utilizing a
    greenhouse temperature transfer function are run to show the usefulness of the
    recommended strategy. For temperature and irrigation control a computerized procedure
    is acquired. Using an Android app that connects (Kori et al., 2021) to the controller,
    many agricultural parameters, including as temperature, humidity, soil wetness,
    and rainfall, are tracked and visualised. A strategy to schedule weather forecasts
    was put out in order to foresee (Li et al., 2019) adoption of weather prediction
    information as well as future energy harvesting values based on historical harvesting
    values. A low-cost solar-powered (Devapal, 2020) soil and weather analysis system
    has been offered that looks at different soil properties and weather patterns
    to set up a high-tech smart farm for farmers. IoT, data mining, and android mobile
    applications are all used in the system''s development. Integrating a provincial
    weather station with dual modules to serve as a LoRa-based soil sensor node (Singh
    et al., 2022) for scrutinizing the state of the soil and the weather. During experiment,
    a LoRa portable communication device and an IoT cloud are used to transmit meteorological
    data. Constructed, and tested a flexible (El-magrous et al., 2019) meteorological-soil
    sensor station for acquiring site-specific maps of soil elements, atmospheric
    information, and yield information for the 2018 soybeans season of cultivation.
    Farmers were able to make well-informed decisions on soil selection, irrigation,
    planting, and harvesting thanks to the use of sophisticated tools for weather
    forecasting and data from already-existing systems. The existing weather monitoring
    and forecasting systems have a number of drawbacks, including the absence of AI
    fault detection approaches, a lack of integration with the existing IoT-based
    agriculture system, and a lack of optimize long-range communication technologies.
    There is a need for an intelligent weather system that can identify the soil''s
    nutritional needs and suggest a suitable crop. 2.8. Soil digging (SDG) To enhance
    tillage processes more significant by fusing IoT, “cloud computing”, and “Decision
    support system” (DESS) technologies (Fawzi et al., 2021) the ”Tillage Operations
    Quality Optimization (TOQO)“ model is constructed using two levels: ”Tillage Depth
    1 (TD1)“ and ”Tillage Depth 2 (TD2)“. TD1 = 10–15 cm and TD2 = 25–30 cm. The TOQO
    standard''s tested results improve long-term evolution for the agribusiness by
    maximizing farmer expenditures, accelerating field productivity, and optimizing
    tillage routines. Real-time monitoring of soil-digging machinery, which enables
    farmers to optimise the depth and spacing of rows or holes, is a strength of the
    current system. This accuracy supports resource utilisation that is efficient
    and minimises reductions in waste. Due to the significant differences in soil
    properties, such as moisture content and hardness, the current system needs to
    be improved in terms of performance, affordability, and sensor calibration. Analysis
    to reduce the environmental impact of soil tilling is still lacking in the system.
    More accurate measurements may be possible by the use of the cutting-edge MCLRN
    algorithm. The average growth rate of research publications published between
    2012 and 2023 for PHRS applications that are based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other
    techniques is shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (193KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Publication growth rate analysis of PHRS application
    based on IoT and AI, MCLRN and other methodology from 2012 to 2023. The growth
    rate of publication has been assessed based on the quantity of articles published
    in a given year for a specific PHRS application, such as CYP, CSL, SSL, SGM, DFM,
    STM, WPM, and SDG, and the average growth rate analysis has been assessed based
    on the overall quantity of publications for PHRS application year-wise. As observed
    in Fig. 4 graph, a growing number of publications based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and
    other approaches for PHRS application are made each year, with a high percentage
    of IoT-based PHRS applications. Thus, it can be concluded that the number of PHRS-based
    smart agriculture applications is growing steadily as a result of the convergence
    of IoT, edge, cloud, and AI technologies. 3. During harvesting system (DHRS) After
    preparing the land for the cultivation of crops, there are numerous sub-operations
    engaged during harvesting. The subsystem of the DHRS is shown in Fig. 5. Using
    cutting-edge technologies to automate crop monitoring and irrigation (IoT, MCLRN,
    Data Mining, etc.). It not only emphasises the value of improved production but
    also strongly emphasises data analytics and environmental sustainability. This
    is done to assess the needs and anticipate the compatibility of crops and fertilisers
    in light of the soil and environment. Download : Download high-res image (261KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. DHRS subsystem classification. A wireless
    sensor network is essential for the implementation of smart agriculture (Haseeb
    et al., 2020). There are numerously IoT-enabled prior related work that has been
    done (Ahmed et al., 2018, Anagha et al., 2023, Sah Tyagi et al., 2021) in the
    domain of during the harvesting process. 3.1. Smart irrigation (SIR) Low-cost
    intelligent smart irrigation system using IoT is proposed in three modules. Combined
    (Nawandar and Satpute, 2019) sensor module, irrigation module, and sensor communication
    module. The combined sensor module is used to access crop, plantation, and soil-related
    information. After accessing sensor monitoring data it uses a neural network model
    to make an intelligent decision. These decisions are sent to an irrigation module
    and sensor communication module. The aforementioned data determines whether the
    water machine has to be turned on or off in a certain location. The system keeps
    track of incoming data, and the sensor communication module logs it via the MQTT
    broker. The “AtMega 328” microcontroller and (Saraf and Gawali, 2017) Zigbee communications
    are used to monitor and control sensor data in the existing work. Each field''s
    central node stores sensor data in the cloud database. The report on automatic
    irrigation is delivered to a user via an Android application. An intelligent irrigation
    (Alomar and Alazzam, 2018) system is achieved using IoT and fuzzy logic. As environmental
    variables, air climate and humidity sensors, soil wetness sensors, and light intensity
    sensors are used. By utilizing all the sensor information, a Mamdani fuzzy controller
    controls the flow of water. IoT, a DPLRN, and fuzzy computation are combined to
    form an ecosystem for creating a self-sustaining irrigation system. Soil wetness,
    atmospheric (P. Patel et al., 2022) variables, and the state of crops are all
    input variables in this operational simulation. Leveraging the Raspberry Pi, a
    device called an IoT gateway allows for uploading data to the cloud. To estimate
    if a crop is healthy or slumping, an assortment of DPLRN algorithms are used.
    In order to determine the appropriate time to irrigate the crops, all measured
    input variables are analyzed with a fuzzy logic controller. RFID and sensors to
    establish an efficient farm tracking framework exploiting (Saha et al., 2022)
    “Long range wide area network” (LoRaWAN) protocol with six distinct harvesting
    issues, prohibiting fungal attacks on crops, screening cattle, appropriate watering,
    accurate soil wellness inspection, accurate inspection of crops, and enhancing
    productivity. It maintains appropriate irrigation while conserving water by using
    incredibly effective temperature and humidity sensors. Four distinct categories
    of sensors are used in the soil and crop wellness tracking system to gauge the
    “NDVI” readings of the crops, the “pH” rating of the soil, the percentage of nutrients
    that are contained in the soil, the soil''s compaction, and the amount of water
    in the soil. Cowlar is used by the cattle monitoring system to continuously check
    on the health of the cows. Smart farm decision-making powered by IoT and the cloud
    system that has been designed in order to communicate sensor (Lova Raju and Vijayaraghavan,
    2022) data using “NRF24L01” modules. A suitable irrigation is schedule in which
    the author, without (Sayanthan et al., 2018) the assistance of labour, employed
    an Arduino soil moisture analyzer to measure water requirements at various phases
    of eggplant growth. Using an “Arduino Uno R3” board and an “Arduino DUE”, the
    (Jamroen et al., 2020) intelligent irrigation system is scheduled. For data connectivity,
    the “NRF24L01” module is intended. The current method guards against crop water
    stress situations using a fuzzy inference system. The MCLRN-enabled autonomous
    watering mechanism has been constructed. The raspberry pi and (Vij et al., 2020)
    Arduino mega are two different types of microcontrollers employs in this method.
    The Arduino Mega is equipped with a number of sensors. Arduino Mega sends sensor
    data to Raspberry Pi through the wifi module. Weather data will be retrieved using
    an open-source Application programing interface (API), and a raspberry pi will
    operate to alert a system using weather data and sensor node data. A soil type''s
    propensity for irrigation is predicted using MCLRN. A way to regulating irrigation
    (Mohammed et al., 2023) systems using DPLRN that takes into account the moisture
    and soil structure. In their methodology, soil pictures and moisture sensors are
    used to gather data, which is then processed using real-time videos to determine
    the crop''s need for irrigation and moisture levels. A “VGG-19” model analyses
    the type of image and crop seeded to predict irrigation needs. “TensorFlow” lite
    is used to run experiments on cheap computational hardware and test the proposed
    model on a private dataset. A remote irrigation water pump monitoring, management,
    and (Kirar, 2022) security is developed. The sensors used in this work to detect
    supply voltage and motor current to estimate operating conditions and offer protection.
    The user receives the measured parameters via the SIM900 GSM component regarding
    the intent of remote oversight and management. The Android application was created
    with a better user interface, timer-based functionality, notifications for feedback
    and pump status, among other features. An ATmega 328P microprocessor that is included
    into the Arduino Uno board protects the pump. To track agricultural factors like
    temperature and relative humidity (Hamouda and Elhabil, 2017) a greenhouse smart
    management mechanism is suggested. The watering and cooling of greenhouses are
    managed and controlled automatically by the system. An intelligent system is created
    to track and control several subsystems, including irrigation, (Cecchetti and
    Ruscelli, 2022) lighting, heating, and solar. To enable sensor data to be connected
    to the farm Ethernet network, RS485 bus Ethernet convertor is employed. Automation
    of the heating system, irrigation system, circulation pump, and solenoid valve
    are accomplished using a relay board coupled to a Raspberry Pi 4 microcontroller,
    which is controlled using the HTTP. PHP scripts handle the system''s overall business
    logic. A connected device WSN is created using the “SIXFAB” module (Kiani and
    Seyyedabbasi, 2018) to irrigate crops in agricultural fields, and the Arduino
    component of the module transmits data to a Raspberry Pi-based IoT gateway. One
    of the strengths of the existing SIR system is its use of WSNs and machine learning
    techniques for monitoring and scheduling irrigation of crops for large and small
    farming fields by collecting wet and dry soil data according to the climate and
    soil condition, which ensures crops are irrigated at the right time and irrigation
    systems optimize crop growth. There should be irrigation and crop-specific field
    monitoring, which are weaknesses of the current approaches. The current system
    relies on a single kind of irrigation for a variety of crops. There are lackings
    of self-sustaining system and sensor calibration system. Based on the soil nutrients,
    moisture, temperature, and humidity, more data analysis needs to be done. Heuristic
    techniques for improving irrigation and minimising water use are still lacking.
    To prevent water waste for different crops, the water irrigation system can be
    scheduled or rain harvesting strategies need to be used. Transparency of sensor
    data is lacking. The current process is unable to communicate with another system.
    The system''s performance can be enhanced by using simple cryptographic techniques
    to safeguard data flowing from all the sensors. Communication over long distances
    for data is still unpredictable. 3.2. Soil health monitoring and fertilizer management
    (SHMFM) A methodical approach that accumulates instantaneous data from the farm
    site, such as light strength, wetness of the soil, surface temperature, humidity,
    etc was proposed to provide local access (Bachuwar et al., 2018) to soil temperature,
    humidity, soil wetness, and light intensity, an ESP826612E transmits sensor data
    over a Wi-Fi network using the “IEEE 802.11” protocol. A method to produce data
    sources made up of temperature, humidity, and N, P, and K nutrient content (Rahman
    et al., 2019) that are produced from soil data sensor readings. In order to create
    a soil fertility data warehouse, sensor data is uploaded using IoT technologies.
    By combining Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and Light Emitting Diodes (LED) in
    a novel NPK sensor (G et al., 2020) an IoT-based system took into account. To
    determine whether N, P, and K deficiencies exist in the soil chosen for testing,
    the Mamdani inference procedure is used. At regular intervals, the farmer is alerted
    to the quantity of fertilizer to be applied. A technique that (Postolache et al.,
    2022) can aid in the evaluation of changes in soil nutrients for more effective
    administration of drainage and fertiliser control. The appliance may gather information
    on the amount of NPK in the soil, further information on soil temperature, conductivity,
    pH, and moisture. A solar fertigation control mechanism for watering using a hybrid
    model and forecasting control (Ahmad et al., 2022) is built on a weather-based
    system accompanied by a crop a repository controlled by real-time sensors that
    keep track of the water condition of the plants as well as the soil moisture and
    water quality. The continuous gauging system for evaluating the water in the soil
    and nutrients for citrus (Zhang et al., 2017) moisture and nutrient status in
    citrus orchards, so that fruit farmers can understand their orchard''s condition
    in time and adjust fertilization and irrigation strategies according to the data.
    To make it simpler for farmers to plant citrus seeds, (Pratama et al., 2021) an
    IoT-enabled gadget that indicates the soil''s nutrients for citrus seedlings using
    a “NPK” indicators and feeds the outcomes to the Thingspeak cloud. A soil wetness
    monitoring system was developed using LoRaWAN detectors with (Hossain et al.,
    2022) blended transmission modules, no in-field root stations or routers, and
    an unmanned aircraft system (UAS)-based mobile router to retrieve the gauges of
    soil wetness taken from buried indicators for a variety of crops. A continuous
    measurement system is proposed for soil nutrition content using an automated fertilizer
    unit for (Visvesvaran et al., 2021) greenhouse systems. The fertilizer system
    automatically provides the plants with the nutrients required once the measurement
    value reduces under the trigger value. The NodeMSU is utilized throughout the
    system for data communication. The performance of the LoRaWAN network beats that
    of the current system for long-distance data transmission, and the “Mamdani inference”
    optimization method based on IoT fuzzy logic yields the best results for measuring
    soil health. From the discussion above, it can be seen that the current system
    has some drawbacks, such as a lack of standardisation due to the fact that different
    soil sensors use different data formats and protocols to collect data. Due to
    the dependence of soil temperature on climate, sensor calibration is still lacking.
    To better manage soil surface and fertilisation, the current system has to be
    optimized. 3.3. Disease detection and analysis (DDAN) For autonomously identifying
    and categorising plant diseases from leaf photos, a DPLRN algorithm is suggested.
    Using the collected images, (Sladojevic et al., 2016) CNNs are trained and validated
    along with fine-tuning. A convolutional neural network model with squeeze net
    architecture is utilised (Hidayatuloh et al., 2018) to distinguish between healthy
    and diseased tomato plant leaves. There are four steps to creating a DPLRN based
    (Andrianto et al., 2020) smartphone application for spotting rice plant diseases.
    These are creating a system architecture for plant disease detection, creating
    a cloud server application and a smartphone application, testing the smartphone
    application, and assessing the system''s performance. The MLP simulation of plant
    diseases, which acquires information as 10 characteristics and 4139 data points,
    was put forward as a real-time (Kumar et al., 2021) detection method. The four
    common forms of disorders are accurately detected by the neural network. An app
    for cellphones that makes use of deep convolutional neural networks to (Pallagani
    et al., 2019) anticipate crop diseases. A total of 38 different diseases have
    been predicted by the app. Farmers everywhere can make use of it even without
    an internet connection. Controlling a pandemic illness with an IoT-based gauge
    is a crucial agricultural (Khattab et al., 2019) application. The system architecture
    can forecast a variety of plant diseases, and the model has been put to the test
    on tomato and potato crops in lab settings. An electronic method designed to communicate
    with mobile phones (Nagasubramanian et al., 2021) to manipulate disease classification,
    environmental objects, and farmer suggestions. MCLRN algorithms, SVMs, and CNNs
    are used to develop the farming suggestion. A leaf detection analysis is put forward
    using (Thorat et al., 2017) an assortment of sensors, such as temperature and
    soil moisture meters, etc. After processing, the leaf image is collected and uploaded
    to the server. The status of the leaf disease is also communicated to the farmer
    via the mobile app. Using “MDFC-ResNet” and DPLRN-based IoT (Hu et al., 2020)
    devices, a crop diagnosis of illnesses IoT system for several crop types is being
    developed. A publicly accessible collection of 54,306 pictures of ailing and healthy
    plant leaves has been assembled (Mohanty et al., 2016) in which a deep CNNs was
    utilised to identify 14 crop types and 26 illnesses from this controlled sample.
    An IoT-based system that uses MCLRN to deliver conveniently (Truong et al., 2017)
    available real-time local environmental data in rural crop fields. With the method,
    it is possible to both identify fungal illnesses and forecast their potential
    spread among crop fields. A “Tiny Machine Learning” (TinyMl)-based technique for
    plant disease identification is designed. Once the model has been trained using
    (Adeola et al., 2022) MCLRN methods, it is transformed into a lightweight model
    with a kilobyte (KB) size that can be placed into devices with external memory.
    Tensorflow lite is used to perform the model conversion with the already installed
    library. The existing method''s strength is its effectiveness in locating the
    illness at the plant''s root system using information on the soil and environment
    of a given region. The performance of the “Tiny Machine Learning” (TinyMl)-based
    technique to identify the kind of sickness was superior to that of existing DPLRN
    systems. For gathering a vast number of statistics on various plants and climatic
    circumstances, the aforementioned existing method still has several shortcomings.
    Lack of ability to detect and control various diseases. To identify plant diseases,
    several existing systems used CNN-based DPLRN algorithms, but the algorithm performance
    still has to be optimized in terms of accuracy, usefulness and real time plant
    disease analysis. 3.4. Pathogens detection (PDT) Biosensors possessed the ability
    to develop into the forefront of diagnostic techniques for various fields of biological
    studies, which comprises immediate assessment of human blood (Sonu and Chaudhary,
    2022) ingredients for both animal and plant infection recognition, environmental
    surveillance, and airborne pathogen identification. As a result variety of techniques
    for detection of (R. Patel et al., 2022) plant pathogens and mechanisms of biosensing
    systems have been examined, whose two main categories of conventional analytical
    methods for the detection of plant diseases are the “Digital droplet polymerase
    chain reaction” and the “Quantum dots-based biosensor”. The exploration of techniques
    for agricultural disease detection is the overall strength of the present work.
    The analysis illustrates the benefits of miniaturized sensors in terms of convenience
    in production; affordability, speed of reaction, and responsiveness, establishing
    those instruments useful for observations in the field. In terms of high levels
    of automation, the work currently being done for pathogen detection still has
    a research gap. It is lacking sensor standardisation. It is necessary to improve
    the methods for detecting various pathogen types, sensor calibration, dataset
    gathering, and technology integration. A cheap sensor needs to be deployed in
    the creation of an affordable, eco-friendly system. Due to the need for further
    optimisation of IoT-enabled systems, there is still a gap in field testing. 3.5.
    Pest controlling (PCN) IoT and CNN-based insect recognition techniques are combined
    in a system. The technology is (Ramalingam et al., 2020) utilized by pest management
    businesses to keep an eye on pests in a variety of settings, including food storage
    areas, hospitals, gardens, etc. Using the IoT for crop monitoring and pest control
    (Tian et al., 2021) an infrastructure for simultaneous and collaborative simulation
    strategy has been provided. Based on the results, the applied simulation with
    IoT assistance system is the most efficient and accurate solution. An artificial
    IoT and DPLRN (Chen et al., 2020) technology can be used to analyze crop growth
    and predict pest occurrences in an environment. A neural network algorithm called
    “You Only Look Once (YOLO)” is used to identify pests in images. A system for
    the detection and control of pests embedded in an embedded environment is proposed
    in which (Vijayalakshmi et al., 2019) if the acceptable limit gets surpassed in
    terms of both temperature and humidity, then the “raspberry pi” captures the image
    of the plant and compares it to the database, and if pests are found, the farmers
    are notified to fertilize. A “Multi-Agent System (MAS)” by deploying a (Debauche
    et al., 2020) Docker environment orchestrated by “Kubernetes” in the Edge AI-IoT
    architecture is constructed. The system utilizes an AI algorithm to identify plant
    diseases and pests and uses an irrigation pivot to treat the crop. The positive
    aspects of MCLRN algorithms like KNN and the (Materne and Inoue, 2018) linear
    regression framework are used to construct a prediction model in a plantation
    to forecast disease and insect outbreaks. The upside of already-existing systems
    is that building a decentralized and accordance simulation structure with the
    IoT for pest control and crop monitoring in combination to increase crop yields,
    lessens the load on one GPU, and contributes to the operation evenly and concurrently
    with all accessible GPUs and perceives data. Based on the usefulness of data,
    the current pest management method still has a gap. For a robotic technique based
    on DPLRN to detect different kinds of insects and rodents, the current solution
    still has to be improved. Due to various data formats and IoT protocols, there
    are still issues when integrating the current system with another system. The
    amount of manual field monitoring by farmers can be decreased, for example, by
    merging deep irrigation systems with current pest management techniques. By including
    preprocessing to normalise the image before the prediction to minimise the effects
    of photo exposure (varying light intensity in outdoor situations), plant disease
    and pest detection can be enhanced. IoT-based security and privacy of sent data
    still require improvement. 3.6. Weed detection (WDT) Robotic weed control that
    uses MCLRN and IoT to detect weeds in onion fields and (Arakeri et al., 2017)
    spray them with the required herbicide. Installing a weed detecting system in
    a chilli (Islam et al., 2021) field using RADF, KNN, and SVM, among other MCLRN
    and image processing algorithms. Systems were built using MATLAB. In order to
    identify weeds in soybean crops (Razfar et al., 2022) a DPLRN based vision-based
    weed identification system is prepared. Three unique CNNs models and MobileNetV2
    are employed in the five-layer DPLRN architecture. In order to increase agricultural
    productivity (Dasgupta et al., 2020) a concept is suggested by utilizing wireless
    sensor networks and AI models for crop forecast and weed identification. In this
    approach, MCLRN is used to create a model after data are collected from sensors
    via WSN. CNN is used in conjunction with this to detect marijuana in drone-taken
    photo. An algorithm is designed based on CNNs to identify and (Jabir and Falih,
    2022) locate weeds in wheat harvests in the region of Beni Mellal-Khenifra, Morocco,
    using an intelligent system. The YOLO model is used to construct a real-time detection
    and identification model on the Raspberry Pi. A network is established for detecting
    weeds (Kulkarni and Angadi, 2019) using a CNN. The CNN is constructed as a pooling
    layer, and the activation function is a “ReLU”. A remote-controlled robot based
    on a Raspberry (Dankhara et al., 2019) Pi is used to detect weed using an image
    processing technique. A model has been formed for precision (Karthikeyan et al.,
    2021) agriculture based on K-means clustering to classify weed plants. A “CNN”
    technique associated with IoT is used for image processing. When compared to another
    neural network technique, the performance of a WSN employing a Raspberry-based
    system with the DPLRN approach is superior. More accurate results were obtained.
    The above-discussed existing work has flaws based on real-time mobile application
    monitoring of weed detection; more parameters can be added to make the DPLRN model
    performance optimised so that real-time weed can be detected accurately; and analysis
    of weed mapping method still has a gap where more research can be carried out.
    Improvements still need to be made to real-time UAV-based technique optimisation.
    The existing system does not incorporate the integration of various environmental
    sensors, actuators, or feedback controllers for monitoring. More research is still
    needed to develop a custom deep learning algorithm that can identify different
    weed types based on plants. 3.7. Crop losses (CLO) To gain an adequate understanding
    of crop health, an apparatus has been (Shafi et al., 2020) put together that combines
    multi-modal data from the IoT nodes and drone photos. The fused data was subjected
    to MCLRN and DPLRN algorithms for crop health classification and creating health
    maps. Data from the sensor nodes is transmitted via a LoRa module. The system
    is intended to design, develop, and test a next generation of automated (Pérez-Ruiz
    et al., 2015) and robotic systems for efficient pest management in agriculture
    and forestry operations using a real-time kinematics (RTK) and “Global positioning
    system” (GPS) controlled autonomous tractor for straight-line tracking. A drone-based
    system is designed in which a “Raspberry Pi” module is integrated (Saha et al.,
    2018) with an array of 64 separate temperature sensors over 12C, an RGB-D camera
    for taking real-time photos, and a GPS navigation module. The cloud server receives
    and stores all sensor data. A system that makes use of multiple sensors to assess
    the temperature, humidity, pH level and scent of the leaves is compared and examined
    (Giri Babu and Anjan Babu, 2020) to check if the gathered leaf values fall within
    the range specified in the actual dataset for tracking crop health. Using IoT
    and remote sensing (Shukla et al., 2021) a method is proposed for agricultural
    health monitoring. To identify healthy crops, IOT-connected UAVs and MCLRN are
    used. Prescription maps are important because they make use of resources like
    pesticides, water, and fertilizers. Farmers are able to decide what resources
    are necessary to ensure that crops are healthy at every stage of growth. An IoT
    platform is constructed that uses image processing and a classifier algorithm
    to detect plant illnesses. If an (Ayalew et al., 2022) automatic medicine system
    identifies ailments, a sprinkler sprays medication. Additionally, disease transmission
    is tracked based on changes in weather using soil humidity and temperature sensors.
    An automated decision-making (Grimblatt et al., 2021) tools and metrics that track
    plant development and health, which have an immediate and measurable effect on
    farmers'' ability to produce crops. Experiments are carried out using two separate
    sensors, soil moisture and temperature, to ascertain the significance of each
    parameter as the foundation for plant growth. An agricultural production system
    simulation is designed (Matsumoto et al., 2017) to carry out intricate business-based
    assessments of the abundance of inventories and crop destruction brought on by
    an absence of knowledge about the quantity of food acquired, the number of unit
    crops, and the enlargement of cultivated fields. IoT-Edge module (Park and Kim,
    2021) collects strawberry hydroponic environment data and strawberry photos, allowing
    for monitoring and determining strawberry harvest time. Utilizing a Wide-area
    inexpensively network (LPWAN) based on the “NB-IoT” (Chang et al., 2018) a smart
    lighting system is developed for greenhouses of expensive crops. Using the temperature,
    humidity, and methane gas sensors MQ4, LDR, and DHT11 (Mahfuz et al., 2020) an
    embedded system is established based on microcontrollers. Its purpose is to keep
    track of the atmosphere all over the greenhouse. In the event that any sensor
    value is outside of its acceptable range, the Arduino will send the user a notification
    SMS using a SIM 900 GSM modem. Through the Android app, a new threshold value
    is also configured. The performance of the smart monitoring of healthy crops is
    outperformed by the IoT that utilises drone and hybrid MCLRN to detect healthy
    crops in the growing environment. The data is transmitted quickly and cheaply
    between the edge and the cloud using an LPWAN based on the “NB-IoT”. It has been
    determined through research of the already-existing system previously described
    that there is still a gap in monitoring and controlling the crop from numerous
    losses. The current system is missing data processing steps and robotic sensors
    with intelligence that can detect different soil parameters, such as soil PH,
    soil water levels, and other characteristics. The ability for mobile-based applications
    to provide the end user with real-time access to farming field information from
    any location still needs refinement. For example, alerts for watering plants,
    temperature control notifications, and disease detection alarms based on the disease
    types and how this disease might be controlled. The examination of extensive data
    based on various crop types is still lacking. Because of climatic circumstances,
    dissimilar data formats, and dissimilar communication protocols, the system is
    not self-sustaining; it is dependent on a certain region and environmental condition.
    It is also unable to integrate with another subsystem. Fig. 6 exhibits the average
    annual growth rate of papers on research produced throughout 2012 and 2023 for
    DHRS implementations based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other procedures. Download :

    growth rate analysis of DHRS application based on IoT and AI, MCLRN and other
    methodology from 2012 to 2023. According to Fig. 6, the DHRS application research
    publication growth rate analysis has been conducted similarly to that of the PHRS
    application research publication growth rate analysis. The DHRS publishing analysis
    graph shows an increase in the number of research published articles year over
    year. Comparing IoT-based DHRS applications to AI, MCLRN, and other techniques,
    the publishing growth rate was higher between 2019 and 2022. This is because more
    research is being done on SIR, DDAN, and CLO-based applications. In comparison
    to the period from 2012 to 2018, the average annual growth rate of publications
    for SIR-based applications between 2019 and 2022 has been calculated to be 69.23
    %. In contrast, between 2019 and 2022, the average growth rates for CLO and DDAN,
    respectively, were 53.26 % and 63.98 %. It is therefore possible to predict that
    there will be an increase in the number of research publications using IoT and
    AI-based approaches for developing DHRS applications. 4. Post harvesting system
    (POHRS) When preparing the ground for agricultural cultivation, farmers that practice
    traditional farming face a number of challenges. These challenges were brought
    on by the rising demand for agricultural production, and it is not simple to match
    this rising demand for food processing, storage, and supply. The Fig. 7 shows
    the post-harvesting subsystem in which various existing research work has been
    done based on storage, harvesting cycle, supply chain, food processing, etc. (Abouelsaad
    et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res image (213KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. POHRS subsystem classification. The post-harvest physiology
    and management of fruits and vegetables are covered in this area, along with topics
    like harvesting, handling, packaging, storage, hygienic practises, transportation,
    crop waste, etc. In the context of severe weather, it also covered postharvest
    handling. 4.1. Reaping, sorting, cooling, and storage (RSCS) An agricultural robot
    design is incorporated that would use “Autodesk Fusion 360″ (Sazid et al., 2022)
    and ”Webots Simulator“ for reaping, seed sowing, excavating, unmanned ploughing,
    watering, fertilising, and harvesting. “Proteus 8.9” simulates the complete system.
    For data analysis, “MATLAB” is being used. An IoT-based microcontroller farm robot
    automates the system as a whole. An IoT-based low-cost solution is structured
    in which warehouse''s (Banerjee et al., 2020) hazardous gas, CO2, is detected
    using a gas sensor. Tilts or lateral motions of the rack are picked up by shock
    sensors. To safeguard grains from fire, a warning is issued if a fire flame is
    discovered. The Node-Red dashboard allows a user to view the findings of live
    sensor data anywhere, at any time. IoT has been used to monitor and manage food
    grain waste in warehouses. A “DHT11” indicator (Devi et al., 2021) for temperature
    and humidity, a CO2 sensor for air quality, a PIR sensor for moving object detection,
    and other sensors are integrated using “Arduino” to act as a rat and insect repellant.
    A fan is activated to cool the room if the temperature and humidity are above
    and below, respectively, the threshold levels. All sensor node data is accessible
    on the mobile application. Immediate terms surveillance equipment powered by IoT
    that (Siddiqua et al., 2022) can track temperature, humidity, brightness, and
    gas concentration in freezing storage and notify the user of potentially dangerous
    values when the levels surpass the thresholds. The “Arduino UNO” microcontroller
    regulates sensor data and provides it to the ESP32. The MIT App Inventor is used
    on either a computer or an Android phone to monitor the status of the storage
    room. Using a combination of blockchain technology (Sangeetha et al., 2021) a
    system for gauging crop quality and monitoring storage that links farmers with
    distributors directly. Data is gathered in real-time both in the warehouse and
    on the field. All sensor nodes are linked together using Arduino, and information
    is transmitted to the Raspberry Pi-based IoT gateway using Lora communication.
    Farmers and distributors can visualise and analyse data via a web application,
    which is stored in Azure SQL databases. The invention of a stated IoT-enabled
    warehouse management system in which (Anoop et al., 2021) the NodeMSU microcontroller
    is set up to receive temperature and humidity data in this study. A DT method
    is used to examine the temperature swings that took place in Kerala during the
    past five years. To assess and display the warehouse''s climate state, this climate
    data is transmitted to the cloud server Thingspeak. A system based on IoT is established
    for controlling and monitoring food (Hema et al., 2020) instantaneous grain storage
    and procurement. To monitor the overall status under the granary, the system makes
    use of gauges for climate control, moisture, gas, real-time clocks, and burning
    flame gauges. Sensor data is visualized using the thingSpeak cloud platform. An
    MQTT-based application control warehouse system is developed for fruits and vegetables
    storage. Using MQTT and COAP protocol (Deshmukh and Bhalerao, 2017) sensor information
    can be displayed on a web page and accessed via mobile apps. Compared two techniques,
    ”Evaporative Cooling Chambers“ (ECCs) (Verploegen et al., 2018) and ”clay pot
    coolers,“ and proposed employing non-electric cooling and storage devices as a
    potential solution to the post-harvest warehouse issues in rural Mali. An IoT-enabled
    approach is structured that employs sensors to track the condition of agricultural
    fields and warehouses in real-time. The (Nayak et al., 2022) necessary region
    is surrounded by a number of sensors that can identify any impending dangers and
    notify the appropriate people. The infrastructure for safeguarding the harvested
    crops in the warehouse and monitoring the same in real time through an IoT sensor
    network performs better than the performance of the entire existing system for
    developing refrigeration sections through WSN-based clay pots. The system is affordable
    and accessible to all farmers. The aforementioned summary of current research
    has a number of drawbacks based on harvesting, storing, and cooling. There is
    a dearth of smart alert notifications in the storage system. The current storage
    system still lacks real-time monitoring of insects and rodents. There is a need
    for such a sophisticated intelligent-based algorithm that can regulate the warehouse''s
    temperature automatically in accordance with diverse environmental factors and
    locales. For different fruits and vegetables, storage systems should be based
    on weight and long-term storage capability, which is still lacking in the current
    work. On the security and usability of the system at the user end, there is a
    research gap. To boost the performance of the current system, other sensors can
    be added, including RFID, sound sensors, and various gas sensors. 4.2. Crop waste
    management (CWM) A solution to identify (Chihana et al., 2018) warehouse breaches
    and track grains using IoT prototypes is suggested. The usage of cloud storage,
    WSN, and RFID technologies increases accountability and efficiency while reducing
    theft and administrative mistakes. Using an IR sensor, microcontroller, and Wi-Fi
    module a smart garbage management (Jayalakshmi et al., 2017) system built on IOT.
    After garbage levels reach maximum, dustbins are cleaned as soon as possible.
    A framework is formed for smart (Bong Cassendra P. C. et al., 2018) agriculture
    based on a smart waste management perspective. The author discusses the various
    sensor and communication protocols that can be used to track the waste of crops
    in agriculture. The current system''s main strength is its ability to collect
    data instantaneously on the amount and type of agricultural waste. These data
    are examined using cloud computing to determine where crop waste is accumulating
    and to evaluate the risk of fire, illness, and pest infestation. Satellite images
    and ground-based sensors can be used to monitor crop waste degradation. Farmers
    at present have access to information on greenhouse gas emissions and decomposition
    rates. According to a study of previous research, smart agro-waste control research
    is still in its early stages. Low-energy power sensors and sophisticated techniques
    for managing post-harvest waste are not used. Research is still needed for all
    forms of crop loss management. 4.3. Transportation and tracking (TTN) A three-layer
    perishable generate fog computing model is proposed (Musa and Vidyasankar, 2017)
    in which the RFID-embedded sensors that generate sensor readings for the monitoring
    and control layer are among the data producers. A system for the effective distribution
    and transportation of fresh fruit is developed by utilizing the MQ3 sensor. The
    (Elavarasi et al., 2019) system''s result was that it lessened fruit contamination.
    When damaged fruit is discovered, an SMS is delivered to the user''s mobile device,
    and through a remote, the system removes the spoiled fruit using a pick-and-place
    robot. In this article the author go into great (Onwude et al., 2020) detail about
    how cutting food losses during postharvest cold chain activities might enhance
    food security. IoT and blockchain were suggested (Pervez and Haq, 2019) as a means
    of digitally disrupting supply chains and logistics. The supply-chain architecture
    built on a block chain is designed using a direct acyclic graph data structure.
    The IoT-based technologies used in the management of the agricultural supply chain
    in a developing nation like India are discussed. Real-time data sharing (Luthra
    et al., 2018) uses embedded components including actuators, sensors, and network
    connectivity. Digital technologies enable the (Dadi et al., 2021) creation of
    effective agri-food supply networks. “Big data” and IoT are a combination of several
    technologies that the system uses to evaluate enormous amounts of information
    quickly. RFID can sense the food environment. The Blockchain-based supply chain
    management plan (Bhutta and Ahmad, 2021) that places an emphasis on employing
    IoT devices and Blockchain technology to securely identify, trace, and track agricultural
    food during transportation. The methods used to anticipate backorders include
    SVM, KNN, RADF, and AdaBoost. The IoT-based dairy supply chain model is suggested
    and put into practise. In which (Jachimczyk et al., 2021) the related solution
    and the domain-oriented knowledge model are well matched for the integration and
    synergy-enabling processes. RFID is used to capture and share data for production,
    warehousing, sales, supply, and other processes. Advocated in China by integrating
    blockchain and RFID in the (Feng Tian, 2016) supply chain. Information is transferred
    securely and made public via the traceability system by using blockchain. Real-time
    monitoring of the climate, humidity, and geolocation guarantees that harvested
    crops get to their destination in the best feasible conditions, reducing spoiling
    and improving crop quality. Blockchain technology leveraging RFID-based sensor
    nodes optimises supply chains for all crops in real-time. It reduces waste and
    guarantees that crops get there at their intended location in the best feasible
    condition. It has been determined from the discussion of the TTN''s current system
    that the secure supply chain technique has to be updated for all agricultural
    products. Sensor-based technologies, device security and failure, software security,
    and power management all require improvement. The current infrastructure does
    not allow for the dynamic scheduling of transportation based on the agricultural
    products'' shelf lives. There are significant research gaps in the areas of cloud
    platform load balancing, computational cost, and security protocol. Logistical
    processes based on smart contracts can be added to the system to increase its
    efficiency and power. There is still a need for an autonomous system that unifies
    numerous subsystems using IoT with technologies like blockchain and AI. 4.4. Food
    processing (FDP) “Big data” analytics, MCLRN, and the IoT are used to build a
    (Konur et al., 2023) cyber-physical / IoT based food manufacturing system. The
    intelligent production control system offers intelligent decision assistance.
    A tools is structured for tracking and (Jagtap et al., 2021) lowering energy and
    water consumption (FEW), as well as a decision-support system with pertinent hardware
    and software components, utilizing an IoT four-layer architecture. FEW data are
    gathered and used in the food manufacturing sector to examine and improve procedures.
    The food processing system is more effective when IoT, big data analytics, MCLRN,
    and cyber-physical systems are incorporated than when they are automated. Additionally,
    this analysis teaches data professionals new information about how to forecast
    the baking process for achieving product consistency. Productivity may be raised,
    and performance and profitability can be raised by analyzing these data. The current
    research has been examined for individual agricultural goods. For all agricultural
    goods, testing can be done based on the ingredients and food processing. It is
    necessary to integrate seamless IoT devices to improve food processing. The current
    system lacks a strong security system to safeguard system data. Based on IoT,
    AI, MCLRN, and other processes, Fig. 8 presents the average annual growth rate

    Publication growth rate analysis of POHRS application based on IoT and AI, MCLRN
    and other methodology from 2012 to 2023. For the TTN and RSCS system implementations,
    a large number of research articles have been published between 2018 and 2022.
    The average growth rate for the IoT and blockchain-based TTN system has been measured
    as 63.23 % between 2018 and 2021, and the average growth rate has been measured
    for the IoT and AI-based system for storage and cooling at 58.41 % between 2018
    and 2021. However, there has been less growth in research publications on the
    topics of IoT and AI for the other POHRS applications, such as FDP, CWM, sorting,
    and cooling, between 2012 and 2022. Therefore, there is a need for greater study
    in that area. Using IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other methodology categories, the average
    growth rate of research papers for PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS was 41.12 %, 43.23 %,
    and 36.10 %, respectively, till January 2023. 5. Metaheuristic based algorithm
    in smart agriculture application From growing to reaping, an agricultural application
    (Kiani et al., 2022a) uses a meta-heuristic approach. In the first unit, the “Sand
    Cat Swarm Optimization” (SCSO) based algorithm has been created to delegate the
    cultivation work to the appropriate autonomous machines, reducing the labor factor.
    In the second unit, IoT devices keep track of cultivated crops. For crop harvesting
    in the third unit, an improved “ANT colony optimization” (ACO) algorithm has been
    created. A 3D strategy approach has been (Kiani et al., 2022b) employed using
    a couple of Progressive enhancement Grey Wolf Optimisation (I-GWO) and Improved
    Grey Wolf Optimisation (Ex-GWO) for self-sustaining farm operations to search
    for a collision-free feasible route in a sufficient period with minimal expenditure
    in various atmospheric conditions and for multiple barriers. The goal is to tackle
    the NP-hard problem of successful crop harvesting by identifying the finest and
    most suitable paths for UAVs. The results indicate an endeavor to avoid any local
    optima pitfalls and determine the most effective response in an adequate span
    of duration. The fuzzy logic-based “Non-dominated sorting (Fathollahi-Fard et
    al., 2023) genetic algorithm” (NSGEA) model has been developed as a metaheuristic
    optimization strategy where the model incorporates the advantage of multiple factors
    of apprehension such as harvesters'' effectiveness, waves of crops that become
    ripe, parameter weather, as well as adjustments in the value of commodities. The
    framework takes into consideration a wide range of desired results, including
    profitability optimization, preventing waste, and carbon dioxide emissions reduction,
    and it is utilized to calculate the optimum amount of day''s labor for farmers
    and laborers on every block of land. The usefulness of the currently available
    SCSO, ACO, I-GWO, Ex-GWO, and NSGEA metaheuristic algorithms put into effect in
    IoT-based agriculture exceeded other approaches, and the model suggested may be
    used for different applications in a variety of agricultural areas. There are
    still some issues with the optimised performance technique that is currently being
    used to solve NP-hard issues in the field of smart agriculture. Lack of standardisation
    for big croplands utilising IoT and IoT of transportation employing a portable
    robot system to monitor the farming field based on SIR, SCL, CSL, CYP, SGM, SSL,
    STM, SHMFM, DDAN, PDT, WDT, PCN, CLO, TTN, FDP, and RSCS. While supply chain optimizer
    for several harvested crops is currently lacking, the used NSGEA algorithms in
    multiobjective problems can be extended by “Benders decomposition” or “Lagrangian
    relaxation”. 6. Technologies based on the IoT for smart agriculture The development
    of IoT-enabled smart agriculture systems has relied on a variety of technologies
    in the past. It is possible to use this technology wirelessly or wiredly. It is
    conceivable to build an infrastructure for intelligent agriculture at a low cost
    by combining sensors, controllers, and communication technologies. Through the
    synthesis of IoT, artificial intelligence, edge computing, and cloud computing,
    IoT-enabled technologies have made advancements in developing smart agriculture
    systems as well. This section analyses various technologies for developing smart
    agriculture systems in the different major areas of farming operations on the
    basis of discussion in 2 Pre-harvesting system (PHRS), 3 During harvesting system
    (DHRS), 4 Post harvesting system (POHRS), 5 Metaheuristic based algorithm in smart
    agriculture application. The estimation average rate of several technologies utilised
    to create smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS system is depicted in Fig. 9 of the graph.
    According to the existing survey (Kalyani and Collier, 2021) and proposed survey
    report, this is the estimated percentage of technologies used in smart agriculture
    methods. Download : Download high-res image (215KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Growth rate of various technologies used in PHRS, DHRS, POHRS subsystem
    between 2012 and 2022. According to an average percentage analysis of various
    technologies conducted between 2012 and 2022, the use of IoT and other technologies
    for the development of smart agriculture would increase by 2028 (Research and
    Markets, 2023). Table 1 presents cutting-edge technologies, sensor or devices
    that can be applied to build smart agriculture using IoT architecture (Chamara
    et al., 2022) based on PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS. From Table 1 it can be seen that
    the use of IoT has advanced the field of smart agriculture from 2012 to 2023.
    The advancement has been done by deploying various IoT devices / sensors (Pyingkodi
    et al., 2022), wireless communication protocols (Khanh et al., 2022), and UAVs
    using micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) technologies to automate the farming
    field operations (Boursianis et al., 2022). It is possible to communicate from
    machine to machine using a variety of communication standards (Orfanos et al.,
    2023). Table 1. Analysis of Technologies used in the smart agriculture between

    The graph in Fig. 10 represent how much data is consumed in GBPS by PHRS, DHRS,
    and POHRS subsystems. This data bandwidth estimate is evaluated and (Annual Internet,
    2023; Virtual Cisco, 2017) measured using prior research. This information is
    obtained through a variety of IoT sensors and actuators, including cameras, DHT
    temperature and humidity sensors, air pressure sensors, rain sensors, distance
    sensors, water flow metres, and others. These sensors and actuators are utilised
    to create smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Information for real-time crop
    management is updated often, like every minute or hour. In the upcoming years,
    it is anticipated that the average data bandwidth for IoT-based PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS subsystems would keep expanding. The rapid development of sensors and actuators,
    as well as the rising demand for real-time crop management data, are to blame
    for this. As technology has developed, the maximum data bandwidth for IoT-based
    smart agriculture systems has increased year over year. The available data bandwidth
    for various IoT based PHRS, DHRS and POHRS applications from 2012 to 2022 is shown
    in the graph Fig. 10. Download : Download high-res image (152KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 10. Data consumption analysis (GB) used by IoT devices year
    wise for various IoT based subsystems in smart agriculture. IoT technologies were
    still in their infancy between 2012 and 2014, and data storage capacity for applications
    in the IoT remained quite constrained. Data rates ranging from a few kilobyte
    per second (Kbps) to a few megabyte per second (Mbps) were accessible via wireless
    technologies including 2G and 3G cellular networks, which were widely used. The
    data bandwidth for IoT applications has increased dramatically between 2015 and
    2018 thanks to 4G LTE cellular networks technologies. Higher data speeds were
    offered by 4G networks, which typically oscillated between tens of Mbps to hundreds
    of Mbps. This made it possible to collect and analyse more data thoroughly while
    also enabling the transfer of data more quickly. Improvements to 4G networks and
    the rollout of 5G networks, which promise even more data bandwidth and lower latency,
    started in 2019 to 2021. Data rates of up to several gigabits per second (Gbps)
    are available with 5G technology. Even while 5G was not yet widely available,
    its promise for fast data transfer was becoming more and more clear. The global
    rollout of 5G networks, which are currently in development, will continue in 2022
    and 2023. This will result in enhanced data bandwidth for IoT-based smart agriculture
    applications. Although the actual data rates that can be achieved in real-world
    settings depend on network coverage and infrastructure, the data bandwidth needed
    for IoT-based smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems might vary depending on the
    implementation and the amount of data being communicated. The overall bandwidth
    needs will be influenced by elements including the volume of data gathering, the
    number of sensors placed, and the complexity of the data being conveyed. Communication
    involves a number of factors, such as the data rate, the frequency bands, the
    range, the application, and the cost. A systematic analysis of these factors has
    been conducted in Table 2 to determine which communication standards are to be
    used in PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystem. As from Table 1 and Table 2, some IoT-based
    communication technologies can also be considered in the 5G/5G beyond smart agriculture
    system. Table 2. Comparative analysis of various communication technologies used
    in smart agriculture. Communication Technologies Frequency Bands Data Rate Range

    problem in CYP, SSL, SIR, DDAN, PCN, WDT, and CWM operations. Existing public
    dataset has been reviewed for several farming operations (Lu and Young, 2020)
    including SSL, DDAN, WDT, CWM, etc., and classified this dataset based on the
    specific problem that can be solved using the IoT based computer vision algorithm
    for PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Including some existing external datasets
    created by various authors can be found in Table 3. This collection includes many
    plant-leaf diseases that affect fruits, vegetables, and seeds. For instance, tomatoes,
    brinjal, potatoes, guava, wheat, cotton, apples, oranges, and so forth. Table
    3. Analysis of dataset that can be used for developing smart agriculture based
    subsystem. References Details (Rauf and Lali, 2021) This dataset of healthy and
    unhealthy guava fruits and leaves can be used to solve plant disease-related issues
    using computer vision techniques. The illness categories in this image dataset
    are Dot, Canker, Mummification, and Rust. Pakistan is the source of the images.
    (Yogesh Suryawanshi et al., 2022) An image collection consists of four vegetables:
    “Bell Pepper”, “Tomato”, “Chili Pepper”, and “New Mexico Chile”. The five distinct
    substructure classes in each vegetable collection are Ripe, Old, Dried, and Wounded.
    (Natnael Tilahun, 2022) This image collection was gathered from a potato farm
    in Holeta, Ethiopia to help in the detection of potato leaf disease. The aforementioned
    collection comprises two distinct varieties of photos. Both “Healthy” and “Late
    Blight” have 363 and 63 images, respectively. The potato disease issue can be
    resolved with this dataset. 8. Comprehensive shortcomings of PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS
    As discussed above in 2 Pre-harvesting system (PHRS), 3 During harvesting system
    (DHRS), 4 Post harvesting system (POHRS), 5 Metaheuristic based algorithm in smart
    agriculture application, some shortcomings have been addressed from the existing
    work on IoT-enabled smart agriculture systems. Individually, these gaps are identified
    according to the various farming activities. The gaps that are noticeable for
    PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS are discussed in the Table 4 from which it can be analysed
    that smart agriculture is a broad research area and the developed existing IoT-enabled
    system still has shortcomings in terms of standard protocols, inconsistencies
    in collected data, and inconsistencies of IoT devices (such as there are multiple
    temperature sensors but their data formats are different and also it is difficult
    to interface that sensor with multiple subsystem microcontroller because of the
    varying platform), difficult to integrate existing system to multiple regions
    because of the environmental factor, cost, lack of technologies enhancement of
    the system and endorsement with real-time information with external source information.
    As from sections, 2, 3, 4 and 5 it can be extrapolated that more examination needs
    to be performed to accomplish IoT-based solutions for the SSL, SGM, SDG, PDT,
    affected crop sorting, CWM, and FDP. Research can be conducted on different crop
    types location-wise. IoT data security is a significant uncertainty, so there
    is a need for scalable WSN or robust mechanisms to protect data. Table 4. In depth
    shortcomings analysis of the existing smart agriculture system based on PHRS,
    DHRS and POHRS. PHRS Problems Focused Description Inconsistency with Standards
    Security protocols, device compatibility, and firmware still need to be standardized
    for IoT-based CSL, YPR, STM, SSL, SGM, DFM, WPM, and SDG systems. Compared to
    other methods and outcomes, the existing systems are difficult to compare. Standardized
    procedures and frameworks are necessary for assessing and comparing different
    methods. Limited Data analysis IoT is dependent on the volume of data. Most of
    the time that information is not easily accessible because of non-availability
    of open source data. More trustworthy sensor data and adequate data-gathering
    techniques are required because still depended on external source data. Data should
    be location-wise, all types of data, and should be validated with real-time and
    existing data. There is need for advanced data analytics techniques to make sense
    of these vast generated data. Inadequate scalability For IoT-based CSL, YPR, STM,
    DFM, and WPM applications, there are many active research projects; nevertheless,
    there is still work to be done to scale this system for commercial applications.
    SGM, SSL and SD-based IoT-based systems require more research. This system are
    not fully automated. Inadequate knowledge Performing experiments on the crop relies
    on understanding of the crop physiology as well as a range of environmental factors,
    which is yet not fully understood. More study is needed on the physiological processes
    of various crops, as well as the effects of environmental conditions on crop growth
    and development. Inability to integrate with current agricultural systems To make
    the fully IoT-based pre-harvesting method more effective, the system can be incorporated
    with the existing agricultural systems such as smart crop recommendation system
    based on weather, location, seed selection and soil nutrients analysis, smart
    soil digging, etc. There is a lack of research in this area of integration. The
    study has to be performed to discover the potential benefits and drawbacks of
    the integration. Limited Accuracy Currently, most IoT devices lead to erroneous
    and inconsistent data, as they have limitations in terms of accuracy, reliability,
    and precision. In addition, sensor calibration is also important despite being
    complex and time-consuming and can result in inconsistent results if not done.
    Also, these devices have to place optimally to ensure correct data collection,
    which can be further used for analysis. The study has to be performed to make
    a system accurate and reliable. Cost Effective IoT-based systems can be expensive
    to install and maintain and thus can be a barrier while adopting the technique,
    especially for small-scale farmers. Although the cost of devices has decreased
    in recent years, the overall integration can still lead to a higher cost. Research
    has to be focused to investigate cost-effective solutions. Use of MCLRN approaches
    The present work has used MCLRN techniques in IoT-based systems, however due to
    the overfitting issue, the trained MCLRN model still cannot make an accurate forecast.
    DHRS Multi-technology incorporating IoT makes it possible for the system to apply
    a variety of technologies during the harvesting process. These technologies can
    be combined to create a system, but research is needed to determine the best way
    to do so. According to the study of the current work, several systems have not
    been fully incorporated. Such as SIR with SHMFM, PCN, PDT, WDT, CLO etc. System
    for Enhancing Irrigation Research must be conducted to point out the efficient
    way to irrigate the plants as compared to the traditional methods of irrigation.
    Such as irrigation system should be managed automatically on behalf of different
    of types crops. Acquiring and adopting users Existing IoT-based DHRS systems are
    still mishandled and challenging to adopt in various environments. Research must
    be performed to make a system that can be easily handled and adopted by end users
    in different environments. Soil health The DHRS process includes IoT enabled system
    for crop monitoring and SHMFM. Research must be performed to examine how SIR affects
    soil systems, microbial residents, and nutrient process for various crops. Environment''s
    impact Still, research is to be investigated based on environmental factors such
    as calibration of temperature, humidity, and rainfall during SHMFM and DDAN. Privacy
    and Security As far as the security of IoT-based DHR systems is concerned, very
    little research has been conducted. Detecting the diseases accurately Although
    IoT-based systems can provide real-time plant health data, there are still limitations
    to how precise the data is. Various factors affect accuracy and research must
    be done to monitor those factors, which can impact accuracy. Efficient Energy
    Continuous data collection is difficult in remote regions. A cost-effective, self-sustaining,
    and optimised technique should be implemented in the current IoT-based systems
    for PDT, DDAN, SHMFM, and WDT so that field monitoring data can be gathered continually.
    Analysing pest behaviour The system to detect pests accurately still needs improvement.
    As various pests respond differently in different environments. Optimization of
    Object Detection algorithms Need more research in the areas of IoT-enabled systems
    for WDT, PDT, CLO, and PCN to provide optimized solutions for accurate results.
    So system performance can be increased. POHRS Security and Privacy While most
    harvesting data must be stored properly and securely. Various IoT-based systems
    can be implemented to monitor and store the data. In this era of cyber threats,
    the system must be made in such a way to make the data properly stored, thus making
    it secure. Innovative solutions with a low cost Developing IoT enables cost-effective
    solutions in post-harvest activities is challenging based on security and privacy.
    As in POHRS, there are still some shortcomings in the existing system, which needed
    to be addressed. Such as in RSCS, SWM, and TTN there is still lacking data security,
    data storage, and low-cost automated system of fruits and vegetables monitoring.
    Research must be done to deeply understand such a situation and make a cost-efficient
    system so that it can be used by small-scale farmers also. Miniature studies In
    POHRS most of the ongoing work is focused on TTN, RSCS, and CWM but missing this
    existing system on a large scale for post-harvest phases. In the current automated
    RSCS system, the sorting technique management can be improved by including scheduling
    and weightage systems for post-harvest storage of crops during the TTN process,
    because Indian farmers have fewer low-cost smart facilities. Research can be done
    to investigate the effectiveness of the IoT system on a large scale as well. Incorporating
    multiple methods IoT system integrates different components which are somehow
    correlated to each other. Research should be carried out to determine how those
    components must be integrated as a distributed system that develops a self-sustainable
    and cost-efficient system. Availability and Reliability The IoT-based system should
    be readily available for the end users. Research should be done regarding the
    improvements in the availability of the data during TTN as well as while RSCS,
    utilizing real-time monitoring. 9. Proposed architecture for smart agriculture
    From PHRS to POHRS, a number of existing smart methodologies have been established
    for all different types of farming tasks, and they are all covered above along
    with their benefits as well as their drawbacks. By using the proposed architecture
    the limitations of the present structures can be reduced in light of the discussion
    above. A compact sensor network is made possible. Thanks to the integration of
    IoT, MCLRN, metaheuristic optimisation algorithm, AI, edge computing, cloud computing,
    SDN, cryptography for data security, UAVs, etc. Using 5G (gNB architecture) and
    5G beyond networks (Abdulghaffar et al., 2021), the recommended IoT-facilitated
    smart farming architecture is designed on the basis of IoT layered architecture
    in the Fig. 11. The sensor layer consists of different types of sensors, and data
    transmitters (“sx1276”, “nrf24l01”, etc.), cameras, high-frequency navigation
    (GPS), etc. It acts to collect and transmit facts it to the central server utilizing
    a 5G network connectivity via an edge gateway for data processing and analytics.
    The central server gives the farmers useful information using miscellaneous algorithms
    and standard procedures. These details may be on the choice of crop, seed germination,
    irrigation, soil analysis, and status, livestock status, crop diseases detection,
    crop sorting and storage, tracking, etc. The collected data are about the PHRS
    subsystem, DHRS subsystem, and POHRS subsystem. These subsystems are interconnected
    to each other to make the overall agriculture system automated. So that farmers
    can optimize their farming procedures and enhance crop yields. Under this system,
    the automated actuators can be used to enable farmers to remotely control some
    of the devices such as irrigation motors, pest control, soil digging, etc. Layer
    by layer, smart agriculture can be developed as follows: Download : Download high-res

    Agriculture Framework. 9.1. Perception layer In this layer, multiple sensor networks
    can be created by deploying various sensor nodes for the PHRS subsystem, DHRS
    subsystem, and POHRS subsystem. This subsystem is communicated to each other as
    machine-to-machine communication (Sakthivel and Vidhya, 2021) and connected to
    an each 5GIoT base edge gateway. The PHRS subsystem retrieves the data of various
    environmental factors, including water in the soil, fertiliser, temperature, and
    humidity, sunlight, flood and drought-related, etc, and transmits this data to
    the local IoT edge gateway for further computation and analysis. The DHRS subsystem
    consists of the sensor data of irrigation, NPK, pest controlling, weed detection,
    disease prediction, livestock, insects sound, crop field, etc. This data is also
    transmitted to a local IoT edge gateway and the same as POHRS sensor network data
    will be collected and transmitted to its IoT local edge gateway for further computing
    and analysis. This all subsystems are the backbone of the IoT sensor network.
    9.2. Network layer The entire IoT AGRI subsystem is designed based on the 5G network,
    but it can enable 5G beyond the network as needed. Essentially, a 5G core network
    is a high-level network that is made up of a radio access network and one or more
    edge networks. The 5G base stations are connected to open flow switches which
    are known as gNB switches (edge network). For traffic offloading and “quality
    of service (QoS)” implementation, SDN controllers can interface with base stations
    using the open flow protocol. The “protocol data unit (PDU) session” or “user
    plane function (UPF)” is used in the core network to connect the data network
    (DN). The SDN controller controls all gNB, UPF, and data plane switches. This
    layer is responsible for all transmissions and communications between sensors,
    IoT gateways, and cloud servers. 9.3. Cloud layer The network layer''s via SDN
    controller would transport the sensor data acquired from the perception layer
    to the cloud layer platform, where analytics would be carried out utilising tools
    like AI, MCLRN, Weka, and Hadoop, among others. Cloud platforms include “AWS”,
    “Azure”, “IBM Cloud”, etc. To handle and analyse the data gathered from the sensors,
    this cloud service offers storage and computational capabilities. The designed
    API gateway is used to manage communication between the edge gateway and the cloud
    server while utilising all authentication services. 9.4. Application layer The
    insights produced by the cloud server will be available to the end user through
    mobile applications, web applications, etc., including farmers, stack holders,
    suppliers, ranchers, purchasers, etc. So that farmers may make informed judgements,
    this programme gives them real-time information regarding the PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS. 9.5. Data storage and processing layer Depending on the particular applications
    and the volume of data collected, the data storage needs for IoT-based PHRS, DHRS,
    and POHRS subsystems can change. Numerous services, including data source, data
    processing, decision support, transmission system, authorization, storage space,
    and reliability, are offered in the data storage and processing layer. The digital
    footprint of the data collection and storing for the IoT-based PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS subsystems in smart agriculture is shown in Fig. 12. Download : Download
    high-res image (611KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Data processing
    and storage footprint. Data gathering: Obtaining information from numerous agricultural
    fields (F) using a variety of sensors, including those that measure things like
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, soil ph, soil NPK, air pressure, RFID, rodents,
    insects, and other animals, as well as things like plant color recognition, rainfall,
    disease detection, and recognization through cameras, storage and cooling control
    of harvested vegetables or fruits, transportation and tracking, water flow measurement,
    level, and pump control. This sensor and actuator data is sent to the server for
    analysis and decision-making for the farm fields, or real-time monitoring. Depending
    on the sensor type and frequency, a single sensor node may generate data on average
    in the range of KB to a megabyte (MB) each day. The expected data storage, for
    instance, can range from GB to terabytes (TB) per year if there is a vast farming
    area with numerous sensors. In addition, image and video data are gathered from
    drones to monitor crop health, pest detection, weed detection, and crop yield.
    This data contains high-definition images of farms in 5 to 100 MB sizes. It is
    possible to estimate total storage capacity by estimating the frequency of capturing
    such imaginary data. The sensor data for CYP, CSL, SGM, STM, SDG, SIR, RSCS, CWM,
    DDAN, PDT, CLO, WDT, SHMFM TTN, and FDP systems as well as scheduling irrigation,
    measuring insect control effectiveness, managing livestock, keeping track of crop
    yields, and managing agribusiness depend on the overall dimension of the farm,
    the variety of crops grown there, and the amount of detail that can be gathered.
    For each crop every year, this data size can be in the KB to MB range. However,
    WPM generates climate-related data that can be recorded for historical research
    and transmitted in KB each hour or day. Data pre-processing: In the pre-processing,
    the gathered data are prepared for further analysis. Which is used to fill in
    the missing data, remove the redundant data, format the data into its size, type,
    and classes, and normalize the data to make data more reliable and knowledgeable.
    Data repository: The local storage server, which may be a NoSql, time-series,
    or relational database, stores all pre-process data. It is quite difficult to
    make the data more trustworthy and long-lasting because the database storage can
    come from a variety of sources of different types and sizes. The data is cleaned
    using a variety of pre-processing techniques throughout the pre-process. There
    are different, specialised cleaning techniques for text and picture data, such
    as stemming and lemmatization, as well as image geometric conversions, image filtering,
    segmentation, Fourier transform, and image restoration, among others. Data from
    both the past and the present is kept in the storage repository. In the edge computing
    layer, data transmission management is carried out between this data processing
    layer. The interval between acquisition and utilisation might vary extensively,
    ranging from a couple of seconds, minutes, or hours to a few weeks, or possibly
    a full year in extreme circumstances. Therefore, several transmission techniques
    can be used for quick and secure long-distance transmission via wired or wireless
    means. High-speed data connection, such as a 5G communication network, is also
    necessary. Various data flow control techniques, including stop and wait, feedback
    control, sliding windows, two-directional communications, etc., will be used to
    manage the data communication traffic between these two communications. Throughout
    all of these steps, data analyses are carried out utilising different MCLRN and
    AI algorithms to send actions and notifications to the user''s cloud server. A
    suggested approach for smart farming system data footprint is developed based
    on smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS existing work deficiencies using a 5G data communication
    network. For the storage of this PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS application, the maximum
    average data volume analysis is shown as a graph in Fig. 13. The regular data
    volume analysis is estimated in Fig. 13 as a graph based on the communication
    technologies range, periodicity of the sensor devices, camera resolution, data
    bandwidth, etc. Using different types of agricultural activity properties, this
    average data volume utilisation analysis over the past 30 days has been calculated.
    The analysis of the 30-day total average data volume was calculated at 1.38856
    GB. Depending on the particular PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS application, the data transfer
    frequency changes. Download : Download high-res image (156KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 13. Estimated digital footprint for one month of proposed
    PHRS,DHRS and POHRS Systems. For instance, a system used to track soil temperature
    and nutrient content might release information once each hour or day. Meanwhile,
    a different system will deliver data every minute for crop growth assessment.
    As more smart sensors are deployed and technology is developed, the amount of
    data conveyed for different crops in soil and crop growth monitoring will expand
    in the future. Aspects that can increase the volume of data include the number
    of sensors used, the type of data (image, text, or numerical), frequency, distance,
    time, cost of data transmission, size of the farmed area, crop type, climate,
    irrigation method, soil type, disease type, etc. 10. Comparative analysis of existing
    smart agriculture system with proposed 5G based architecture For the recommendation
    of a 5G-based smart agriculture framework, some of the existing available research
    surveys have already (Liu et al., 2023) been carried out, in which the major technologies
    and technological barriers preventing the advancement and development of smart
    agriculture applications leveraging 5G technologies are described. The resultant
    effect of 5G on the IoT for smart agriculture is outlined. An exploration of precision
    agricultural (Majumdar et al., 2023) applications has been explored using green
    IoT-based solutions, utilizing UAVs, LPWANs, and 5G networks as well as an assortment
    of technical issues. Utilizing 5G networks and beyond, the long-lasting expansion
    of digital farming through the incorporation of green IoT technology enables the
    IoT greener. The proposed architecture above has been recommended by incorporating
    each multiple-edge gateway grid with the central controller for all small and
    large farming area data based on the existing 5G-based smart agriculture architecture.
    The advantages of using this agriculture system over existing IoT-based agriculture
    systems include the immediately apparent advancement across multiple agriculture
    applications, centralised archives of data, estimation process power, etc. Existing
    smart agriculture exhibits challenging obstacles and demands to handle high volume
    data storing processes, computation power, and managing various agriculture applications
    of small and large farming areas. Therefore, in this instance, data computation,
    interpreting, and other capabilities can be offered close to the network''s edge,
    where initially the data are originated. Edge computing power has benefits such
    as decreased latency, bandwidth savings, reduced downtime, increased trustworthiness,
    improved privacy and security, etc. The proposed IoT-based architecture allows
    for the best provisioning of resources using SDN, network segmentation, route
    optimisation, load balancing, and other practises. A evaluation of current smart
    farm systems with the proposed IoT architecture is shown in Table 5 below based
    on the various parameter. Some of the characteristics are identical in the proposed
    5G-based smart agriculture architecture and the existing smart agriculture architecture.
    The comparison has been verified based on this characteristic. Table 5. Advantages
    of the proposed 5G based smart agriculture system with existing smart agriculture
    system. Comparative parameter (Udutalapally et al., 2021) (Liu et al., 2023) Proposed
    5G based IoT agriculture architecture system Bandwidth Low Bandwidth Fast bandwidth
    with single edge network Fast bandwidth with single and multiple edge network
    with LPWAN communication Latency High latency rate and risk of data loss during
    cloud transmission. Delay time will be increased for large farming area. Delay
    time is reduced as of using multiple edge gateway. Interruption Interruption rate
    are high Interruption rate can be high if switching to 5G beyond network or multiple
    edge network. Interruption are reduced because authenticated edge connection for
    small and large farming field WSN and can be customized based on the network.
    Data storage Limited storage capacity and complicated database management because
    of limited globalization. High storage capacity at the cloud end, as the architecture
    is for small farming area. Capable of managing databases at the edge network and
    storage capacity will be maximum as using distributed system. Energy efficient
    Requires a lot of energy for calculation and processing while transmitting various
    types of data at long distances. More energy required as system is not fully distributed.
    Less energy consumption as system is distributed. Minimises the necessity for
    transmission of data over long distances. Real time decision Real-time decision-making
    can be accomplished although has a larger latency, which restricts its effectiveness
    for circumstances where timeliness is essential. Real time decision possible but
    lack in independency at each edge network. Increase productivity and yield by
    enabling real-time decision-making with exposure to the constantly changing conditions
    on the farm. PHRS Subsystems Integration of PHRS sub systems is possible with
    other farming sub system but need much enhancement, as limited range of network
    connections and no such algorithm for intelligent decision making at the edge
    level. Since PHRS module data differ from farm to farm, there are chances of data
    overload at the edge network level because there are no such discussions on NP-hard
    problem optimization strategies. Using of metaheuristic-based algorithms it is
    possible to increase the efficiency of PHRS, sub-systems in 5G-based or beyond
    networks. DHRS Subsystems Integration of DHRS sub-systems is limited as it provides
    a huge volume of image and video-type data. Integration of the DHRS subsystem
    is achievable as discussed about the UAVs-based system for various image vision
    problems. Integration of DHRS with PHRS subsystem is achievable using NB-IoT M2M
    communication. POHRS Subsystems Integration of POHRS subsystem is limited. POHRS
    subsystem integration for supply chain management. Management of POHRS subsystems
    for TTN, FDP, cooling, harvesting, and farmers'' inventory. Security and privacy
    Device security, data authentication, network slicing, and encryption still need
    to be improved. There is no analogous method discussed for recognising security
    ambiguity while deploying IoT devices for securing inconsistent energy-efficient
    communication devices for considerable distance and durability. The system becomes
    more efficient and capable with the help of 5G, SDN, and distributed edge computing
    structures and is able to oversee massive amounts of network traffic and data
    authentication. As a result of the discussion in Table 5 above, it can be concluded
    that creating the proposed 5G based smart agriculture system using edge computing
    could effortlessly extend to meet the increasing necessities of modern farming.
    The entire structure can be customized by how the agricultural operation grows
    and network changes or whether its operations require more sensors and devices.

    surveys information. Table 6. Comparative analysis of proposed survey from existing

    the gap in existing reviews for IoT-based smart agriculture by classifying pre-
    and post-harvest activities into PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Based on this
    categorization, various existing work has been discussed in detail with an analysis
    of the IoT communication technologies and metaheuristic approach used in the IoT
    based smart agriculture system. As a result of the discussion of the problem in
    existing work, the 5G and 5G beyond smart agriculture system architecture are
    being prepared. With this recommended framework, the shortcomings of the existing
    work can be reduced, and the system can be optimized. 11. Conclusion IoT-based
    smart agriculture is the advancement of the digital transformation of various
    traditional farming subactivities. In this a comprehensive review by categorizing
    the farming subactivities based on the Pre, During, and Post harvests of the smart
    agriculture-based existing application has been discussed in detail. We have also
    observed the research gaps for each and every activity separately. Based on these
    research gaps it has been analyzed that developing an intelligent farming system
    is still a challenging process. We have tried to address these challenges and
    enhance the performance of the existing systems by proposing a 5G-based hybrid
    framework for smart agriculture. The outcome of the proposed survey is validated
    by comparison with the existing survey papers. It is found that various existing
    surveys have not been represented considering the smart agriculture applications
    according to the Pre, During, and Post harvesting phases. Therefore, our survey
    methodology and outcome seem to outperform the other surveys conducted so far
    for smart agriculture. In future work the technology wise survey for the different
    aspects of smart agriculture may be conducted. For example, we can have a comprehensive
    survey on the use of Machine learning algorithms for each activity of smart agriculture.
    Also crop wise comprehensive survey can be conducted involving all the pre, during
    and post-harvest activities. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare
    that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

    is a major occupation in India, however, the traditional methods employed are
    time-consuming and labor demanding. The global population increases the demand
    for food, while climate change makes it difficult to grow crops with the existing
    resources [1]. Therefore, the resources must be utilized in a sustainable manner
    through the integration of technology. The use of technology in farming, commonly
    known as smart farming, play pivotal in achieving sustainable agriculture. Smart
    farming can help farmers with the ability to adapt to the effects of climate change
    by providing real-time monitoring and analysis of weather conditions and along
    with early warning systems for extreme weather events. This enables farmers to
    make well-informed decisions regarding planting, irrigation, and fertilization
    methods, enhancing resilience and sustainability. In addition, the use of sensors
    and other technologies in smart farming can help in reducing the use of natural
    resources such as water and fertilizers. By providing real-time data on soil moisture
    and nutrient levels, smart farming systems can help farmers to optimize their
    use of these resources, leading to more efficient and sustainable agricultural
    practices. This approach can help the environmental impact of farming by reducing
    the amount of excess water and chemicals that can pollute water sources and harm
    wildlife. The use of technology into agriculture offers numerous benefits to farmers,
    consumers, and the environment. Smart farming techniques enable farmers to enhance
    productivity, increase profitability, and contribute to the sustainability and
    resilience of the agricultural industry. Smart farming can be particularly beneficial
    for smallholder farmers in developing countries, such as India, where farming
    communities often have fragmented farmlands and limited access to advanced technologies.
    The implementation cost of smart farming technologies can be a barrier, but some
    of these technologies, such as the use of sensors and mobile apps, are becoming
    more affordable and accessible. Through automation and intelligent decision-making
    systems, smart farming improve efficiency, reduces the dependence on manual labor,
    conserves water and other vital resources, improves crop yields, and make farming
    more efficient and profitable. However, there are also challenges, such as the
    need for strong Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure
    and knowledge, as well as concerns about data privacy and storage. Smart farming
    involves the use of technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), remote sensing,
    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and deep learning to monitor and optimize various
    agricultural parameters such as soil moisture, nutrient levels, pest infestations,
    and irrigation. This monitoring allows for better control over the cultivation
    process and leads to increased crop yields, reduced costs, and optimized resource
    utilization. Furthermore, smart farming plays a pivotal role in reducing the ecological
    footprint associated with traditional farming practices. IoT devices, connected
    to the Internet, work smart to make day-to-day life easier. They can be either
    connected to wires or wireless, depending on the specific need and nature of the
    applications. IoTs are connected through sensors for sensing and transferring
    the required information from the environment to cloud servers to control equipment
    or machinery when integrated appropriately. These devices are often small and
    energy efficient, require minimal resources [2, 3]. IoT devices provide real-time
    monitoring and analysis of various environments, facilitating  a wide range of
    applications, ranging from detecting and preventing equipment failures in industrial
    settings to optimizing irrigation and fertilization in agriculture. By providing
    real-time data and insights, IoT devices can help users to make more informed
    and efficient decisions, leading to improved productivity and cost savings. IoT
    devices operate autonomously, without the need for direct human intervention.
    This can be especially useful in situations where continuous monitoring and control
    are required, such as in industrial processes or agriculture. The use of Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles, also known as drones, in agriculture has seen substantial be
    growth in recent years due to their ability to provide real-time monitoring and
    analysis of crop conditions. UAVs can be equipped with a variety of sensors, including
    thermal cameras, multispectral cameras, and laser scanners, which can collect
    a wide range of data regarding crop health and growth. This data can be used to
    optimize the cultivation process of the crops. One of the key benefits of using
    UAVs in agriculture is their ability to cover large areas quickly and efficiently.
    Unlike traditional methods of crop monitoring, which often require manual ground
    inspection by workers, UAVs can cover large fields in a short amount of time,
    providing a more comprehensive view of crop conditions. This can help farmers
    to identify problematic areas and take corrective actions, leading to improved
    crop yields and reducing costs. Furthermore, through the application of machine
    learning algorithms, UAVs can learn from the collected data and make intelligent
    decisions based on that data without human intervention [4]. This capability can
    help farmers to optimize their use of resources, such as water and fertilizers,
    and reduce the environmental impact of their farming practices. Studies have provided
    an overview of available data science applications in India for agriculture produce
    and commodities production [5, 6]. The proposed research aims to develop a low-cost,
    automatically controlled, precise prototype for a smart irrigation system that
    combines UAVs and the IoT to monitor plant health and optimize irrigation in real
    time. By using UAVs to collect high-resolution data on plant health and environmental
    conditions and integrating this data with IoT sensors in the soil and irrigation
    system, the proposed system enables precise and efficient irrigation. This approach
    reduces water consumption, and promotes sustainable agriculture by improving plant
    health. 2 Related Works The technological advances in the Internet and smart techniques
    pave the way for reducing unnecessary burdens in highly demanding situations such
    as work, constant monitoring, and saving resources. The additional advantage of
    automated technological growth is the transfer of resources toward additional
    investments including time, cost, money, and human workforce. Smart techniques
    involve a great deal of embedded electronic devices (sensors, actuators, other
    electronics) coupled with software. These devices, when connected with software
    and Internet connections, create opportunities for integrating the physical world
    into computer-based systems. Ultimately, this integration improve efficiency,
    accuracy, and reduces costs with minimal or no human intervention. Almost, all
    the fields are expected to be equipped with IoT for smart devices [8]. However,
    problems are also present along with the above-said advantages. The granulated
    information collected from everything, including people who creates a larger database
    that requires more space for electronic storage and smart solutions. The consumption
    of the electronic storage requires additional attention and concerns about loss
    of data and data privacy becomes additional concern [9]. The IoT model includes
    seven crucial levels. They are physical, connectivity, edge computing, data storage,
    data aggregation and access, data application, and processing. The physical devices
    form the base level connection between the real world and the computing. They
    are connected to the communication and processing units to data analysis and transform
    alphabetic and/or numeric information. The information is accumulated in a storage
    platform or cloud or devices for further access and aggregation. Data analytics
    is the key role in the entire model. Based on the analysis, application models
    are implied either to control or report to end users for collaboration and processing
    [10]. The scarcity of non-renewable energy is evident in recent times, and the
    demand for more energy is constantly increasing. The solar energy can be utilized,
    and the smart irrigation system can be connected to it. In this way, the system
    could be cost effective and can fulfill the energy needs of the country. This
    entire system could be able to conserve the electricity and save water by applying
    a smart irrigation system. The system is sensitive enough to irrigate the crops
    only at the required level of drop in the moisture level [11, 12]. There is an
    increasing scenario of reducing water springs, drying rivers, and lakes, emphasizing
    the crucial need for proper water usage. To mitigate this, sensors such as, temperature,
    moisture, and time sensors can be placed near crops to monitor moisture and temperature
    levels [13]. IoT solutions prove helpful for many dimensions of agricultural problems
    [14]. A smart irrigation system should be designed based on soil moisture, precipitation,
    and evaporation rates. Soil moisture is influenced by precipitation and evaporation
    with the proportion of these factors. The used for estimation of the wetness of
    the soil. Precipitation is gathered through the routine weather reports, and evaporation
    is calculated using other meteorological parameters. The number of sensors is
    reduced by deploying them at each corner of the irregular area making them like
    a square. Each node was connected to wireless network devices. Wireless sensor
    network was formed with multiple sensors into a cluster. These clusters were led
    by cluster heads and members. The members collected the data from the field (single
    hop communication) and heads collected them (multi-hop communication) and passed
    to a sink. The data routing process was controlled through cluster heads, and
    load was minimized [15]. Similar methods could be linked to the prototype developed
    this could eventually minimize sensors required and subsequently the cost. The
    smart irrigation model presents a promising solution for improving plant growth
    and crop yields through the efficient management of water resources. It has the
    potential to increase the productivity of agricultural systems while reducing
    water waste, which is a critical issue in areas with water scarcity. Additionally
    , by continuously monitoring and fine-tuning the system, and adapting to changing
    conditions, the system can provide more accurate and efficient irrigation, resulting
    in healthier plants and increased yields. 3 Proposed Framework An integrated framework
    for a smart irrigation system for plant health management is a comprehensive approach
    to designing and implementing a system that optimizes crop irrigation. The framework
    typically comprises several components, including sensors, controllers, actuators,
    and software, which work together to collect data on the crop health and water
    needs. This data is then used to apply water or fertilizers to the crops in an
    optimal manner. A cloud-based IoT platform, such as Microsoft Azure IoT, AWS IoT,
    ThingSpeak, and Google Cloud IoT, can be used to connect the smart irrigation
    system to the cloud. The sensors in the framework are used to collect data on
    a various plant health and environmental parameters, including plant moisture
    levels, soil moisture levels, temperature, and sunlight intensity. These sensors
    can be installed on the ground or can be mounted on UAV for remote sensing. Within
    the framework, controllers are responsible to analyze the data collected by the
    sensors and determine the optimal irrigation schedule for the crops. This analysis
    can be conducted using a various machine learning algorithms, and considering
    a wide range of factors, such as plant moisture levels, soil moisture levels,
    temperature, and sunlight intensity. Actuators are used to apply water or fertilizers
    to the crops, based on the irrigation schedule determined by the controllers.
    These actuators can be installed on the ground or can be mounted on a UAV for
    remote application. Lastly, the software components is responsible to manage and
    coordinate the various components of the system, while providing an interface
    for users to monitor and control the system. The smart irrigation system combines
    both hardware and software components to monitor and control irrigation. The hardware
    component of the system includes sensors that measure soil moisture, water level,
    and temperature, as well as a UAV equipped with high-resolution cameras. The sensors
    are connected to an Arduino board, which is a microprocessor-based controller.
    The soil moisture sensor uses electrodes to measure the volumetric water content
    of the soil through dielectric permittivity. The electrodes measure the soil resistance.
    The sensor is inserted into the soil for about 1 inch. The water level sensor
    is an ultrasonic sensor that is used to detect the level of water in the source.
    Temperature sensors are used to measure the temperature of the soil. The sensors
    are connected to the Arduino board [7], which processes the data from the sensors
    and sends it to the software component of the system. The software component uses
    algorithms to analyze the data and make decisions about when and how much to irrigate
    the plants. The UAV is used to remotely monitor the plants and provide detailed
    images that can be used to diagnose plant health issues. Figure 1 illustrates
    the model system for smart irrigation combined with plant health management. Fig.
    1 Integrated framework for a smart irrigation system for plant health management
    Full size image The Arduino board is a microcontroller that is programmed to receive
    input signals from the sensors and process them according to pre-defined instructions.
    The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is the software used to write
    and upload the code to the microcontroller. This code defines the conditions under
    which the Arduino will send output signals to control the water pump motor. The
    Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) modem is used to establish wireless
    communication between the Arduino board and the cloud-based server. The Arduino
    sends the processed data from the sensors to the server through the GSM modem,
    and the user can access the data and control the water pump motor through a mobile
    application. An electromagnetic serves as a switch to control the water pump motor.
    When the relay receives a signal from the Arduino, it switches the circuit to
    turn the motor ON or OFF accordingly. This allows the smart irrigation system
    to automatically manage the water supply based on the data from the sensors. The
    system continuously monitors the physical parameters of the soil and water source,
    such as moisture, temperature, and water level. This data is collected by sensors
    and transmitted to a web server (ThingSpeak) through UAV-collected signals and
    smartphones. The web server processes the data and generates a graphical representation
    of the information, which allows users to monitor and analyze the data in real
    time. The system uses fuzzy logic to control the irrigation process. When the
    water level in the source falls below a certain threshold, the ultrasonic sensor
    sends a signal to the Arduino board, which activates the water pump motor to start
    irrigation. This process is repeated based on the data collected by the sensors,
    ensuring that the plants receive the optimal amount of water. The deep learning
    algorithm further analysis with the existing database of plant health and nutrient
    content repositories. Findings are shared with farmers through an appropriate
    platform. Based on these recommendations, farmers can apply required pesticides
    and nutrient tonics accordingly. The application of nutrient tonics or pesticides
    can be further targeted to specific regions by bifurcating the irrigation pipelines,
    creating a variable rate application model. ArduPilot is an open-source autopilot
    software commonly used to control multi-copter drones. In this smart irrigation
    system, ArduPilot was installed on the multi-copter UAV to enable autonomous flight
    and data collection. In addition to ArduPilot, the UAV was also equipped with
    a thermal OpenMV Cam M7 Smart Vision Camera and two digital cameras. These cameras
    were used to capture images of the plants and soil, which were then processed
    using the Fiji ImageJ software. The images were then analyzed using the Caffe
    open-source deep learning framework, which is a popular deep learning framework
    that is widely used for image classification and object detection tasks. The images
    were sent to repositories for analysis, and the results were used to make decisions
    about irrigation and plant health management. Various vegetation Indices were
    used for remote sensing. ENVI provides 27 vegetation indices to be used to detect
    the presence and relative abundance of pigments, water, and carbon as expressed
    in the solar-reflected optical spectrum (400–2500 nm). NDVI is the most used index,
    due to its versatility and reliability in reporting general biomass. For new drone
    intelligence users, it''s the best vegetation index to start. Other primary spectral
    indices are Green Normalized Differential Index (GNDVI) and Crop Water Stress
    Index (CWSI) from thermal indexing. Normalized Differential Index (NDI) is a spectral
    index that is used to compare the reflectance or emission of a target in two different
    spectral bands. It is calculated by using Eq. (1). $${\\text{NDI}} = \\left( {A-B}
    \\right)/\\left( {A + B} \\right),$$ (1) where A is the reflectance or emission
    value in the first spectral band and B is the reflectance or emission value in
    the second spectral band. NDI is often used to compare the reflectance of a target
    in the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands, as plants typically have a higher reflectance
    in the NIR band than in the red band. By comparing the reflectance in these two
    bands, NDI can be used to estimate the amount of green vegetation in an image,
    or to identify other targets or features of interest. Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) is a widely used measure of the amount of vegetation present in an
    area. It is calculated using the difference between the near-infrared and red
    light reflected by vegetation and is commonly used in remote sensing and agricultural
    applications. NDVI values range from −1 to 1, with higher values indicating a
    greater amount of vegetation. It is calculated by using Eq. (2). $${\\text{NDVI}}
    = \\frac{{S_{{\\text{IR}}_n } - S_R }}{{S_{{\\text{IR}}_n } + S_R }},$$ (2) \\(S_{{\\text{IR}}_n
    }\\)—Reflection in the near-infrared of the spectrum \\(S_R\\)—Reflection in the
    red range of the spectrum. NDVI can be used to monitor the health and productivity
    of crops. For example, healthy crops typically have higher NDVI values, while
    stressed or damaged crops may have lower values. By measuring NDVI, farmers and
    agricultural researchers can assess the health and growth of crops and make decisions
    about irrigation, fertilization, and other management practices. Table 1 describes
    different stages of plant development and associated characteristics such as soil
    conditions, vegetation density, and plant vigor. The stages are denoted by ranges
    of values, from −1 to >0.80. For example, the first row indicates that in the
    range from −1 to 0, the soil is water and bare, whereas the second row suggests
    that in the range from 0 to 0.15, the vegetation may be sparse, and the plants
    may have poor vigor. Table 1 Range description for plant health Full size table
    The Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) is a measure of the amount of water stress
    experienced by crops. It is calculated using the temperature and relative humidity
    of the air, as well as the temperature and moisture content of the soil. CWSI
    values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater water stress.
    The CWSI is calculated using Eq. (3). The CWSI is used to monitor the water needs
    of crops and make decisions about irrigation. For example, crops experiencing
    high levels of water stress (high CWSI values) may require more frequent irrigation,
    while crops experiencing lower levels of stress (low CWSI values) may require
    less irrigation. By measuring the CWSI, farmers and agricultural researchers can
    ensure that crops receive the optimal amount of water for healthy growth and productivity.
    $${\\text{CWSI}} = \\frac{{T_{{\\text{ac}}} - T_w }}{T_d - T_w },$$ (3) \\(T_{{\\text{ac}}}\\) = Actual
    canopy temperature from thermal image \\(T_w\\) = Lower temperature (wet temperature)
    \\(T_d\\) = Upper temperature (dry temperature). The CWSI is a numerical index
    that ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater water stress. CWSI
    values below 0.1 indicate that the plant is not experiencing any water stress
    and is well-hydrated. The values between 0.1 and 0.3 indicate that the plant is
    experiencing mild water stress and may benefit from some additional irrigation
    or water management practices. The values between 0.3 and 0.5 indicate moderate
    water stress, which may result in reduced growth, yield, and fruit quality. Additional
    irrigation and water management practices are typically needed to alleviate this
    level of stress. The values between 0.5 and 0.7 indicate severe water stress,
    which can lead to significant crop damage and yield losses. Immediate action is
    typically required to prevent further stress and minimize crop losses. The values
    above 0.7 indicate extreme water stress, which can result in crop failure and
    complete loss of yield. Urgent and intensive irrigation and water management practices
    are needed to address this level of stress. 4 Experiments and Results The developed
    IoT monitoring system for smart irrigation was able to sense the physical parameters
    (soil moisture, temperature, and water level). The IoT-based smart irrigation
    system involves connecting sensors to an Arduino Uno, such as those measuring
    soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and water level. The data collected though
    the sensors can be sent to a cloud-based platform for analysis. The results were
    captured between each one-hour interval from morning 5 h till afternoon 18 h.
    As the day was progressing, the temperature level rose, and the soil moisture
    decreased gradually. This was gathered from the sensors and transmitted to the
    system. The Arduino Uno board is directly connected to a Wi-Fi module, allowing
    it to send the sensor data to cloud storage using a software program in the Arduino
    IDE. Figures 2 and 3 show the graphical representation of the soil moisture sensor
    and temperature sensor data. It is evident that the proposed system could control
    the set soil moisture level and automatically switch on the water pump motor when
    required as per the signal transmission. The test was performed for loamy soil
    which requires an optimum level of soil moisture is between 70 and 90. The optimum
    temperature needed for crops in the tropical climate is less than 30 °C. Fig.
    2 Soil moisture sensor output Full size image Fig. 3 Soil temperature sensor output
    Full size image As shown in Fig. 2, when the moisture level dropped less than
    70% (i.e., 65%), the water pump motor switched automatically on. This is evident
    from the next reading where the moisture level raised up to 82%. In comparison
    with Fig. 3, the soil temperature correlates with the soil moisture level in Fig.
    2. In other words, the temperature reduced accordingly to 29 from 33 °C. The results
    further confirm that the stability of optimum temperature, and optimum moisture
    level required for plant growth is maintained throughout the life cycle of the
    plant or crop. The comparison analysis in Fig. 4 shows that the temperature effects
    are well controlled by the model system. The morning reading shows the moisture
    level as high while the temperature of the soil is very low. As the time increased,
    the temperature gradually shot up in the soil. As the result of the effect, the
    soil moisture reduced drastically between 11.00 and 12.00 h. The automated system
    initialized the irrigation and neutralized the temperature to the optimum and
    increased the moisture of the soil. The lowest level of the moisture was observed
    around 12.00 PM and resumed within an hour. The drop in the moisture did not affect
    the plant, as the duration not longer to make the crop wilting. The same trend
    was observed in high Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) regions, where respective
    sensors were tested for temperature and soil moisture. Yielding the results were
    similar to that of the above-mentioned. Fig. 4 Comparison of effects of model
    on temperature and moisture of the soil Full size image The effects of the smart
    irrigation model on temperature and moisture of the soil could be compared with
    different metrics. The threshold metric indicates that the water pump motor is
    triggered when the moisture level drops below 70%, ensuring that the plants receive
    enough water. The maximum metric shows that the model increases the moisture level
    to 82%, which is the maximum level recorded. The minimum metric demonstrates that
    the moisture level drops drastically at 11.00 h, reaches its lowest point at 12.00
    h, but resumes within an hour. The stability metric reveals that the model maintains
    optimum temperature and moisture level throughout the life cycle of the plant
    or crop. Finally, the correlation metric highlights that the soil temperature
    is correlated with the soil moisture level, indicating that temperature reduced
    accordingly as the moisture level increased. 5 Conclusion Recently, smart systems
    for monitoring and maintaining agricultural farms in developed countries have
    gained widespread acceptance. However, due to the high cost of investments, smallholder
    farmers in India are not able to afford the recent technology. Therefore, this
    research proposes an integrated framework for a smart irrigation system for plant
    health management and has successfully developed a prototype for this system.
    The proposed system uses soil moisture sensors to detect moisture levels in the
    soil. This data is then used to optimize irrigation schedules and ensure that
    plants receive the right amount of water at the right time, thus improving water
    use efficiency and reducing water waste. The proposed system has the potential
    to significantly improve plant growth and crop yields by maintaining optimal growing
    conditions. It also helps the farmers with real-time information on plant health
    and soil moisture levels. Additionally, the study explores the potential use of
    combining UAVs and IoT technologies to create innovative solutions for precision
    agriculture. Further, research is continued to establish the efficiency of this
    proposed model for a small and larger scale and DL-based DSS study. References

  description: Measurement of soil water content is complicated due to the soil heterogeneity
    and environmental variability. No single efficient method has been developed to
    map the different soil moisture zones at great depth at the field scale without
    disturbing the soil structure and paths of the waterflow. Partially or completely
    non-destructive measurement of soil moisture is provided by ground-penetrating
    radar (GPR), which offers high resolution and significant penetration depth for
    medium-scale soil moisture measurements, bridging the methodological gap between
    small-scale point-based and large-scale remote sensing techniques. In addition,
    this technique can be used with better time efficiency compared to other destructive
    or non-destructive procedures. GPR has been used for soil water content estimation
    including measuring soil water content profile, identifying specific soil water
    depths or soil water variation under irrigation conditions. Despite the high potential
    of GPR for hydrological investigations, it is important to realize that no single
    geophysical method is able to perform optimally under all conditions. For example,
    GPR is mostly restricted to areas with relatively low electrical conductivity
    (low attenuation of the electromagnetic wave). In addition, some of the GPR interpretation
    methods require the presence of well identifiable and continuous GPR reflections,
    which requires sufficient and spatially continuous subsurface contrast in dielectric
    permittivity. Soil moisture (considering its flow) is a key variable in the fields
    of agriculture. It is the essential requirement for plants to grow. Consequently,
    soil moisture is important for irrigation management particularly in semiarid
    and arid regions. In this paper, the literature of the principles of GPR measurements
    and utilization possibilities is summarized with the emphasis on the agricultural
    sector. GPR can be a beneficial measuring device that can help in mapping soil
    moisture distribution, taking into account infiltration, but also water loss caused
    by evaporation and plant water absorption. Consequently, it can be used in agriculture,
    due to its precision at high central frequency values, even (fine)root characteristics
    of the plants, essentially the xylem-water relationship can also be determined
    (xylem transports water and water-soluble minerals and supply water used during
    photosynthesis). In addition, GPR can provide valuable information regarding natural
    stratification and soil compaction. The data interpretation of GPR measurements,
    in addition to soil compaction causing a decrease in the moisture of soils (as
    three-phase systems), can in principle be extended to other aspects of agrotechnology,
    such as soil contamination studying. However, it has not been sufficiently explored,
    as no recent literature can be found on this subject. Soil radar can be a useful
    part of "Smart farming", which can help in the selection of soil moisture measuring
    sensors placed in the soil as part of it. Especially when associated with the
    recently released new simultaneous multi-offset and multi-channel (SiMoc) GPR
    system, which enables fast soil profile mapping with seven receivers, but at the
    speed of a traditional single-channel GPR. If complete non-destruction is the
    goal, air-coupled GPRs mounted on a drone can provide an opportunity. It should
    be noted, however, that due to the significant signal attenuation (wave scattering)
    occurring at the soil-air interface, only a small penetration depth can be achieved.

    ARTICLES Abstract A talajnedvesség-tartalom variabilitásának mérését jelentősen
    megnehezíti a talaj heterogenitása és a környezeti változatosság. Jelenleg még
    nem fejlesztettek ki olyan univerzális módszert, amely a magas vagy alacsony talajnedvesség-zónák
    szántóföldi léptékű feltérképezésére alkalmas úgy, hogy a talajnak és a talajnedvesség
    áramlásának teljes zavarásmentességét nagy mélységben is biztosítja. A talajnedvesség-mérés
    részben (talajkapcsolt), vagy teljesen roncsolásmentes (levegőkapcsolt) lehetőségét
    biztosítja a földradar (GPR), amely nagy felbontást és jelentős behatolási mélységet
    biztosít a közepes léptékű talajnedvesség meghatározáshoz, így hiánypótló technikát
    jelent a kisléptékű pontszerű és a nagyléptékű távérzékelt mérési technikák közötti
    metodikai hiány kitöltésére. Emellett jobb időhatékonyággal alkalmazható más roncsolásos
    és roncsolásmentes eljárásokkal összevetve. A talajradart sikeresen alkalmazták
    a talajnedvesség-meghatározásra, de hidrológiai vizsgálatokban történő alkalmazásának
    nagy potenciálja ellenére nem minden körülmény között működik optimálisan. Felhasználhatósága
    többnyire olyan területekre korlátozódik, ahol viszonylag alacsony az elektromos
    vezetőképesség (az elektromágneses hullám gyenge csillapodására való tekintettel).
    Ezen túlmenően egyes talajradar módszerek működésének alapfeltétele a jól azonosítható
    és folyamatos jelvisszaverődés, továbbá a dielektromos állandó tekintetében a
    földradar-rendszerek térben folyamatos felszín alatti kontrasztot igényelnek.
    A talajnedvesség és annak áramlása kulcsparaméter a mezőgazdaság különböző területein.
    A talajnedvesség (és a talajvíz) látja el a növényeket, ami elengedhetetlen feltétele
    a növények fejlődésének. Ennélfogva a talaj nedvességtartalmának, eloszlásának,
    áramlásának, valamint a beszivárgás sajátosságainak alapos és lokális ismerete
    az öntözés hatékony megvalósításának alapköve, különösen a félszáraz és száraz
    éghajlatú területeken. A talajradar mérési alapjaival, valamint hasznosítási lehetőségeivel
    összefüggésben az elsősorban nemzetközi szakirodalmat összegezve megállapítható,
    hogy a GPR előnyös mérőeszköz lehet, amely segíthet a talaj nedvességeloszlásának
    feltérképezésében, tekintettel a beszivárgásra, a párolgás és a növényi vízfelvétel
    okozta vízveszteségre is. Következésképpen mezőgazdasági felhasználhatósága lehetséges.
    A talajradar hasznos része lehet a „Smart farming”-nak (intelligens gazdálkodás),
    segítséget nyújthat a talajban elhelyezett talajnedvesség-mérő szenzorok kijelölésében.
    Különösen, ha a közelmúltban megjelent új, szimultán többeltolásos és többcsatornás
    (SiMoc) GPR rendszerre asszociálunk, amely gyors talajprofil-feltérképezést tesz
    lehetővé a hét vevőegységével, de a hagyományos egycsatornás GPR sebességével.
    Ha a teljes roncsolásmentesség a cél, úgy a drónra szerelt levegőkapcsolt GPR-ek
    nyújthatnak lehetőséget. Megjegyzendő azonban, hogy a talaj-levegő határfelületen
    jelentkező szignifikáns jelcsillapodás (hullámszóródás) következtében a feltárási
    mélység jelentősen csökken. A földradar végső soron mérési alapul szolgálhat a
    hatékony (precíziós) öntözési gazdálkodás kialakításához, és a megfelelő vízfelhasználási
    hatékonyságot biztosítva járulhat hozzá a precíziós mezőgazdasági programok megvalósításához.
    Bevezetés Korunk egyik legégetőbb globális kérdése az élelmiszertermelés szempontjából,
    hogy meddig tudjuk élelemmel ellátni az egyre növekvő népességet egyre kevesebb
    (és gyakran gyengébb minőségű) rendelkezésre álló termőterületről (FAO, 2020).
    A kulcs a növényi erőforrás-felhasználás hatékonyságának folyamatos fejlődése
    (MORISON et al., 2008), és a termőtalajok minőségének javítása (LIU et al., 2015).
    A Föld vízkészletének csak 0,0012%-át képezi a földfelszín közeli talajnedvesség
    (VANDER & CASEY, 2010), azonban a hidrológiai folyamatok egyik kulcsparamétere,
    amely befolyásolja a vízcserét és az energiaáramlást a földfelszín/légkör határfelületen
    (SHUKLA & GARG, 2014). Szántóföldi körülmények között a talajnedvesség a növények
    fejlődésében kulcsparaméter, a termény minőségét leginkább meghatározó faktorok
    egyike (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018). Legnagyobb kihívást a száraz és félszáraz régiók
    jelentik, ahol a felszín alatti vízforrásokat, különösen a víztartó rétegeket
    használják öntözésre, mivel a csapadék csak egy részét fedezi a termőnövények
    párologtatási veszteségének (NEUPANE & WENXUAN, 2019). A talajban tárolt nedvesség
    mennyisége a talaj szemcseméret-eloszlásától, szerkezetétől, porozitásától, tömörödöttségének
    fokától, a termőrétegének vastagságától, ásványi összetételétől, sótartalmától,
    szennyezettségétől, szervesanyag tartalmától, illetve a légkör hőmérsékletétől
    és a páratartalmától is függ (MUNOTH et al., 2016). A talajnedvesség-tartalom
    jelen cikk esetében a térfogati talajvíztartalmat jelenti, ami az adott talajban
    lévő víz térfogatának, a teljes talajtérfogathoz viszonyított aránya egy egységre
    vonatkoztatva (TOSTI & SLOB, 2015). A talajnedvesség és annak tér- és időbeli
    változása több tudományterület, így az ökológia, mezőgazdaság, hidrológia és mérnöki
    tudományok (pl.: talajok, talajfelszín alatti rétegek kutatásai) kulcsparamétere,
    ezért meghatározza a csapadéknak a beszivárgásra, felszíni lefolyásra jutó részét,
    ezáltal az erózió, vízfolyás-vízhozam, és a talajvíz-utánpótlódás arányait (KLOTZSCHE
    et al., 2018). A talajnedvességtartalom-meghatározási eljárásoknál (áttekintés
    a következő fejezetben) jelenleg is hiányosság van a nagyléptékű, azaz pontszerű
    (<0,01 m2), és a kis/közepes léptékű, vagyis távérzékelt (>100 m2) mérési lehetőségek
    között. A két véglet közötti (0,01–100 m2) hiány áthidalását jelentheti a szántóföldi
    léptékű alkalmazást biztosító földradar (vagy talajradar – ground penetrating
    radar; GPR) (SHUKLA & GARG, 2014; TOSTI & SLOB, 2015). A GPR mérések sikeres mezőgazdasági
    alkalmazásának két fő követelménye a felszín alatti első méterig való behatolás
    képessége és a centiméteres felbontás (LOMBARDI et al., 2022). Jelen cikk célja
    a talajnedvesség-tartalom földradarral történő mérési, valamint mezőgazdasági
    alkalmazhatósági lehetőségeinek bemutatása, összefoglalva a legfontosabb, elsősorban
    nemzetközi szakirodalmat. Talajnedvesség-meghatározási módszerek A talajnedvesség
    meghatározásának legelterjedtebb, hagyományos, leginkább kutatott, ugyanakkor
    nagyszámú minta esetén munkaigényes, direkt eljárású lehetősége a magfúrásokra
    alkalmazott termogravimetrikus eljárás (hőelemzési technika, ahol a vizsgált mintát
    standard 105 °C-on tömegállandóságig szárítják, és az így mért abszolút száraz
    tömegre vonatkoztatják a tömeg%-os nedvességtartalmat). A módszerrel a talaj térfogattömegének
    (vagy térfogatsűrűségének) mérése alapján konvertálhatók a kapott tömegarányos,
    (vagy tömeg%-os) nedvességtartalom eredmények térfogatarányos, (vagy térfogat%-os)
    értékekké (STEELMAN & ENDRES, 2012; TOSTI & SLOB, 2015). A kevesebb roncsolással
    járó, indirekt módszerek közé sorolhatók a nukleáris eljárások, mint a gamma sugárgyengítéses
    módszerek, vagy a finomabb kalibrációt biztosító neutronszonda (KLOTZSCHE et al.,
    2018), valamint az elektromágneses szenzorok. Ezen utóbbi csoportba tartoznak
    a dielektromos és kapacitás alapú technikák: a legismertebbek közül például a
    magasfrekvenciás impedancia mérést lehetővé tevő kapacitás szonda, az időtartománybeli
    reflexiómérés (Time Domain Reflectometry; TDR), és a frekvencia-tartománybeli
    reflexiómérés (Frequency Domain Reflectometry; FDR). Az elektromágneses szenzorok
    közé tartoznak továbbá az elektromos ellenállás és elektromos vezetőképesség alapú
    technikák (1. ábra). Az alkalmazott technikák közül érdemes még megemlíteni a
    hőimpulzusszenzorokat, tenziométereket és a gipszblokkok-nylonelemek elektromos
    vezetőképességének mérését is (TOSTI & SLOB, 2015). VIEW FULL SIZE 1. ábra Talajnedvesség-meghatározási

    tesz lehetővé a távérzékelési eszközök alkalmazása, ahol a műszerek nem érintkeznek
    a talajjal. Továbbá a nagyobb területi lefedettségre vonatkozó méréseket is lehetővé
    teszik (100 m2 – 100 km2) (ROBINSON et al., 2008). A talajnedvesség távérzékelés
    alapú meghatározása elsősorban mikrohullámú szenzorokkal történik. Mivel mind
    a passzív, mind az aktív mikrohullámok érzékenyek a víz dielektromos állandójára,
    ami befolyásolja azok emissziós képességét és visszaverődését, lehetővé téve ezzel
    a felszíni talajnedvesség mérését. Az aktív érzékelő mikrohullámú impulzust bocsájt
    ki és fogad, míg a passzív érzékelő a természetes hőkibocsájtást rögzíti a föld
    felszínéről. A spektrumtartomány alapján optikai (VIS – VISible – látható fény;
    NIR – Near Infrared közeli hullámhosszú infravörös), termális (LWIR – Long WaveLength
    Infrared – hosszú hullámhosszú infravörös), valamint mikrohullám típus (passzív
    és aktív) különíthető el. A spektroszkópiai módszer elve az elektromágneses sugárzási
    energia és az anyag közötti kölcsönhatáson alapul. A talaj fizikai és kémiai jellemzőinek
    – például vízmolekuláknak – jelenléte miatt az elektromágneses sugárzás az egyes
    molekuláris kötések rezgését idézi elő. A rezgések révén a fény elnyelődik egy
    frekvenciához kötött, meghatározott energiakvantummal, lehetővé téve a talaj tulajdonságainak
    elemzését (PRADIPTA et al., 2022a; SHUKLA & GARG, 2014). Az aktív mikrohullámú
    érzékelők nagyobb térbeli feloldóképességgel bírnak, mint a passzív mikrohullámúak,
    ezért felhasználásuk egy farm gazdaság szintjén célszerű (amelyek átlagos területe
    1,8 km2 az USA-ban). A passzív mikrohullámú szenzorok a helyi vagy regionális
    szintű mezőgazdasági döntéshozatalban hasznosak (PRADIPTA et al., 2022b). A növénytakaró
    és a talaj jellemzői jelentősen befolyásolhatják a talajnedvesség-meghatározás
    pontosságát, úgy, hogy a szenzor érzékenysége a növényzet sűrűségének növekedésével
    csökken. Általában ez a probléma minimálisra csökkenthető hosszabb hullámhossz
    használatával. A műhold alapú távérzékelés fő korlátja, hogy nem képes megragadni
    a talajnedvesség dinamikáját a mélyebb talajzónában (gyökérzóna talajnedvesség),
    ami a gyökérvízfelvétel és a talaj hidraulikus paraméterei szempontjából lényeges
    információ (PRADIPTA et al., 2022b). Az optikai és termikus szenzorok kombinációja
    (optikai-termikus), az úgynevezett hőmérséklet-növényzet háromszög megközelítés.
    Alapelve, hogy a talajnedvesség szorosan összefügg a földfelszín hőmérsékletével
    és a vegetációs indexszel (PRADIPTA et al., 2022b). A felszíni talajnedvesség
    mérés konkrét, távérzékelési alapú termékei, mikrohullám szenzor esetén a SMAP_SM
    (Soil Moisture Active Passive) (9 km-es térbeli felbontás); az AMSR2 SM (Advanced
    Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2) (25 km-es térbeli felbontás). A MODIS_LST (MODerate
    resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer_Land Surface Temperature), mint termikus
    (1 km-es térbeli felbontással) és a MODIS_ Surface Reflectance, mint optikai (250
    m-es térbeli felbontás), továbbá a Sentinel-1 és -2 Landsat-8 OLI & TIRS (ahol
    a Sentinel-1: 15 m, míg a Sentinel-2: 10–60 m térbeli felbontásúak), az előbbi
    esetén mikrohullám, optikai és termális, utóbbi esetén pedig optikai és termális
    szenzorokról beszélhetünk. A gyökérzóna talajnedvesség-feltérképezésének, távérzékelés
    alapú termékei mikrohullám-optikai szenzor esetén a SMAP SM, SMOS SSM (Soil Moisture
    and Ocean Salinity Surface Soil Moisture) (35 km-es térbeli felbontás), SMOS_RZSM
    (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Root Zone Soil Moisture), MODIS LST, MODIS Surface
    Reflectance (PRADIPTA et al., 2022b). Itt jegyezzük meg, hogy a terepi módszerek
    mindig pontosabbak, mint a távérzékelés alapú, közvetett adatgyűjtési eljárások.
    Kiemelendők a geofizikai módszerek, amelyek kifejezetten érzékenyek a talaj elektromos
    tulajdonságainak változásaira, a dielektromos permittivitásra vagyis „áteresztőképességre”
    és/vagy az elektromos vezetőképességre. Fő előnyük, hogy minimális roncsolással
    vagy teljesen roncsolásmentesen kivitelezhetők, és jelentős területet (1–80 km2)
    képesek lefedni. A mezőgazdasági alkalmazás tekintetében, a geofizikai módszereken
    belül az elektromos ellenállás (ERT), az elektromágneses indukció (EMI), illetve
    a jelen cikk tárgyát képező földradar (GPR) a legszélesebb körben alkalmazott
    technikák. A GPR esetén az elektromágneses hullámoknak – rádióspektrum, mikrohullám
    tartomány – a talajba történő kibocsájtása, majd detektálása történik (TOSTI &
    SLOB, 2015). A precíziós gazdálkodás területén legelterjedtebben a GPR-t alkalmazzák,
    mivel a módszer érzékeny a vizsgált közeg (talaj) permittivitási és vezetőképességi
    tulajdonságaira is (LOMBARDI et al., 2022). GPR alkalmazhatósága talajnedvesség-tartalom
    mérésére A földradar egy részben, vagy teljesen roncsolásmentes eljárás, amely
    nagy horizontális és vertikális felbontást tesz lehetővé. Alacsony veszteségű
    anyagok, például a homok maximális elérhető függőleges felbontása nagyfrekvenciás
    (900 MHz-es) antennával 2–8 cm (NEAL, 2004). Másik előnye, hogy jelentős, akár
    50 méteres behatolási mélység is elérhető vele (XINBO et al., 2019). A GPR-t számos
    tudományterületen sikeresen alkalmazzák, így például a régészetben és a kultúrmérnöki
    tudományokban felszín alatti objektumok, például védőgátak állapotának feltérképezésére
    (SHEISHAH et al., 2022), vagy útpályaszerkezetelemzéshez (TOSTI & SLOB, 2015;
    PRIMUSZ & TÓTH, 2021). Ez utóbbi kapcsán HERCEG (2022) mutatja be az útpályaszerkezetek
    földműveinek vizsgálatára alkalmazható GPR alapú talajnedvesség-tartalom meghatározásának
    szakirodalmát. A talajvizsgálatok során, a GPR leggyakoribb alkalmazása a talajnedvesség
    meghatározása, a nedvességtartalom elektromágneses jelterjedést befolyásoló tulajdonsága
    miatt (ZAJÍCOVÁ & CHUMAN, 2019; PATHIRANA et al., 2023). A GPR nagyfrekvenciás
    (többnyire 10–1200 MHz-es) elektromágneses hullámokat használ a vizsgálandó közegben
    lévő célobjektumok detektálására (DANIELS, 2004). A GPR adó egysége elektromágneses
    hullámimpulzusokat bocsájt a vizsgálandó közegbe, a vevő egysége a visszavert
    jeleket fogadja, amit bisztatikus kialakításnak neveznek. A földradar elsődlegesen
    időt mér, az úgynevezett kétirányú futás idejét (HUISMAN et al., 2003). Ezt bővebben
    a GPR alapú talajnedvességmérési módszerek c. fejezet tárgyalja. A földradar kifejezetten
    érzékeny a talajtextúrára, és a talaj elektromos vezetőképességére (HUISMAN et
    al., 2003), ezért felhasználhatósága többnyire olyan területekre korlátozódik,
    ahol viszonylag alacsony a talaj elektromos vezetőképessége, gyenge az elektromágneses
    hullám csillapodása (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018). A földradar két főparamétere a felbontás,
    és a behatolási mélység. Felbontása, annak központi frekvenciájával együtt nő
    (XINBO et al., 2019). A GPR mérések esetén a sávszélesség értéke alapvetően 10
    és 1200 MHz közé esik. A feltárható mélység a vizsgálandó talaj elektromos konduktivitásának,
    és a GPR központi frekvenciájának függvénye. Alacsony vezetőképességű közeg (száraz
    homok, kavics) esetén az alacsony frekvenciás GPR rendszerek (pl. 50 vagy 100
    Mhz-es) néhány 10 méteres, de akár 50 méteres behatolási mélységet is képesek
    elérni (DOOLITTLE et al., 2007). A magas frekvenciás típusok (pl.: 450 vagy 900
    MHz) pár méteres behatolási mélységet valósíthatnak meg. A GPR azonban nem megfelelő
    eszköz szikes talajokon, ahol a behatolási mélység jellemzően 25 cm-nél kisebb.
    Kőzetlisztes homok vagy agyag esetén is jelentősen csökken a behatolási mélység.
    A nedves agyagokban kifejezetten kedvezőtlenek a lehetőségek a talajnedvesség-tartalom
    meghatározására, mert ezeknél a behatolási mélység jellemzően kevesebb, mint 1
    m (DOOLITTLE et al., 2007). SCHROTT és SASS (2008) rámutat, hogy a meredek és
    sziklás terepfelszín a GPR antennák nagy méretei miatt gyakorlatilag lehetetlenné
    teszi azok alkalmazását. Emellett az erdőállományok földradar alapú vizsgálata
    is korlátozott, hiszen a fák gyökérzete, mint visszaverődést okozó felületek,
    hibás mérési adatokat generálnak. Míg a fák gyökérzetének talajradarral történő
    feltérképezéséről az elmúlt 20 évben számos tanulmány született, addig a mezőgazdasági
    termőnövények gyökérzetének vizsgálatával csak korlátozott számú közlemény foglalkozott
    (SHUKLA & GARG, 2014). A DOOLITTLE és munkatársai (2007) által bemutatott talajalkalmassági
    térképek információt adnak azokról a talajtulajdonságokról, amelyek befolyásolják
    a földradar alkalmazhatóságát. Ezeket a térképeket az Egyesült Államokban fejlesztették
    ki a talaj elektromos vezetőképességének adatai alapján, amelyet a talaj agyagtartalma,
    nátrium-abszorpciós aránya és kalcium-karbonát-tartalma befolyásol (LIU et al.,
    2016). Hazai kutatásként ki kell emeljük NÁDASI és munkatársai (2020) munkásságát,
    akik Magyarország földradar-alkalmazhatósági térképét készítették el. Öt osztályt
    különítettek el úgy, hogy az első jelenti a legalkalmasabbat, míg az ötödik jelenti
    a legkevésbé alkalmasat. Az alkalmassági osztályok meghatározásánál a radarhullámok
    terjedését gátló tényezők, mint jelző faktorok, jelentették az alapot, ami elsősorban
    a víz felszínközeli jelenléte (vagy hiánya), az agyagtartalom, az oldott ionok
    potenciális mennyisége, a szikesedés és a kémhatás. A NÁDASI et al. (2020) által
    közölt alkalmassági térkép rámutat, hogy Magyarországon a GPR mérésekre kimondottan,
    illetve közepesen alkalmas területek aránya a teljes területhez viszonyítva megközelítőleg
    15–15%. Körülbelül 50%-ra tehető a kevésbé alkalmas, míg 20%-ra az alkalmatlan
    területek aránya. Jó területeknek számítanak a Duna-Tisza köze, valamint a Nyírség
    homok szövetű talajai. A GPR mérési elve A dielektromos állandó (valós része)
    (𝜀𝑟) egy anyag vákuumhoz viszonyított elektromos térerősség-tárolási kapacitását
    adja meg. Értéke a háromfázisú polidiszperz rendszerben széles skálán mozoghat,
    így a cseppfolyós halmazállapotú (szabad, vagy másnéven gravitációs) víz értéke
    a hőmérséklet függvényében 78–88 közötti (a magasabb hőmérséklet a polarizáció
    erősödésével csökkenti a permittivitást), a talajlevegő értéke kb. 1, míg a szilárd
    fázisok kb. 3–10 közöttiek (CASSIDY, 2009; HUISMAN et al., 2003; STEELMAN & ENDRES,
    2012). A három talajalkotó fázis közti szignifikáns különbség főként a vízmolekulák
    jelentős polarizálhatóságának köszönhető (TOSTI & SLOB, 2015). A higroszkópos
    (adszorpciós) víz esetében a permittivitás 4 alá is csökkenhet (SAARENKETO, 1998),
    a kapilláris víz permittivitása pedig a szabad víz és a higroszkópos értékei között
    található. Ezt a hatást a nagy fajlagos felülettel rendelkező részecskék (agyag
    vagy humusz) okozzák, melyeknek nagyobb a vízmolekulákat megkötő potenciáljuk;
    ezért a vízmolekulák nem képesek válaszreakcióba lépni az elektromágneses mezővel,
    és így csökken a talaj dielektromos permittivitása (LAUER et al., 2010). A talajra
    jellemző jelentős dielektromos állandó különbség teszi lehetővé a GPR-ek mérőeszközként
    való használatát a talajnedvesség-tartalom meghatározásában (XINBO et al., 2019).
    A telítetlen talajok dielektromos permittivitása elsősorban a talaj víztartalmától
    függ, azonban más tényezők, mint a litológia, a hőmérséklet, az ionkoncentráció
    és a pórusfolyadék összetétele szintén befolyásolják azt (LOMBARDI & MAURIZIO,
    2019). Itt jegyezzük meg, hogy a talaj dielektromos permittivitása a talaj szervesanyagtartalmának
    emelkedésével csökken, ami a talaj, adott térfogategységnyi súlyának csökkenéséből
    következik. A száraz biomassza dielektromos permittivitása 1-hez közeli értékű,
    ami a lebomlással növekszik (ZAJÍCOVÁ & CHUMAN, 2019). GPR alapú talajnedvesség-mérési
    módszerek Számos, a nedvességérzékelést megcélzó GPR-alapú módszert fejlesztettek
    ki különböző alkalmazási területekre és anyagokra, így a természetes (módon kialakuló)
    talajokra is (LAMBOT & ANDRÉ, 2014). Az elmúlt évtizedekben a földradar egy lehetséges,
    nagy hatékonysággal alkalmazható műszere volt a telítetlen zónák hidrológiai feltárásának,
    a vízkészlet kutatásoknak (TOSTI & SLOB, 2015), a talajrétegek azonosításának
    (DAVIS & ANNAN, 1989), a felszín alatti hidraulikai paraméterek feltérképezésének
    (HUBBARD, et al. 1997), a talajvízszint lokalizálásának (NAKASHIMA et al., 2001),
    és természetesen a jelen cikk tárgyát képező talajnedvesség-tartalom mérésnek
    is (HUISMAN et al., 2003; KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018). A GPR-alapú talajnedvesség-mérési
    módszerek területén, a közelmúltban elért kutatási eredményeket XINBO és munkatársai
    (2019) mutatják be az alapelvek, előnyök, korlátok, valamint alkalmazási lehetőségek
    tekintetében. A szerzők hét elterjedt mérési technikát demonstrálnak, név szerint
    a visszavert hullám, a talajhullám, a felszíni visszaverődés, a fúrólyuk GPR technika,
    teljes hullámforma inverzió, átlagos burkológörbe amplitúdó és frekvencia eltolás.
    Hardver tekintetében talajkapcsolt GPR-t és levegőkapcsolt földradar antenna kialakítást
    különíthetünk el. Előbbi esetén az eszköz a talajjal közvetlenül érintkezik, ezért
    ez a megvalósítás csak a felszín alatt roncsolásmentes. Az adatminőséget a talaj
    felületérdessége, a vegetáció, az antenna pozícionálásakor esetlegesen fellépő
    akadályok befolyásolják (HUISMAN et al., 2003). A felszínvisszaverődés módszer
    levegőkapcsolt antennával működik, ezért teljes roncsolásmentességet biztosít.
    A technika alkalmas a talajnedvesség nagy térbeli felbontással kivitelezett feltárására,
    emiatt azonban néhány cm-re szűkül a feltárási mélység, továbbá érzékennyé válik
    a felszínborítottságra, felületérdességre, (XINBO et al., 2019), ami az érdesség-modell
    integrálásával javítható (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018). Az elterjedt földradar-technikák
    adatgyűjtési és adatfeldolgozási metódusát tekintve a visszavert hullám, a talajhullám
    és a fúrólyuk GPR módszerek esetén először a rendelkezésre álló radarhullámok
    átlagos sebességének meghatározása szükséges (a GPR által kibocsájtott elektromágneses
    hullám jel kétirányú futási idejéből meghatározva), amelyet a dielektromos állandó,
    majd a talajnedvesség számításához használnak. A felszín-visszaverődés módszerrel
    a reflexiós együttható (a levegő és a talaj felszíne közötti határfelületről történő
    visszaverődés amplitúdóból meghatározva) és a talaj dielektromos állandója között
    határoznak meg összefüggést; a teljes hullámforma inverzió és az átlagos burkológörbe
    amplitúdó módszerekkel viszont a radarjelekből közvetlenül is meghatározható a
    talaj dielektromos állandója. A dielektromos állandó alapú módszerek átszámítási
    képletet igényelnek (bővebben a „Petrofizikai összefüggések” fejezetben) a talaj
    dielektromos állandójának talajnedvességgé alakításához, továbbá terepi kalibrációt
    (STEELMAN & ENDRES, 2012). A szokványos megközelítéstől eltér a frekvenciaeltoláson
    alapuló módszer, amely a talajnedvességet a FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation)
    révén kapja meg. A talaj, GPR alapú nedvességtartalom meghatározásának pontossága
    – a talajviszonyoktól és a talajradar antenna konfigurációjától függően – 0,0026
    cm3 cm–3 (STOFFREGEN et al., 2002) és 0,115 cm3 cm–3 (WEIHERMÜLLER et al., 2007)
    között változhat. A GPR módszerek mérési pontossága mellett a precíz, térbeli
    pozicionálása is kiemelt szerepet kap, amit a legtöbb GPR-rendszer ma már lehetővé
    tesz a GPS-rendszerekkel való plug-and-play kapcsolat segítségével. A közelmúltban
    kereskedelmi forgalomba került műholdas kommunikációs jelvétel alapú GPS rendszer
    az „European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service” (EGNOS) és a „Wide Area
    Augmentation System” (WAAS), melyekkel akár 0,04 m abszolút pozíciópontosság érhető
    el (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018). Petrofizikai összefüggések A dielektromos állandón
    alapuló módszereknél a talaj dielektromos állandóját határozzák meg első körben,
    majd abból helyszíni kalibrációval, vagy empirikus módon a talajnedvességet petrofizikai
    összefüggés segítségével. A petrofizikai összefüggéseknek 3 csoportja ismeretes:
    empirikus összefüggések, térfogati keveréses formulák, effektív közeg megközelítések.
    TOPP et al. (1980), ROTH et al. (1990), NADLER et al. (1991), JACOBSEN és SCHJONNING
    (1993) rámutattak, hogy a terepi és laboratóriumi mérés alapú, kevésbé összetett
    empirikus megközelítések, a talaj szerkezeti tulajdonságairól (pl. térfogatsűrűség,
    porozitás, pórusszerkezet stb.) csak korlátozott információt igényelnek. A térfogati
    keverés formulák, a háromfázisú talaj-levegő-víz rendszer térfogati összetevőit
    és dielektromos állandóját veszik alapul a kapcsolat felállítására. Ilyen például
    a CRIM (Complex Refractive Index Model) modell (DOBSON et al., 1985; JONES & FRIEDMAN,
    2000). Az effektív közeg megközelítések figyelembe veszik egy kompozit anyag textúrális
    és szerkezeti hozzájárulását annak dielektromos állandójához (TYČ et al., 1988;
    FRIEDMAN, 1998; ENDRES & BERTRAND, 2006). Jelen cikkben a két legelterjedtebb,
    a nemzetközi szakirodalomban leggyakrabban előforduló empirikus petrofizikai összefüggést,
    vagyis a Topp és Roth egyenleteket vázoljuk (ROTH et al., 1992; TOPP et al., 1980;
    STEELMAN & ENDRES, 2012). θ s o i l = − 5 , 3 * 10 − 2 + 2 , 92 * 10 − 2 ε s o
    i l − 5 , 5 * 10 − 4 ε 2 s o i l + 4 , 3 * 10 − 6 ε 3 s o i l  ( 1 a ) ahol 𝜃𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙:
    térfogati talajnedvesség, 𝜀𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙: talaj dielektromos állandója A Topp-egyenletet
    empirikus módon határozták meg a különböző fizikai talajféleségekre (különböző
    textúrával rendelkező ásványi talajokra), de elsősorban homokos talajok esetén
    alkalmazható (TOPP et al., 1980; STOFFREGEN et al., 2002). Pontossága JACOBSEN
    és SCHIJONNING (1994) validációja alapján: 0,022 m3 m–3 ROTH et al. (1992) TDR
    segítségével ásványi, szerves és mágneses tulajdonsággal rendelkező talajokra
    alkalmazható empirikus összefüggést alkotott, 0,015 m3 m–3 előrejelzési hibával:
    θ = − 7 , 28 ⋅ 10 − 2 + 4 , 48 ⋅ 10 − 2 ε r − 19 , 5 ⋅ 10 − 4 ε 2 r + 36 , 1 ⋅
    10 − 6 ε 3 r  ( 1 b ) STEELMAN és ENDRES (2012) a talajnedvesség és a dielektromos
    állandó közötti kőzetfizikai összefüggések hatékonyságát vizsgálták. A GPR terepi
    mérések homokra, homokos vályogra és iszapos vályogra irányultak. A teljes adatsort
    nézve ROTH et al. (1990) összefüggése mellett TOPP és munkatársai (1980) adták
    a legpontosabb előrejelzést a talajnedvesség-tartalomról 0,052 m3 m–3 négyzetes
    hibával (RMSE: root mean square error). DEIANA és munkatársai (2008) a beszivárgás
    hatására létrejövő lefelé irányuló vízáramlást vizsgálták kiterjedt vadózus zónákban,
    GPR segítségével. A szerzők rámutattak, hogy legtöbb tanulmány a természetes infiltrációhoz
    kapcsolódóan kis (max. 0,03 cm3 cm–3) talajnedvesség változásokat jelzett. Meg
    kell jegyezni azonban, hogy a GPR-vizsgálatokat túlnyomórészt alacsony elektromos
    vezetőképességű talajokon végezték, amelyek jellemzően alacsony vízmegtartó képességgel
    is rendelkeznek (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018). GPR mérési technika számítási menete
    (visszavert hullám módszerrel) A GPR adóegysége által kibocsájtott elektromágneses
    hullámok visszaverődnek, illetve megtörnek a levegő/talajfelszín határfelületen
    és/vagy két eltérő dielektromos tulajdonságú talajrétegen, majd levegő-, talaj-,
    visszavert vagy megtört hullámként érik el a vevőegységet. HUISMAN et al. (2003)
    rámutatnak, hogy a visszavert hullám sebessége a talaj elektromos értelemben vett
    áteresztőképességétől, dielektromos állandójától függ, ha kis vezetőképességű
    és nemmágneses talajt vizsgálunk: v s o i l = c √ ε s o i l  ( 2 ) ahol, 𝑣𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙:
    a visszavert hullám talajban történő átlagos terjedési sebessége, 𝜀𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙: talaj
    dielektromos állandója, c: elektromágneses hullám vákuumban való terjedési sebessége
    (2,9979 108 m s–1) Amennyiben a mélység ismert, akkor a vevőegységbe érkező hullámok
    kétirányú futásidejéből meghatározható a vizsgált zóna (itt talaj) átlagos talajnedvesség-tartalma
    a következő egyenlettel: v s o i l = 2 d t r w  ( 3 ) ahol, 𝑡𝑟𝑤: a visszavert
    hullám kétirányú futásideje, d: vizsgált réteg mélysége Ha az adó és a vevőegység
    között jelentős a távolság, akkor a (3) egyenlet módosul (HUISMAN et al., 2003;
    TOSTI & SLOB, 2015): v s o i l = 2 √ d 2 + ( 0.5 a ) 2 t r w  ( 4 ) ahol, 𝑎: antennatávolság
    A bemutatott számítás a talajfelszín és a visszaverő felület közti réteg (talajszelvény)
    talajnedvességét reprezentálja, amin a hullám áthalad. A visszavert- és a talajhullám
    értelmezésekor idealizált esetben homogén talajnedvességeloszlást feltételezünk,
    azonban a valós terepi viszonyok nem mindig egyszerűsíthetők le ennyire. Kifejezetten
    igaz ez az olyan dinamikus hidrológiai folyamatok esetén, mint a beszivárgás,
    a kapillaritás vagy az olvadás, ahol a vékony rétegek közötti erős kontraszt és
    a permittivitás gradiense lényegesen befolyásolhatják a földradar válaszjelét
    (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018). A földradar mezőgazdasági alkalmazhatósága a talaj nedvességtartalmának
    meghatározására Az éghajlatváltozás főként a globális felmelegedéssel, szárazodással
    tipizálható. (IPCC, 2022). A világszintű, ugyanakkor régiónként eltérő hőmérsékletemelkedés
    következményeként az evapotranszspiráció (ET), a csapadék és a légköri vízgőztartalom
    tér és időbeli változékonysága is fokozódik. Ez a talaj nedvességtartalmának ingadozását
    és a teljes hidrológiai ciklus felerősödését okozza. Globális szinten a 21. század
    eleje óta az evapotranszspiráció meghaladja a csapadék mennyiségét (DENG et al.,
    2020). Hazánkra, a minimum- és maximumhőmérsékletek 21. század végi emelkedése
    mellett, a csapadék szabálytalan eloszlása jellemző. Elviekben a heves csapadékesemények
    és a súlyos szárazság előfordulása egyaránt valószínű, a gyakorlatban azonban
    az 1980-as évek óta egyre gyakrabban fordul elő aszály, amely elsősorban a vegetációs
    időszakot sújtja (GÁLOS et al., 2015; MÁTYÁS et al., 2018). A fokozódó aszály
    miatt a vízgazdálkodási feladatok aránya nő. A 2021 végére országosan 112 állomással
    rendelkező Operatív Aszály- és Vízhiánykezelő Monitoringrendszer magában foglalja
    és ingyenesen elérhetővé teszi a talajnedvesség-mérő monitoringhálózat adatait,
    a védekezési fokozatok elrendeléséhez szükséges (napi) meteorológiai és talajnedvesség
    adatokat is tartalmazó kombinált aszályindexet, az ezekre épülő elemzéseket, kármentesítési
    terveket, és védekezési fokozatokat. A rendelkezésre álló adatok révén így napi
    szintű tájékoztatás kapható a vízhiány (aszály) aktuális helyzetéről és várható
    tendenciáiról (FIALA et al., 2018). A mezőgazdaság fenntarthatóságának – ahol
    a növényi erőforrás-felhasználás hatékonysága folyamatosan fejlődik – meghatározó
    tényezője a rendelkezésre álló víz mellett (MORISON et al., 2008) a termőtalaj
    minősége (LIU et al., 2015). A növények gyökérzete a vizet és a szükséges tápanyagokat
    a talajból veszi fel, aminek állapota befolyásolja a növények gyökérzetének eloszlását
    és működését (ZHANG et al., 2009; SHARMA et al., 2014; LIU et al., 2015; 2016).
    Megjegyzendő azonban, hogy egy mezőgazdasági terület esetén a talajfelszín alatti
    kölcsönhatások komplexek, így a talajnedvesség mellett, a talaj szerkezete és
    tömörödése is befolyásolhatja a gyökéreloszlást. Agrotechnológia szempontjából
    a talajdegradáció egyik formája, a talajtömörödés a mezőgazdasági talajok sajátossága.
    AKINSUNMADE et al. (2019) kutatása a talajtömörödés vizsgálatát célozta meg. A
    talajtömörödés az intenzív gazdálkodással, a nehézgépek súlya révén alakul ki.
    A tömörödés a talajban a nagy hézagok redukálódását (makroporozitás-csökkenését),
    vagy eltűnését okozhatja, így a talaj hidraulikus vezetőképessége és ezáltal a
    nedvessége és az oldottanyag-tartalma is csökken. A folyamat gátolja az öntözővíz
    beszivárgását és a tápanyagfelvételt. A lefolyást és a talajeróziót fokozza, illetve
    korlátozza a gyökér fejlődését is (LOMBARDI et al., 2022). A GPR mérések sikeres
    mezőgazdasági alkalmazásának két fő követelménye a felszín alatti első méterig
    való behatolás képessége és a centiméteres felbontás. Ezért a mezőgazdasági vizsgálatokhoz
    használt GPR berendezések többsége 200–900 MHz közötti központi frekvenciatartományra
    kiélezett, ami száraz talajok esetén 3–14 cm, nedves talajok esetében pedig 8–18
    cm vertikális felbontásnak felel meg (LOMBARDI et al., 2022). A növénytermesztés
    hozamának a talajtömörödés okozta veszteségei gyorsan kivizsgálhatók GPR segítségével.
    Ennek oka, hogy a talaj agrotechnikai tulajdonságainak változása szorosan összefügg
    a talajszerkezetben lévő víz térfogati hányadával. A talajtömörödöttség fokával
    változik a porozitás, a pórusméreteloszlás, ezáltal a víz térfogatarányos mennyisége
    is változik, ami a GPR jelet is megváltoztatja. AKINSUNMADE et al. (2019) krakkói
    mezőgazdasági parcellán végzett talajtömörödéssel kapcsolatos kutatási eredményei
    rámutattak, hogy a GPR hullámamplitúdó abszolút értéke, a traktor által tömörített
    talaj esetén körülbelül háromszor kisebb, mint a jármű futását megelőző értéke.
    A GPR mérés eredményeit, a talajtömörödés mellett a talajszennyezettség is befolyásolhatja.
    A mezőgazdasági talajokban a nehézfémek kevésbé oldódó formában felhalmozódhatnak,
    negatívan hatva a termés minőségére, hiszen a növények számára esszenciális tápanyagok
    felvételét akadályozzák. Ugyanakkor előfordulhat, hogy bizonyos körülmények (pH,
    vagy redoxipotenciál-változások) hatására ismét vízoldható formába kerülnek a
    fémek, ezért elszennyezhetik a talajvizet, és bekerülhetnek a növényi szövetbe,
    majd a terményen tartott haszonállatba, végül az emberbe. Kiemelendő a szennyvíz
    alapú öntözés, különösen, ha az ipari eredetű, ami hozzájárul egyes toxikus nehézfémek
    koncentrációnövekedéséhez (KELEPERTZIS, 2014; ULLAH et al., 2022). Ez utóbbi különösen
    a fejlődő országokban probléma, ahol a vízhiány miatt széles körben használják
    fel öntözésre a szennyvizet (ATTA et al., 2023). A hagyományos mezőgazdálkodási
    gyakorlat egységesen kezeli a termőterületet anélkül, hogy figyelembe venné a
    domborzati, talaj- és növényfejlődési feltételek valamint egyéb agronómiai tényezők
    változékonyságát. A környezet geológiai és hidrológiai viszonyainak heterogenitása
    miatt a terepről származó pontadatok gyakran leegyszerűsített képet adnak, és
    nem tükrözik a tényleges állapotot. Ez tápanyag kimosódást (túlöntözést), környezetszennyezést
    (pl. szennyező anyagok talajvízbe mosódását) és a gazdálkodó szempontjából csökkent
    jövedelmezőséget eredményezhet. A precíziós mezőgazdálkodás során a termőterületet
    kis gazdálkodási egységekre osztják fel, az optimalizált termelést megcélozva
    (ZAJC et al., 2020). A precíziós mezőgazdaság egy olyan irányítási rendszer, amely
    a termőföld és a termésnövekedés tér- és időbeli változékonyságát méri és reagál
    azokra, a résztáblák szintjén növelve a jövedelmezőséget és csökkentve a környezeti
    terhelést. A főbb technológiák közé tartoznak a földrajzi információs rendszerek
    (GIS), a távérzékelés, a globális navigációs műholdrendszer (GNSS) és a terméshozam-figyelés.
    Lehetővé válik továbbá az öntözővíz helyspecifikus kijuttatása is. A változó arányú
    öntözési technológia (VRI = variable rate irrigation) segíthet a megfelelő mennyiségű
    víz megfelelő időben történő kijuttatásában a tábla megfelelő területén, ami kb.
    10–15% vízmegtakarítást eredményez (NEUPANE & WENXUAN, 2019). A szenzoros technológia
    a talaj nedvességszintjének folyamatos nyomon követését biztosítja, vagyis döntéstámogató
    eszközként szolgálhat az öntözés ütemezéséhez, így elkerülhetővé válik a szárazságstressz
    (MUNOTH et al., 2016). A talaj nedvességtartalmának szántóföldi monitorozása a
    precíziós öntözésen alapuló gazdálkodás alapköve (VISCONTIA et al., 2014), ami
    lehetővé teszi a termésminőség optimalizálását (LOMBARDI & MAURIZIO, 2019). A
    talajnedvesség eloszlásának ismerete segíthet a növények gyökérkarakterisztikájának
    feltárásában, mivel a hajszálgyökerek megnövelik a makropórustereket, légtereket
    hozva létre a talajszerkezetben (ZHANG et al., 2009; LIU et al., 2016). A mezőgazdasági
    kutatások jelentős része foglalkozik talajnedvesség méréssel (GROTE et al., 2003;
    GALAGEDARA et al., 2005; ROBINSON et al., 2008; LU et al., 2017). A GPR lehetőséget
    ad a talaj nedvességének meghatározására, és ahogy LIU, et al. (2016) kutatása
    rámutat, hatékonyan alkalmazható (magas központi frekvencia értékeken) akár hajszálgyökér
    becslésre is hidrológiai alapú inverz modell segítségével. Lényegében a xilém-víz
    kapcsolat is meghatározható (a xilém feladata a víz és a vízoldékony ásványi anyagok
    szállítása, és a párologtatás, illetve fotoszintézis során felhasznált víz pótlása).
    A GPR talajnedvesség-tartalom becslése a talajnedvesség profiljának mérését (LAMBOT
    & ANDRÉ, 2014), a talaj nedvességtartalom tér- és időbeli változásának nyomon
    követését (PAN et al., 2012), a talajnedvesség-tartalom térbeli változásának szántóföldi
    léptékben történő feltérképezését (WEIHERMÜLLER et al., 2007), a talajművelés
    talajnedvességtartalomra gyakorolt hatásának összehasonlítását (JONARD et al.,
    2013) és a talajnedvesség változásának, öntözés alatt és után történő becslését
    (GALAGEDARA et al., 2005; LIU et al., 2016) jelenti. A növény hajszálgyökér fejlődésének
    egyik bevált hatékony meghatározási módja a makroszkopikus gyökér-tápanyagfelvétel
    modell, kiegészítve a talajnedvesség-áramlási modellel (YADAV & MATHUR, 2008).
    A gyökérnövekedés mintázatainak becslésére és a talajfizikai tulajdonságok meghatározására
    különféle optimalizálási megközelítéseket alkalmaztak a mért talajnedvességtartalom-adatok
    alapján (DONG et al., 2010). LU és LU (2022) egy roncsolásmentes, GPR jel (parabola)
    alapú rendszert alkotott a gyökérről történő visszaverődés elemzéséhez és a gyökérforma
    rekonstrukciójához. A modellt almaültetvényen tesztelték. A rekonstruált finomszemcsés
    3D-s gyökérmodell további alkalmazási lehetőségeket is lehetővé tesz: a gyökérátmérő
    és a növekedés becslését. A legtöbb talajnedvességre és annak fizikai tulajdonságaira
    irányuló meghatározási módszer pontmérés alapú, ezért a kivitelezésük időigényes,
    sőt megnehezíti az ismeretlen paraméterek megbízható meghatározását. ZAJC és munkatársai
    (2020) egy szlovéniai, hordalékos üledéken elhelyezkedő gyümölcsösben tesztelték
    a GPR módszert, és hasonlították össze az eredményeket talajprofiladatokkal. A
    GPR hasznosnak bizonyult a talajnedvesség-szondák optimális helykijelölésében.
    Alkalmazásával meghatározhatjuk a kritikus területeket, mint a magas agyagtartalmú,
    sekély felszín alatti vízvisszatartó, vagy a magas homoktartalmú gyorsabb vízelnyelésű
    területeket. Alkalmazása tehát hasznos lehet öntözés-optimalizálási felméréseknél,
    a vízfenntarthatóság és jelentősebb mezőgazdasági termelés biztosítása érdekében
    a precíziós mezőgazdaságban. A GPR-alapú talajfeltárással térbeli átlagolás is
    megvalósítható, ami ideális kiegészítője lehet a makroszkopikus gyökér-tápanyagfelvétel
    modellnek. A földradar mellett más, szintén geofizikai alapú mérőeszközök (mint
    az időtartomány-, és frekvenciatartomány alapú reflexiómérések) is használhatók
    a talajkarakterisztika átfogóbb feltérképezéséhez (LIU et al., 2016). Konkrét
    példaként a talajnedvesség meghatározásra LIU et al. (2016) az iszapos agyag esetén
    a frekvenciatartomány alapú reflexiómérést javasolja a GPR mellé kiegészítésnek.
    Maga a GPR ez esetben konkrétan a teljes-hullámforma inverzió módszer (200–800
    MHz-es központi frekvencia-tartományban), a kőzetfizikai összefüggés pedig valamely
    keverési modell. Másik példaként LIU et al. (2016) a geoelektromos képalkotó eljárás
    módszerének földradarral (600–1600 MHz) való kombinációját javasolják, frekvenciacsúcs-elemzéssel,
    homokos vályog esetén, Topp-egyenlettel. Sem LIU et al. (2016), sem a többi példában
    szereplő kutató(csoport) nem közöl további konkrét információkat az egyes kombinációk
    alkalmazásának sikerességéről. LU et al. (2017) egy Belső-Mongóliai sivatagi sztyeppén
    négy különböző felszínborítottság-típus (öntözött zöldség és lucerna, természetes
    gyep, mocsár) talajnedvességét, valamint a talajnedvesség-változásának dinamikáját
    vizsgálták különböző mélységben, földradar talaj és visszavert hullám elemzésével.
    A GPR mérés pontosságát gravimetriás módszerrel ellenőrizték. Az alkalmazott empirikus
    kőzetfizikai módszerek közül a Topp-egyenlet pontosabb, mint a Roth-egyenlet a
    GPR-adatokon alapuló talajnedvesség számításában. A GPR talajnedvesség-mérések
    összhangban voltak a gravimetriás mérési eredményekkel, hiszen az RMSE = 0,0101
    m3 m–3. Eredményeikből világosan látszik, hogy sűrű növényborítottság esetén,
    a levegőhullám, a talajhullámmal és a visszavert hullámmal is interferál a radarprofilban,
    ami a GPR mérés pontosságát csökkentheti. Emellett a csapadék is csökkenti a talajhullám-feltárás
    mélységét bizonyos körülmények között. WIJEWARDANA és GALAGEDARA (2010) kutatásának
    középpontjában talajradar alapú talajnedvesség-tartalom tér- és időbeli változásbecslése
    állt mezőgazdasági táblák esetén (Gannoruwa, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka). A GPR méréseket
    termogravimetrikus mintavételi adatokkal ellenőrizték, és a talajnedvesség-tartalom
    2D-s térképeinek kidolgozását végezték el. A GPR mérései révén meghatározott talajnedvesség-tartalom
    jól illeszkedett a mért adatokhoz (R2 = 0,754). A vadózus zóna vizsgálatokhoz
    elengedhetetlen a talaj heterogenitásának jellemzése. A talaj magminta-vételezésen
    alapuló vizsgálata azonban időigényes, és hiányzik a kellő térbeli lefedettség
    (KAUFMANN et al., 2020). PAN és munkatársai (2012) sikeresen alkalmazták a GERHARDS
    et al. (2008) által kifejlesztett, többcsatornás GPR adatok (Multi-Offset Techniques)
    módszerét, amely lehetővé teszi a talajnedvesség tér és időbeli változásának nagy
    felbontású meghatározását heterogén talajszerkezetű mezőgazdasági terület esetén.
    A módszer nyilvánvaló potenciálja ellenére a többcsatornás GPR méréseknek is vannak
    korlátai. A legjelentősebb kihívást az egyértelműen meghatározott visszaverő felületek
    folyamatos szükségessége jelenti, az antennaeltolások miatt (KLOTZSCHE et al.,
    2018). A LOMBARDI és MAURIZIO (2019) lépésfrekvenciás, folyamatos hullám GPR (Step
    Frequency Continuous Wave Ground Penetrating Radar; SFCW GPR) alkalmazási lehetőségeit
    vizsgálta. A frekvenciatartomány alapú talajradar esetén, egy fixen beállított
    frekvencia helyett, diszkrét lépésekkel változtatott frekvenciaértékekkel történik
    a célterület vizsgálata. A kutatás eredményei rámutatnak a GPR jel amplitúdójának
    a vizsgált központi frekvenciától függő szignifikáns ingadozásaira, vagyis a heterogén
    talaj elektromágneses tulajdonságai erősen frekvenciafüggőek, ami bizonyos feltárási
    minőség esetén lényeges. Ez a GPR technika a növényzet vízfelhasználás-hatékonyságának
    vizsgálatára alkalmas, ezért precíziós mezőgazdasági programok tervezésének alapjául
    szolgálhat. A hagyományos FO (fixed offset – rögzített távolság) GPR mérések a
    talajréteg változásait csak az idő függvényében érzékelik, így a (talajnedvességmeghatározáshoz
    szükséges) permittivitás pontos meghatározása kivitelezhetetlen. A sebességbecsléshez
    CMP (common middle point – közös középpont) vagy WARR (wide-angle reflection and
    refraction – szélesszögű visszaverődés és refrakció) mérésekre van szükség, amelyek
    kifejezetten időigényesek. Ezért ezekkel a mérésekkel nagyobb területeket kell
    reprezentálni, ami így a felszín alatti sebesség tekintetében alacsony térbeli
    felbontást jelent. Mindez növeli a becsült rétegvastagságban, a talaj áteresztőképességében
    és ezáltal a talajnedvességben megjelenő hibalehetőséget. A közelmúltban megjelent
    egy új, szimultán többeltolásos és többcsatornás (SiMoc) GPR rendszer, amely gyors
    talajprofilfeltérképezést tesz lehetővé a WARR segítségével (KAUFMANN et al.,
    2020). Az úgynevezett „WARR-gép” (WARR machine) egy adó és hét vevőegységet használ.
    Minden mérési pozíciót egy nagy pontosságú differenciál-GPS rögzít. Ez az új rendszer
    a többeltolásos és többcsatornás GPR adatok egyidejű mérését ugyanolyan sebességgel
    teszi lehetővé, mint egy hagyományos egycsatornás FO GPR, akár 10 000 WARR h–1
    teljesítménnyel. A GPR méréseket a németországi Selhausenben, egy mezőgazdasági
    tesztterületen végezték. A GPR mérésekkel számított talajnedvesség-értékek (Topp-egyenlet
    felhasználásával) 0,20 m mélységben jól korreláltak a kontrollként használt meteorológiai
    állomás és a TDR szondák talajnedvesség-változásával (KAUFMANN et al., 2020).
    A modern pilóta nélküli légijárművek (unmanned aerial vehicle; UAV) számos tudományterületen
    vonzó technológiát képviselnek egyszerű használatuk, alacsony karbantartási költségük
    és nagyfokú működési rugalmasságuk miatt. Az UAV-k nagyon kis területekről tudnak
    fel- és leszállni, és minden irányban mozoghatnak, vagyis szinte minden helyet
    – beleértve a nehezen megközelíthetőeket is – elérhetnek (NOVIELLO et al., 2022).
    Az UAV és GPR technológiájának kombinációjaként, innovatív képalkotási rendszer
    valósítható meg, ami a földi telepítésű akna felderítésétől (BURR et al., 2021),
    a keresés/mentésen (JENSSEN et al., 2020) át a mezőgazdaságig (KAIJUN et al.,
    2019) számos gyakorlati területen alkalmazható (NOVIELLO et al., 2022). NOVIELLO
    és munkatársai (2022) rámutatnak, hogy ezen újszerű kombinációval a mezőgazdaság
    területén még csak kevesen foglalkoztak, ezért az ebben rejlő lehetőség még nincs
    kihasználva. Kiemelendő, hogy teljes roncsolásmentességet biztosít, megkímélve
    ezzel a talajt és a növényeket. Az elért eredmények azt mutatták, hogy a talajnedvesség-térképek
    jól korrelálnak a mezőgazdasági táblák topográfiai térképeivel és a légi fotogrammetriai
    megfigyelésekkel, demonstrálva ezzel a precíziós mezőgazdasági és környezeti monitoring
    célokra használt UAV alapú GPR rendszerekben rejlő potenciált (NOVIELLO et al.,
    2022). KAIJUN et al. (2019) drónra szerelt GPR alapú mérési tapasztalatait összegzi
    a talajnedvesség-térképezéshez kapcsolódóan egy belgiumi mezőgazdasági területen,
    Saint-Denisben. A GPR rendszer egy vektorhálózatelemzőből, mint frekvenciatartomány-radarból,
    a radar vezérléséhez használt mikroszámítógépből, a távvezérléshez alkalmazott
    okoseszközből, valamint egy GPS-ből áll. A radaradatok feldolgozása teljes hullámforma
    inverzió módszerrel történik LAMBOT és ANDRÉ (2014) munkássága alapján. A központi
    frekvencia tartománya 500–700 MHz. A GPR adatokból származtatott dielektromos
    állandó értékeket a Topp-egyenlettel alakították talajnedvesség-értékekké. DEHEM
    (2020) Belgiumban, egy gemblouxi mezőgazdasági területen drónra szerelt, dipólantennával
    ellátott GPR-t használt nagy felbontású térképek készítésére, valamint a talajnedvesség-tartalom
    térbeli eloszlásának és dinamikájának tanulmányozására. Két mérési alkalommal,
    csupán két talajnedvesség-térkép készült (2020 júliusában) eltérő adatsűrűséggel
    (0,24 mérés m–2 és 2,62 mérés m–2). Köszönetnyilvánítás Jelen publikáció a 143972SNN

    purpose of this work is to present new results of using Earth remote sensing data
    in the problem of managing agricultural technology in real time. The main reason

    In the presented work, for the first time, a complete theory of managing the state

    basis. The presented theory is based on classical control principles used in modern
    dynamic systems. According to the proposed theory, a specialized software package
    was developed, with the help of which the control system was tested on the example
    of spring wheat sowing. INTRODUCTION The main core of modern precision farming
    systems is the task of managing agricultural technologies. It is by implementing
    these tasks that it is possible to obtain high economic returns from the entire
    technological complex of technical specifications. At the same time, the successful
    implementation of these tasks is hampered by the lack of a developed theoretical
    base. Currently, the papers of modern researchers have considered only certain
    aspects of the management problem. This applies to the choice of mathematical
    models of crops and soils [20, 31], control of individual regime parameters [17],
    and development of a zonal approach to the application of mineral fertilizers
    and herbicide treatments [26, 32]. The problems of risks associated with aspects
    of agricultural technology management were considered separately [19, 21]. A significant
    limiting factor in the creation and development of a general control theory is
    the insignificant achievements in the field of using Earth remote sensing data
    to form estimates of the quantitative parameters of crops and the soil environment.
    Without such estimates, it is impossible to implement agricultural technology
    management. Interpretation of the information content of the spectral characteristics
    of vegetation continues to be the subject of numerous scientific studies, but
    significant results in the field of assessing quantitative indicators have not
    yet been obtained [7, 15, 18, 27]. The most widely used satellite remote sensing
    systems, which are designed to meet many needs for monitoring and management of
    agriculture, are not yet capable of providing information for making management
    decisions [1, 2, 16, 28–30]. The appearance of the first papers on assessing the
    parameters of biomass of agricultural crops and the soil environment served as
    a significant incentive for the development of a general theory of agricultural
    technology management [9–11, 22, 24]. The starting point for creating such a theory
    was the development of a general concept for managing agricultural technologies
    [8]. According to this concept, the overall management of agricultural technology
    is organized into three levels. At the first level, considered on an annual time
    scale, strategic management, or crop rotation management, is implemented. The
    results of management at this level represent optimal strategies for applying
    long-acting mineral fertilizers by year of crop rotation. At the second level,
    considered on a daily time scale, the state of one crop is managed during one
    growing season. The results of management at this level are optimal management
    programs that represent sequences of technological operations performed upon the
    onset of specified phenological phases. Real-time management represents the third,
    lowest level of management. The first two levels are planning and are implemented
    in advance, outside of real time. If the first, strategic level can be used by
    the agronomic service to prepare resources for managing agricultural technologies,
    then the second, software one, becomes the master level in relation to real-time
    management. At this level, an optimal program is formed, which should be reproduced
    in a real control object. Therefore, the main effect of optimizing the management
    of agricultural technology is manifested in real time, when technological operations
    are formed based on the actual state of the crop. It is here that the maximum
    efficiency of using remote sensing data is shown, without which it is impossible
    to assess the current state of the control object and develop optimal management
    [23, 25]. At the same time, in the original version of the theory, agricultural
    technologies were considered as a control object only with the sowing of an agricultural
    crop, without taking into account the fact that the agrocenosis in the same field
    contains weeds. Fertilizers applied stimulate the growth of not only the main
    crop, but also weeds, and herbicide treatments suppress the growth of both weeds
    and crop plants. In this regard, in recent years, papers have appeared on technologies
    for joint application of mineral fertilizers and herbicide treatments [3, 5, 13].
    Such studies became the impetus for the further development of the general theory
    of agricultural technology management [12]. The objective of this paper is to
    further develop the general theory of agricultural technology management using
    remote sensing data in real time. This development relates to the task of managing
    the state of the agrocenosis, which contains the main crop and weeds. To test
    the proposed theory, sowing of spring wheat was considered. Taking into account
    the many phenophases of spring wheat development, such an agrocenosis is a large-scale
    control object with a variable structure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mathematical Models
    of the Control Object The starting point for solving any management problem is
    the choice of an achievable goal. When we are dealing with agricultural technology,
    such a goal can only be to obtain a given crop yield at the end of the growing
    season. Any control task is based on a mathematical description of the control
    object. In the case under consideration, it is an agricultural field with an agrocenosis,
    which contains spring wheat and weeds. The fundamental basis for solving the control
    problem is mathematical models that describe the dynamics of the state parameters
    of the control object. At the same time, in addition to the presence of a mathematical
    model of the main crop, the control object must be supplemented with a model of
    weeds. It is necessary that such models reflect the effect of controlled influences
    and external uncontrolled disturbances on the control object parameters, as well
    as take into account the relationship of the control object parameters to each
    other through the soil environment. To achieve the above management goal, it is
    necessary to select the most important target-forming parameters of the sowing
    state of the cultivated crop. Based on such parameters, an optimization criterion
    is constructed, the minimization of which allows the formation of controls that
    ensure the achievement of the control goal. At the same time, the crop under consideration
    as part of an agrocenosis is characterized by both continuum state parameters,
    which can include parameters of the state of the biomass of the crop itself and
    the soil environment, and non-quantitative (structural) states, which include
    phenological phases of development of crop plants (phenophases). As an example
    of the application of the theory, an agrocenosis with the sowing of spring wheat
    is considered here. For this culture, depending on belonging to time intervals
    t (day), nonquantitative states s are, at \\(t \\in (0{\\kern 1pt} - {\\kern 1pt}
    7)\\) – s = 1, sowing phase; at \\(t \\in (11{\\kern 1pt} - {\\kern 1pt} 13)\\)
    – s = 2, germination phase (first–third leaves); at \\(t \\in (21{\\kern 1pt}
    - {\\kern 1pt} 29)\\) – s = 3, tillering phase; at t = 30 – s = 4, leaf-tube formation
    phase; at \\(t \\in (31{\\kern 1pt} - {\\kern 1pt} 32)\\) – s = 5, internode phase;
    at t = 37 – s = 6, flag leaf phase; at t = 39 – s = 7, ligula phase; at t = 49
    – s = 8, leaf sinus opening phase; at \\(t \\in (51{\\kern 1pt} - {\\kern 1pt}
    59)\\) – s = 9, heading phase; at \\(t \\in (61{\\kern 1pt} - {\\kern 1pt} 69)\\)
    – s = 10, flowering phase; at \\(t \\in (71{\\kern 1pt} - {\\kern 1pt} 75)\\)
    – s = 11, milky ripeness phase; at \\(t \\in (85{\\kern 1pt} - {\\kern 1pt} 86)\\)
    – s = 12, waxy ripeness phase t ≥ 86 – s = 13, full ripeness phase. The entire
    growing season, depending on the structure of the crop biomass, must be divided
    into two time intervals: from the onset of the second phenophase to the onset
    of the ninth phenophase and from the onset of the ninth phenophase to the onset
    of the 13th phenophase. At the first interval, the total and wet weight become
    the parameters of the sowing biomass, and at the second interval the weight of
    the ears is added to them, with the grain yield mostly consisting of this. At
    the same time, fertilization, herbicide treatment, and irrigation are carried
    out at fixed times of the onset of the following preselected phenological phases:
    s = 3 (tillering), s = 9 (heading), s = 10 (flowering), and s = 11 (milky ripeness).
    This forces to resort to an additional breakdown of the entire growing season
    into management intervals between selected phenophases: first, from tillering
    to heading (T3, T9); second, from heading to flowering (T9, T10); third, from
    flowering to milky ripeness (T10, T11); and fourth, from milky ripeness to full
    ripeness (T11, T13). Another set of phenophases is also possible, upon the occurrence
    of which real-time control is implemented. For the first time interval between
    the third and ninth phenophases, the model for the dynamics of parameters of the
    structure of crop biomass has the following expanded form [10]: $$\\begin{gathered}

    in both blocks: f1 is the average daily air temperature (°C), f2 is the average

    significance of this paper, we do not disclose the types of herbicides here, since
    the approach we are developing can be implemented for any of their types. For
    ease of further use, model (1) must be presented in canonical symbolic vector-matrix

    density over the field area (c/ha), x2u is the average crop wet weight density
    over the field area (c/ha), x3u is the average ear mass density (harvest) over
    the field area (c/ha); external disturbances in both blocks: f1 is the average
    daily air temperature (°C), f2 is the average daily radiation level (W m–2 h–1),
    and f3 is the average daily precipitation intensity (mm); parameters of the chemical
    state of the soil: \\({{v}_{{\\text{N}}}}\\) is the nitrogen content (kg/ha),

    content (kg/ha), \\({{v}_{5}}\\) is the moisture reserve (mm); g1u and g2u are
    doses of herbicide treatment (g/ha); j = 1, 2, 3 are numbers of control intervals
    after the heading phase; and a11j–a33j, b11j–b35j, c11m–c33j, and d11j–d32j are
    model parameters (day–1). The canonical symbolic vector matrix form of model (3)
    is $${{\\dot {X}}_{{uj}}} = {{A}_{{uj}}}{{\\operatorname{X} }_{{uj}}}(t) + {{B}_{{uj}}}{{\\operatorname{V}

    agrocenosis, to solve the problem of managing its state, in addition to crop sowing
    models (2) and (4), it is necessary to introduce a dynamic model of the biomass
    of the dominant weed species, the vector-matrix form of which has the following
    form [12]: $${{\\dot {S}}_{j}} = {{A}_{{sj}}}{{\\operatorname{S} }_{j}}(t) + {{B}_{s}}{{\\operatorname{V}

    are matrices of model parameters. Model (5) includes the states of two dominant
    weed species. For other conditions, their number and types may differ, which only
    clarifies the structure of the algorithms, but does not change the general approach
    to solving the problem. Models (2), (4), and (5) represent the main block of the
    control object state parameters. In addition to this block, the control object
    contains a control transfer block, which is the soil medium. It is through this
    block that competition between crop plants and weeds for nutrients and moisture
    occurs. The model for the dynamics of soil state parameters for phenophases from
    the third to ninth has the following form [12]: $$\\begin{gathered} \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}

    Algorithms Based on Phenophases As stated above, management of the state of the
    agrocenosis, which consists of applying fertilizers, treating with herbicides
    and irrigating, is carried out at fixed time moments for the onset of the following
    pre-selected phenological phases: s = 3 (tillering), s = 9 (heading), s = 10 (flowering),
    and s = 11 (milky ripeness). Due to the sequence of these phase-by-phase controls,
    the state of spring wheat crop is transferred from the seed germination phase
    to full grain ripeness and the achievement of the set control goal. In the designated
    parameters of the crop state, formally the control goal looks appears as follows
    for the last (j = 3) interphase control interval at moment of grain ripening T13:
    $$\\begin{gathered} {{x}_{{1j = 3}}}({{T}_{{13}}}) \\geqslant 2.1U^*,\\,\\,\\,\\,{{x}_{{2j
    = 3}}}({{T}_{{13}}}) \\leqslant 0.15U^*, \\\\ {{x}_{{3j = 3}}}({{T}_{{13}}}) \\geqslant
    U^*, \\\\ \\end{gathered} $$ (17) where U* is the specified yield of spring wheat
    (c/ha). For each previous interphase time interval, optimal local control goals
    are set to ensure the achievement of the final goal (17). The formation of these
    local goals is carried out as a result of the implementation of program management
    of the agrocenosis state [10]. This control level, preceding the real-time control
    level, forms an optimal program for the evolution of the crop state throughout
    the entire growing season. This program is a sequence of vectors of crop state
    parameters that set local control goals in real time, which is denoted as follows:
    $$\\operatorname{X} _{m}^{ * }({{T}_{9}}),\\,\\,\\,\\,\\operatorname{X} _{u}^{
    * }({{T}_{{10}}}),\\,\\,\\,\\,\\operatorname{X} _{u}^{ * }({{T}_{{11}}}),\\,\\,\\,\\,\\operatorname{X}
    _{u}^{ * }({{T}_{{13}}}).$$ (18) Similar goals are set for weeds in the agrocenosis:
    $$S{\\text{*}}({{T}_{9}}),\\,\\,\\,\\,S{\\text{*}}({{T}_{{10}}}),\\,\\,\\,\\,S{\\text{*}}({{T}_{{11}}}),\\,\\,\\,\\,S{\\text{*}}({{T}_{{13}}}).$$
    (19) For each interphase control period, local optimality criteria are set: $$\\begin{gathered}
    {{\\operatorname{J} }_{j}}({{T}_{j}}) = {{\\left[ {{{\\operatorname{X} }_{j}}({{T}_{j}})
    - \\operatorname{X} _{j}^{ * }({{T}_{j}})} \\right]}^{T}}G\\left[ {{{\\operatorname{X}
    }_{j}}({{T}_{j}}) - \\operatorname{X} _{j}^{ * }({{T}_{j}})} \\right] \\\\ + \\,\\,{{\\left[
    {{{S}_{j}}({{T}_{j}}) - S_{j}^{ * }({{T}_{j}})} \\right]}^{T}}Q\\left[ {{{S}_{j}}({{T}_{j}})
    - S_{j}^{ * }({{T}_{j}})} \\right], \\\\ \\end{gathered} $$ (20) where G and Q
    are weight matrices by means of which the required relationships are established
    between individual parameters of the state of the crop and weeds and j = 0, …,
    3 are indices of interphase intervals of the general growing season. Taking into
    account the introduced models and algorithms for estimating state parameters,
    the general real-time control algorithm includes the following steps. Step 0.
    As a result of the implementation of the program control task, a sequence of local
    control goals by phenophases is formed (18). Step 1. From the beginning of the
    growing season until the onset of phenophase s = 3 (tillering), the parameters
    of the crop state (according to algorithm (15)) and the parameters of the weed
    state (according to algorithm (16)) are estimated. Step 2. Estimation of vector
    of crop biomass parameters \\({{\\overset{\\lower0.5em\\hbox{$\\smash{\\scriptscriptstyle\\frown}$}}{X}
    }_{m}}({{T}_{3}})\\) is accepted as the initial condition in model (2) when forming
    control at time moment T3. This control is found by minimizing criterion (20)
    according to the vector of parameters of technological operations D(T3) and the
    vector of herbicide treatments G(T3), into which the specified values of the vector
    of sowing-state parameters \\(\\operatorname{X} _{m}^{ * }({{T}_{9}})\\) and vectors
    of weed-state parameters \\(S{\\text{*}}({{T}_{9}}),\\) are substituted, which
    should be achieved based on control results. Minimization of criterion (20) by
    vectors D(T3) and G(T3) is also carried out in accordance with the program control
    algorithm [10], which, due to its large volume, is not presented here. Step 3.
    Resulting real-time control δD(T3) is introduced into model (6) of parameters
    of the soil environment state, and vector of herbicide treatments G(T3) is substituted
    into model (5). The transition is made to step 1, and the entire sequence of operations
    is repeated for phenophase s = 9 and subsequent phenophases, up to phenophase
    s = 11 and obtaining the specified final result. TESTING AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS
    The proposed control theory was tested using experimental data obtained in the
    period 2016–2021 at the Menkovsky biopolygon of the Agrophysical Research Institute
    (Leningrad oblast, Gatchinsky district, Menkovo village). Spring wheat crops were
    part of a seven-field crop rotation. To create a database of experiments on selected
    20 test sites, samples of agrocenosis biomass and soil were taken. Simultaneously
    with sampling, remote sensing of the experimental field with agrocenosis was carried
    out using a Geoscan-1 unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with a small-sized hyperspectral
    camera developed at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (Switzerland).
    The database generated in this way became a source of information for identifying
    all the mathematical models used throughout the growing season. As already mentioned
    above, the management procedure begins with the creation of an optimal program
    for the evolution of the agrocenosis for the planned growing season. For this
    purpose, a program control algorithm is used, the result of which is a sequence
    of vectors of spring wheat sowing state parameters that set local control goals
    in real time (18). For the example under consideration, this sequence is presented
    in Fig. 1 (for a given yield of 50 c/ha). Fig. 1. Diagram of vectors of spring
    wheat crop state parameters that set local control goals in real time. Full size
    image The next step of the general control algorithm is the procedure for estimating
    the parameters of the crop state using remote sensing data at phenophases in which
    real-time control was implemented. The sequence of such estimates is presented
    in Fig. 2. Estimates of state parameters at phenophase s = 3 in Fig. 2 are not
    shown due to their small value. Fig. 2. Estimation of parameters of the state

    weeds in agrocenosis. Full size image The control shown in Fig. 5 ensures the
    evolution of the parameters of the state of weeds throughout the entire growing
    season (Fig. 6). Fig. 6. Evolution of parameters of the state of weeds during
    the growing season. Full size image As can be seen from the graphs in Fig. 4,
    control in the form of doses of mineral fertilizers and irrigation rates ensures
    the achievement of a given control goal (grain yield 50 c/ha). Graphs in Fig.
    6 show that controlling the state of weeds in the form of doses of herbicide treatments
    ensures minimization of weed biomass at the end of the growing season. In this
    case, the application of mineral fertilizers and herbicide treatments are carried
    out jointly, at the same time moment. The developed theory and the algorithmic
    scheme for its implementation are applicable for any agrocenoses with different
    crops. The main condition for application is mathematical models of the parameters
    of the state of crops and weeds, as well as models of the connection of these
    parameters with remote sensing data. At the same time, the models have an appearance
    and shape similar to the models presented in the article, and differ only in the
    dimension and value of the parameters, and the introduction of models of other
    agrocenoses does not change the basic provisions of the theory and the algorithmic
    implementation scheme. CONCLUSIONS A theory for managing the state of agrocenosis
    has been proposed, which includes algorithms for estimating the parameters of
    the state of the crop and weeds, as well as algorithms for creating controls at
    given phenological phases of development of crop plants. In this case, the controls
    for the crop state are the doses of mineral fertilizers and irrigation, while
    the controls for the state of weeds are the doses of herbicide treatments carried
    out together at the same time with the application of fertilizers. The initial
    basis for solving the control problem is the optimal plant development program
    obtained by preliminary solution of the program control problem. Moreover, the
    goal of real-time control is to achieve optimal values of the parameters of the
    crop state, obtained in the optimal program for the moments of the onset of specified
    phenophases, including the phenophase of full crop ripening. Achievement of all
    local control goals is carried out by optimizing the doses of fertilizers, irrigation,
    and doses of herbicide treatments, carried out on the basis of estimates of the
    parameters of the state of the crop and weeds obtained from the phenophases in
    which the state of the agrocenosis is controlled. REFERENCES Antonov, V. and Sladkih, L.,

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction In Precision farming,
    sensors can be installed in the fields to capture environmental data such as climatic
    data, moisture levels, and information on soil water requirements [1], [2]. Sensor
    data must be transported to a center that processes data for field intervention
    decisions [1], [3]. Sensors actively forward data from other nodes in the routing
    process to the center, which may quickly drain the battery of nodes that relay
    a lot of data [4]. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can assist the data collecting
    process because of the need to cover a large area in precision agriculture [2],
    [5]. Note that the application of UAVs could provide a solution to prolong the
    network lifetime. Since UAVs usually have a limited endurance due to the physical
    constraint of batteries, UAV-assisted data gathering schemes should consider the
    energy consumption of sensors and the maximum flight distance of UAVs as well.
    Practically, UAV-assisted data gathering consists of two main tasks: 1) designing
    clusters wherein the cluster heads (CHs) work as rendezvous nodes to gather data
    from each cluster, 2) determining UAV trajectories for collecting the data at
    the CHs and returning to the base, where the battery of UAVs can be recharged
    or swapped. A good UAV-assisted data-gathering scheme should achieve a trade-off
    between the flying distance of UAVs and the total energy consumption of sensor
    nodes. In this article, we are motivated by the quest for an efficient solution
    for minimizing the sensor-to-sensor energy expense while satisfying an upper limit
    on the travelling distance of each UAV per data collection round. The contributions
    of the article are summarized as follows. We derive a theoretical lower bound
    for the energy consumption of sensors to transport data to cluster heads in uniform
    and plain deployments and prove that the energy consumption of sensors is close
    to the theoretical bound if clusters are balanced regarding energy consumption.
    Therefore, an essential step in proposed heuristic multi-UAV schemes, called Gathering
    data Assisted by Multi-UAV with a BAlanced Clustering (GAMBAC), is to find balanced
    or near-balanced clusters concerning energy consumption. To evaluate the efficiency
    of GAMBAC, we compare the results of GAMBAC and the mixed-integer linear programming
    (MILP) formulation. For sensor networks with a small number of nodes our heuristic
    algorithms give results close to the MILP formulation. We perform extensive numerical
    investigations and show that the GAMBAC schemes extend network lifetime and requires
    less energy to support a specific number of collection rounds than the best existing
    approach. The rest of this article is organized as follows. We provide a short
    summary of related works in Section II. We describe the operation of a practical
    system with sensor nodes in Section III. We present our theoretical result about
    the lower bound for the energy consumption of a sensor network in Section IV.
    We describe arguments behind the proposed GAMBAC schemes in Section V. We present
    simulation results in Section VI. Finally, Section VII concludes this article.
    SECTION II. Related Works Data gathering schemes and rendezvous-based protocols
    for wireless sensor networks have drawn a lot of attention for almost two decades.
    Recently, UAVs have been proposed for data collection in large-scale wireless
    sensor networks [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].
    Xing et al. [6] considered a data gathering problem with low-speed mobile elements
    on the ground and proposed the application of rendezvous points so mobile elements
    could collect data from rendezvous points. The authors investigated the minimum-energy
    rendezvous point and considered the constraint of mobile element paths (e.g.,
    mobile elements could only move along the routing tree). Several essential aspects
    (energy consumption, data collection deadline, UAVs'' limited endurance, etc.)
    are related to the application of UAVs in wireless sensor networks. Since UAVs
    usually have a limited endurance due to the physical constraint of batteries,
    the UAV completion time for data gathering and flying should be considered as
    in [9]. Zhan and Zeng [10] investigated a trade-off between the aerial cost, which
    is defined by the propulsion energy consumption and the operation cost of UAVs,
    and the ground cost. Wu et al. [11] also considered a data collection with multiple
    collectors, where a genetic algorithm was proposed to design ME paths so the delay
    constraint could be met. Ebrahimi et al. [12] studied the data collection problem
    with one UAV as a data collector and proposed a heuristic algorithm for clustering,
    selection of head nodes, and construction of routing trees. Alfattani et al. [13]
    investigated using multiple UAVs to collect data from clusters and applied genetic
    algorithms to solve optimization problems. According to Ghdiri et al. [14] there
    exist 1) offline scenarios where the network and the coverage area are fixed and
    known ahead, and hence the UAV trajectories can be preplanned ahead, and 2) online
    scenarios where IoT sensors are mobile and so offline path planning becomes unpractical
    (applications such as wildlife monitoring and intelligent transportation systems).
    For UAVs deployment, energy-efficient trajectory design is required, either in
    the offline scenarios where the system''s status is available beforehand or in
    the online scenarios where no or limited information is available for the UAV''s
    mission. The offline scenarios correspond to applications for dedicated or private
    IoT networks, where the IoT system architecture is static and changes occasionally.
    A comprehensive survey on trajectory schemes is provided in [15]. To our best
    knowledge, Konstantopoulos et al. [16] have proposed the best method (Convex-Hull
    based Protocol—CHP) to design ME tours until now. The CHP starts with choosing
    initial UAV paths based on convex hulls, which can cover the nodes at the furthest
    distance from the center. Then, it improves the initial paths using a simulated-annealing
    approach. This article also considers a data-gathering problem with mobile elements.
    We derive the lower-bound limit on the energy consumption of sensors and establish
    that the energy consumption approaches the lower bound if clusters have the same
    energy consumption, which has not been found in the literature to our best knowledge.
    We design GAMBAC schemes to establish either energy-consumption-balanced or near-balanced
    clusters to satisfy the flying constraint. In addition, we show that our algorithms
    outperform the CHP method. SECTION III. Cooperation of Wireless Sensor Nodes and
    the Operation Centre We deal with a precision agriculture scenario, where farmers
    deploy N sensors to collect the soil moisture levels of specific points in a large
    area for growing crops. Cloud computing is applied in an operation center to host
    an agricultural decision-making support system [1], [3]. Information about the
    position of each sensor node is available for decision-making. The operation center
    and sensor nodes cooperatively control a topology creation [17], [18] (i.e., determine
    directional links between sensor nodes) during the operation to form an ad hoc
    network. The moisture levels of N points should be transported to the operation
    center periodically by the end of each period of T max seconds. The operation
    center processes data to control water pumps and sprays in the crop production
    area. There are several alternatives for transmitting and transporting data to
    the processing center: a) sensors directly send data to the center, b) sensor
    nodes cooperate in an ad hoc sensor network to transport data to the center, c)
    UAVs are used along with an ad hoc sensor network to convey data to the center.
    Alternatives a) and b) may quickly drain the battery of nodes that relay a lot
    of data [4]. Consequently, those monitoring nodes die, and there will be no monitoring
    data, which may prevent the correct determination of decisions for efficient irrigation
    control. In this article, we deal with alternative c), which is motivated by a
    need to cover a large area in precision agriculture because the application of
    UAVs could provide a solution to prolong the working time of deployed sensors
    [9], [19], [20]. We focus on the application M UAV, each UAV could fly with a
    constant speed v 0 (m/s) at an altitude of H meters and the maximum flight distance
    of ℓ max . The deployment illustration is presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Sensor
    network with the clusters, CH nodes, and the flight paths of four UAVs that are
    determined at the beginning of each round by the operation center. Show All The
    data collection process is performed as follows in each round. Fig. 2. Planar
    Voronoi diagram with the seed elements consisting of the set of points S P ={
    O 0 , O 1 ,…, O q } and the set of open line segments S L ={ O 0 O 1 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯
    ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ , O 1 O 2 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ,…, O q O 0 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯
    ¯ ¯ ¯ } . Show All The operation center selects cluster head (CH) nodes, plans
    the assignment of sensors to CH nodes, and determines the data forwarding tree
    (DFT) of each CH node and computes the ℓ max -constrained UAV trajectories (see
    Fig. 1). The operation center broadcasts information to sensor nodes about the
    selection of CH nodes and the routing information (e.g., DFTs). The operation
    center sends the UAVs to flight along the planned trajectory. Each UAV trajectory
    is represented by a closed polyline O 0 O 1 … O q O 0 , where O 0 is the sink
    location and O i,1≤i≤q is the intermediate turning points (cluster heads) in Fig.
    2. Sensor nodes transmit measured data and energy consumption information to the
    assigned CH following the routing path in an ad hoc wireless sensor network during
    each data collection period. CH waits for an associated UAV to hover above its
    position and transmits the aggregated data to the UAV. The operation center makes
    decisions based on information about the location of sensors, and the energy consumption
    of each node due to the transmitting activity and the actual energy level of a
    battery in sensor nodes. The information about the energy consumption is encoded
    and sent with monitoring data to the processing center. If packet loss happens,
    the energy consumption information is estimated from the past data. SECTION IV.
    Lower-Bound of the Energy Consumption In this section, we introduce some notations
    for the formalized problem description, then we present a proposition on the lower
    bound of the energy consumption of nodes. Let G=(V,Ξ) denote the network graph,
    where V={ s 1 ,…, s N } is the set of sensor nodes and Ξ denotes the set of direct
    wireless links that can be feasibly established between sensor node-pairs. That
    is, the distance between u and v , ( u,v∈V ), is smaller than the sensor maximum
    radio transmission range ( R ). Definition 1 (Clusters): For graph G=(V,Ξ) , Clustering
    C(G,K)={ V 1 ,…, V K ,H} describes the partition of sensor nodes into K separate
    sets V k ⊂V of nodes and the selection of a cluster head node ( c h k ) for each
    set (cluster), k=1…K , where H={c h 1 ,…,c h K } is the set of cluster head nodes
    and ∪ K l=1 C l =V . Definition 2 (Data Forwarding Tree): Nodes in cluster k send
    and forward data along Data Forwarding Tree (DFT) T k ( C k , Ξ k ) to c h k ,
    ( k=1…K ), where Ξ k ( Ξ k ⊂Ξ ) is the set of edges in cluster k . Let T={ T 1
    ,…, T K } denote the set of DFTs for clustering C(G,K) . Let E 0 i denote the
    initial energy, and E r i be the energy at the start of the rth round of sensor
    node s i . Let E Rx = E RX0 and E Tx i,j = E TX0 +ϑ d 2 ij be the energies for
    receiving and transmitting one bit from s i to s j , ( i,j=1,…,N ), where d i,j
    is the Euclidean distance between s i and s j , ϑ is a parameter depending on
    the circuit and the antenna of a sensor. Let ι(i,C(G,K)) be the index of the next
    node in the data forwarding path of sensor node s i toward its cluster head. We
    denote E Tx i0 = E TX0 +ϑ H 2 as the per-bit transmission energy from SN s i to
    a UAV. Hence, if s i has to forward its own b i bits and relay B i,C(G,K) bits
    from its child nodes to the next node s ι(i,C(G,K)) in its data forwarding tree,
    then the amount of energy consumed in s i is e i,C(G,K) = E Rx B i,C(G,K) + E
    Tx i,ι(i,C(G,K)) ( B i,C(G,K) + b i ) (1) View Source and the residual energy
    of s i after the rth round is E (r+1),i = E (r),i − e i,C,H . (2) View Source
    Definition 3: A uniform deployment evenly distributes identical sensors in a specific
    area. Definition 4: A plain deployment divides an area into multiple subareas.
    In each subarea, an uniform deployment is carried out with homogeneous sensors.
    That is, a network in the plain setting consists of multiple regions and each
    node collects the same amount of data during one round. Proposition 1: (Lower
    bound of the energy consumption of sensors to transport data to CHs) In each round,
    the energy consumption of sensors E S2S = ∑ N i=1 e i,C(G,K) for the transportation
    of data to CHs satisfies the following in-equations: E S2S >B= c S 2 total ℓ max
    if a sensor network is with the uniform deployment and S total is the area covered
    by the sensor network, where E R = E RX (1)+ E TX (1,R) is the total energy consumption

    nretr++ 18: go to 5 19: end if 20: end if 21: return H Intuitively, the larger
    the number ( K ) of clusters is, the smaller the energy is consumed to transport
    data to cluster heads. Note that the number of clusters is upper bounded by a
    threshold depending on ℓ max . According to Proposition 1, the total energy consumption
    approaches the lower bound if clusters are energy-consumption-balanced. Therefore,
    algorithm GAMBAC- α tries to reach this goal through obtaining the largest number
    of clusters so the data volume of each cluster is almost the same and UAVs could
    fly without violating the endurance limit. Procedure GAMBAC- α through the execution
    of GAMBAC( G,M, ℓ max ,0,N , Select_CHs- α ) repeatedly divides interval (low,high)=(0,N)
    to search for the largest possible value of K . In the loop, procedure SelectCHs-
    α ( G,K ) (Algorithm 2) chooses set H with K cluster heads so the largest cluster
    still has a total data volume that does not exceed 1+ϵ times the average data
    amount. During the selection, the probability of a SN being chosen as CH is proportional
    to its residual energy, i.e., the nodes with higher energy are given more priority
    to become a CH, which prolongs the network lifetime. Procedure SelectCHs- α (
    G,K ) (Algorithm 2) consists of two tasks: 1) add new CHs; and 2) adjust the current
    H by growing data forwarding trees (i.e., clusters) and then removing the smallest
    ones (as inefficient). The first task gradually selects a new CH from the set
    of available nodes V G ∖ V T that contains all SNs outside the current DFT forest.
    The second task rebuilds the DFT tree, and this is done by utilizing Grow ( G,H
    ). The Grow operation (Algorithm 3) returns subgraph ( V T , E T ) representing
    a DFT forest, where the volume of data in each DFT (or respective cluster) does
    not exceed W=(1+ε) totalVolume K . If the number of DFTs/clusters is larger than
    K (for example, when there is a few insufficient, small clusters), the cluster
    heads of these small clusters are removed from H (line 14 of Algorithm 2) and
    SelectCHs- α ( G,K ) keeps searching for better positioned CHs (based on random
    selection). Note that the maximum number of searches is limited. Otherwise, SelectCHs-
    α ( G,K ) returns H . Algorithm 3: Grow ( G,H ). Input: Graph G=(V,E) ; H the

    ( G,H ) (Algorithm 3) computes K data forwarding trees for K CH nodes by using
    an algorithm similar to the parallel Dijkstra algorithm [21] for constructing
    graph Voronoi diagrams. For each node c h i , a DFT rooted at c h i is gradually
    grown by adding the closest available nodes. Node u is added if it is the node
    closest to the current “forest” (union of all the current DFTs) and, of course,
    is added to c h i ’s DFT for being the DFT nearest to it. The growth of each DFT
    must stop before exceeding the predetermined threshold (set at c h i .dataVolume
    ). Procedure Grow ( G,H ) produces complete Voronoi sets which are ϵ -balanced.
    Procedure MultipleTSP ( s 0 ,H,M ) based on an travel-salesmen algorithm [22]
    to find the the appropriate set S Π of trajectories (of M available UAVs). At
    the end of the main loop of GAMBAC, if the length of trajectories is below the
    limit ℓ max , then it searches for a larger K (further reduce the total energy
    consumption). Otherwise, the search range set by letting high be mid. Algorithm

    Residual Energy Among All Sensor Nodes Inspired by Proposition 1, our GAMBAC-
    α has been designed to keep balancing the size of the clusters (and, consequently,
    the communication workloads per cluster). However, GAMBAC- α may perform poorly
    in deployments with different amounts of monitoring data. In this section, we
    improve our solution with a subtle strategy. An improved version called GAMBAC-
    β has the same code base as GAMBAC- α (i.e., through the execution of GAMBAC (
    G,M, ℓ max ,0,100 , Select_CHs- β )). Here the idea is to keep balancing the ratio
    between the required workload and the residual energy of the CH. Instead of balancing
    “data volume,” we switch to “energy expense in fraction” (denoted by p in Algorithm
    4). For a predetermined fraction value p , clusters are formed so that the energy
    expenditure per each cluster is, at most, a fraction p of the current capacity
    (procedure Select_CHs- β in Algorithm 4). The tune-up phase seeks to find the
    minimum value of p so that the density of CHs is still low enough for M UAVs to
    sufficiently travel, picking up harvested data (each spans a distance no longer
    than ℓ max ). In each step, Select_CHs- β recruits the node with the largest residual
    energy outside the current DFT forest to set H . To restrict the percentage of
    energy expenditure per CH below fraction p , the max data volume of CH u is set
    to be p 100 × u.residualEnergy E RX (1)+ E TX (1) , where E RX (1)+ E TX (1) is
    the total energy spent for receiving and transmitting a unit of data to a UAV.
    Other than that, the remaining details are similar to in SelectCHs- α , where
    notably Grow ( G,H ) is repeatedly performed to extend the DFT forest upon a new
    CH recruit. C. GAMBAC- γ Through the execution of GAMBAC ( G,M, ℓ max ,0,100 ,
    Select_CHs- γ ) we get GAMBAC- γ . The only difference between GAMBAC- β and GAMBAC-
    γ is the setting of the probability of selecting a node to be a cluster head.
    Function Select_CHs- γ picks up a random node from V G ∖ V T with probability
    proportional to its residual energy (as in GAMBAC- α ) and inserts it to the set
    of CHs. SECTION VI. Numerical Results A. GAMBAC Versus Reference Results We have
    performed a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for the problem
    as well. Then, we use CPLEX to get optimal (reference) results for scenarios with
    parameters listed in Table I. Note that the computational complexity of MILP is
    O( N 3 ) (proportionally to the number of nodes), so we can only get reference
    results with CPLEX for networks with a maximum of 50 nodes. TABLE I Parameter
    Settings Two scenarios with four UAVs were investigated. Sensor nodes are randomly
    deployed in the scenarios. Each UAV has a flying limit of 200 m, and each sensor
    node has the initial energy of 50 J and generates the same amount of 64 Kb of
    data per round. In the comparison, ϑ is computed using an energy consumption presented
    in [23]. From Table II, we can observe that after 50 rounds the node with minimum
    remaining energy still has 78.35% and 69.65% of its capacity with the MILP-based
    solution and GAMBAC- α , respectively. The MILP-based solution took 30 min for
    computations per round, while GAMBAC- α needed 0.35 s. TABLE II Comparison Between
    the MILP-Based Solution and GAMBAC- α B. Performance of Heuristic Algorithms In
    this section, we compare the Convex-Hull based Protocol (CHP) [16] (which has
    been the best existing approach so far) with three proposed schemes: GAMBAC- α
    ”, GAMBAC- β and GAMBAC- γ . Note that CHP also carries out the cluster configuration
    and the computation of UAV trajectories at the sink node. Assume that farmers
    deploy sensors (like [24]) in an area of 3000m×3000m to collect soil moisture
    measurements for irrigation management. Two scenarios are investigated: Scenario
    1 represents a case where there is no hole in the area, and the sensor data rate
    fluctuates between 8 and 64 kbits/s. Scenario 2 is an example where the area has
    a big hole but is plain elsewhere, and the data rate (DR) is not fixed over time
    (can fluctuate from 8 to 64 Kb/SN). The DR is relatively high on the far away
    side of the hole, near the border, where the rate is 52 Kb/SN (emergency rate),
    but is the same pattern anywhere else (8-64 Kb/SN). Assume the sensor network
    should support the specific number of rounds (e.g., depending on the length of
    a planting season and the need for collecting data), we plot a battery energy
    level required in each sensor in Figs. 4 and 6. Note that the battery level depicted
    in the y-axis of Figs. 4 and 6. We observe that GAMBAC β is the best scheme for
    saving energy consumption. For example, to support 200 rounds, the GAMBAC- β scheme
    needs the batter of only 32 J for each sensor node, while GAMBAC- γ , CHP and
    GAMBAC- α require the battery of 40, 41, and 50 J, respectively. The phenomenon
    is understandable from the histogram of the residual energy of nodes at a specific
    round (e.g., 464) plotted in Fig. 5. Compared to other schemes, GAMBAC- β utilizes
    energy most efficiently. Sensor nodes have the highest level of residual energy
    and the status of the smallest energy after each round is highest. Similar observations
    are obtained in Scenario 2 as well (see Fig. 7). Note that GAMBAC- β outperforms
    other schemes in all the scenarios with different deployments of sensor nodes
    in a geographic area. Fig. 3. Deployment of sensors in two scenarios. (a) Scenario
    1. (b) Scenario 2. Show All Fig. 4. Number of rounds versus required battery energy

    algorithms (Scenario 2). Show All Fig. 7. Histogram and the standard deviation
    σ of SN residual energy at round 211 (Scenario 2). Show All The CHP solution is
    a geometric approach, where the sink is at the center of the area with multiple
    sectors of similar weights. The geometric approach works well when the network
    area has a simple shape (continuous without any void), and the observed data volume
    distributes evenly over the network. However, if the network has a complicated
    shape (with void regions) and the data volume observed at the sensors varies,
    this geometric approach could not produce good results. From our experiments,
    CHP performs well in the first scenario (simple shape network), but poorly in
    the second (with a void and unequal distribution of observed data). SECTION VII.
    Conclusion We have proposed joint clustering & multi-UAV gathering schemes to
    extend network lifetime. Our heuristic (GAMBAC) algorithms give a result close
    to the MILP approach and are efficiently applied for a network of large sizes.
    Numerical results showed that our algorithms outperform existing proposals. In
    all the scenarios, GAMBAC- β requires significantly less initial energy to support
    the specific number of data collection rounds than the CHP algorithm. In future
    work, we will investigate randomization techniques to select cluster head nodes
    and algorithms to facilitate searching for the optimal number of clusters. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    multiple regions by constructing a planar Voronoi diagram with the seed elements
    consisting of the set of points S P ={ O 0 , O 1 ,…, O q } and the set of open
    line segments S L ={ O 0 O 1 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ , O 1 O 2 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯
    ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ,…, O q O 0 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ } . Fig. 2 illustrates such Voronoi
    partition, where the Voronoi region of a point in S P is gray in color, while
    the remaining parts are Voronoi regions of the line segments in S L . For a node
    u , let ψ u be the point or line segment whose Voronoi region contains s u . It
    is straightforward to see that the Euclide distance between s u and its CH cannot
    be less than the distance between s u and ψ u , which is denoted as d( s u , ψ
    u ) (see Fig. 2). According to [25], the most energy efficient way for delivering
    data over a distance d( s u , ψ u ) is to take ν u =⌈ d( s u , ψ u ) R ⌉ hops
    with equal distance of d( s u , ψ u ) ν u , where ⌈.⌉ denotes the ceiling function.
    Let f u be the S2S energy consumption for delivering data from source s u to its
    CH. Then, we have f u ≥ ν u [ E RX (1)+ E TX (1, d( s u , ψ u ) ν u )] ≥ ν u [
    E RX0 + E TX0 +ϑ ( d( s u , ψ u ) ν u ) 2 ]. (3) View Source Lemma 1: If R t,t+1

    ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ | is the length of O t O t+1 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ . Proof:
    We apply the Riemann summation to approximate an integral. Namely, we divide the
    Voronoi region into χ= ℓ t,t+1 / Δ x rectangles, each with equal width Δ x as
    illustrated in Fig. 8. Then for a rectangle Rec t i with height y i , we further
    divide it into J=⌈ y i R ⌉ subrectangles, where the first J−1 has height of R
    and the last has height of y i R −J+1 (see Fig. 8). As analyzed above, we can
    assert that a SN s u located in the j th subrectangle Subrec t j has the hop distance
    to its CH of at least ⌈ d( s u , ψ u ) R ⌉ , which is equal to j . Thus, we have

    1: We first consider the Uniform setting. From Lemmas 1 and 2, we have E S2S =

    q 3 4 ℓ t ) ≥ ( ∑ t=1 q S t,t+1 + ∑ t=1 q S t ) 2 = S 2 total . (22) View Source
    Thus, E S2S > c S 2 total ℓ max + ∑ q t=1 3 4 ℓ t . (23) View Source Since ∑ q
    t=1 3 4 ℓ t ≪ ℓ max , (23) can be rewritten as E S2S > c S 2 total ℓ max =B. (24)
    View Source For the Plain setting, let ℓ i be the length of trajectory parts passing
    through area A i . Since the SNs inside A i form a Uniform subnetwork then from
    Proposition 1, we have E S2S,i > c ς i S 2 i 4 ℓ i , where E S2S,i be the expected
    energy consumption for delivering data from all nodes located inside A i to their
    corresponding CHs and S i is the area of A i . Thus, E S2S = ∑ i=1 K E S2S,i >
    ∑ i=1 K c ς i S 2 i 4 ℓ i . (25) View Source Using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality,
    we obtain ( ∑ i=1 K ς i S 2 i ℓ i )( ∑ i=1 K ℓ i )≥ ( ∑ i=1 K ς i − − √ S i )
    2 . (26) View Source As a consequence, we get E S2S > c ( ∑ K i=1 ς i − − √ S
    i ) 2 ℓ max =B. (27) View Source Since the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality is applied,
    the energy consumption approaches the lower bound if clusters are energy-consumption
    balanced. □  Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

    Abstract Water resources are, therefore, a limiting factor for the country’s agricultural
    production, and saving water becomes clearly a necessary prerequisite. In this
    logic, irrigation technologies appear to play a major role in supporting Egypt''s
    agro-economy. However, using such modern means of irrigation control can help
    in scheduling both irrigation and fertigation processes very accurately, providing
    different cultivated crops with their exact requirements of water and fertilizers
    at the correct time for the plant. Moreover, it will consume the minimum water,
    fertilizers energy, and labor as well. Also, it will render the plant avoid any
    stress of water deficiency. This review article aims to present some automated
    scheduling techniques for accurate irrigation management in Egypt, as one of the
    solutions to overcome the impact of climate change. This can be done through several
    methods such as irrigation scheduling using the data required for irrigation scheduling
    or by using irrigation scheduling programs and models. As well as the use of automatic
    irrigation, whether by means of ground humidity or controlling the time and amount

    all metrics Abstract Precision agriculture is the mechanism which controls the
    land productivity and maximizes the revinue and minimizes the impact on sorroundings
    by automating the complete agriculture processes. This projected work relies on
    independent internet of things (IoT) enabled wireless sensor network (WSN) framework
    consisting of soil moisture (MC) probe, soil temperature measuring device, environmental
    temperature sensor, environmental humidity sensing device, CO2 sensor, daylight
    intensity device (light dependent resistor) to acquire real-time farm information
    through multi-point measurement. The projected observance technique consists of
    all standalone IoT-enabled WSN nodes used for timely data acquisitions and storage
    of agriculture information. The farm history is additionally stored for generating
    necessary action throughout the whole course of farming. The work summarizes the
    optimum usage of irrigation by the precise management of water valve using neural
    network-based prediction of soil water requirement in 1 h ahead. Our proposed
    irrigation control scheme utilizes structural similarity (SSIM)-based water valve
    management mechanism which is used to locate farm regions having water deficiency.
    Moreover, a close comparative study of optimization techniques, like variable
    learning rate gradient descent, gradient descent for feedforward neural network-based
    pattern classification, is performed and the best practice is employed to forecast
    soil MC on hourly basis together with interpolation method for generating soil
    moisture content (MC) distribution map. Finally, SSIM index-based soil MC deficiency
    is calculated to manipulate the specified valves for maintaining uniform water
    requirement through the entire farm area. The valve control commands are again
    processed using fuzzy logic-based weather condition modeling system to manipulate
    control commands by considering different weather conditions. Similar content

    agriculture methods: a holistic review Article 13 September 2021 A Review of the
    Applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) for Agricultural Automation Article
    26 November 2020 1 Introduction Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are constantly
    used from the scientific community since the potential of ecological monitoring
    software composed of cost-effective possibility to construct and process all kinds
    of information with greater resolution, these systems are regarded as a important
    part of ubiquitous computing [1, 2]. Therefore, using IoT-driven WSN platform
    in precision agriculture can revolutionize the information assortment in agricultural
    area and encourage the sought after exceptionally machine-driven agriculture method
    which demands intensive understanding of ecological conditions in the base level
    and speedy communication of the information to a distant or local server where
    the source of storage and process, identification of insects inside the plants,
    burial or hyperbolic moist, the alternative generating, and so the direction of
    plantation instrumentation is completed instantly (automatic propulsion apparatus
    such as sprinklers, foggers, valve-controlled irrigation method, and so forth
    is used for management irrigation, and fertilization and pest control in order
    to offset the negative states forming wireless sensor in addition to actuator
    network (WSAN). The above system is accessible globally due to the involvement
    of IoT technology [3,4,5]. A fast evaluation and observation of soil moisture
    content (MC) of this massive area is necessary so that optimum irrigation will
    be possible at agriculture plantation region. Gravimetric method is called the
    standard to determine soil water content version, but it is not effective in providing
    large-scale fast data collection and can be limited to a compact dimension quantity.
    Geophysical techniques like ground penetrating radar (GPR) and electromagnetic
    induction (EMI) quantify a bigger sample quantity and therefore are accommodated
    to cover huge areas economically, which could not triumph from different procedures
    [6,7,8]. Additional techniques of spectroscopic scanning-based soil moisture material
    discovery are most frequently used to find soil MC map of a huge agriculture property,
    but utilizing this way is frequently expensive work, and also they are not used
    to find soil MC variations through the summertime [9, 10]. Within exactly the
    same circumstance, wireless sensor network (WSN)-based land MC evaluation can
    be utilized for real-time observation and evaluation of dirt MC dynamics throughout
    the whole cropping time. Liang et al. [11] have suggested a plan and employ a
    real-time irrigation forecast using GPRS and WSN system . The addition of the
    general system uses WSN to obtain soil MC information. The backend system employs
    the hereditary back-propagation neural system to assess in addition to process
    sensor information with simulated annealing algorithm to maximize the outcome
    for real time forecast. The experimental results reveal that the system suggested
    by Liang et al. [11] gets the benefits of low-cost, higher precision and suitable
    maintenance. The process implied by Liang et al. [11] is a straight sensing of
    soil MC using WSN platform, and this content does not signify the mechanism for
    water conservation by simply contemplating weather conditions. Similarly, the
    work does not emphasize on remote access like IoT-enabled control [12, 13]. At
    the similar circumstance, additional property-associated parameters and ecological
    parameters might impact the irrigation demands. Timely forecast of soil moisture
    content may soon demonstrate much improved irrigation optimization by considering
    all of the crucial parameters that impact the soil water flow. Further, the prediction
    methodology for a large agriculture land requires high computing resources which
    is possible in a cloud-enabled services. Thus, IoT comes into the picture with
    data analytics and machine learning framework [14,15,16,17,18]. The suggested
    method is determined by establishing wireless sensors in the farm to acquire real-time
    observation and evaluate soil moisture content (MC) in the test site. The test
    site is of length 50 m and width 50 m. It is implanted with Bermuda grass that
    is generally used as an ayurvedic medicine for colitis and gut infections. The
    distributed sensor network nodes are utilized to acquire real-time soil as well
    as environmental parameters. The general parameters considered are soil moisture
    content (MC), soil temperature, temperature of the surrounding, humidity level
    of the surrounding, CO2 level of air, as well as sunlight intensity level. The
    WNS environment is configured as nine numbers of wireless sensor nodes and a single
    gateway node (GN) or the coordinator node. The gateway node is also called as
    the coordinator node and others behave as router nodes. The coordinator node is
    responsible to collect all the sensor information and forward it to the cloud
    platform for necessary prediction of soil water requirements. The coordinator
    node is designed with Raspberry Pi3, Zigbee tranceiver (S2 series) and wifi circuitry
    (On board). Further, gateway node connects the internet application via the wifi
    network for the prediction of the soil water requirements. The essential data
    set is obtained over wifi connectivity to the internet server unit for the estimation
    of soil MC. Further, it is used obtain the soil MC distribution map of the land.
    With this work structural similarity index (SSIM)-based soil MC deficiency is
    calculated to manipulate irrigation valves to maintain the required water content
    uniform over the farm area. The performance of two different optimization algorithms
    such as VLRGD and GD-based neural network (NN) data prediction strategies is compared
    by computing few statistical errors like RMSE, R-squared error and MSE. Similarly,
    Majone et al. [19] have used wireless sensor network to supervise MC dynamics
    of the top soil in both time and space that is appropriate to examine the relationship
    between MC dynamics and plant physiology. The wireless sensor network deployment
    consists of twenty-seven locations (in verticals direction) configured by multi-hop
    configuration. The every wireless node contains 5 numbers of soil moisture sensor
    probes those are deployed in the varied depths like 10, 20, 30, 50 and 80, along
    with a temperature sensing device (temperature sensor PT100) at a distance downwards
    25 cm [3, 17]. The method projected by Majone et al. [19] does not provide the
    mechanism for site-specific irrigation valve control for maintaining efficient
    irrigation requirement. Irrigation scheduling and decision support system will
    provide better control over farm land water requirement. And also the water requirement
    is not precisely controlled by considering site-specific weather data. There are
    several weather condition-dependent irrigation controllers available commercially.
    All these instruments are based on few environmental parameters like temperature,
    humidity and solar radiation [20,21,22,23,24]. But other environmental parameters
    like wind speed, CO2 and soil-related parameters are also affects the farm irrigation
    requirements [25,26,27]. The complete intelligent weather-dependent irrigation
    control scheme is also discussed in this article. In the similar perspective,
    Lenka et al. [28] projected the MC prediction using partial-least-square-regression
    and fuzzy logic technique to manage the land irrigation requirements. The method
    produces MSE about 0.183193 and RMSE about 0.428011. The method proposed by Lenka
    et al. [28] controls the farm irrigation valve in a real-time approach, but zone-wise
    irrigation map is not included in the work. Similarly Lenka et al. [28] proposed
    BFGS-quasi-newton feedforward NN to forecast MC level in 1 h advance, and it is
    integrated with fuzzy logic model to generate appropriate irrigation valve control
    commands. The land soil moisture requirement map is not proposed in this work
    which will be produce better zone-wise as well as crop-wise irrigation control.
    The moisture map shows a better view over the soil moisture content deficiency
    of the farm land [29, 30]. The irrigation requirements can easily be addressed
    quickly by the IoT-driven decision support system (DSS). Our SSIM-based zone and
    crop specific irrigation control mechanism will produce added advantage for efficient
    irrigation control scheme over a large farming area. 2 Proposed methodology The
    main aim of the research work described in this article is to design a precise
    irrigation monitoring and control mechanism consisting of the following objectives.
    Development of a low-cost and high accuracy distributed IoT-enabled wireless sensor
    network environment for accurately monitoring the soil and environmental parameters
    which are used for predicting timely water requirements. Development of a precise
    optimization mechanism for timely forecast of MC level. Development of a robust
    mechanism for generating soil moisture content distribution map using interpolation
    technique. The distribution map is generated by measuring soil moisture content
    at nine positions of the farmland using IoT enabled WSN environment (land dimension
    is defined in the experimental site section of the article). Structural similarity
    index (SSIM) mechanisms that associate interpolated data for generating zone-specific
    irrigation control commands to control irrigation valves. Implementation of the
    weather condition-dependent irrigation control mechanism using fuzzy logic-based
    weather model. The detailed explanation of the above methodology is explained
    in the rest of the sections. 3 Experimental site The test site is situated at
    Bhubaneswar (Latitude: 20.351323, Longitude: 85.806547) in the eastern region
    of India. The cultivated farm has an area of almost 5000 m2. The profile consists
    of a layer of soppy soil, quite 2 m deep with sandy loam surface. Here the key
    top soil quality was found by laboratory study of untouched sample of 3.5 kg.
    Further, the dry bulk density and consistency of the soil sample are about 1.43
    g-cm−3 and 0.46 g-cm−3, respectively. The deployment of WSN nodes is shown in
    Fig. 1 where all nodes are connected with each other using multi-hop mesh network.
    The architecture of a single WSN node is shown in Fig. 2. All sensors are interfaced
    with the node via internal eight channels analog-to-digital converter (ADC) of
    the microcontroller (ATMEGA328P-PU). The microcontroller communicates with the
    Zigbee S2 unit via RS232 interface. Each Zigbee S2 device is configured using
    mesh network topology. The digital out pin of the Zigbee S2 is used to activate
    corresponding sprinkler valve unit. In this work, the irrigation mechanism consists
    of sprinkler pipe lines with sprinkler heads at 0.41 m spacing as well as with
    a flow of 2.2 Lh−1. Fig. 1 Deployment of wireless sensor network nodes in a Bermuda
    grass (Cynodon dactylon) planting site located at Bhubaneswar (latitude: 20.351323,
    longitude: 85.806547) Full size image Fig. 2 a Single node architecture of the
    WSN environment b proposed Single node fabricated for acquiring farm data. The
    IP67 housing used for the sensor node is shown in the right side figure Full size
    image 4 Proposed IoT-driven WSN system The battery capacity and backup are two
    major factors of the WSN nodes. All sensors are connected to the analog-to-digital
    converter (ADC) of the microcontroller. The battery capacity chosen in this work
    is of 6 V/4.5 A/h lead acid type. The solar panel provides necessary charging
    current to the batter unit during day time. The solar panel chosen in this work
    is of 7 V/250 mA. The fabricated WSN node is shown in Fig. 2b. Similarly, the
    energy supply is also monitored in a real-time approach via ADC of the controller.
    The data acquisition is carried out in every 10 min and during non-transmitting
    mode the Zigbee modem is kept in a sleep mode which eventually increases the battery
    backup. During deep sleep mode, the Zigbee generally consumes a very low current
    as 0.02 µA. The Zigbee transceivers are configured in a mesh network pattern by
    updating the device firmware. Finally, the gateway is responsible to send the
    data to the internet web server for real-time analysis of sensor parameters. The
    complete unit is enclosed in a IP65 enclosure and mounted in a panel box. The
    solar panel is inclined at 45° for maximum power efficiency. In the similar context,
    Yunseop James et al. (2008) have proposed a 295-m-long linear movement irrigation
    system at Valley, Valmont Irrigation, Valley, NE [26]. It is observed that Bluetooth
    radio has many limitations as compared to Zigbee. The wireless nodes are utilized
    to acquire sensor data and forward it to the sink node for storing in its own
    database. The detailed architecture of the sink node is shown in Fig. 3. In this
    work, MATLAB is used to communicate with the sink node for collecting all data
    which is used for soil MC prediction and irrigation valve control using SSIM technique.
    Fig. 3 Sink node architecture of the WSN environment Full size image 5 Proposed
    soil MC prediction and irrigation control methodology The proposed MC prediction
    methodology is based on feedforward neural network where the input parameters
    are the real-time wireless sensor data [31, 32]. In this article, the performance
    analysis of the training algorithms such as VLRGD and GD is deliberated for implementation
    of IoT-WSN bidirectional DSS (decision support system) in PA (precision agriculture)
    mechanism. After the successful prediction of soil MC at every location of the
    WSN nodes connected in the field area, bilinear interpolation is used to generate
    soil MC distribution throughout the farm land. The soil MC distribution map generated
    using interpolation is compared with required soil MC using SSIM, which plays
    an important role in controlling zone-specific irrigation valves. The valve control
    command generated using SSIM is used to evaluate the actual necessity of water
    by implementing fuzzy logic-based weather-dependent irrigation mechanism. A detailed
    flow model of the methodology is shown in Fig. 4. Further, the performance analysis
    of the above two prediction methodologies is listed in Table 1A (Fig. 5). Fig.

    Variable learning rate gradient descent (VLRGD) The neural network performance
    depends on learning rate; therefore, the error rate converges soon. The bigger
    learning rate may converge the error rate of the neural network training. But
    much bigger learning rate will make the neural network unstable. Similarly, much
    smaller learning rate will take long time to converge [14, 33]. To improve the
    convergence time, the VLRGD neural network assumes bigger learning rate \(\alpha\).
    Further, the new weight vector \(V_{i + 1 }\) is modified with a varying \(\alpha_{i}\).
    Again,\(g_{k}\) is the gradient of the error with respect to the weight matrix
    [14, 34,35,36]. There is momentum (μ) of gradient descent for a varying \(\alpha_{k
    }\) [33]. Normally, the updated weight vector \(V_{i + 1 }\) is defined in Eq.
    1. $$V_{i + 1} = V_{i} - \alpha_{i + 1} g_{i} + \mu V_{i - 1}$$ (1) $$\alpha_{i
    + 1} = \beta \alpha_{i}$$ $$\beta = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {0.75 \;{\text{if
    updated error}} > 1.05\, \left( {\text{for previous error}} \right)} \\ {1.05
    \;{\text{if updated error}} < 1.05\, \left( {\text{for previous error}} \right)}
    \\ \end{array} } \right.$$ 6.1 Gradient descent This optimization technique updates
    the weight matrix and bias values in the direction of the negative gradient [28].
    The updated weight matrix is based on Eq. 2. $$w_{k + 1} = w_{k} - \alpha_{k}
    g_{k}$$ (2) The updated weight matrix depends on three factors such as current
    weight matrix (wk), updated weight matrix (wk+1), learning rate (α) and gradient
    error (\(g_{k}\)) with respect to the weight matrix [28, 37, 38]. The negative
    sign of the weight matrix signifies that it is following the opposite direction.
    6.2 Bilinear interpolation on the grid data The bilinear transformation is a type
    of linear interpolation technique where the interpolation of two variables (x
    and y) on a 2D plane. This interpolation first performs in one direction and then
    again in another direction. For example, an unknown function ‘f’ at two different
    points (a, b) need to be interpolated where four discrete points are available
    which is mentioned below. D11 = (a1, b1), D12 = (a1, b2), D21 = (a2, b1), and
    D22 = (a2, b2) Firstly, the interpolation is performed in the x-direction and
    then in y-direction according to Eqs. 3 and 4. These yields. $$f\left( {a,y_{1}
    } \right) \approx \frac{{a_{2} - a}}{{a_{2} - a_{1} }}f\left( {D_{11} } \right)
    + \frac{{a - a_{1} }}{{a_{2} - a_{1} }}f\left( {D_{21} } \right)$$ (3) $$f\left(
    {a,y_{2} } \right) \approx \frac{{a_{2} - a}}{{a_{2} - a_{1} }}f\left( {D_{12}
    } \right) + \frac{{a - a_{1} }}{{a_{2} - a_{1} }}f\left( {D_{22} } \right)$$ (4)
    Further, the interpolation is performed from y-direction to estimate the interpolated
    data according to Eq. 5. $$f\left( {a,b} \right) \approx \frac{{b_{2} - b}}{{b_{2}
    - b_{1} }}f\left( {a,b_{1} } \right) + \frac{{b - b_{1} }}{{b_{2} - b_{1} }}f\left(
    {a,b_{2} } \right)$$ (5) Finally, the same result is used to interpolate the values
    in x-direction. 6.3 Structural similarity (SSIM) index The SSIM conveys the visual
    characteristics by calculating a similarity measure between two spots such as
    x and y. The SSIM is calculated by multiplying mean m(x, y), variance v(x, y),
    along with cross-correlation r(x, y) as mentioned in Eq. 6 [39]. $${\text{SSIM}}\left(
    {x, y} \right) = m\left( {x, y} \right)^{\alpha } \times v\left( {x, y} \right)^{\beta
    } \times c\left( {x, y} \right)^{\gamma }$$ (6) $$\quad \qquad= \left( {\frac{{2\mu_{x}
    \mu_{y} + C_{1} }}{{\mu_{x}^{2} + \mu_{y}^{2} + C_{1} }}} \right)^{\alpha } \times
    \left( {\frac{{2\delta_{x} \delta_{y} + C_{2} }}{{\delta_{x}^{2} + \delta_{y}^{2}
    + C_{2} }}} \right)^{\beta } \times \left( {\frac{{\delta_{x} \delta_{y} + C_{3}
    }}{{\delta_{x} \delta_{y} + C_{3} }}} \right)^{\gamma }$$ where \(\mu_{x}\) is
    mean of x, \(\mu_{y}\) is mean of y, \(\delta_{x}\) is standard deviation of x,
    \(\delta_{y}\) is standard deviation of y, \(\delta_{xy}\) is cross-correlation
    (inner product) of the mean shifted matrix x–\(\mu_{x}\) and y–\(\mu_{y}\), as
    well as the Ci for i = 1, 2, 3 are small positive constants. 6.4 Fuzzification
    and defuzzification Fuzzification is that the practice of building a sharp fuzzy
    set. This is sometimes accomplished by simply recognizing that a number of these
    amounts will be thought about to be eloquent and settled that are really not deterministic
    whatsoever. Uncertainty that is clear is carried by them. In the event the form
    of doubt occurs to appear as a consequence of ambiguity; then the factor could
    be portrayed by means of a membership function. Similarly, defuzzification is
    the transformation of a fuzzy figure into an explicit amount, as fuzzification
    is the conversion of an equal amount to some fuzzy quantity. Similarly, the output
    of a fuzzy method may be the logical union of 2 or additional fuzzy membership
    functions outlined on the universe of discourse of the output variable. The fuzzy
    logic is a rule-based model where the inputs and outputs are bounded to the rule
    sets. The outputs of the model are mathematically bounded to the input parameters.
    In this article, we have considered the real-time sensor parameters as the inputs
    to the model and valve control commands are generated according to the rule set
    defined in the fuzzy logic model. In this work, the weather information as well
    as the predicted soil MC is used to generate appropriate irrigation valve control
    commands. The fuzzification and defuzzification process is shown in Fig. 4. 6.5
    Proposed flow model for irrigation valve control The proposed flow model of the
    irrigation control scheme is depicted in Fig. 6. The irrigation control mechanism
    takes into account of all the IoT enabled WSN node data for analyzing soil MC
    distribution using bilinear interpolation. Finally, precise irrigation valve control
    is done using SSIM index of the interpolated data with the reference soil MC.
    The agriculture irrigation valve control is efficiently performed using real-time
    acquisition of IoT-enabled WSN data, neural network prediction module and fuzzy
    logic-based decision-making module. The DSS model is integrated with a GSM modem
    for SMS sending. The interfacing is done using suitable AT command sequences through
    RS232 interface with the server station. Fig. 6 Flow chart of the irrigation control
    mechanism using hybrid decision model Full size image 7 Results and discussions
    The optimization techniques utilized within the scope of this neural network-based
    prediction methodology are variable learning rate gradient descent and gradient
    descent. The parameters used to establish a relationship between wireless sensor
    data and soil MC in 1 h advance are shown in Table 1A. Further, the crop water
    need can be studied from Table 1B where the water requirement of some seasonal
    crops are listed. The performance analysis of the prediction algorithm is done
    by evaluating R-squared, MSE and RMSE. It is observed that VLRGD-based feedforward
    NN pattern classification generates minimum MSE, RMSE, and better R-squared value.
    Finally, this is used for the generation of MC distribution map of the farm land
    by taking all the IoT enabled WSN node data. Few input parameters such as sunrise
    time, UV index, and air flow rate are taken from weather forecast data, and soil
    type is taken from manual soil test of the farm land. VLRGD and NN pattern classification
    is used to predict soil MC by obtaining soil and environmental information. The
    soil MC prediction performance in addition to error graph is shown in Fig. 7.

    the performance of VLRGD-based NN pattern classification training is shown in
    Fig. 8. The accurate training performance is found after 2000 epochs. The training
    state of VLRGD-based NN pattern classification is shown in Fig. 9. It is observed
    that the best training was performed after 1999 epochs. Fig. 8 Variable learning

    is performed to analyze training performance. The soil MC prediction response
    and error graph of GD-based NN pattern classification model is shown in Fig. 10.
    The GD optimization-based NN pattern classification training performance is shown
    in Fig. 11. The accurate training is performed after 2000 epochs. Fig. 10 Actual

    of GD optimization for water requirement is shown in Fig. 12. Then, the performance
    analysis is established by evaluating general statistical errors like MSE, R-squared
    value and RMSE which is shown in Table 2. The MSE and RMSE are required to analyze
    the behavior of the two prediction techniques during the estimation of required
    soil moisture content. Less is the MSE and RMSE, more better is the performance
    of the prediction algorithm. Similarly, R-squared value more closely to 1 represents
    the better estimation of the target values during the training of neural network
    algorithm. Fig. 12 Training state of the gradient descent optimization neural
    network pattern classification training Full size image Table 2 Different errors
    obtained prediction of soil MC Full size table Gradient descent (GD) has higher
    MSE and RMSE than VLRGD-based neural network soil moisture content prediction
    algorithm. Similarly, the variable learning rate gradient descent (VLRGD) produces
    less MSE and RMSE compared to GD-based neural network soil moisture content prediction
    algorithm. It is found from Table 2 that the performance of the VLRGD is far better
    than simple GD-based neural network pattern classification method. This method
    is used to calculate MC in 1 h advance of all the farm regions wherever IoT-enabled
    WSN nodes are connected. The predicted MC using VLRGD-based neural network pattern
    classification of all the regions is stored for generating soil MC distribution

    map data are used for bilinear interpolation for generating complete soil MC distribution
    map at each location of the farm land. The complete soil MC distribution map is
    shown in Fig. 14. The required soil MC distribution of the farm land is shown

    in Fig. 16. Furthermore, the soil MC deficiency data of the agriculture area are
    impressed to fuzzy logic-based weather module to generate actual irrigation valve
    commands (Fig. 17). Fig. 16 Soil MC deficiency map using SSIM index Full size

    in Fig. 20. A sample valve control command matrix for single region soil MC deficiency
    is shown in Table 5. It is observed from Table 5 that the valve control commands
    are generated in a matrix format where 0 and 1 are used. The ‘0’ represents OFF
    condition of the valve, and ‘1’ represents the ON condition of the valve. Fig.

    contemplating soil MC prediction technique utilizing VLRGD-based optimization
    algorithm. A comparative analysis between VLRGD and GD is also formed by acquiring
    MSE, RMSE and R-squared value. During this test, we found that VLRGD has a much
    reduced MSE and RMSE such as 0.0468 and 0.0021, respectively. Similarly, GD-based
    NN prediction system produces much higher MSE and RMSE values such as 0.1111 and
    0.0123, respectively. The comprehensive soil MC requirement map is obtained using
    bilinear interpolation and SSIM-based approach. The irrigation valve control commands
    are generated successfully with fuzzy logic weather model to fulfil uniform farm
    irrigation requirement almost all the weather conditions. References Panchard

    based on the use of weather forecast data from freely and easily accessible online
    information for determining irrigation scheduling has been developed. Firstly,
    reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was determined with a user-friendly procedure
    that does not require previous local calibration, knowledge of data acquisition
    or processing, or a nearby weather station. The comparison of ETo based on short-term
    (same-day) and long-term (6-day-ahead) weather forecast data with measured data
    for 50 locations in southern Spain during 2013–2014 season indicated that differences
    in ETo were relatively low with root-mean-square error (RMSE) equal to 0.65 and
    0.76 mm d−1, respectively. The procedure was tested for a wide range of weather
    conditions in the development of irrigation schedules and yield simulations for
    maize crop during 2013–2014 season. Irrigation water depths provided by irrigation
    schedules based on ETo obtained from daily and weekly forecasts and from measured
    data showed differences of around 1.5 and 0.9 %, respectively. Likewise, yield
    simulation with irrigation scheduling based on forecast and measured data provided
    equal averaged values, with a relative RMSE of below 5 %. This similarity of irrigation
    scheduling and yield estimation based on forecast and measured data has proved
    the optimal performance of the proposed approach. Similar content being viewed

    18 March 2022 Introduction In recent years, significant advances in modelling
    have contributed to the improvement of water management in many areas around the
    world (Allen et al. 2007; Steduto et al. 2012). Crop simulation modelling has
    increased our understanding of how agricultural systems function (Marsal and Stocke
    2012), allowing us to determine optimal agronomic practices that increase water
    productivity and optimise irrigation management at both farm (García-Vila and
    Fereres 2012) and district level (Lorite et al. 2007). An essential requirement
    for the effective application of these new simulation tools is the acquisition
    of high-quality weather data. Subsequently, a significant emphasis has been laid
    on the development of weather station networks (Gavilán et al. 2006). Numerous
    areas around the world have therefore incorporated advanced weather station networks
    (Schroeder et al. 2005), but the high costs of maintenance and data collection
    have restricted their growth (Exner-Kittridge and Rains 2010). A further limitation
    of the use of these networks is the reduced density of the weather stations themselves;
    currently, vast irrigated areas are located far away from well-managed weather
    stations due to their low density and uneven distribution (Collins 2011). In recent
    years, an alternative to the use of weather station networks has been the use
    of remote sensing techniques, providing high-quality and fine-resolution weather
    characterisation for extensive areas (Cristobal and Anderson 2012; Cruz-Blanco
    et al. 2014a, 2015; Rahimikhoob and Hosseinzadeh 2014). However, the use of remote
    sensing techniques for farmers and technicians is severely limited by the complexity
    of accessing the information, which stems from the lack of user-friendly communication
    channels for data acquisition. Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is a key component
    of crop modelling (Allen et al. 1998) and requires complete and accurate weather
    data for its computation. Thus, in areas with limited or deficient weather data
    from automatic weather station networks, new advances in simulation modelling
    might face serious restrictions. Due to the detected limitations in the availability
    of accurate data for the use of complex functions for ETo estimation (Allen 1996),
    alternative approaches have been analysed in order to reduce data acquisition
    costs (Exner-Kittridge and Rains 2010) and to facilitate their estimation for
    technicians and farmers. Simplified equations with reduced data requirements such
    as Hargreaves (Gavilán et al. 2006; Khoob 2008), the use of interpolation approaches
    (Alves et al. 2013; Walsh et al. 2013) or those based on multiple linear regression
    (Martí et al. 2011) have therefore been advocated, as well as new alternatives
    such as the use of weather forecast data for ETo estimation and irrigation water
    management in the development of real-time irrigation scheduling (Mariño et al.
    1993; Cai et al. 2007; Xu et al. 2012). Around the world, public and private institutions
    provide accurate, daily, online weather forecasts, and in most cases these are
    freely accessible to all. These weather forecast services are based on complex
    numerical models. In Europe, the two main consortiums that provide weather forecast
    data are HIRLAM (HIgh Resolution Limited Area Model; Unden et al. 2002) and ALADIN
    (Aire Limitée Adaptation dynamique Développement InterNational; ALADIN 1997).
    In 2006, both European consortiums collaborated in the development of high-resolution
    systems with a spatial resolution of less than 1 km. The resulting system is called
    HARMONIE/AROME (HIRLAM–ALADIN Research towards Meso-scale Operational NWP in Europe/Application
    of Research to Operations at Mesoscale; Seity et al. 2011) and will be the successor
    to HIRLAM (Gronsleth and Randriamampianina 2012). In addition to these, the European
    Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF; Persson 2011) also provides
    weather forecasting services for Europe and North Africa that are used in conjunction
    with the HIRLAM system (Navascués et al. 2013). Other models such as Weather Research
    and Forecasting (WRF), MM5 (PSU/NCAR mesoscale model) or Australian Community
    Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS-G) provide atmospheric research and
    operational forecasting for North America, South America and Australia (Done et
    al. 2004; Silva et al. 2010; Perera et al. 2014). Numerous studies have been carried
    out using weather forecast data for agriculture applications. Some studies have
    evaluated the use of those data for ETo estimation when data from weather stations
    were not available (Er-Raki et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2012; Perera et al. 2014; Luo
    et al. 2014; Tian et al. 2014), while others have focussed on the impact of real-time
    weather forecast data, mainly rainfall, on irrigation scheduling (Cabelguenne
    et al. 1997; Gowing and Ejieji 2001; Wang and Cai 2009; Bergez and Garcia 2010;
    Cai et al. 2011; Mishra et al. 2013). Also related to irrigation scheduling, numerical
    weather data have been used for soil water content assessment (Venalainen et al.
    2005; Cai et al. 2009; Tian and Martinez 2014) with satisfactory results. Equally,
    the integration of remote sensing techniques with forecasting tools has provided
    spatially distributed weather data information with very satisfactory results
    (de Bruin et al. 2010; Cristobal and Anderson 2012; Cruz-Blanco et al. 2014a,
    b). However, not all technicians and farmers have access to these innovative methodologies
    as they require in-depth knowledge of data acquisition and processing, calibration
    and evaluation. This study evaluated the use of weather forecast data for ETo,
    irrigation scheduling and yield estimation by comparing the results with those
    generated with measured data by automatic weather stations. Our objective was
    to develop a user-friendly procedure for ETo estimation which did not require
    prior knowledge or calibration and which was applicable in any location regardless
    of whether there was a weather station in the surrounding area or not. In order
    to evaluate the performance of weather forecast data for irrigation scheduling,
    a practical application has been examined, generating irrigation schedules for
    maize with weather forecast data for 43 locations in the southern Spanish region
    of Andalusia, and comparing them with the irrigation scheduling based on measured
    weather data from automatic weather stations. Materials and methods Weather forecast
    service from the State Meteorological Agency In Spain, the State Meteorological
    Agency (Agencia Estatal de Meteorología, AEMET; AEMET 2015) provides daily weather
    forecasts for up to 6 days ahead for 8117 locations, 771 of them in Andalusia.
    The weather forecast data include sky cover, probability of rainfall, maximum
    and minimum air temperature and relative humidity, as well as wind speed and direction.
    The weather forecast service from AEMET combines two data sources for weather
    forecasting: for up to 3-day-ahead forecast (D0–D2) the numerical model HIRLAM-AEMET;
    and for 3- to 6-day-ahead forecast (D3–D6) data provided by ECMWF. The HIRLAM-5
    project was established in order to provide the best available operational short-range
    forecasting system for the member institutes (currently the National Meteorological
    Services in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain
    and Sweden, including Météo-France with a research cooperation agreement; Unden
    et al. 2002). The HIRLAM-5 project originates an operational production system
    for short-range forecasting, which generates a comprehensive set of Numerical
    Weather Prediction products of the highest quality with a spatial resolution of
    about 5 km2 (Unden et al. 2002). The ECMWF system consists of several components
    such as an atmospheric general circulation model, producing forecasts from days
    to weeks ahead, with an initial spatial resolution of 13.5 km along the meridian
    direction (Persson 2011). Data collection, processing and evaluation The first
    step towards obtaining irrigation scheduling and yield estimation based on weather
    forecast data is the daily collection from the AEMET web page and the processing
    of these data. Due to the elevated number of data managed for this study (50 weather
    stations during 2013–2014 season; Fig. 1), a specific tool programmed in Delphi
    was developed for the daily data collection and processing, although the use of
    this tool would not be required by regular users of a single weather station.
    Fig. 1 Location of the 50 weather stations used in the study for ETo analysis
    (small black dots), including those considered for irrigation scheduling with
    maize crop analysis (blank circles), over a digital elevation model for the Andalusia
    region (southern Spain) Full size image Online weather forecasts usually include
    numerical daily maximum and minimum air temperatures, wind speed and relative
    humidity estimations, requiring the prior processing of these variables before
    being used for ETo estimation. Thus, in meteorology wind speed values refer to
    a standard height of 10 m (Allen et al. 1998) so that the wind values provided
    had to be converted into 2 m (reference for agro-meteorological studies) using
    the procedure described by Allen et al. (1998). For sky cover, AEMET provides
    daily non-numerical forecasts such as “Cloudy”, “Mostly Cloudy”, “Partly Sunny”,
    “Mostly Sunny” or “Sunny”. These non-numerical sky cover forecasts were converted
    into numerical solar radiation values using conversion codes: dense cloud cover,
    100 % cloud cover, for “Cloudy”; 75–87.5 % for “Mostly Cloudy”; 50–62.5 % for
    “Partly Sunny”; 25 % for “Mostly Sunny”; and clear sky, 0 % cloud cover, for “Sunny”
    forecast (AEMET 2014). Taking the clear-sky radiation based on latitude and day
    of year (Allen et al. 1998) and assuming 35 % of clear-sky radiation for “Cloudy”
    conditions and 100 % of clear-sky radiation for “Sunny”, the value of solar radiation
    for any forecast period and location was linearly interpolated with the percentage
    of cloud cover. The indicated percentages are based on the analysis of data provided
    by the Agroclimatic Information Network of Andalusia (Red de Información Agroclimática
    de Andalucía, RIA; RIA 2015) for cloudy days, and coincide with the values provided
    by Allen et al. (1998) for dense cloud cover and clear sky. With the weather data
    (forecast by AEMET and measured by the RIA) ready, the following step was the
    consideration of several approaches for ETo estimation (“Approaches for ETo estimation”
    section), constituting the base for the irrigation scheduling and yield estimation
    determined with the AquaCrop model (Steduto et al. 2012). The procedure for the
    development of the irrigation schedules and yield estimation is described in “AquaCrop
    model” section. The methodology for testing the results obtained with the new
    approach using weather forecast data (weather data, ETo, irrigation schedules
    and yield estimations) was based on comparison with weather data measured by RIA,
    ETo based on these measured weather data and irrigation schedules and simulated
    yield based on these ETo values, respectively. For these comparisons, the last
    step consisted of the analysis of averaged values, root-mean-square error (RMSE),
    relative root-mean-square error (rRMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient
    of determination (R 2) and Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r). Figure 2 summarises
    the procedures considered in the study, from data collection to evaluation results,
    showing all the successive steps previously described. Fig. 2 Flow chart of the
    proposed methodology to evaluate the use of weather forecast data for irrigation
    scheduling. Blank rectangles with continuous lines indicate intermediate and final
    results, and blank rectangles with dotted lines and grey rectangles indicate the
    materials and procedures used in the study, respectively Full size image Approaches
    for ETo estimation Penman–Monteith equation (PM-FAO56) Allen et al. (1998) defined
    the standardised Penman–Monteith (PM-FAO56) equation in order to simplify and
    clarify its application (Monteith 1965). This equation for grass reference surface
    and for daily time step was defined as: $${\text{ET}}_{\text{o}} = \frac{{0.408\,\varDelta
    \left( {R_{\text{n}} - G} \right) + \gamma \left( {\frac{900}{{T_{\text{m}} +
    273}}} \right)\,u_{2} \left( {e_{\text{s}} - e_{\text{a}} } \right)}}{{\varDelta
    + \gamma \left( {1 + 0.34u_{2} } \right)}}$$ (1) where ETo is the reference evapotranspiration
    (mm d−1); R n is the net radiation at the crop surface (MJ m−2 d−1); G is the
    soil heat flux (MJ m−2 d−1); Tm is the mean daily air temperature (°C); u 2 is
    the wind speed at a height of 2 m (m s−1); e s is the saturation vapour pressure
    (kPa); e a is the actual vapour pressure (kPa); (e s − e a) is the saturation
    vapour pressure deficit (kPa); Δ is the slope of saturated vapour–pressure curve
    (kPa °C−1); and γ is the psychrometric constant (kPa °C−1). Daily net radiation
    (R n), saturation and actual vapour pressure (e s, e a) as well as other constants
    and parameters were determined as described by Allen et al. (1998) and ASCE-EWRI
    (2005). Numerous authors consider the Penman–Monteith equation to be the benchmark
    for comparison with other equations and methodologies (Gavilán et al. 2006; Er-Raki
    et al. 2010; Espadafor et al. 2011; Cristea et al. 2013; Cammalleri and Ciraolo
    2013; Tabari et al. 2013), and it is recommended by Allen et al. (1998) as the
    reference approach due to its excellent results, especially under semi-arid conditions.
    Hargreaves equation (HAR) and regionally calibrated Hargreaves equation (HC) The
    Hargreaves equation (Hargreaves and Samani 1985; HAR) can be written as: $${\text{ET}}_{\text{o}}
    = \alpha \cdot R_{\text{a}} \cdot \left( {T_{\text{m}} + 17.8} \right)\sqrt {T_{\text{max}
    } - T_{\text{min} } }$$ (2) where α is an empirical coefficient originally set
    to 0.0023 by Hargreaves and Samani (1985), R a is the water equivalent of the
    extraterrestrial radiation (mm d−1) computed according to Allen et al. (1998);
    T max, T min and T m are the daily maximum, minimum and mean air temperatures
    (°C). Gavilán et al. (2006) proposed a regional calibration procedure (HC) for
    semi-arid conditions in southern Spain modifying the α coefficient depending on
    the average daily range air temperature (ΔT) and wind speed for each location.
    Thus, α was set to 0.0027 for windy locations (average wind speed higher than
    1.5 m s−1) with ΔT lower than 12 °C, and set to 0.0021 for non-windy locations
    with ΔT higher than 12 °C. The Hargreaves equation has given excellent results,
    especially for periods of 5 days or more (Hargreaves and Allen 2003), with very
    limited data requirements. After local/regional calibration, the performance was
    improved, obtaining very satisfactory results, reducing the RMSE by around 12
    % (Gavilán et al. 2006), producing a simple and well-adapted approach for ETo
    assessment under semi-arid conditions, which is also applicable with weather forecast
    data (Luo et al. 2014). Advection-revised Makkink equation (MAK-Adv) The use of
    the Makkink equation under semi-arid conditions requires a local calibration process
    (Er-Raki et al. 2010). A new approach for ETo determination based on the Makkink
    equation, called the advection-revised Makkink equation (MAK-Adv), has been developed
    by de Bruin et al. (2012) and validated by Cruz-Blanco et al. (2014a), and reads
    as follows: $${\text{ET}}_{\text{o}} = \frac{1}{\lambda } \cdot \left[ {0.38 +
    0.015 \cdot \left( {T_{\text{m}} - 12} \right)} \right] \cdot R_{\text{s}}$$ (3)
    where R s and T m are solar radiation and mean air temperature, respectively,
    and λ is the latent heat of vaporisation (MJ kg−1). Recently, this approach has
    been used for ETo estimation using remotely sensed data and weather forecast data
    (Cruz-Blanco et al. 2014a; 2015) providing satisfactory results. However, the
    evaluation of this approach exclusively using weather forecast data is still required.
    The Agroclimatic Information Network of Andalusia The Agroclimatic Information
    Network of Andalusia (RIA) is located in the southern Spanish region of Andalusia
    and currently comprises 100 automatic weather stations providing daily ETo values
    and other meteorological data (Gavilán et al. 2006; RIA 2015). Each station is
    equipped with sensors to measure air temperature and relative humidity, solar
    radiation, wind speed and direction and rainfall. For this study, the daily values
    collected from each weather station were checked for validity applying record
    structure data, range, step and persistence, internal and spatial consistency
    tests following the methodology provided by Meek and Hatfield (1994) and Shafer
    et al. (2000). After data quality analyses, half of the available weather stations
    were removed from the original dataset, leaving only 50 weather stations for this
    study (Fig. 1). The 50 locations in the study represent different environments,
    providing an excellent dataset for evaluating the quality of the forecast weather
    data under different weather conditions within a semi-arid region (Fig. 1). Thus,
    for the 2013–2014 season, the average air temperature ranged from 12.6 to 19.6
    °C, relative humidity from 60.7 to 80.9 %, wind speed from 1.3 to 2.7 m s−1, solar
    radiation from 16.4 to 19.5 MJ m−2 d−1, daily reference evapotranspiration from
    3.0 to 4.0 mm d−1 and rainfall from 111 to 789 mm year−1. These conditions cover
    a wide range of climate conditions, which contribute to the value of this study.
    AquaCrop model The AquaCrop model simulates attainable yields for herbaceous crops
    as a function of water consumption under different irrigation regimes (Steduto
    et al. 2012). AquaCrop directly links crop yields to water use and estimates biomass
    production from actual crop transpiration through a normalised water productivity
    parameter, which is the core of the AquaCrop growth engine (Steduto et al. 2012).
    A full description of the conceptual basis and principles of AquaCrop is found
    in Steduto et al. (2012). The model version used in this study is version 4.0.
    The AquaData tool (Lorite et al. 2013) was considered in order to manage the numerous
    executions of the model required. Irrigation scheduling and yield estimation In
    order to evaluate the performance of weather forecast data for irrigation scheduling,
    43 locations in southern Spain were selected to simulate different irrigation
    scheduling strategies for maize crop using the AquaCrop model. The locations selected
    include a wide range of weather conditions (Fig. 1) and were chosen for their
    suitability for maize. The same field characteristics and agronomy practices were
    considered for irrigation modelling in all the locations (Fig. 1): sowing date
    was 19 March; soil texture was silty clay with total available soil water (TAW)
    of 180 mm m−1, soil depth of 1.8 m and null slope. A drip irrigation system was
    used, with a fixed daily irrigation depth of 25 mm. Table 1 shows the four irrigation
    strategies considered (IS-A, IS-B, IS-C and IS-D), varying the initial soil conditions
    and the rules for the irrigation starting time depending on crop phenology, and
    based on the percentage of depleted readily available soil water (RAW), defined
    as the maximum amount of water that a crop can extract from its root zone without
    inducing stomatal closure and reduction in crop transpiration, and calculated
    as the product of TAW by the stomatal conductance closure threshold (equal to
    0.69 for maize; Hsiao et al. 2009). Thus, IS-A and IS-C generated near-optimal
    irrigation scheduling with different soil water at sowing, while IS-B and IS-D
    strategies generated a clearly deficit irrigation during the canopy expansion
    phase (Table 1). Additionally, for each irrigation strategy, two different irrigation
    schedules were considered depending on the weather forecast data acquisition frequency
    (daily and weekly). Daily irrigation scheduling was set up using the PM-FAO56,
    HAR, HC and MAK-Adv approaches, and for weekly irrigation scheduling, two more
    approaches were considered: PM-FAO56 for the first 3 days of the forecast period
    (D0–D2), and HAR and HC for the last days of the forecast period (D3–D6), resulting
    in PM + HAR and PM + HC approaches, respectively. The selection of these periods
    was based on the performance of each approach for each forecast period. Finally,
    the irrigation schedule considered as being a reference one was determined with
    the Penman–Monteith approach using measured data from RIA (PM-RIA). Table 1 Parameters
    for irrigation scheduling strategies for maize crop considered in the study Full
    size table Simulated yield analysis improved the evaluation of the proposed methodology
    as maize yield is directly related to the irrigation water depth and irrigation
    timing carried out by the farmers (Igbadun et al. 2008; Taghavaeian et al. 2014).
    Yield was simulated using the AquaCrop model, previously described in “AquaCrop
    model” section. Results Evaluation of weather forecast data Average mean air temperature
    (T m) measured by RIA for the 50 weather stations (Fig. 1) was equal to 16.8 °C,
    while the average forecast T m ranged from 17.2 to 17.5 °C, depending on the length
    of the forecast (Table 2). Results were equally satisfactory when comparing measured
    and forecast values day by day; the average RMSE increased from 1.61 to 1.80 °C
    and the mean absolute error (MAE) from 1.31 to 1.43 °C, for the same-day (D0)
    and 6-day-ahead (D6) forecast, respectively (Table 2). Extreme RMSE values ranged
    between 1.0 and 2.7 °C (Fig. 3). Coefficient of determination, R 2, between measured
    and forecast values was quite stable within the forecast period with values decreasing
    from 0.95 to 0.94 for D0 to D6, respectively. As factors influencing the quality
    of the T m forecast, high elevation and surrounding slope negatively affected
    the forecast, with Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r, equal to −0.48 correlating
    R 2 and surrounding slope, and r = 0.45 correlating RMSE and elevation, both statistically
    significant (p < 0.001). Table 2 Average values and statistical analysis (using
    R 2 coefficient of determination, RMSE root-mean-square error, and MAE mean absolute
    error) for mean air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and solar radiation
    measured by 50 automated weather stations located in southern Spain (from the
    RIA network) for the 2013–2014 season and obtained from weather forecast data
    by AEMET for different forecast lengths (from D0, the same-day forecast, to D6,
    6 days ahead) Full size table Fig. 3 Box plot with root-mean-square error (RMSE)
    from comparison of measured weather variables by automatic weather stations with
    weather forecast data for each forecast period (from the same day, D0, to 6 days
    ahead, D6) during the 2013–2014 season. Short grey lines inside the box indicate
    average RMSE Full size image Average relative humidity measured for the 50 weather
    stations (Fig. 1) was equal to 67.4 %, while the average forecast value ranged
    from 62.9 to 63.5 % (Table 2), showing a clear underestimation for all forecast
    periods. Average RMSE increased from 10.2 to 11.6 %, and R 2 decreased from 0.71
    to 0.60 with a forecast length of D0 and D6, respectively (Fig. 3; Table 2). Extreme
    RMSE ranged from 7.0 to 18.6 % (Fig. 3). Elevated surrounding slope negatively
    affected the accuracy of relative humidity forecast with r = −0.29 correlating
    R 2 with surrounding slope, and is statistically significant (p < 0.05). Average
    wind speed measured by RIA for the 50 weather stations (Fig. 1) was equal to 1.8
    m s−1, while the average forecast values ranged from 1.8 to 2.2 m s−1, depicting
    accurate average results. However, when daily values were compared, there were
    major differences between measured and forecast values; average RMSE ranged from
    0.8 to 1.2 m s−1, and R 2 from 0.61 to 0.23 (Table 2), according to the forecast
    period. Analysing all the locations, extreme RMSE ranged from 0.5 to 1.8 m s−1
    (Fig. 3), depicting a high variability between locations. Locations with high
    surrounding slope showed less accuracy in the forecast of wind speed, with r =
    0.28 correlating R 2 and surrounding slope, and statistically significant (p <
    0.05). Finally, average solar radiation measured by RIA was equal to 18.1 MJ m−2
    d−1, while the average forecast values ranged from 18.0 to 18.9 MJ m−2 d−1, indicating
    accurate results (Table 2). Similarly, when daily average values were compared,
    average RMSE increased from 3.0 to 3.6 MJ m−2 d−1 and average R 2 decreased from
    0.88 to 0.82 for D0 and D6, respectively (Table 2). With individual analyses of
    the selected locations, extreme RMSE ranged from 2.5 to 4.7 MJ m−2 d−1 (Fig. 3).
    High elevation and surrounding slope negatively affected the solar radiation forecast
    with r = 0.53 correlating R 2 and surrounding slope, and r = 0.45 correlating
    RMSE and elevation, with both correlations being statistically significant (p
    < 0.001). Evaluation of ETo values using weather forecast data Reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) was determined using weather forecast data with the four previously described
    approaches (PM-FAO56, HAR, HC, MAK-Adv) and was compared with values provided
    by the PM-FAO56 approach with measured weather data from RIA (PM-RIA). The average
    daily ETo values with each approach for the 50 weather stations included in the
    study are shown in Table 3. Table 3 Average values and statistical analysis (using
    R 2 coefficient of determination, RMSE root-mean-square error, and MAE mean absolute
    error) for ETo (mm d−1) obtained from measured weather data by 50 automated weather
    stations located in southern Spain for the 2013–2014 season with PM-FAO56 approach
    (PM-RIA) and determined by PM-FAO56, HAR, MAK-Adv and HC approaches using weather
    forecast data for different forecast lengths (from D0, the same-day forecast,
    to D6, 6 days ahead) Full size table Average daily ETo with measured data from
    RIA (PM-RIA) was equal to 3.54 mm d−1, while the average ETo with the PM-FAO56
    approach using weather forecast data ranged from 3.45 to 3.67 mm d−1, depending
    on the forecast period, revealing a highly accurate ETo estimation (Table 3).
    Average RMSE increased from 0.65 to 0.83 mm d−1, rRMSE increased from 18.3 to
    23.6 %, and R 2 decreased from 0.91 to 0.85 for D0 and D6, respectively (Table
    3). Analysing each location individually, the PM-FAO56 provided the best results
    for the D0 period, with RMSE ranging from 0.48 to 0.88 mm d−1 (Figs. 4, 5a). However,
    for D6, PM-FAO56 estimates were mediocre (RMSE ranged from 0.69 to 1.09 mm d−1),
    with this approach providing the worst estimates for around half of the locations
    (Fig. 5b). These results show a major deterioration in the ETo estimates using
    the PM-FAO56 approach as the length of the forecast increases, especially from
    D3 to D6. This was caused by the poor forecast performance of relative humidity
    and wind speed, key components in the ETo estimation with the PM-FAO56 approach,
    during the D3–D6 period (Table 2; Fig. 3). Fig. 4 Box plot with root-mean-square
    error (RMSE; mm d−1) from comparison of ETo values from measured weather data
    by automated weather stations (PM-RIA) with ETo from weather forecast data (using
    PM-FAO56, MAK-Adv, HAR and HC approaches) for each forecast period (from the same
    day, D0, to 6 days ahead, D6) during the 2013–2014 season. Short grey lines inside
    the box indicate average RMSE Full size image Fig. 5 Curves of cumulative frequency
    of root-mean-square error (RMSE; mm d−1) from comparison of ETo values based on
    measured weather data with ETo based on same-day forecasts (D0; a), and on 6-day-ahead
    forecast weather data (D6; b), using four ETo estimation approaches (PM-FAO56,
    HAR, MAK-Adv and HC) during the 2013–2014 season Full size image Finally, analysing
    the performance of the ETo estimation with PM-FAO56 per season, the most accurate
    ETo estimations were provided in summer, while the worst were in winter (e.g.
    for D0 rRMSE was equal to 12.8 and 27.4 % for summer and winter seasons, respectively).
    This is particularly significant because spring and summer seasons are the critical
    periods for crop modelling as the irrigation requirements are higher and better
    water management is required. Average daily ETo estimations with the Hargreaves
    approach (HAR) using weather forecast data ranged from 3.38 to 3.40 mm d−1, showing
    a clear underestimation compared with ETo estimated with PM-RIA (Table 3). However,
    contrary to PM-FAO56, there was a high temporal stability in the estimations as
    the forecast length increased (Table 3): average RMSE increased from 0.73 to 0.77
    mm d−1, rRMSE increased from 20.7 to 21.6 %, and R 2 decreased from 0.89 to 0.88
    for D0 and D6, respectively (Table 3). In addition, analysing each location for
    D0, RMSE values ranged from 0.54 to 1.46 mm d−1, and for D6, from 0.58 to 1.47
    mm d−1 (Figs. 4, 5). The results showed a very stable ETo estimation with the
    HAR approach from D0 to D6 due to the fact that wind speed and relative humidity
    data were not required to calculate ETo, and the behaviour of the air temperature
    was very constant throughout all forecast periods (Fig. 3). This temporal stability
    resulted in a better ETo estimation performance with HAR than with PM-FAO56 approach
    for D3, D4, D5 and D6 (Table 3). Maximum underestimations with the HAR approach
    (Fig. 5) were associated with coastal locations with high wind speed. Thus, high
    wind speed and short distance to the sea generated larger errors in ETo estimation
    with the HAR approach (r = 0.53 correlating RMSE with wind speed, and r = 0.52
    correlating R 2 with distance to the sea). Average performance of the regionally
    calibrated Hargreaves approach (HC) was very similar to the HAR approach (Table
    3). However, HC significantly improved the ETo assessment in a few locations (Fig.
    5), eliminating the average underestimation determined with the HAR approach (Table
    3), but performed slightly worse than the HAR approach for the rest of the stations
    (Fig. 5). Thus, average ETo with HC ranged from 3.52 to 3.55 mm d−1, with similar
    statistics to those with HAR (Table 3). Analysing the results for D6, the HAR
    and HC approaches performed best for around 80 % of the locations (Fig. 5b). Seasonally,
    as for PM-FAO56, the most accurate ETo estimations were produced in summer using
    HAR and HC, with a better performance than PM-FAO56 for D3–D6 forecast periods
    (e.g. for D6 with PM-FAO56 during the summer rRMSE was 18.6 % and for HAR and
    HC around 15.3 %). Finally, average ETo using the MAK-Adv approach with weather
    forecast data ranged from 3.58 to 3.79 mm d−1, indicating a clear overestimation
    compared with ETo estimates obtained with PM-RIA (Table 3). Average RMSE varied
    from 0.77 to 0.84 mm d−1, rRMSE from 21.6 to 23.6 %, and average R 2 decreased
    from 0.89 to 0.86 for D0 and D6, respectively (Table 3)—the worst performance
    of the approaches analysed. Analysing each location, RMSE values for D0 ranged
    from 0.56 to 1.16 mm d−1 and for D6, from 0.68 to 1.21 mm d−1 (Figs. 4, 5). Impact
    of the use of weather forecast data on irrigation scheduling Irrigation water
    depth Based on ETo values estimated in “Evaluation of ETo values using weather
    forecast data” section, irrigation scheduling for maize crop in 43 locations was
    carried out with four irrigation strategies (IS-A, IS-B, IS-C, IS-D; Table 1).
    The best performing approaches for ETo assessment with weather forecast data were
    those that provided more accurate irrigation schedules compared to those originated
    with PM-RIA. Daily irrigation scheduling based on ETo using PM-FAO56 with weather
    forecast data for the same-day (D0 forecast level) provided the most similar schedules
    to those generated with PM-RIA, with an average difference of 1.5 % (Fig. 6),
    demonstrating the PM-FAO56 as the best approach to be used for daily irrigation
    scheduling. However, with the HAR approach, the underestimation in ETo previously
    described (Table 3) produced systematic underestimations in irrigation water depth
    (Fig. 6), with average underestimations of around 10 %, which were improved when
    the HC approach was used, reducing these differences to 3.5 %. Equally, the ETo
    overestimation using the MAK-Adv approach (Table 3) generated similar overestimations
    in irrigation water depth (around 11 %). The differences found in irrigation water
    depth using HAR and MAK-Adv approaches with PM-RIA were statistically significant
    (p < 0.05; Fig. 6). This pattern was similar for all the irrigation strategies
    considered (Fig. 6). Thus, for example, for IS-C, rRMSE with PM-FAO56 was equal
    to 7.5 %, while with HAR, HC and MAK-Adv, the rRMSE were 13.6, 12.7 and 11.6 %,
    respectively. Taking the 43 analysed locations individually, PM-FAO56 confirmed
    the satisfactory performance for irrigation scheduling compared to HAR and HC
    approaches. For IS-C, PM-FAO56 provided accurate irrigation schedules, with less
    than 10 % difference in the irrigation water depth for 74 % of the locations,
    while with HAR and HC the irrigation schedules were adequate for only 58 and 60
    % of the locations, respectively. Also for IS-C, considering only locations in
    the two extreme deciles, PM-FAO56 generated the lowest under- and overestimations
    (average values were equal to 12 and 13 %, respectively), HAR and HC approaches
    provided the largest underestimations (32 and 23 %, respectively), and MAK-Adv
    and HC the largest overestimations (23 and 21 %, respectively). Fig. 6 Average
    irrigation water depth (mm) for 43 locations with maize crop during the 2013–2014
    season calculated by the AquaCrop model with ETo values based on measured weather
    data (PM-RIA) and on weather forecast data (using PM-FAO56, HAR, HC, MAK-Adv,
    PM + HAR and PM + HC approaches for ETo estimation) at the daily and weekly scale,
    and under four irrigation strategies (IS-A, IS-B, IS-C, IS-D). The bars represent
    the standard deviation of the mean. Asterisks indicates statistically significant
    differences compared with PM-RIA Full size image For weekly irrigation scheduling
    based on weather forecast from the same day (D0) to 6 days ahead (D6), PM-FAO56
    generated overestimations of around 4.4 % in the recommended irrigation water
    depth compared with the schedules based on PM-RIA, with the differences being
    statistically significant for IS-A and IS-D (Fig. 6). These overestimations were
    caused by that in ETo with the PM-FAO56 approach for some forecast periods (Table
    3). The HAR approach systematically triggered underestimations for all the irrigation
    strategies that HC improved (average differences compared with schedules based
    on PM-RIA were reduced from 5.8 % with HAR to 1.2 % using HC), and the MAK-Adv
    approach generated overestimations for all the irrigation strategies (10.7 %;
    Fig. 6). Finally, irrigation schedules based on PM + HAR and PM + HC achieved
    satisfactory results (average differences were equal to 0.9 and 4.6 %, respectively).
    The same performance for these approaches was found by analysing rRMSE values;
    for example, for IS-C the lowest values were found for PM-FAO56, PM + HAR and
    PM + HC with rRMSE equal to 7.2, 8.4 and 8.9 %, respectively. Figure 7a shows
    the cumulative frequency of differences in irrigation water depth generated by
    different ETo approaches compared with PM-RIA schedules, for IS-C strategy. For
    70 % of the locations, HAR generated irrigation water depth underestimations,
    while the MAK-Adv approach overestimated the irrigation needs in almost 80 % of
    the locations (Fig. 7a). The percentage of locations with adequate schedules (with
    differences in irrigation water depth of less than 10 % compared with PM-RIA)
    were 66, 70 and 66 % for PM-FAO56, PM + HAR and PM + HC, respectively (Fig. 7a),
    reflecting the high performance of these approaches. Fig. 7 Curves of cumulative
    frequency of differences (in %) between (a) irrigation water depth recommended
    for 43 locations cultivated with maize during the 2013–2014 season with a near-optimal
    irrigation strategy (IS-C) based on measured weather data (PM-RIA) and on 6-day-ahead
    weather forecast data, with six ETo estimation approaches (PM-FAO56, HAR, HC,
    MAK-Adv, PM + HAR and PM + HC); and (b) simulated yields obtained from irrigation
    scheduling based on measured and weather forecast data using the aforementioned
    approaches for ETo estimation Full size image Yield Average maize yield estimates
    using schedules based on weather forecast data were very similar to those simulated
    using schedules based on PM-RIA (Fig. 8). Thus, considering the near-optimal irrigation
    strategy (IS-C; Table 1) estimated yield with PM-RIA was 13.1 t ha−1, and considering
    the irrigation scheduling based on PM-FAO56, simulated yield varied from 13.0
    to 13.1 t ha−1 for daily and weekly scheduling, respectively. For the HAR approach,
    due to the clear underestimation in the irrigation water depth (Table 3), simulated
    yield was underestimated (12.1 and 12.4 t ha−1 for daily and weekly scheduling,
    respectively). In contrast, MAK-Adv overestimated irrigation water depth (Table
    3) and the simulated yield was equal to 13.3 t ha−1, a slightly higher yield value
    than for PM-RIA due to the elimination of minor stresses during the canopy expansion
    phase generated with IS-C irrigation strategy. The calibrated Hargreaves equation
    (HC) obtained a simulated yield of around 12.8 t ha−1, PM + HAR 13.0 t ha−1 and
    PM + HC 13.1 t ha−1 (Fig. 8). Similar results were obtained for the other irrigation
    strategies (Fig. 8), and only daily schedules based on the HC approach and daily
    and weekly schedules based on HAR produced statistically significant differences
    in yield (Fig. 8). Fig. 8 Average estimated yields (t ha−1) for 43 locations with
    maize crop during 2013–2014 season calculated by the AquaCrop model using irrigation
    scheduling based on measured weather data (PM-RIA) and on weather forecast data
    (using PM-FAO56, HAR, HC, MAK-Adv, PM + HAR and PM + HC approaches for ETo estimation)
    for daily and weekly scale, under (a) near-optimal irrigation strategy (IS-C)
    and (b) deficit irrigation strategy (IS-D). The bars represent the standard deviation
    of the mean. Asterisks indicates statistically significant differences compared
    to PM-RIA Full size image Analysing the simulated yield for each location individually,
    the results were similar: for IS-C, PM-FAO56, MAK-Adv, PM + HAR and PM + HC approaches
    provided the most accurate results, with an rRMSE of below 5 %. In contrast, using
    irrigation scheduling based on the HAR approach gave rRMSE values of 13.1 and
    9.8 %, for daily and weekly scheduling, respectively. Figure 7b describes the
    yield distribution for IS-C with weekly scheduling. With schedules based on PM-FAO56,
    yield was reduced in 29 % of locations, with small average reductions for the
    locations in the last decile (around 12 and 6 % for daily and weekly schedules,
    respectively). Similar reductions were produced with PM + HAR and PM + HC. However,
    HAR and HC generated reduced yield compared with PM-RIA in 57 and 36 % of the
    locations, respectively (Fig. 7b), with an average yield reduction in locations
    in the last decile of 25 and 18 %, respectively. With a deficit irrigation strategy
    (IS-D; Table 1), the simulated yield was clearly affected by the differences in
    irrigation timing caused by the use of irrigation schedules based on weather forecast
    data (Fig. 8b). Thus, those approaches that underestimated the irrigation water
    depth (Fig. 6) produced severe reductions in simulated yield (Fig. 8b). Accordingly,
    regarding daily schedules, the HAR and HC approaches caused average yield reductions
    of 17 and 11 %, respectively, which were statistically significant compared with
    the results obtained with PM-RIA. On the other hand, the lowest reductions in
    yield were found for PM-FAO56, MAK-Adv and PM + HC approaches. Discussion The
    AEMET service, based on HIRLAM + ECMWF methodology, provided very satisfactory
    weather forecast data compared with measured data by the RIA for mean air temperature
    (RMSE = 1.68 °C and R 2 = 0.95), relative humidity (RMSE = 10.8 % and R 2 = 0.66)
    and solar radiation (RMSE = 3.28 MJ m2 d−1 and R 2 = 0.86), with the differences
    increasing as the forecast length increased. Previous studies using alternative
    forecast methodologies produced a similar performance. For T m forecast, Cruz-Blanco
    et al. (2014a) used ECMWF data obtaining satisfactory results (average RMSD =
    1.53 °C, with R 2 equal to 0.96). Silva et al. (2010) reported slightly worse
    results using the MM5 model (R 2 ranging between 0.84 and 0.90), and Er-Raki et
    al. (2010), using the numerical weather prediction model ALADIN, obtained R 2
    values ranging from 0.94 and 0.96 and RMSE values between 2.2 and 2.7 °C. The
    decrease in forecast accuracy as the forecast length increased, detected with
    HIRLAM + ECMWF, was also reported by Luo et al. (2014) and Perera et al. (2014).
    For relative humidity, previous studies provided slightly better results than
    those obtained in the current study. Cai et al. (2007) obtained R 2 = 0.85 for
    actual vapour pressure, and Perera et al. (2014) determined R 2 values of over
    0.77 for dew point temperature. Finally, for solar radiation, previous studies
    also produced satisfactory results as Perera et al. (2014), who reported RMSE
    values ranging between 2.8 and 7.4 MJ m−2 d−1. Wind speed forecast provided by
    HIRLAM + ECMWF performed worse than that of the other variables (RMSE = 1.03 m
    s−1 and R 2 = 0.39), similar to the results reported by Er-Raki et al. (2010)
    using the ALADIN model (R2 ranged between 0.16 and 0.42). However, Cai et al.
    (2007) and Perera et al. (2014) obtained accurate estimations with R 2 above 0.80
    and ranging between 0.64 and 0.97, respectively. These results, compared with
    other forecast methodologies, confirm the accurate forecast provided by HIRLAM
    + ECMWF, as well as some weaknesses of the approach, mainly related to wind speed
    estimation. This study is a good starting point for further analysis of irrigation,
    water–heat stresses, wildfire alerts, solar and wind energy applications or warnings
    of extreme weather events, using HIRLAM + ECMWF or other weather forecast approaches.
    In spite of the very satisfactory results obtained with HIRLAM + ECMWF, for specific
    locations, variables (mainly wind speed and relative humidity) and forecast periods,
    some divergences between forecast and measured data were detected (Fig. 3; Table
    2). Although the nearest location with available weather forecast data was chosen
    for each RIA station considered, weather conditions may have differed between
    the two locations due to the topography and the different spatial resolution (point
    measurement for weather stations vs. aggregated weather forecast data within about
    5 km2). Thus, although air temperature was adjusted with respect to the elevation
    using the factor 0.0067 °C m−1 provided by de Bruin et al. (2010), it was not
    possible to adjust other weather variables such as relative humidity or wind speed.
    Other divergences between forecast and measured data stem from the elevated uncertainty
    in the estimation of wind speed and relative humidity by the weather models (Rockel
    and Woth 2007), and the higher spatial variability of these variables compared
    with air temperature and solar radiation. Thus, the surrounding slope influenced
    the quality of the weather forecast, and so locations with large variations in
    physical and climate conditions (such as coastal areas, mountainous areas and/or
    areas with heterogeneous topography) showed larger errors in the weather variables
    forecast. As with the weather variables, the performance of the different approaches
    for ETo estimation was very satisfactory and varied according to the forecast
    period and the approach considered (Table 3; Figs. 4, 5). The Penman–Monteith
    equation (PM-FAO56) provided the best performance for the short-term forecast
    (D0; RMSE = 0.65 mm d−1 and R 2 = 0.91; Table 3), but its performance worsened
    with long-term forecasts (D6; RMSE = 0.83 mm d−1 and R 2 = 0.85; Table 3). Other
    authors have also considered the PM-FAO56 approach with weather forecast data:
    Cai et al. (2007) obtained R 2 values of between 0.91 and 0.98; Silva et al. (2010)
    found high variability in the performance between locations, with R 2 values ranging
    between 0.35 and 0.77, and Perera et al. (2014) obtained R 2 values of above 0.8
    for ETo for 1-day-ahead forecasts but significantly lower ones (of around 0.4)
    for 9-day-ahead forecasts. The Hargreaves approach (HAR) underestimated ETo (3.40
    vs. 3.54 mm d−1; Table 3), as in Gavilán et al. (2006) or Er-Raki et al. (2010),
    who detected clear ETo underestimations with the HAR approach caused by the omission
    of the aerodynamic component of the ETo. This limitation was solved using the
    HC approach (ETo = 3.52 mm d−1, RMSE = 0.76 mm d−1 and R 2 = 0.88, for D6; Table
    3). Xu et al. (2012) and Luo et al. (2014) also used a modified HAR approach considering
    weather forecast data and obtained RMSE values of around 0.79 mm d−1. Torres et
    al. (2011) used statistical learning machines and limited climate information
    to obtain satisfactory results for a 1-day-ahead forecast (RMSE = 0.65 mm d−1)
    but with a worse performance for 7-day-ahead forecast (RMSE around 0.88 mm d−1).
    Finally, the MAK-Adv approach overestimated ETo assessment (3.58 mm d−1 with RMSE
    = 0.84 mm d−1, for D6; Table 3) with a poorer performance than that reported by
    Cruz-Blanco et al. (2015), which combined weather forecast and remotely sensed
    data (solar radiation) with the MAK-Adv approach, thus obtaining accurate results
    for ETo estimation (RMSE = 0.69 mm d−1). These ETo values provided the basis for
    irrigation scheduling; subsequently, for daily scheduling using weather forecast
    data, the PM-FAO56 approach provided excellent results (Figs. 6, 7 , 8) and is
    recommended. However, for weekly scheduling, PM-FAO56 generated significant errors
    in ETo estimation with forecasts from 3 to 4 days ahead (Table 3), generating
    statistically significant overestimations in the recommended irrigation water
    depth for some irrigation strategies (Fig. 6). Therefore, for weekly scheduling,
    the combination of PM-FAO56 for the short-term forecast (D0–D2), and HAR or HC
    for subsequent forecast lengths (D3–D6) is recommended (PM + HAR and PM + HC approaches).
    The use of the HAR or HC approach will depend on wind conditions in the analysed
    area. Thus, the use of the HC approach is recommended for ETo estimation in D3–D6
    forecast periods for those locations with high wind speed (u > 1.5 m s−1), while
    for other locations, HAR performs best (Fig. 5). With deficit irrigation strategies,
    the impact of non-specific irrigation schedules is greater than with optimal or
    near-optimal strategies; simulated yield decreased and yield variability between
    locations increased (Fig. 8). Here, the irrigation scheduling must be carried
    out carefully in order to avoid a severe impact on yield. Comparing PM + HAR and
    PM + HC schedules, the latter recommended a slightly higher irrigation water depth,
    resulting in less severe reductions in yield: average yield reduction in the locations
    situated in the last quartile was 13.6 and 7.2 % for PM + HAR and PM + HC, respectively.
    For these reasons, PM + HC is recommended when weekly deficit irrigation strategies
    are carried out so that the potential negative impact on yield is minimised. Previous
    studies combining ETo estimated with forecast weather data and irrigation scheduling
    are scarce. Cai et al. (2011) combined rainfall forecast with an optimisation
    method for irrigation scheduling obtaining water savings between 11 and 27 %,
    Mishra et al. (2013) produced similar water savings by integrating rainfall forecasts
    and simulation models, and Hejazi et al. (2014) reported the need to reduce the
    forecast uncertainty in order to improve the irrigation assessment. Cabelguenne
    et al. (1997) and Venalainen et al. (2005) highlighted the utility of weather
    forecast data for accurate soil moisture estimations, the basis for irrigation
    scheduling, indicating the necessity of accurate weather forecasts. Finally, Cruz-Blanco
    et al. (2014b) analysed the impact of the use of remotely sensed data (solar radiation)
    and weather forecast data provided by ECMWF on irrigation scheduling, and obtained
    rRMSE values equal to 7.2 % when simulated irrigation water depths were compared
    with those generated using measured data. Although these results were excellent,
    access to the required information was much more difficult than for the proposed
    methodology (free and easily accessible from the web). The accurate results produced
    by the proposed methodology (Figs. 6, 8) satisfy the original objectives, demonstrating
    that it is possible to develop accurate irrigation scheduling using weather forecast
    data. However, further studies on methodologies other than HIRLAM + ECMWF are
    still required. Equally, the integration of the proposed methodology (using ETo)
    with rainfall forecast would generate a complete tool for irrigation scheduling.
    However, these rainfall forecasts still perform worse than for ETo (Venalainen
    et al. 2005) due to the great spatial variability. Consequently, advances in rainfall,
    wind speed and relative humidity forecasts must be promoted in the future, especially
    for long-term forecasts. Conclusions The use of weather forecast data for ETo
    estimation provided accurate results compared with ETo values from measured weather
    data; at daily scale the Penman–Monteith approach (PM-FAO56) provided the best
    results (RMSE = 0.65 mm d−1; rRMSE = 18.3 %; R 2 = 0.91), while at weekly scale,
    HAR and HC approaches achieved the best performance (RMSE = 0.76 mm d−1; rRMSE
    = 21.6 %; R 2 = 0.88). Their performance was similar in the development of irrigation
    scheduling, showing minor differences from schedules based on measured weather
    data from automatic weather stations. Thus, daily scheduling based on PM-FAO56
    provided the best results (differences of around 1.5 % and rRMSE = 8.6 %), while
    weekly scheduling based on PM-FAO56 and HAR/HC approaches achieved the best performance
    (differences of 0.9 % and rRMSE = 11 %). Thanks to the excellent results obtained
    with the proposed methodology, the ease of access to the required information
    for farmers and technicians, and the site-specific data provided by the public
    and private meteorological services around the world, it emerges as an excellent
    alternative to the traditional weather station networks. Its use by farmers and
    technicians could therefore significantly contribute to improvements in water
    management at field and irrigation district level, facilitating the development
    of site-specific irrigation schedules with similar results to those obtained from
    automatic weather stations located in the vicinity of the field analysed, but
    without their installation and maintenance costs. The development of these site-specific
    irrigation schedules will help prevent the crop water stress and over irrigation
    caused by the use of weather data from non-representative or incorrectly located/maintained
    weather stations. Irrigation scheduling can then be modified accordingly by adjusting
    irrigation timing and irrigation water depth; thus improving irrigation efficiency
    and water savings at field scale. References AEMET (2014) Predicción meteorológica.

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Water is becoming scarcer. The unmonitored control
    and the extensive use of fossil fuel in water-table pumping for irrigation exacerbate
    global warming and harm the environment. Along with the rapid population growth
    and the concomitant increase in the demand for food, optimal usage of water-table
    and energy is becoming a must and indispensable for sustainable agriculture. In
    this context, Smart Agriculture (SA) is emerging as a promising field that leverages
    ICT (Information and Communication Technology) to optimize resources’ usage while
    enhancing crops’ yields. In this paper, we present an integral SA solution that
    leverages cost-effectiveness . Commercial solutions are costly and thus become
    impossible to adopt by small and medium farmers. Our solution revolves around
    three main axes: 1. Smart Water Metering promotes optimal usage and conservation
    of water-table (a.k.a., groundwater) via real-time data collection and monitoring
    using a Cloud-based IoT (Internet of Things) system; 2. Renewable-Energy integration
    promotes energy-efficient agriculture by reducing reliance on fossil fuels in
    water-table pumping, and 3. Smart Irrigation to promote good crops quality and
    quantity without harming the soil and the water-table ecosystems. Our solution
    has been deployed and tested in a real-world Smart Farm testbed. The results have
    shown that the adoption of our SA system reduces the amount of water consumption
    (with a traditional irrigation system) up to 71.8%. Finally, our solution is open-source
    and can be easily adopted and adapted by other researchers to promote the setting
    of a dedicated Cloud-based platform for water-table usage, especially in arid
    and sub-Saharan countries. IoT Based Smart Agriculture: Testbed General Architecture.

    I. Introduction Water is the basis and the main engine of life on earth. Humans
    use water for industrial purposes, sanitation, and irrigation. In the last decades,
    the annual water withdrawal ranged between 11 billion and 15 billion cubic meters
    per year, out of which 69 % is used in agriculture [1]. Unfortunately, most of
    this water is wasted because of inadequate irrigation control systems. As in most
    arid and sub-Saharan countries, agriculture in Morocco is the largest consumer
    of fresh water, especially after launching the Green Plan program in April 2008
    [2]. This program aims to promote agriculture as an efficient sector capable of
    advancing the economy, fighting poverty, and preserving many people in rural areas
    efficiently and sustainably. Within the framework of this program, the government
    provided many facilities and assistance to farmers and investors in irrigated
    agriculture to provide enough basic food for local consumption and export promotion
    programs. However, the level of Smart Agriculture penetration in Morocco remains
    very low. In addition, investors in the irrigated agricultural projects started
    sounding alarms of severe depletion of groundwater on the horizon [3] and the
    lack of a cost-effective real-time data collection in irrigation systems in farming
    fields that will enable them to benefit from the advanced modern technologies.
    There is a need to develop a cost-effective and sustainable data acquisition system
    for smart agriculture applications in sub-Saharan fields for sustainable, efficient,
    and smart agriculture. The system should use renewable energy and the latest Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) that can sustain the aridity of an agricultural
    environment. When combined with reasonable control and management and data analytics,
    the data acquisition system can play an essential role in increasing agricultural
    productivity and improving the quality of crops. Most importantly, unlike the
    traditional methods of irrigated agriculture that widely use underground water
    reservoirs and resort to fossil fuels, especially gas, as a source of energy.
    Smart agriculture (SA) exploits modern management systems to rationalize water
    consumption and adopt renewable energies as a source of energy, thus rendering
    the agricultural sector eco-friendly. In this paper, we are presenting an integral
    and cost-effective SA solution. When approached from a Cyber-Physical System (CPS)
    perspective [4], our solution relies on four main ICTs: 1. A Wireless Sensors
    Network (WSNs) monitor, in real-time, the plant environmental conditions, e.g.,
    weather and soil conditions, 2. A Wireless Actuators Network (WAN) acts upon electric
    appliances such as water pumps and light bulbs, 3. A Cloud-based IoT platform
    for real-time data storage, processing, and visualization; and 4. A Fuzzy Logic
    Control module decides on monitoring irrigation durations based on the real-time
    acquired differences between desired and ambient soil moisture. We deployed our
    open-source software solution for data acquisition, actuation, and control. We
    built our cost-effective sensors and actuators using off-the-shelf cheap nano-Arduinos.
    Finally, we leveraged an existing free Cloud-based IoT platform, e.g., NodeRED
    [5]. In this paper, and by considering optimal water-ground usage, renewable energy
    integration, and open-source ICT-based smart irrigation, we aim to contribute
    towards the smooth penetration of Smart Agriculture into underprivileged sub-Saharan
    countries. We are further envisioning, through this work, to set a solid cornerstone
    for establishing a dedicated Cloud-based and HPC (High-Performance Computing)
    platform [6] to collect real-time data about water-table usage. This data, which
    falls under the big data category, as it bears the big data 3Vs (Volume, Velocity,
    and Variety) [7], and along with appropriate Big Data Analytics tools, will tremendously
    assist in promoting eco-friendly smart agriculture. The paper contributions are
    as follows: We present a real-world, cost-effective, and easy-to-deploy general
    architecture for a Smart Farm testbed that the research community can easily adopt
    and adapt for further testing and improvement. We detail how to use open-source
    software and leverage Cloud Computing for wireless sensor data storage and processing.
    We demonstrate the integration of our developed cost-effective wireless sensors
    and actuators using off-the-shelf hardware in a real-world case study. We show
    how integrating renewable energy into smart farms paves the path towards adopting
    our solution in off-grid sites, e.g., arid and sub-Saharan areas. We prove that
    by adopting fuzzy logic into smart drip irrigation, our system reduces water consumption
    by up to 71.8%, thus contributing to sustainable water-table usage. The rest of
    the paper is organized as follows. The background is presented in Section 2, and
    the related work is overviewed in Section 3. The general system architecture and
    design are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss the results and evaluate
    the findings. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude and present our future work.
    SECTION II. Background A. Smart Agriculture as a Cyber-Physical System The rapid
    technological developments of the Internet of Things (IoT), WSN, and Embedded
    Systems in recent years have enabled the development of modern systems and applications
    that have completely changed our lives. CPSs are among the most powerful of these
    modern systems, and Smart Agriculture is a CPS. CPS refers to systems that ideally
    integrate software and hardware components to perform precise tasks. A formal
    definition states: “Cyber-Physical System is defined as transformative technologies
    for managing interconnected systems between its physical assets and computational
    capabilities” [8]. As shown in Fig. 1, the general CPS architecture combines embedded
    computing, wireless sensors, and actuators networks to monitor and control the
    physical environment and give it the ability to adapt itself to new conditions
    in real-time through feedback loops. Its ability to combine different technologies
    and make them integrated has made CPS a crucial technological revolution that
    brings innovation to multiple industries by replacing traditional processes in
    many application areas with new and modern ones. FIGURE 1. Cyber-physical systems
    (CPS) general architecture. Show All Smart agriculture is one of the most promising
    CPS applications that will positively affect human life. SA can preserve a significant
    amount of water and energy through its ability to monitor multiple resources such
    as irrigation and solar energy systems. As a CPS, it replaces the traditional
    agricultural system with a smart and modern one that provides accurate agricultural
    management by collecting and processing data related to the plant, the weather,
    and the soil, in real-time mode and using precise control methods. The interaction
    of the main components of SA as a closed-loop control CPS is depicted in Fig.
    2. This figure includes the field, the control center, the Wireless Sensors and
    Actuators Network (WSAN), and the drip irrigation system. FIGURE 2. Smart farm
    as a closed CPS (Cyber physical system). Show All B. Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) The rapid developments in wireless communication technologies, micro-electromechanical
    systems, and digital electronics have given rise to WSN [9]–[11]. The latter consists
    of sensor nodes that monitor the agricultural environment needed data, such as
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, motion, and pressure, and send through a
    gateway towards the data processing server(s). This data can be hosted locally
    or remotely in the Cloud [12]. Once processed and analyzed, it becomes information
    that can be visualized (e.g., using plots and charts) and sent to the control
    unit to react upon and take actions, e.g., switching On/Off water pumps and drip
    irrigation motors. One of the main advantages of WSN is that it reduces the cost
    of wiring and makes it practical and easy. According to some studies, WSN will
    have the ability to eliminate from 20% to 80% of the installation costs [13].
    The general structure of a wireless sensor node is depicted in Fig. 3 and consists
    of four units [14]: The Sensing Unit consists of sensor modules that sample the
    environmental conditions of the deployment field. The Processing Unit consists
    of a microcontroller with a CPU and memory to run code and process the data. The
    Transmission Unit: This unit modulates digital data and sends it wirelessly. Several
    wireless technologies are adopted for this unit. In our deployment, we are using
    ZigBee [15]. The power Supply Unit is the Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery that powers
    the wireless sensor node. FIGURE 3. General architecture of a wireless sensor
    node. Show All C. Internet of Things (IoT) With the rapid advancement in ICT,
    today’s era has left the concept of the internet far behind, and a new concept
    has emerged: the IoT. There are many definitions of IoT set by many organizations
    working globally. ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector) has defined IoT as “Global infrastructure for Information
    Society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual)
    things based on existing and evolving, interoperable information and communication
    technologies” [13]. [16] defines IoT as a technology that combines the internet
    and existing resources to control devices. This control is ensured by using various
    IoT communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Long-Range (Lora), Zensys
    Wave (Z-Wave), SigFox, Wi-Fi, GPRS, 4G, and 5G [17]. Even though IoT is mainly
    about connecting and automating things (objects) over the internet, human intervention
    gives this concept the possibility of existence. The interrelationship between
    the three sections that make up the IoT is illustrated in Fig. 4. FIGURE 4. Tri-sectional
    relationship between the three components of IoT. Show All IoT is witnessing continuous
    progress and has a promising future. Statistics indicate that the number of IoT-connected
    devices is expected to rise to 43 billion devices by 2023 [18]. Furthermore, the
    total IoT market worldwide was worth around \\(389 billion in 2020, and it is
    expected to rise to more than one trillion US dollars in 2030 [19]. This optimistic
    future vision reinforces the necessity to develop newer communication technologies
    that enable the synchronization of the largest possible number of new devices
    with sensors over the internet. Fig. 5 shows the persistent increase in connected
    devices/things over the internet for ten years (2015-2025) [20]. FIGURE 5. IoT
    connected devices in 2015-2025. Show All Given that IoT is a fertile research
    area that both the academic and industry sectors are interested in, all indications
    show an urge to deploy novel technologies to cope with the rapid increase in IoT
    deployment and adoption. In this regard, 5G and its Massive Machine Type Communication
    (mMTC) component is excellent news for the IoT market, and it will have a significant
    impact on it [19]. Through mMTC, 5G networks will inevitably improve the reliability
    and performance of many vital ICT-related domains of substantial interest to society,
    such as smart mobility, smart grid, smart buildings, and smart agriculture. The
    following section presents some critical IoT applications in SA. D. IoT Applications
    in Smart Agriculture IoT and connected objects have invaded our daily lives in
    all fields, from smart TVs to connected cars: all our activities are facilitated
    by these new tools, which significantly increase our comfort. All studies confirm
    that the potential of connected things is enormous. For example, a study done
    by Fortune Business Insight indicates that the global IoT market size is projected
    to reach $ 1,854.76 billion by 2028. It is set to exhibit a Compound Annual Growth
    Rate (CAGR) of 25.4% during the forecast period between 2021 and 2028 [21]. The
    applications of IoT are numerous and cover many areas. The most appealing IoT
    applications in Agriculture are presented next. 1) Smart Greenhouses Greenhouse
    farming enhances the quality and quantity of crops production through manual control
    of environmental conditions [22]. A smart greenhouse can be created using IoT
    by deploying sensors and motors that intelligently monitor and control the climate
    conditions based on the needs of the plants [23]. Several operations will be automatic
    by adopting this innovative agricultural system, such as opening and closing windows,
    adjusting the cooling and heating system, and turning on/off light bulbs. Thus,
    manual intervention is no longer required. 2) Smart Irrigation Management The
    currently adopted irrigation methods are somewhat advanced and depend on watering
    at specific times, which does not require much human intervention. Still, at the
    same time, it involves a high degree of guesswork and can be very wasteful in
    terms of water and energy consumption. Some field parts are under or over irrigated
    even with modern irrigation systems. Besides, although farmers would stop irrigation
    systems when expected to rain, sometimes they do not check the weather to adjust
    their schedules accordingly. The smart irrigation management system can consider
    all of this by using precision farming methodologies and IoT-enabled sensors that
    monitor soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature everywhere in the field.
    The control based on this data automatically adjusts irrigation schedules. It
    also provides the exact amount of water where and when needed to create optimal
    conditions for the plant for a better yield without wasting water and energy.
    3) Integration Into Smart Grid Renewable energy integration into Smart Agriculture
    would serve as a bias to link Smart Farms to Smart Grids (SG) [17]. Smart farms
    are both energy producers and consumers. An SG is an electricity distribution
    network that promotes the flow of information between suppliers and consumers
    to adjust the flow of electricity in real-time and allows more efficient management
    of the electricity network [24], [25]. Smart grid benefits from the significant
    development that IoT and embedded systems are witnessing to optimize energy production,
    distribution, consumption, and storage. It improves the energy efficiency of the
    assembly by minimizing line losses and optimizing the yield of the means of production
    used, taking into consideration the real-time consumption. E. Cloud-Based Big
    Data Analytics Platforms This study uses Node-RED, an open-source flow-based programming
    tool that allows wiring hardware devices, application programming interfaces (APIs),
    and online services. We used the built-JavaScript-based library on Node.js to
    develop the application. We wired pre-programmed nodes represented by appropriate
    icons and created the application’s different needed functional IoT components.
    Node-RED contains several node types, each of which has a specific function. For
    instance, the debug-out nodes are used to monitor the flow. The inject nodes trigger
    a flow manually by clicking on it or automatically at regular intervals. The function
    nodes allow JavaScript code to be run on the messages passed through it. Furthermore,
    dashboard nodes allow us to display data [26]. In this work, we wired up input,
    output, and processing nodes to create needed flows for data preprocessing, processing,
    storage, and controlling the water pumps and the lighting system, as well as sending
    alerts. The deployed Node-Red flow construction of our irrigation control system
    is depicted in Fig. 6. FIGURE 6. NodeRED irrigation control flow construction.
    Show All SECTION III. Related Work Several studies have been carried out in Smart
    Agriculture (SA). Authors in [27] covered state of the art in SA systems from
    a big data perspective. Their work aimed at introducing big data processing into
    SA. Besides, the authors presented a detailed evolution of the different agricultural
    systems was presented. It showed that SA could explore the full potential of information
    communication technology (ICT) by using various data sources. In [28], D. Glaroudis
    et al. provided a detailed survey about the most used messaging protocols in IoT
    applications. Based on the up-to-date references, they introduced, analyzed, and
    compared six protocols: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Extensible
    Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), WebSocket, and Data Distribution Service
    (DDS). The performance comparison was based on throughput, latency, power consumption,
    bandwidth, reliability, and security. The main challenges that are and will be
    raised by SA applications were also presented in this paper to provide a solid
    basis for realistic implementation options for SA applications. Authors in [29]
    highlighted the importance of IoT and WSN in precision agriculture. The development
    of a low-cost system that monitors, controls, and makes decisions, was presented.
    According to the results, the deployed system showed meaningful improvement in
    the efficiency of resources usage and crops production. Another model of a low-cost,
    effective irrigation system for enhancing cotton production using wireless sensors
    was proposed in [30]. The proposed wireless sensor showed excellent efficiency
    in monitoring the soil water tension, thus implementing an effective irrigation
    scheduling protocol. Authors in [31] deployed small-sized and low-cost WSN nodes
    to improve potato yield by monitoring the field. This study presented a model
    for irrigation management based on mathematical estimations of the agricultural
    parameters. The obtained results ensure better crop yield quality even under stressful
    environmental conditions. Besides, the irrigation system efficiency showed an
    increase that goes up to 10%. In [32], the authors concluded that environmental
    conditions monitoring is crucial to increasing agricultural yield. In this direction,
    a smart system was deployed to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    the movement of animals in the field. The system used Arduino-based sensors. Besides,
    the suggested system deployed an Android mobile application that schedules the
    irrigation, visualizes real-time data, and alerts the farmer in case of any discrepancy.
    The IoT-based SA system farmer-friendly, which is an intelligent system for monitoring
    the concentration of nitrates in groundwater without human intervention, has been
    established in [33]. The proposed approach was based on WSN using Wi-Fi and LoRa
    for data communication. The results demonstrated that the model is ambitious and
    can be adopted by the farmers on large scales. The authors in [34] performed an
    experimental comparison of IoT devices with solar energy harvesting. For the sake
    of the comparison, they used three different communication technologies: Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWan, and ZigBee. The results proved that LoRaWan was the best solution for
    agricultural monitoring when prioritizing network lifetime. The research work
    in [35] defined SA as the application of modern ICT into agriculture. They presented
    the usable IoT hardware and software for smart agriculture and shared interesting
    results. A practical solution for sustainable irrigation in hyper-arid regions
    was proposed in [36]. The suggested solution is based on fuzzy logic combined
    with WSN. According to the results, vast amounts of water and energy were saved
    through effective irrigation scheduling and management processes. For environmental
    sustainability, authors in [37] developed a system that retrieves real-time data
    and uses it to accurately determine the amount of water needed to irrigate the
    garden. The results of this real-world prototype showed savings between 26% and
    34% in water consumption. Still, the results depend on whether the temperature
    sensor is used alone or humidity and soil moisture sensors. Similar to Industry
    4.0 [38], “Agri-Food 4.0” was introduced in [39]. Inspired by the concept of “agriculture
    4.0”, it aims to meet the challenge of enhancing the performance of the agricultural
    supply chain using efficient and effective methods and procedures. The authors
    have conducted a comparative analysis of more than 100 research papers on the
    new technologies and the latest available supply chain approaches. This analysis
    aims to prospect the future of Agri-Food and answer the relevant outstanding questions,
    e.g., how Agri-Food can better support supply chain decision-making? Escamilla-García
    et al. in [40] proposed the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in precision
    agriculture. According to the authors, these models can be developed to adapt
    to new technologies such as IoT, Big Data, and Machine Learning (ML) and eventually
    improve the agriculture field. The feedforward architecture is predominant in
    most of the works analyzed in this paper, while the recurrent and hybrid neural
    networks are less used. The benefits and shortcomings of using ANNs in different
    greenhouses applications such as microclimate prediction, control of carbon dioxide,
    and energy expenses are also featured. In [41], the authors proposed Agrinex,
    a modern irrigation mechanism that helps preserve resources by using WSAN. This
    mechanism can be an alternative to the traditional methods used to control agricultural
    irrigation. Agrinex is based on a mesh network consisting of nodes distributed
    in the field and act simultaneously as sensors detecting soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. Some nodes of the mesh network act as actuators that control the
    valves of the drip irrigation system. The results show that Agrinex is a promising
    start for many other WSAN applications in the agricultural sector. A GSM-based
    smart irrigation system was presented in [42]. GSM was used to communicate environmental
    data such as the soil moisture, the temperature in the field, the solar power
    data, and the status of the water pumps. Fuzzy Logic control has been exploited
    in this study to take input from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity)
    and decide on the water pump status as output. This system has several advantages.
    The most important ones are the availability of a mobile application to remotely
    monitor the irrigation system and its ability to switch Off the water pumps when
    expected to rain. Compared to manual flooding, the results showed that this smart
    system proved its efficiency in conserving water and energy. A system that relies
    on solar energy to cope with water and energy shortages was developed in [43].
    This system uses Wi-Fi technology to provide the control unit with data related
    to the soil and the weather in the field where they are deployed to decide whether
    to send a switch On command to the pumps to irrigate the area or not. Besides,
    the designed controller monitors the water level in the well and operates in three
    different modes: manual mode, mobile control mode, and fuzzy logic control mode.
    The developed prototype solely relied on solar energy. Moreover, it successfully
    proved its efficiency in providing the appropriate conditions for the plants without
    wasting water and energy. In [44], Y. P. Lin et. argue that the next step in the
    evolution in Smart Agriculture will consist of blockchain usage. They proposed
    an ICT e-agriculture system using blockchain infrastructure. SECTION IV. System
    Architecture and Design Our proposed system consists of seven main elements, see
    Fig. 7: Data Acquisition: It is a Wireless Sensor Network that senses the environment
    data and sends it to the gateway [45]. Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP): The
    unit responsible for data storage, visualization, and processing. In addition
    to that, this platform controls the drip irrigation and lighting system within
    the farm. We deployed this component using a Raspberry Pi along with Node-Red.
    The latter is a local server containing a control unit running algorithms to decide
    whether to pump water from groundwater to basin via water pump #1 or from basin
    to the drip irrigation system via water pump # Wireless Actuator Network (WAN):
    It consists of actuators carrying out decisions issued by the BDAP by switching
    On/Off the water pumps and the lighting bulbs. The actuators are wirelessly connected
    to the BDAP [46]. Renewable Energy: These are solar panels that constitute the
    renewable power source for the farm and battery. Storage Unit: The element responsible
    for storing extra electrical energy produced by the solar panels and reusing it
    when needed to operate the water pumps and lighting. It consists of a Lithium
    battery. Control Unit: It decides whether to forward the produced electricity
    to the Smart Farm or store it in the batteries for future use. Cluster Controller:
    It is responsible for collecting and filtering data related to the smart grid
    and sending it to the Cloud-based IoT platform in real-time mode [47]. FIGURE
    7. IoT based smart agriculture: Testbed general architecture. Show All Our proposed
    system is meant to cope with the rapidly growing need for water-table by controlling
    water pumping, overcoming the shortage in electricity by integrating renewable
    energy, and promoting rational usage of water by regulating drip irrigation. The
    following sections shed further light on the main functionalities of our system.
    A. Data Acquisition The data acquisition is composed of wireless sensors and actuators.
    As depicted in Fig. 8, a sensor node is composed of three elements: Sensor modules:
    soil moisture sensor deployed in the field, temperature, and humidity sensor (DHT11)
    which measures the ambient air temperature and humidity, PIR sensor which detects
    the existence of humans by sensing motion, and for the fields’ security reason,
    the fire sensor is used to detect the presence of a flame or fire, the Ultrasonic
    HC-SR04 sensor which measures the water level in the basin, and the AC sensor
    which measures pumps’ power consumption. Microcontroller: an Arduino Nano board
    that connects all the components is used in this study. Communication module:
    It is responsible for transceiving data between sensors and the BDAP. In this
    study Zigbee module (Xbee series 2 S2C) was used. FIGURE 8. Data flow: from sensors
    to the cloud. Show All In anticipation of any power failure in sunlight deficiency,
    all nodes are powered with an IoT solar system (solar panel 20W, solar battery
    charger, and 25Ah battery). This method makes the WSN data acquisition system
    ideal for agriculture as it can be easily deployed everywhere independently of
    the power installation. This energy harvesting system can guarantee up to 5 days
    of total autonomy for each sensor node. B. Sensor Node Configuration The WSN was
    implemented as a mesh topology using a scalable and reliable firmware named Digimesh.
    Each sensor node can act as a sensor and a router in this configuration using
    the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol [10]. In the current
    study, five wireless sensor nodes were deployed. These send real-time data to
    the BDAP every 15 minutes through the gateway device (sink node) that connects
    the WSN and the BDAP, see Fig. 9. FIGURE 9. Wireless mesh network architecture.
    Show All The wireless actuator nodes we used to control the water pumps are smart
    relays (Sonoff with integrated ESP8266 Wi-Fi Card [48]). These are WiFi-based
    wireless smart switches that operate with a voltage range of 90-250v AC and a
    wireless frequency of 2.4GHz and are compatible with a wide range of appliances.
    We adopted this smart switch as it is cost-effective, reliable, and provides an
    integrated Wi-Fi module. In addition, ensuring communication with the BDAP as
    the Wi-Fi connection might not be available. We enhanced the data acquisition
    and control unit by replacing Sonoff’s smart relay module with a standard relay
    5V connected to an Arduino Nano microcontroller equipped with a GSM/GPRS module
    or a Zigbee module. Fig. 10. shows the wireless sensors used to collect data from
    the field, Fig. 11. shows the wireless sensors used to monitor the water level
    in the basin and the water pump’s energy consumption, and Fig. 12 shows the wireless
    actuator nodes that act on the water pumps to switch them On/Off. FIGURE 10. In-field
    wireless sensor node deployment. Show All FIGURE 11. Basin wireless sensor node
    deployment. Show All FIGURE 12. Wireless smart actuators nodes deployment. Show
    All C. Big Data Analytics Platform Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) is the backbone
    of the proposed system. The developed BDAP is based on Node-RED and tested locally
    on a RaspberryPi 3 board running Raspbian OS. Besides, we installed the message
    broker Eclipse-Mosquitto that implements the IoT publish-subscribe messaging protocol
    (MQTT). Following are the main functionalities of our BDAP. 1) Real-Time Data
    Collection and Storage The BDAP receives real-time data from three sources. DigiMesh
    sensors network is distributed in the field to collect and send data to the gateway.
    This data is then forwarded to the BDAP through the USB serial port. Wireless
    sensor/actuator nodes are deployed in groundwater sources and basins. They are
    connected to Wi-Fi using the ESP8266 module, and they communicate with BDAP using
    the MQTT communication protocol. OpenWeatherMap online forecasting portal: it
    provides up to 5 days forecast of temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure,
    and precipitation. 2) Real-Time Data Visualisation The proposed BDAP contains
    a NodeRED dashboard that displays the acquired data from the different sources
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The main characteristics
    of the GUI are: Visualizing data over short, medium, and long-term periods (daily,
    monthly, and yearly) in charts form. Allowing the user to remotely act on the
    pumps by switching them On/Off via graphical command buttons. Securing data access
    by prompting the user to authenticate through password-secured sessions. Fig.
    13 depicts the interactive real-time control GUI, which displays the real-time
    soil moisture average, temperature average, water level in the basin, irrigation
    duration, rain precipitation, and the state of water pumps (On/Off). The NodeRED
    dashboard was deployed using flowchart programming. FIGURE 13. Real-time control
    interface. Show All 3) Real-Time Irrigation and Water Level Control The control
    flow of the proposed smart irrigation system is presented in Fig. 14. It has two
    primary sequences: 1. Irrigation control (in green), and 2. water level control
    (in blue). FIGURE 14. Deployed system control-flow diagram. Show All a: Real-Time
    Irrigation Control We are adopting fuzzy logic in deploying this component, and
    we dubbed it the Fuzzy Irrigation Control Unit (FICU). The BDAP starts by retrieving
    predicted precipitation data for the next 24 hours from OpenWeatherMap. Depending
    on provided data, two cases are possible: If it is predicted to rain, the FICU
    decides to switch Off the basin waterpump #2 as the rain will likely irrigate
    the field. else, the FICU proceeds as follows: It retrieves the actual soil moisture
    and ambient temperature (Ta) from the wireless sensor nodes and computes their
    average values. The computed average soil moisture is compared to the desired
    one that varies depending on the plant type. In this study, the desired soil moisture
    is set to 60%. The FICU computes a new variable named Soil Moisture Difference
    (SMD). SMD is the difference between the real-time soil moisture average and the
    desired one. If SMD is ≤ 0, FICU uses SMD and Ta to generate the irrigation duration
    (Id) based on the rules mentioned in Table 1. For instance, “If SMD ≪<0 , and
    Ta is Cold, then Id is set to Short”. Then, waterpump #2 is turned On for Id minutes
    to irrigate the field. If SMD >0, the waterpump #2 is turned Off. TABLE 1 Fuzzy
    Rules of Irrigation Duration The use of Ta alongside SMD by FICU is meant to reduce
    water evapotranspiration at high temperatures. FICU comprises four components,
    see Fig. 15: 1. fuzzification module, 2. The Max-Min Inference Engine, 3. The
    Mamdani-type rule base module, and 4. The Centroid defuzzification module. FIGURE
    15. Fuzzy irrigation controller architecture. Show All The inputs and output membership
    functions of the FICU are depicted in Fig. 16. The fuzzification/defuzzification
    of inputs/output is done using trapezoidal and triangular membership functions.
    FIGURE 16. Fuzzy sets memberships functions. Show All Only three membership functions
    were used for each input to improve the program execution speed and avoid the
    memory backlog [36]. However, five membership functions were used for the output
    to cover all variations of Id. b: Real-Time Water Level Control Drip irrigation
    using basins is the most used irrigation method in agriculture. This method has
    several advantages and drawbacks as well. Advantages: Collecting rainwater: by
    collecting rainwater, water table resources are saved, and energy use is reduced.
    Improving water quality: when water is kept in basins, it becomes more oxygenated,
    thus becoming more beneficial for the plants [49]. Drawbacks: Permanent supervision
    cost: This is the sole drawback. Conventional Water Level (WL) control requires
    permanent human supervision, increasing the cost of the products. Our BDAP monitors
    WL in basins based on real-time data provided by a WL sensor to minimize the additional
    cost due to supervision. The blue part in Fig. 14 shows the WL control flowchart.
    Once the field is watered, the BDAP checks the WL value of the basin. If WL <
    50 %, waterpump #1 is turned On. Then, water is pumped from the groundwater source
    to fill the basin to the maximum. Once at maximum, a switch Off command is sent
    to waterpump #1. The whole water irrigation and water level control process is
    regularly repeated (see Fig. 14). We fixed the cycle duration to one hour. The
    solar system used in this study is shown in Fig. 17. It consists of a DC/AC inverter,
    an AC/DC inverter, electrical protection, and a lithium battery. FIGURE 17. Solar
    system real-world deployment. Show All The real-world deployment of the proposed
    SA system is depicted in Fig. 18. The setup consists of solar panels, WSN, IoT
    solar panels with batteries and water pumps. FIGURE 18. Smart agriculture real-world
    deployment. Show All SECTION V. Results & Discussions In order to evaluate our
    system, real-time data was continuously collected remotely via the settled WSN
    over five days in July 2020. Collected data include soil moisture, temperature,
    irrigation duration, water level, solar panels energy production, and the energy
    consumption of waterpump #2. The relevant data variances are depicted in Figures
    19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. FIGURE 19. Real-time temperature and soil moisture averages.
    Show All FIGURE 20. Real-time soil moisture using the traditional irrigation system.
    Show All FIGURE 21. Real-time soil moisture average and irrigation duration. Show
    All FIGURE 22. Real-time water level and groundwater pump state. Show All FIGURE
    23. Real-time PV power production and waterpump #2 energy consumption. Show All
    In Fig. 19, depicting the temperature and soil moisture variances, we notice that
    the day temperature rose to 40 °C, and the nocturnal temperature ranged between
    15 and 20 °C. Unlike conventional irrigation systems (depicted in Fig. 20), the
    soil moisture is optimal and closer to the desired value (60%), and it stays within
    the range of 57%-65%. In conventional irrigation systems, represented in Fig.
    20, the soil moisture varies from 0%-100%. In Fig. 20, we track the real-time
    soil moisture in traditional irrigation systems within five days. This method
    consists of irrigating the field for two consecutive hours daily. The results,
    in Fig. 20, underpin the following drawbacks: The plant is either over or under
    irrigated since the soil moisture varies between those extreme values, and the
    optimal value (60%) is not maintained for an extended period. The quality and
    quantity of the yield would be negatively affected since the soil moisture reaches
    0% for at least five hours each day. High water and energy consumption: in five
    days, 2400L were consumed, which is equivalent to 480L/day for an area of 25m2.
    The last average is used later to evaluate our system compared to conventional
    irrigation in the same region. Our proposed system reacts to weather changes with
    high precision. It raises the soil moisture to 65% during high temperatures (to
    avoid evapotranspiration losses) and does not exceed 62%-63% in low temperatures.
    To study the impact of the irrigation duration on soil moisture, we tracked the
    relevant variances as depicted in Fig. 21. Accordingly, whenever there is a decrease
    in soil moisture, the FICU computes the desired irrigation period to meet the
    desired moisture value and sends a switch On signal to the wireless actuator attached
    to waterpump #2. Accordingly, the higher the temperature is, the longer the irrigation
    duration becomes. When raising the irrigation periods, the evapotranspiration
    losses are reduced, and as a result, the desired soil moisture is continuously
    maintained. Thus, better conditions are provided to the plant, consequently increasing
    the yield’s quality and quantity. Monitoring and controlling the water level in
    the basin is crucial for controlling the drip irrigation system. In this experiment,
    we continuously track the basin water, which varies according to the irrigation
    periods computed by the FICU. For instance, as shown in Fig. 22, when the water
    level exceeds the set threshold (50% in our case), waterpump #1 is turned Off;
    otherwise, waterpump #1 is switched On until the basin is reached entirely complete.
    Thus, the obtained results are consistent with the water level control previously
    presented in section IV. We used a water pump with a water flow rate of 240 L/hour
    in our experiment. Within five days, the total Id was 169 minutes, and 676 L were
    consumed during this time. This rate is equivalent to 135.2 L/day consumed over
    the same area of 25 m2. Accordingly, our proposed smart agriculture system provides
    the field with an average of 54 m3/hectare per day. This water consumption is
    3.55 times lower than in the traditional irrigation system, and thus the energy
    consumption as well since used pumps are electrical ones. Therefore, we conclude
    that the traditional irrigation system is ineffective in maintaining soil moisture
    at the desired value. In addition, it is wasting water and energy resources. The
    real-time energy consumption of waterpump #2 measured by AC sensor and the real-time
    solar panels’ energy production measured by a smart energy meter within five days
    are presented in Fig. 23. We notice from this figure that the maximum energy consumption
    and maximum solar energy production are reached simultaneously (between 12:00
    pm and 4:00 pm). From this figure, we also conclude that the integration of solar
    energy is suitable for smart agriculture without implementing an extensive storage
    system(batteries). In the design of our SA prototype, the cost has been reduced
    to the minimum possible to make it affordable and widely adopted even by small
    and medium farmers. The unit price for every single component is presented in
    Table 2. TABLE 2 Unit Price of the Different Components The total cost of designing
    our SA Prototype with a RaspberryPi, five wireless sensor nodes, 5 IoT solar panels
    and batteries, two smart relays, and a Zigbee gateway is $ 609, which is much
    cheaper than other existing solutions in the market. The proposed SA system is
    an up-and-coming solution for many reasons: Better quantity and quality production.
    Less energy and water consumption. Cost-effectiveness. Open-source. Eco-friendly.
    Easy monitoring (less effort). Designed to promote scalability. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper developed, presented, and deployed an open-source and easy-to-deploy
    smart agriculture system with the main drivers of cost-effectiveness, water consumption
    optimization, and renewable energy integration. The deployed SA system leverages
    up-to-date ICT. We used IoT devices for data acquisition and control (sensors
    and actuators). We also used Cloud Computing for data processing, visualization,
    and data storage. Besides, we recurred to fuzzy logic to implement a fuzzy irrigation
    control unit that decides on the appropriate Id (Irrigation Duration) based on
    real-time processed data. This approach saves water and energy and provides adequate
    conditions for the plants, thus optimizing crops’ yield. Furthermore, this allows
    better monitoring for the water level in the basin and adheres to the conventional
    eco-friendly trend of sustainable agriculture through its total reliance on solar
    energy. The case study results show that our proposed solution is promising compared
    to the traditional irrigation system due to its cost-effectiveness and ability
    to reduce water/energy consumption by 71.8%. As future work, we are paving the
    way towards scaling up our system by deploying our solution in several farms in
    the region, allowing our BDAP (Big Data Analytics Platform) to collect big real-time
    data about water-table usage in the region. Thus appropriate irrigation strategies
    can be derived and analyzed. Besides, we plan further experimentation to enhance
    solar energy production and storage. We will also integrate LoRa wireless sensors/actuators
    network and develop a machine learning system that predicts soil moisture, energy
    production, and energy consumption within a few days. The machine learning algorithm
    can adapt to different crop requirements in moisture levels and improve crop yield.

    of intelligent sprinkler irrigation technologies for remote autonomous system
    Xingye Zhu, Prince Chikangaise, Weidong Shi, Wen-Hua Chen, Shouqi Yuan  Abstract  Changing
    of environmental conditions and shortage of water demands a system that can manage
    irrigation efficiently. Autonomous irrigation systems are developed to optimize
    water use for agricultural crops. In dry areas or in case of inadequate rainfall,
    irrigation becomes difficult. So, it needs to be automated for proper yield and
    handled remotely for farmer safety. The aim of this study is to review the needs
    of soil moisture sensors in irrigation, sensor technology and their applications
    in irrigation scheduling and, discussing prospects. The review further discusses
    the literature of sensors remotely communicating with self-propelled sprinkler
    irrigation systems, distributed wireless sensor networks, sensors and integrated
    data management schemes and autonomous sprinkler control options. On board and
    field-distributed sensors can collect data necessary for real-time irrigation
    management decisions and transmit the information directly or through wireless
    networks to the main control panel or base computer. Communication systems such
    as cell phones, satellite radios, and internet-based systems are also available
    allowing the operator to query the main control panel or base computer from any
    location at any time. Selection of the communication system for remote access
    depends on local and regional topography and cost. Traditional irrigation systems
    may provide unnecessary irrigation to one part of a field while leading to a lack
    of irrigation in other parts. New sensors or remotely sensing capabilities are
    required to collect real time data for crop growth status and other parameters
    pertaining to weather, crop and soil to support intelligent and efficient irrigation
    management systems for agricultural processes. Further development of wireless
    sensor applications in agriculture is also necessary for increasing efficiency,
    productivity and profitability of farming operations. Keywords: intelligent sprinkler
    irrigation, precision agriculture, soil moisture sensors, wireless sensor network,
    remote data management, autonomous system DOI: 10.25165/j.ijabe.20181101.3557  Citation:

    \ by crops is supplied by nature in the form of precipitation, but when it becomes\
    \ scarce or its distribution does not coincide with demand peaks, it is then necessary\
    \ to supply it artificially, by irrigation. Several irrigation methods are available,\
    \ and the selection of one depends on factors such as water availability, crop,\
    \ soil characteristics, land topography, and associated cost. In the near future,\
    \ irrigated agriculture will need to produce two-thirds of the increase in food\
    \ products required by a larger population (English et al., 2002). The growing\
    \ dependence on irrigated agriculture coincides with an accelerated competition\
    \ for water and increased awareness of unintended negative consequences of poor\
    \ design and management (Cai et al., 2003). Optimum management of available water\
    \ resources at farm level is needed because of increasing demands, limited resources,\
    \ water table variation in space and time, and soil contamination (Kumar and Singh,\
    \ 2003). Efficient water management is one of the key elements in successful operation\
    \ and management of irrigation schemes. Irrigation water management involves determining\
    \ when to irrigate, the amount of water to apply at each irrigation event and\
    \ during each stage of plant, and operating and maintaining the irrigation system.\
    \ The main management objective is to manage the production system for profit\
    \ without compromising environment and in agreement with water availability. A\
    \ major management activity involves irrigation scheduling or determining when\
    \ and how much water to apply, considering the irrigation method and other field\
    \ characteristics. Under limitations in water availability, it is required to\
    \ develop new irrigation scheduling approaches focused on to ensure optimal use\
    \ of available water, and not based on full crop water requirements. The determination\
    \ of these efficient and effective irrigation schedules (including deficit irrigation\
    \ strategies) requires the accurate determination of water requirements for the\
    \ main crops, in order to assist the farmers in deciding when and how much to\
    \ irrigate their crops. New technologies such as remote sensing, modeling, and\
    \ lysimiter are contributing to obtain a better knowledge of the crop agronomy\
    \ and irrigation, detecting water stress, determining crop water requirements\
    \ and obtaining accurate irrigation schedules. Irrigation technology has made\
    \ significant advances in recent years. Criteria and procedures have been developed\
    \ to improve and rationalize practices to apply water, through soil leveling,\
    \ irrigation system design, discharge regulations, adduction structures, and control\
    \ equipment. However, in many regions these advances are not yet available at\
    \ the farm stage. Irrigation systems are selected, designed and operated to supply\
    \ the irrigation requirements of each crop on the farm while controlling deep\
    \ percolation, runoff, evaporation, and operational losses, to establish a sustainable\
    \ production process. Playán and Mateos (2006) mentioned that modernized irrigation\
    \ systems at farm level implies selecting the appropriate irrigation system and\
    \ strategy according to the water availability, the characteristics of climate,\
    \ soil and crop, the economic and social circumstances, and the constraints of\
    \ the distribution system.  IRRIGATION SYSTEMS  Design and management Design of\
    \ irrigation systems is a very important topic in the process to improve irrigation\
    \ application, efficiency and economical return in the production process (Pannunzio\
    \ et al., 2004b). Irrigation system design substantially affects application efficiency\
    \ and involves numerous variables and restrictions, whose principal objective\
    \ is to maximize benefits and minimize costs. In a successful irrigation system,\
    \ a set of resources produces maximum returns. To achieve this, an optimization\
    \ process supporting the design and operation of water application systems in\
    \ agriculture is required due to many possible combinations of design variables\
    \ that satisfy irrigation conditions. Irrigation systems have specific applications\
    \ that are based in several factors, among which the most relevant are the crop,\
    \ soil type, topography, and water availability and quality. The application efficiency\
    \ of the different surface and pressurized irrigation methods varies and depends\
    \ on design, management, and operation (Holzapfel and Arumí, 2006). Undoubtedly,\
    \ well-designed and correctly used irrigation systems will have the highest efficiency\
    \ and water distribution levels, which can result in a good production and high\
    \ product quality (Holzapfel et al., 2000; 2004). For an adequate management and\
    \ operation of the surface irrigation systems, a series of support elements have\
    \ been developed, including simulation models and control and derivation structures,\
    \ such as adduction systems. In the case of pressurized irrigation systems, enormous\
    \ advances have resulted in greater automation in its operation, greater precision\
    \ in its application, and the incorporation of chemical elements for nutrition\
    \ and disease control into the irrigation process (Holzapfel and Arumí, 2006;\
    \ Ravindra et al., 2008). In order to increase agriculture sustainability, an\
    \ important aspect that has been considered by several researchers and studies\
    \ is to design efficient irrigation systems at farm level (Hillel and Vlek, 2005;\
    \ Khan et al., 2006; Hsiao et al., 2007; Pannunzio et al., 2008; Pannunzio, 2008).\
    \ These appear to be a very crucial aspect for the irrigated agriculture and a\
    \ key factor due to the competition for water resources. In recent years, several\
    \ irrigation systems have improved significantly the application efficiency at\
    \ farm level, improving the irrigation water management. For instance, in the\
    \ main irrigation districts of Mexico, introducing new technologies and more efficient\
    \ associated with real-time irrigation scheduling, demonstrated water savings\
    \ in the order of at least 20%, without any appreciable decrease in crop yields\
    \ (Quiñones et al., 1999). Some studies have analyzed the differences in irrigation\
    \ efficiency for several irrigation systems, as Al-Jamal et al. (2001), where\
    \ sprinkler, trickle and furrow irrigation systems were analyzed in Southern New\
    \ Mexico, USA, with onion production. Thus, the maximum irrigation water use efficiency\
    \ (IWUE) was obtained using the sprinkler system. The lower IWUE values were obtained\
    \ under subsurface drip and furrow irrigation systems compared with sprinkler\
    \ irrigation was due to excessive irrigation under subsurface drip and higher\
    \ evaporation rates from fields using furrow irrigation.  Comparison of irrigation\
    \ systems Ibragimov et al. (2007) compared drip and furrow irrigation, obtaining\
    \ that 18-42% of the irrigation water was saved with drip systems in comparison\
    \ with furrow, and the IWUE increased by 35-103% compared with furrow irrigation.\
    \ Same comparisons were made by Maisiri et al. (2005) in a semi-arid agro tropical\
    \ climate of Zimbabwe; in this study, drip irrigation used about 35% of the water\
    \ used by the surface irrigation systems, providing higher IWUE. The gross margin\
    \ level for surface irrigation was lower than for drip irrigation.  Other studies\
    \ analyzed surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems in Turkey (Yazar et\
    \ al., 2002). Both methods had similar yield results but surface drip had more\
    \ advantages due to difficulty in replacement and higher cost for subsurface systems.\
    \ Additionally they recommended the surface drip in early potato under Mediterranean\
    \ conditions.  Tognetti et al. (2003) determined that drip irrigation influenced\
    \ positively many of the physiological process and technological parameters in\
    \ semi-arid conditions, as compared to low-pressure sprinkler irrigation. Hanson\
    \ and May (2004) obtained yield increases when drip system were used compared\
    \ to the sprinkler systems with similar amounts of applied water; additionally,\
    \ drips systems reduced percolation below the root zone. Another study analyzed\
    \ low-energy precision application (LEPA) and trickle irrigation for cotton in\
    \ Turkey, concluding that both irrigation systems could be used successfully under\
    \ the arid climatic conditions of this country (Yazar et al., 2002).  Pressurized\
    \ irrigation systems According to many papers, drip irrigation is widely regarded\
    \ as the most promising irrigation system, and is specially recommended in combination\
    \ with saline water. In Karlberg et al. (2007) report, two low-cost drip irrigation\
    \ systems with different emitter discharge rates were used to irrigate tomatoes\
    \ (Lycopersicon esculentum), concluding that the combination of drip systems with\
    \ plastic mulch increased the yield. In relation with drip systems, some analyses\
    \ have been made to determine the optimum lateral spacing for drip-irrigated corn\
    \ (Zea mays) in Turkey (Bozkurt et al., 2006). Lateral spacing of 0.7, 1.40 and\
    \ 2.10 m were compared, concluding that the optimum lateral spacing for corn was\
    \ 1.40 m (one drip lateral per two crop rows). Ravindra et al. (2008) developed\
    \ a linear programming model for optimal design of pressurized irrigation system\
    \ subunit, considering implementation cost and energy. Holzapfel et al. (2007a;\
    \ 2007b) analysed the optimal selection of emitters and sprinkler taking into\
    \ account the total cost, operation and implementation. Rodriguez et al. (2007)\
    \ studied the selection of emitter on the basis of hydraulic characteristics.\
    \ On the other hand, annual water application cost per unit area has been analyzed\
    \ at the subunit level designed with pipes of different materials by Ortiz Romero\
    \ et al. (2006). Other important aspects are related with the analysis of strategies\
    \ for water management in pressurized irrigation systems (Ramalan and Hill, 2000).\
    \ The timing or frequency of water applications will depend on soil texture (e.g.,\
    \ sand vs. clay), the irrigation system used (e.g., drip vs. sprinkler), the rate\
    \ at which the plant is using water, and the overall development of the plants\
    \ root system. Frequent water applications are especially important when using\
    \ drip systems, which tend to restrict soil wetting and thus produce a smaller\
    \ root system. When done properly, frequent irrigations are beneficial and often\
    \ increase growth and yield in many orchards and crops. For example, frequent\
    \ irrigation by drip in peach (Prunus persica) increased fruit size and yield\
    \ compared to other irrigation methods by maintaining higher tree water status\
    \ between irrigations (Bryla et al., 2005). It is also important to apply water\
    \ to both sides of the plant and to maintain an adequate volume of soil wetted,\
    \ as was observed in citrus (Citrus sp.) and avocados (Persea americana) (Henríquez,\
    \ 2005; Holzapfel and Arumí, 2006). Abbott and Gough (1986) found that when water\
    \ was applied to only one side, growth and production were severely restricted\
    \ on the other. However, irrigators, particularly those using drip, should be\
    \ careful to avoid the temptation to over-irrigate. Over-irrigation depletes the\
    \ root zone of much-needed oxygen, thus reducing both root growth and nutrient\
    \ uptake, leading to a host of potential root disease problems as well as aquifer\
    \ contamination. Yadav and Mathur (2008) found with tested model that the water\
    \ extraction is closely related with soil moisture availability in addition to\
    \ the root density, which occurs normally from the upper root dense soil profile.\
    \ Considering the relevant support that means a good automation of the irrigation\
    \ systems to reduce management time and simplify design, it is necessary to use\
    \ the modern methods of surveying and analysis tools (Troy Peters and Evett, 2008).\
    \ Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with their capability\
    \ of data collection and analysis are viewed as efficient and effective tools\
    \ for pressurized irrigation system design and management (Rodriguez, 2001). The\
    \ capability of GIS to analyze the information across space and time would help\
    \ in managing such dynamic systems as pressurized irrigation systems. Hazrat et\
    \ al. (2003) found that the GIS are an important tool that can be used to optimal\
    \ allocation of water resources of an irrigation project. Mean water balance components\
    \ results for different months were stored in GIS databases, analyzed, and displayed\
    \ as the monthly crop water requirements maps. Intensive irrigated agriculture\
    \ under pressurized systems involves water application, fertilizers and other\
    \ chemicals, applied in varying amounts to the crop and orchards areas. Yet, like\
    \ any enhanced productive activity, it leads to environmental contamination if\
    \ it is improperly managed (Wichelns and Oster, 2006). When utilization of chemicals\
    \ is incomplete or inefficient, or when water is applied in excess, the resultant\
    \ seepage ends up in drainage systems or in recharging the aquifers beneath the\
    \ cropped land (Hadas et al., 1999).  Surface irrigation systems During the past\
    \ two decades procedures and criteria of surface irrigation have become available,\
    \ which have established the optimum design and efficient management and operation\
    \ of the water applied to crops to obtain maximum yield and avoid environmental\
    \ effect due to leaching and runoff. The most frequently used surface irrigation\
    \ systems are: contour irrigation, border irrigation, and furrow irrigation. The\
    \ latter is more frequently used to irrigate row crops and orchards. This method\
    \ possesses various factors and elements of design and management which have been\
    \ extensively analyzed. Furrow irrigation is the oldest and more commonly used\
    \ irrigation system. Lately, it has become important because of the high cost\
    \ of energy in pressurized irrigation methods and the incorporation of automation\
    \ in its operation (Holzapfel and Arumí, 2006). Eldeiry et al. (2005) found in\
    \ a study of design of furrow irrigation in clay soil that the furrow length and\
    \ application discharge are the main factor affecting application efficiency.\
    \ On the other hand, environmental impacts of furrow irrigation has been studied\
    \ by different researchers (Lehrsch et al., 2000) and has been found that in irrigation,\
    \ risks of nitrate leaching depends of water and fertilizer application (Popova\
    \ et al., 2005). Burguete et al. (2009a; 2009b) developed and calibrated a model\
    \ and methodology for fertigation in furrow irrigation, which allow adequate fertilizer\
    \ uniformity and avoid contamination problems. The automation of fertilization\
    \ as well as water application are very important advances for the development\
    \ of furrow irrigation and the improvement of surface irrigation systems. The\
    \ amounts of water and leachates vary with the type of irrigation system used,\
    \ irrigation efficiency, crop or orchard, utilization of water and fertilizers,\
    \ decomposition of the added organic materials, and absorption of the decomposed\
    \ fractions. The leachates contain the chemicals mostly added in irrigation water,\
    \ but nitrate is the dominant anion, derived from fertilizers and decomposing\
    \ organic materials. In addition, pesticides are other chemicals incorporated\
    \ in irrigation and it has been shown that leaching increased in direct relation\
    \ with the increment of the amount of percolating water produced by irrigation\
    \ (Asare et al., 2001). The close association between leaching and amount of deep-percolating\
    \ water produced by irrigation is expected because leaching occurs through dissolution\
    \ of solute in soil solution and subsequently moves with soil water. These results\
    \ can show the importance of using an adequate design of surface and pressurized\
    \ irrigation systems and management techniques to reduce chemical leaching by\
    \ decreasing deep percolation. In many irrigated regions of the western United\
    \ States, commercial growers that use furrow irrigation systems are facing serious\
    \ challenges to improve irrigation efficiency and reduce contamination of water\
    \ supplies (Rice et al., 2001). However, the most important points are to adequately\
    \ select the irrigation variables in each system with appropriate design criteria,\
    \ improving the irrigation scheduling and water management of the field that will\
    \ also potentially reduce over-irrigation and deep leaching of applied water and\
    \ chemicals.  General considerations Design of irrigation systems is a very important\
    \ topic in the process to improve water application, efficiency and economical\
    \ return in the production process. To develop adequate engineering design, the\
    \ use of well known criteria it is a basic component; this can only be obtained\
    \ with deep knowledge on irrigation, and the technical parameters associated with\
    \ crop, soil water characteristics, energy and environment. Pereira (1999) reported\
    \ that to improve the irrigation systems requires the consideration of the factors\
    \ influencing the hydraulic processes, the water infiltration and the uniformity\
    \ of water application to the entire field. The consideration of all these aspects\
    \ makes irrigation management a complex decision making and field practice process.\
    \ Playán and Mateos (2006) reported that in general all irrigation systems can\
    \ attain approximately the same level of efficiency, when they are well designed\
    \ and appropriated selected for the specific condition, due that irrigation is\
    \ site specific. However, differences among irrigation systems appear in many\
    \ areas as a consequence of design, management and maintenance. There are several\
    \ reports indicating that trickle irrigation systems increased yields in Washington\
    \ Navel oranges (Citrus sinensis) in humid regions (Pannunzio et al., 2000; Pannunzio\
    \ and Genoud, 2000), determining the convenience of wetting a minimum percentage\
    \ of the shaded area by the crop to maximize yields, finding the mini-sprinkler\
    \ system as the most efficient. An adequate selection and distribution of number\
    \ of emitters in drip irrigation may give substantial different results (Rodríguez\
    \ et al., 2007). Colombo and Or (2006) found that in a drip irrigated field, local\
    \ crop yield patterns are determined by spatial patterns in water accessibility\
    \ to plants that could be quantified and used for optimal irrigation system design;\
    \ the results demonstrated that around each emitter, the spatial distribution\
    \ of above-ground dry mass per plant followed a general pattern. Number and location\
    \ of drippers in a blueberry (Vaccinium corimbosum) crop was tested, finding out\
    \ that the shallow and spread roots of the crop were well wetted by two laterals\
    \ per each row of crop compared with a single line of drippers per row of crop,\
    \ resulting in greater yields (Pannunzio et al., 2004a). Henríquez (2005) found\
    \ that with a correct number and distribution of emitter on the base of soil and\
    \ plant characteristic, there are differences of 100% in yield for citrus orchards.\
    \  WATER MANAGEMENT FOR IRRIGATION SYSTEMS  Deficit irrigation in fruit trees\
    \ for management of irrigation systems The concept of regulated deficit irrigation\
    \ (RDI) was initially proposed to control vegetative growth in peach orchards,\
    \ determining in addition savings in irrigation water without reducing yield.\
    \ Thus, deficit irrigation has been demonstrated as a useful tool to improve the\
    \ irrigation management at field scale for arid and semi-arid conditions. Deficit\
    \ irrigation has been used extensively for annual crops in the past. Thus, was\
    \ applied to corn (Payero et al., 2006; Farré and Faci, 2006); cotton (Gossypium\
    \ hirsutum) (Jalota et al., 2006; Falkenberg et al., 2007); wheat (Triticum aestivum)\
    \ (Jalota et al., 2006); sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) (Farré and Faci, 2006); onion\
    \ (Allium cepa) (Bekele and Tilahun, 2007) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) (Fabeiro\
    \ et al., 2003). However deficit irrigation has had significantly more success\
    \ in tree crops and vines than in field crops (Fereres and Soriano, 2007). Analyses\
    \ of deficit irrigation in trees have been related with peaches (Girona et al.,\
    \ 2005a); almonds (Prunus dulcis) (Romero et al., 2004; Girona et al., 2005b;\
    \ Romero et al., 2006; Goldhamer et al., 2006); pistachio (Pistacia vera) (Goldhamer\
    \ and Beede, 2004); plum (Prunus domestica) (Intrigliolo and Castel, 2006); olives\
    \ (Olea europaea) (Moriana et al., 2003; Tognetti et al., 2006); citrus (Domingo\
    \ et al., 1996; González-Altozano and Castel, 1999; Velez et al., 2007) and wine\
    \ grapes (Vitis vinifera) (Bravdo and Naor, 1996; McCarthy et al., 2002). Analyzing\
    \ all these studies, the conclusion would be that supplying full ET requirements\
    \ could not be the optimal irrigation scheduling for management of irrigation\
    \ systems. A correct water management at field scale is highly influenced by the\
    \ irrigation method and the irrigation operating system. Traditionally deficit\
    \ irrigation strategies were carried out on-demand irrigation systems, where the\
    \ date and rate of the irrigation was decided by the farmer or technician, and\
    \ the irrigation scheduling was not limited by the distribution system. Equally,\
    \ for fruit trees drip and micro-sprinkler systems are the most common irrigation\
    \ methods, although surface irrigation methods under an appropriate water management\
    \ could provide similar efficiency and performance results. Authors as Girona\
    \ et al. (2005a) analysed the response to single and combined deficit irrigation\
    \ regimes for peach trees with an automated drip system with four compensating\
    \ emitters per tree. Thus, it was obtained that deficit irrigation during Stage\
    \ II of fruit development and/or during post-harvest significantly reduced vegetative\
    \ growth of the trees. However, fruit production was not affected by any deficit\
    \ irrigation strategy until the fourth year when yield decreased slightly with\
    \ combined deficit irrigation (Girona et al., 2005a). Similar studies were made\
    \ in almond, applying RDI during the kernel-filling phase (Girona et al., 2005b).\
    \ In the study during the first two experimental years, kernel dry matter accumulation\
    \ did not decrease, however, similar to previous works, cropping and kernel growth\
    \ were reduced during the third and fourth years of experiment due to a hypothetical\
    \ depletion of the reservoirs. Water savings obtained with these deficit irrigation\
    \ strategies may help to promote the adoption of regulated deficit irrigation\
    \ in areas with water availability reduced. The main difference among this experiment\
    \ and previous analyses was the irrigation system; in this case micro-sprinklers\
    \ were used. This fact could affect the wetted soil volume. Some authors (Hutmacher\
    \ et al., 1994) suggested the possibility to obtain better results using micro-sprinklers,\
    \ confirmed by Girona et al. (2005b) who indicated that wet soil volume was a\
    \ very important factor for almond. Thus, specific studies comparing drip and\
    \ micro-sprinklers systems indicated that also for others crops as grapevines\
    \ irrigated by micro sprinklers, showed greater root presence as the distance\
    \ from the trunk increased (Bassoi et al., 2003). Also in almond with micro-sprinkler\
    \ irrigation, Goldhamer et al. (2006) analyzed the impacts of three different\
    \ water stress timing patterns. The most successful stress timing pattern in terms\
    \ of yield (considering fruit size and load) was the pattern that imposed sustained\
    \ deficit irrigation by applying water a given percentage of full ETc over the\
    \ entire season. Also Romero et al. (2004) analysed the influence of several RDI\
    \ strategies under subsurface and surface drip irrigation. Thus, RDI, with a severe\
    \ irrigation deprivation during kernel-filling (20% ETc), and a recovery post-harvest\
    \ at 75% ETc or up to 50% ETc under subsurface drip irrigation, can be adequate\
    \ in almonds under semiarid conditions, saving a significant amount of irrigation\
    \ water. The comparison between surface and sub-surface irrigation indicated higher\
    \ levels of volumetric soil water content for sub-superficial systems (Romero\
    \ et al., 2004). Comparisons among surface drip, subsurface drip and micro-jet\
    \ on almonds indicated that micro-jet irrigated trees tended to increase yield\
    \ about 10% in some years although no consistent yield differences were found\
    \ (Edstrom and Schwankl, 2002). Considering growth under deficit irrigation, micro-jet\
    \ irrigated trees induced slightly higher growth, similar results that when root\
    \ development was analysed. However, as negative aspect, micro-jet irrigation\
    \ increased maintenance and required higher use of herbicide. Deficit irrigation\
    \ effects on yield and vegetative development also have been analyzed for drip\
    \ irrigated olives. Thus, some authors (Tognetti et al., 2006) determined that\
    \ water availability might affect fruit weight before flowering or during the\
    \ early stages of fruit growth rather than later in summer season. Thus, irrigation\
    \ of olive trees with drip systems from the beginning of pit hardening could be\
    \ recommended, at least in the experimental conditions of the study. Comparing\
    \ different treatments, deficit irrigation during the whole summer resulted in\
    \ improved plant water relations with respect to other watering regimes, while\
    \ severe RDI differentiated only slightly treatments from rain fed plants (Tognetti\
    \ et al., 2005). Nevertheless, regulated deficit irrigation of olive trees after\
    \ pit hardening could be recommended. Citrus also has been studied under deficit\
    \ irrigation strategies. Thus, deficit irrigation treatments compared with the\
    \ control drip irrigated by six pressure compensated emitters by tree allowed\
    \ seasonal water saving between 12 and 18% (Velez et al., 2007).  Recent methodologies\
    \ applied to the water management and stress detection Several studies about deficit\
    \ irrigation have used new technologies as remote sensing techniques. The use\
    \ of infrared thermometry and thermal imaging is considered an interesting option\
    \ in order to monitoring stress in trees, as Sepulcre-Cantó et al. (2006) described\
    \ for stress detection in olive trees from infrared imagery. Also Falkenberg et\
    \ al. (2007) with an infrared camera distinguished between biotic (root rot) and\
    \ abiotic (drought) stress with the assistance of ground truthing, determining\
    \ that deficit irrigation around 75% ETc had no impact on yield, indicating that\
    \ water savings were possible without reducing yield.  In addition to remote sensing\
    \ technology, lysimeter also has been used to characterize deficit irrigation\
    \ and stress for orchard trees as peaches (Girona et al., 2004). In this work\
    \ it was established threshold levels of available soil water content for ET,\
    \ leaf conductance and photosynthesis during deficit irrigation periods, demonstrating\
    \ the importance of considering wetting patterns, soil depth and root exploration\
    \ in high frequency irrigation management, especially for tree crops.  CONCLUSIONS\
    \  Irrigation system design substantially affects application efficiency and involves\
    \ numerous variables and restrictions whose principal objectives are to maximize\
    \ benefits and minimize costs. Design of irrigation systems is a very important\
    \ topic to improve irrigation application, efficiency and economical return in\
    \ the production process. The design must be on the basis of sound criteria that\
    \ are mainly related with knowledge on irrigation, hydraulic, economic, energy,\
    \ environmental and agronomics aspects. Efficient irrigation systems design at\
    \ farm level appear to be a very important aspect for the irrigated agriculture\
    \ and a key factor due to the competition for water resources with other sectors\
    \ and to permit the economical and environmental sustainability of agriculture.\
    \ In general, surface and pressurized irrigation systems can attain a reasonable\
    \ level of efficiency, when they are well designed, adequately operated and appropriately\
    \ selected for specific conditions; because irrigation is site specific. Automation\
    \ of the irrigation systems (surface and pressurized) coupled with sensor and\
    \ equipments to register the information of the irrigation process are important\
    \ topic that must be developed in order to use the systems with their total potentiality.\
    \  Regulated deficit irrigation proposed to control vegetative growth in orchards\
    \ produce, in addition, savings in irrigation water without reducing yield. Thus,\
    \ deficit irrigation has been demonstrated as a useful tool to improve irrigation\
    \ management at field scale for arid and semi-arid conditions.  LITERATURE CITED\

    modéle mechanistic SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract EN FR In a field experiment
    with white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata (L.) alef.) in Germany,
    three irrigation scheduling approaches were tested: (i) three sprinkler irrigation
    schedules based on soil water balance calculations using different development-dependent
    crop coefficients; (ii) automatic drip irrigation based on soil water tension
    thresholds; (iii) irrigation scheduling by real-time application of a partially
    calibrated mechanistic crop growth model. Multi-objective calibration was applied
    to derive a fully calibrated model as a diagnostic tool to identify the water
    loss terms of the individual irrigation strategies.The results of the experiment
    showed that: (i) high yields can be achieved with relatively low amounts of irrigation
    water (~100 mm), provided the optimal irrigation strategy and technique are applied;
    (ii) automated tension threshold-based drip irrigation outperformed soil water
    balance or crop growth model-based strategies; (iii) the soil water balance calculation
    approach relying on recommended Kc factors led to an enormous overirrigation;
    (iv) the application of a partially calibrated crop growth model led to an underestimation
    of the crop water requirements in conjunction with an incorrect timing of irrigation
    events and therefore resulted in the lowest yields. The diagnostic model identified
    percolation, for the wet sprinkler irrigation treatments, and canopy evaporation,
    for the dry and model-based treatments, as major water loss sources; only minimal
    additional water was lost in the tension-controlled treatment. Copyright © 2016
    John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Introduction The worldwide demand for fresh water is increasing
    steadily, especially in water-scarce areas, producing an unprecedented need for
    efficient water use in irrigated agriculture. In contrast, irrigation is often
    conducted as full irrigation to reach soil water content near field capacity (Smittle
    et al., 1994; Jones, 2004; McKeown et al., 2010) in order to increase yields and
    improve fruit quality. To determine the timing and amount of applied water, different
    irrigation scheduling strategies can be employed, varying in their complexity,
    technical infrastructure and required expertise. One option is irrigation scheduling
    based on soil water balance (SWB) calculations (Allen et al., 1998). Hereby, the
    crop water requirement is calculated from the reference evapotranspiration by
    multiplication with a crop-specific, development-dependent crop coefficient (Kc
    factor). Daily values of the crop water requirement are accumulated until a certain
    deficit threshold is reached and the soil water storage is filled by irrigation.
    The SWB calculation approach is sufficiently robust under a wide range of conditions
    (Jones, 2004). However, several drawbacks are involved in this approach (Annandale
    et al., 2000): (i) growth and development are dependent on calendar time, ignoring
    thermal time and water supply; (ii) the Kc factor curves cannot be transferred
    to different regions and to different planting dates in the same region; (iii)
    the approach assumes that water loss is always demand-limited, although it is
    well known that crop water uptake and evaporation can be limited by either atmospheric
    evaporative demand or by water supply; (iv) errors accumulate over time which
    makes data assimilation necessary. Specific crop coefficients for white cabbage
    in German conditions are provided by the Geisenheim irrigation scheduling approach
    (Paschold et al., 2010; Kleber and Mayer, 2014), later referred to as GH, serving
    as one approach in this study. Furthermore, two adaptations of the proposed crop
    coefficients were also applied in the field experiments and will be evaluated.
    Another approach is based on soil water tension and soil water content measurements.
    Soil water status is measured directly to estimate the irrigation water requirement.
    According to Shock and Wang (2011), a major advantage of soil water tension-based
    irrigation scheduling is that soil water tension can be closely related to the
    drought stress experienced by plant tissues. Soil tension-based irrigation is
    relatively easy to apply and irrigation can be automated which is important for
    intensive horticultural production (Jones, 2004). On the other hand, extensive
    measurement programmes can be required in highly heterogeneous soils in order
    to achieve representative measurements. A third option is the estimation of irrigation
    water demand by real-time application of mechanistic crop growth models. In this
    strategy, a model which is able to simulate all relevant crop growth and water
    response processes, is updated at regular time intervals and run as a forward
    model to predict the—crop development and soil water status specific—irrigation
    water requirement. This approach relies heavily on an accurate and well-calibrated
    model. For reliable predictions, soil and plant model parameters, which are always
    site specific, need to be calibrated properly. Angulo et al. (2013) recommend
    deriving crop model parameters from field experiments where growth and development
    processes have been measured rather than from aggregated data of regional statistics.
    Currently, numerous crop models exist but only a few include horticultural crops.
    The mechanistic model DAISY (Abrahamsen and Hansen, 2000), the performance of
    which regarding yield estimation was found to be fairly good (Palosuo et al.,
    2011), provides parameterizations for several horticultural crops including white
    cabbage. Irrigation scheduling for cabbage has been tested worldwide (Cripps et
    al., 1982; Ells et al., 1993; Imtiyaz et al., 2000; Tiwari et al., 2003; Šturm
    et al., 2010; McKeown et al., 2010; Shock and Wang, 2011). However, due to differences
    in climate, varieties and other growing conditions, it is difficult to apply results
    from studies conducted outside of Germany (or Central Europe). To test irrigation
    scheduling under local conditions, white cabbage was cultivated in 2012 on four
    experimental sites all over Germany including the study site of this investigation.
    The Kc factors recommended by GH, along with three variations (one higher and
    two lower levels), were applied to estimate the irrigation water demand of white
    cabbage and the associated yield reductions caused by drought stress. However,
    no considerable drought impact on the yields was observed at any of the sites.
    This calls the recommended Kc values into question and reveals that drought stress
    effects and their influence on plant development and yields of white cabbage are
    only poorly understood. However, knowledge about these relationships is important
    for the estimation of feasible irrigation water demands. To shed some light on
    these relationships three irrigation scheduling approaches were applied in a field
    experiment in 2013 and 2014: (i) SWB calculations based on the GH Kc factors and
    two adaptations at lower levels; (ii) soil water tension-based irrigation scheduling;
    (iii) scheduling based on real-time model predictions. Along with extensive data
    collection, comprising soil water and plant development observations, this study
    compares the applied approaches regarding water productivities, applied irrigation
    water amount and model-estimated water loss. Materials and Methods Site description
    and experimental set-up The experimental site is located near Dresden in Germany
    (51° N, 13.9° E and 120 m altitude). Average annual precipitation and temperature
    are about 667 mm and 10.4 °C, respectively. The loamy sand soil is composed of
    35% sand, 39.5% silt and 25.5% clay (soil depth from 0 to 60 cm), with the sand
    content increasing at deeper soil depths (at about 1 m). The groundwater table
    of the site is located deeper than 6 m. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation
    of the measurement and irrigation set-up at the field site. Figure 1 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Soil characterisation at the experimental site in Pillnitz,
    Dresden showing the four distinct soil layers identified by soil sampling. The
    plant variables measured during the field campaign were the leaf-N-content (Nl),
    the biomass of the stems, the leafs and the heads (denoted by Bs, Bl and Bh, respectively),
    the leaf stomatal conductivity (g), the plant height (H) and the leaf area index
    (LAI) Over three years (2012–2014), field trials with white cabbage were established.
    The experimental design included four randomized sprinkler irrigation treatments
    with each treatment being replicated three times. A linear move irrigation system
    (Gierhake, Germany) was used to sprinkler irrigate the crops of the SWB-based
    treatments. Moreover, an NMC-Pro drip irrigation system (Netafim, Israel) was
    installed in 2013 and 2014 in an adjacent plot for soil water tension-based drip
    irrigation treatment. The drip irrigation system has a discharge rate of 7.1 l h-1
    m-2 and a drip line and drip emitter spacing of 75 and 30 cm, respectively. White
    cabbage seedlings were transplanted into the fields on 15 May 2012 (variety Kilaton
    F1), 16 May 2013 (variety Typhon F1) and on 15 May 2014 with a planting density
    of 3 plants per m2. The plants were fully fertilized according to soil sampling
    and quantification of mineral nitrate. Plant and soil observations Plant data
    collection in 2013 and 2014 included approximately weekly measurements of the
    leaf area index (LAI, measured with AccuPAR LP-80, Decagon Devices Inc.), plant
    height, leaf-N content (SPAD Chlorophyll-Meter, Decagon Devices Inc.) and stomatal
    conductivity (SC-1 leaf porometer, Decagon Devices Inc.), usually with 10 replicates.
    In order to provide an estimate of above-ground biomass, head samples were collected
    three times during crop growth and once at harvest. The samples were partitioned
    into leaves, stems and heads. About 50 heads (in the drip-irrigated treatment
    only 25 heads) were collected at harvest from each treatment to estimate cabbage
    yield. The fresh heads were weighed and a subsample of five heads per treatment
    was dried down to a constant weight. Only centre rows were evaluated to avoid
    border effects. Water productivity (WP, in kg m-3) is here defined as dry matter
    head yield divided by the sum of applied irrigation water and rainfall during
    the growing season. Additionally, continuous measurements (every 10–15 min) of
    soil water tension using tensiometers (T4e, UMS, Germany) were taken in two treatments
    in 2013 (T and D, treatment descriptions see below) and in four treatments in
    2014 at three soil depths. Standard climate data were collected hourly at the
    research site and the precipitation measured by a Hellmann precipitation gauge
    was corrected according to Richter (1995). Model description In this study the
    one-dimensional mechanistic soil–plant–atmosphere system model DAISY was applied
    to simulate crop growth and the evolution of the water balance components at the
    field site. DAISY solves the Richards equation to simulate soil water flow by
    application of the retention and conductivity model of van Genuchten (1980). Input
    data comprise hourly data of wind speed, relative humidity, temperature, global
    radiation and precipitation. The model was set up according to the available soil
    data (layering, soil types) and the management during the irrigation experiments.
    The soil profile in the model has a depth of 2 m and ‘free drainage’ is applied
    as a lower boundary condition. The spatial discretization ranges between 0.125 cm
    at the top of the profile and 0.5 cm at the bottom and is combined with an adaptive
    time-stepping scheme leading to stable numerical solutions and minimization of
    numerical diffusion effects. Model calibration Two different model set-ups have
    been calibrated, one acting as a forward model which is used in the real-time
    irrigation scheduling approach D using the experimental data of 2012 (described
    in detail below), and one as the final model which is calibrated using the experimental
    data of 2014. The model calibration for the real-time scheduling in 2013 and 2014
    was done to fit observations from the sprinkler irrigation experiments in 2012.
    The observational data in 2012 were rather limited and comprised only dry matter
    yields. Therefore, only a few plant parameters were calibrated manually and the
    soil hydraulic parameters were estimated by laboratory evaporation experiments
    on 250 cm3 soil cores. To complicate model applicability for real-time scheduling,
    the white cabbage variety was changed in 2013, as the cabbage variety was affected
    by root flies in 2012. Hence, the real-time irrigation scheduling model is affected
    by a lot of uncertainties and has to be regarded as ‘partially’ calibrated. The
    second model set-up was calibrated applying experimental data of 2014, by a multi-objective
    approach comprising altogether 9 objective functions and over 40 parameters, controlling
    the soil water flow, root and plant development, photosynthetic efficiencies and
    development-dependent biomass partitioning. The multi-objective optimization problem
    was solved with the AMALGAM algorithm (Vrugt and Robinson, 2007). The algorithm
    fits the model parameters to all objectives and their trade-offs simultaneously,
    giving some additional information about the structural deficiencies of the model
    in the reproduction of the measurements and allows the selection of a suitable
    compromise solution after the optimization procedure (Werisch et al., 2014). The
    objectives comprised the soil water tensions at three depths, the evolution of
    the above-ground biomass divided into leaves, stem and head parts (three cuts),
    the plant heights, LAI and the overall dry matter yield based on the field data
    of 2014 (Seidel and Werisch, 2014). This second model calibration can be considered
    to be much more robust than the ''partial'' calibration, as the model performance
    was evaluated on different system components simultaneously and is therefore considered
    to be a suitable tool to assess sources of water loss of the individual irrigation
    strategies. Irrigation scheduling In 2013 and 2014 three different irrigation
    scheduling approaches were tested throughout the growing period, namely the soil
    water balance method (SWB), the real-time scheduling approach on the basis of
    the ‘partially’ calibrated model DAISY (D) and an automatic drip irrigation approach
    based on continuous observations of soil water pressure heads (T). Three different
    SWB methods were applied based on different assumptions about the underlying Kc
    factors. Detailed information is given in Table 1. Table 1. Irrigation treatments

    when soil water tension is below −250 hPa, application of 15 mm per event Soil
    water balance—Geisenheim For irrigation scheduling in Germany, the water balances
    can be calculated using the ‘Geisenheim irrigation scheduling’ (GH) approach (Paschold
    et al., 2010). The approach is a SWB method which uses three to four development-stage-dependent
    Kc factors for the vegetation period defined by the BBCH scale (Meier, 2001).
    These Kc factors were determined in lysimeter and field experiments in Geisenheim
    (Germany). For white cabbage, four Kc values for the following development stages
    are recommended (in spring 2013): Kc of 0.7 after BBCH 13 (transplanting), Kc
    of 1.1 after BBCH 18 (8-leaf stage), Kc of 1.7 after BBCH 111 (11-leaf stage)
    and Kc of 1.8 after BBCH 41 (heads begin to form). According to Paschold et al.
    (2010), the GH approach involves the following three steps: firstly, the soil
    has to be filled to about 90% of field capacity. For cabbage, only the soil layer
    from 0 to 30 cm soil depth is considered until BBCH 18, from 0 to 60 cm until
    BBCH 41 and from 0 to 90 cm soil depth afterwards until harvest. Secondly, the
    amount of water to be distributed at each irrigation event needs to be estimated.
    The amount depends on the soil characteristics, the vegetable and its developmental
    stage. Thirdly, the daily water balance has to be estimated. Thus, the daily potential
    reference evapotranspiration is multiplied by the development-stage-dependent
    Kc value. The water balance will then be summed up on a daily basis until the
    amount of water to be distributed at each irrigation event is reached. The water
    balance is reduced by the amount of precipitation. In 2013, Kc ranged from 0.7
    (transplanting) to 1.8 (head formation) for the highest level (SWB1, recommended
    by GH) and from to 0.7 to 0.8 for the lowest level (SWB3), with recommended irrigation
    amounts of 10 mm (before BBCH 18) and 20 mm (after BBCH 18) per event. Model-based
    real-time scheduling The partially calibrated model was applied to estimate the
    irrigation schedule on a weekly basis in 2013. Once a week on a predefined day,
    the observed weather data and the irrigation events of the last 7 days were assimilated
    into the model. This set of initial conditions was used to run the model for the
    near future. Boundary conditions for the prediction period were derived from historic
    weather data representing average conditions without rainfall serving as input.
    Every time the simulated soil water pressure head reached −250 hPa an irrigation
    event with 15 mm was triggered in the model. The sum of all simulated irrigation
    events in a 7-day period defined the water requirement for the real experiment
    in the next week. Observed precipitation within this week was subtracted from
    the simulated water requirement. Sensor-based drip irrigation In the automatically
    drip-irrigated treatment (treatment T), 15 mm were irrigated automatically when
    the soil water pressure head fell below −250 hPa at 29 cm soil depth. An irrigation
    event was followed by a break of 2 h to allow for the redistribution of the irrigation
    water in the soil. The automated drip irrigation started on 16 June 2013. Evaluation
    of irrigation strategies The aim of every irrigation strategy is to use the applied
    water as effectively as possible, which means here that the applied water is plant
    available and is not lost by percolation, runoff or interception. In crop production,
    only transpiration, which is directly linked to biomass production, can be seen
    as productive (although stored water in the soil may be available for the next
    crop). In this study, the different irrigation strategies are evaluated regarding
    (i) the observed yields, (ii) the amount of applied irrigation water and (iii)
    their crop water productivities, and (iv) the irrigation efficiency (IE), which
    is calculated as the ratio of applied water and plant available water. Furthermore,
    the unproductive water losses of the individual irrigation strategies—defined
    as water which is evaporated from the canopy (interception), from soil or ponded
    water, percolated out of the root zone, and run off during the growing period—are
    estimated in a simulation study with the fully calibrated model to gain a more
    detailed overview of the water losses. The water losses were predicted for the
    five irrigation schedules tested in 2013 and a hypothetical rain-fed treatment.
    Results In 2013, May and June were cool and wet with 383 mm of precipitation from
    transplanting (16 May) until the end of June. Cumulated precipitation during the
    whole growing period (16 May–1 October; 138 days) was 482 mm. In June, ponding
    was observed on the soil surface. Runoff from the plots was not observed as the
    field site is not sloping. The months of July and August can be characterized
    as dry. Yield and water productivity Table 2 shows the fresh head yields of the
    2013 experiments, which were harvested on 1 October; dry matter yields, applied
    water and corresponding water productivities are also shown. A significant yield
    reduction (according to Tukey''s honest significant difference (HSD) test (Tukey,
    1949), was observed for the strategies SWB3 and D compared with SWB1 and 2. The
    observed head yields between SWB1 and SWB3 and between SWB1 and D were significantly
    different. The yield of SWB2 but also the yield of SWB3 and D did not differ significantly.
    Water productivity was highest for treatment T (1.45 kg m-3), which achieved the
    highest yields with a minimum of applied water. The lowest WP was achieved by
    treatment SWB1, due to the very high irrigation volumes. Table 2. Observed head

    The performance of the partially and the fully calibrated models regarding reproduction
    of observed yields is satisfying. The partially calibrated model (PC) simulated
    a dry matter yield of 7.50, 7.44 and 7.41 t ha-1 for the treatments SWB1–3, respectively,
    while 7.60, 7.45 and 6.96 t ha-1 were observed in the experiments. The fully calibrated
    model (FC) simulated a dry matter yield of 10.37 which is very close to the 10.4 t ha-1
    that was observed in the SWB1 treatment of 2014, which served as calibration treatment.
    Additionally, the observed and by both models predicted pressure head time series
    at 29 and 52 cm soil depth of a drip-irrigated treatment of 2014 are shown in
    Figure 2. The fully calibrated model captures the observed dynamics far better
    than the partially calibrated model which uses soil hydraulic parameters estimated
    from soil core evaporation experiments. As a consequence it can be stated that
    the partially calibrated model performs well regarding the observed yields, but
    fails to simulate the correct partitioning of the above-ground biomass (see also
    Figure 3), which results in rigorous underestimation of the leaf and stem biomass.
    Furthermore, results are based on false soil water dynamics. As a consequence
    it underestimates the required irrigation water amounts and drought stress effects
    on yield. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Observed precipitation (Prec),

    by circles. Although in the interpretation of the classical box plot they are
    considered to be outliers, they are not in this case. The predictions of the fully
    calibrated (FC) and partially calibrated (PC) model are depicted by lines The
    fully calibrated model was validated against four other treatments of 2014. The
    head yield was very well predicted (NRMSE = 1.4%), but also the other plant variables
    are simulated accurately. The validation results for plant height (of treatment
    D of 2014) and LAI (of treatment T of 2014) and the corresponding model fits are
    shown in Figure 3. The overall performance of the FC model is very satisfying
    considering the numerous objectives in the optimization and the high number of
    parameters. However, there are still small deviations between the model simulations
    and the observations, but the model performs well enough to be applied as a diagnostic
    tool to analyse the loss terms of the individual irrigation strategies. Evaluation
    of the irrigation scheduling strategies tested in 2013 To assess the effectivity
    of the irrigation strategies the following aspects are analysed: (i) the yields;
    (ii) the overall above-ground biomass; (iii) the applied irrigation water; (iv)
    the resulting water productivity and the water loss components of the water balance,
    namely evaporation and percolation as predicted by the fully calibrated model.
    Table 3 provides an overview of these parameters for the individual irrigation
    strategies applied in the experiments of 2013. As a baseline scenario, a synthetic
    rain-fed treatment (a treatment without irrigation) was simulated with the fully
    calibrated model to determine the minimum values for the individual components.
    Table 3 shows the water loss terms components evaporation from the canopy, soil
    evaporation and deep percolation. Additionally, their sum as a measure of the
    total water loss of the individual irrigation strategies and the differences compared
    with the rain-fed treatment are given in brackets to quantify the additional losses
    caused by irrigation. The irrigation efficiency is defined as the percentage ratio
    of transpiration and applied irrigation water. All variables where calculated
    for the time period between planting and harvest for the year 2013. Table 3. Average

    Furthermore, the applied irrigation water (I) is given along with the water loss
    terms components, namely: evaporation from canopy (Ec), soil evaporation (Es),
    deep percolation (DP) and their sum (∑L). The irrigation efficiency (IE) is given
    to express the amount of irrigation water that can be effectively used by the
    crop as percentage value. The precipitation during the growth period was 482 mm

    99.0 RF – 6.5 – 0 79 83 277 439 Comparing the individual irrigation strategies
    with respect to the yields for the 2013 experiment, treatments can be classified
    into two groups, one with yields over 8 t ha-1, including treatments SWB1 and
    SWB2 and T, and treatments SWB3 and D with yields less than 8 t ha-1. This is
    not a surprising result as the applied amounts of irrigation water decrease from
    410 mm (SWB1) to 106 mm (D) and the yield reduction appears to depend on the applied
    irrigation water. In contrast to this, the highest yields and the highest above-ground
    biomass were achieved in the tension-based treatment, which also required the
    least irrigation water. These findings already point out some of the main advantages
    of tension-based irrigation strategies: the water is automatically applied at
    the moment when it is required and timing seems to play an important role here.
    Furthermore, the tension-based irrigation treatment was irrigated by drip irrigation
    which had lower discharge rates compared to the sprinkler irrigation treatments,
    resulting in longer residence times within the root zone and a decreased probability
    of irrigation water entering soil macropores and thereby bypassing larger volumes
    of the soil matrix. A third advantage of water application by drip irrigation
    is application directly on the ground, which circumvents evaporation and interception
    losses and places the water directly underneath the cabbages where the irrigation
    plume is shaded from radiation-reducing soil evaporation. In a sprinkler treatment,
    water is lost due to wind drift, evaporation within the air and interception on
    the plant leaves. The water reaching the ground is located where the soil is not
    covered by leaves and is therefore prone to evaporation. Thus, the remarkable
    water productivity of the T treatment does not rely just on the irrigation scheduling
    strategy itself but also on the application technique. The lowest yield was observed
    in the D treatment, which is the sprinkler-irrigated treatment with the lowest
    irrigation water amount. Treatment D appears to support the importance of the
    right timing of irrigation events, as almost equal amounts of water were used
    in the SWB3 treatment which achieved slightly higher yields. As both treatments
    are based on the same water application technique timing is the only variable
    able to explain this small difference. This underlines the importance of robust
    and reliable model calibration by inverse modelling. In our case the wrong timing
    of the irrigation events originates mainly from the wrong soil water dynamics
    which overestimate the soil moisture and the insufficiently modelled plant development
    (LAI) which furthermore underestimates the model-estimated plant water requirements.
    The fully calibrated model was subsequently applied to simulate the individual
    treatments to allow a more detailed investigation of the water loss terms. Comparing
    the simulated and observed above-ground biomasses shows a good agreement of the
    model (NRMSE of 4%), while the simulated and observed yields exhibit larger, although
    acceptable, differences (NRMSE of 17%). This is due to the fact that the harvest
    index (ratio of yield and total above-ground biomass) was at 60% in 2014 (calibration
    period) higher than the 53% observed in 2013. Analysing the water losses identifies
    two major loss terms: (i) evaporation from the plant canopy which is increased
    for all sprinkler treatments between +28 mm (D) and +79 mm (SWB1); (ii) deep percolation
    which increases up to +185 mm (SWB1) for the wettest treatment and is also high
    for SWB2 (+103 mm), underlining the massive overirrigation in those two treatments.
    Treatments SWB3 and D lost only a small amount of the irrigation water by deep
    percolation, while no additional percolation was simulated for the tension-based
    treatment. A graphic example of the difference of the deep percolation between
    treatments T and SWB1 is given in Figure 4. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    and irrigation water applied (red) Calculating the irrigation efficiency (IE)
    as the percentage ratio of water that can be used by the crop (ergo water which
    is not lost) and the applied irrigation water allows an effective comparison of
    the individual strategies. The tension-based treatment achieved an IE of 99% while
    in the wetter treatments SWB2 (41.2%) and SWB1 (33.4%) less than 50% of the applied
    water could effectively be used. Summary and Conclusions Crop irrigation management
    is a complex and difficult task in which three questions need to be answered:
    (i) How much water should be applied? (ii) When should it be applied? (iii) How
    should it be applied? Irrigation scheduling is conventionally based on either
    experience, SWB calculations, crop growth simulation models, soil water measurements,
    or on sensing of the plant''s response to water deficits. White cabbage was cultivated
    at the experimental site between 2012 and 2014 to test and evaluate different
    irrigation strategies: (i) SWB calculations using the ‘Geisenheim irrigation scheduling’
    (GH) approach (Paschold et al., 2010) which provides specific Kc factors for white
    cabbage in Germany, (ii) demand estimation by real-time model application, and
    (iii) automated drip irrigation based on soil water tension measurements. Irrigation
    based on the partially calibrated mechanistic crop growth model resulted in the
    lowest yields (but yield did not differ significantly from treatment SWB3) due
    to the underestimated soil water dynamics and crop development, but still performed
    better than the sprinkler irrigation treatments (SWB1 and SWB2) regarding water
    productivity or irrigation efficiency. Performance of the model can be drastically
    increased if more measures (higher resolution and further plant variables) of
    crop growth and soil water dynamics are included in the optimization task, resulting
    in better prediction of the required irrigation water amounts and application
    timing. However, extensive data collection is required and disqualifies this approach
    for everyday irrigation practice in farming. Nevertheless, fully calibrated models
    serve as powerful tools for detailed investigation of irrigation strategies and
    associated potential water losses, which are becoming more and more important
    under the increasing demand for high-yielding water-efficient horticultural production.
    With these challenges ahead, common approaches should be evaluated properly and
    new approaches need to be tested. To improve simulation reliability and enhance
    model calibration and validation results, long-lasting experiments with the same
    variety are required. Considering that the treatments SWB3 and D estimated realistic
    irrigation water demands but resulted in the lowest yields and the sprinkler treatments
    with higher yields required far more water, this proved the importance of correct
    timing, application rate and application technique to achieve highly efficient
    irrigation strategies. Moreover, the target wetness of the soil in the root zone
    in the ‘Geisenheim’ methodology (90% of the available water capacity) could be
    too high and neglects the fact that plant water uptake is mainly driven by pressure
    gradients between the soil and the root system (Jury et al., 2011). The soil water
    tension at a certain soil water content on the other hand depends strongly on
    the site-specific soil and can already be high (more sandy soils), causing reduced
    uptake rates, or be still very low (more clay content). However, an extended observation
    strategy is required to analyse possible reasons in further detail and to make
    site-specific adjustments. These extended observations should include measurements
    of evapotranspiration using lysimeters, Bowen ratio or eddy covariance approaches
    to define the real transpiration rates and support model calibration. Additional
    soil water content measurements could also help to define the water balance, but
    measurements with three different capacitance probes failed in the 2013 experiments,
    probably due to the high background electrical conductivity in the clayey soil
    layers. A fully calibrated mechanistic crop growth model was applied as a diagnostic
    tool to analyse the effectivity of the tested irrigation strategies and define
    the major sources of water losses. Most of the water is lost by percolation for
    the wet sprinkler treatments SBW1 and SWB2, while evaporation from the crop canopy
    is the main source in the treatments SBW3 and D. Percolation water losses, especially,
    are not only costly, but lead at the same time to negative off-site effects like
    fertilizer leaching or groundwater pollution which should be avoided. Water losses
    by canopy evaporation can only be circumvented by microirrigation strategies (Madramootoo
    and Morrison, 2013), such as drip irrigation, which proved to be superior in the
    2013 experiments as almost no irrigation water was lost and the highest yields
    and above-ground biomasses were achieved. The performance of the fully calibrated
    model as a predictive tool for real-time irrigation scheduling needs to be tested
    in future experiments. Furthermore, the shortcomings of the models need to be
    analysed in order to gain further knowledge about the main driving processes controlling
    the drought stress response of white cabbage under German growing conditions.

    Abstract From last decade, Big data analytics and machine learning is a hotspot
    research area in the domain of agriculture. Agriculture analytics is a data intensive
    multidisciplinary problem. Big data analytics becomes a key technology to perform
    analysis of voluminous data. Irrigation water management is a challenging task
    for sustainable agriculture. It depends on various parameters related to climate,
    soil and weather conditions. For accurate estimation of requirement of water for
    a crop a strong modeling is required. This paper aims to review the application
    of big data based decision support system framework for sustainable water irrigation
    management using intelligent learning approaches. We examined how such developments
    can be leveraged to design and implement the next generation of data, models,
    analytics and decision support tools for agriculture irrigation water system.
    Moreover, water irrigation management need to rapidly adapt state-of-the-art using
    big data technologies and ICT information technologies with the focus of developing
    application based on analytical modeling approach. This study introduces the area
    of research, including a irrigation water management in smart agriculture, the
    crop water model requirement, and the methods of irrigation scheduling, decision
    support system, and research motivation. Similar content being viewed by others

    save it. Water is the main limiting factor of agricultural development in semi-arid
    and arid climates. It is a critical input for enhancing agricultural productivity.
    Arthur Keith said that the advancement of agriculture is the first major step
    for civilized life [1]. Even after six decades of planned development, agriculture
    has played an important role in the Indian economy. However, the agriculture sector
    of India has been transformed via the effective deployment of Information and
    Communication Technologies (ICTs) in traditional to modern practices which provide
    various services (such as- IoT agriculture, smart water management, soil management,
    plant diseases, crop management, geo-spatial image and livestock monitoring).
    In India, the demand of water for the agriculture and industry sectors is continuously
    increasing to fulfill the needs of 1.366 billion people. Central Indian Punjab
    is well-known for its agricultural activities and has occupied a high percentage
    of the land area all over India, and its agricultural production mainly depends
    on irrigation. Punjab has 97.95% highest gross irrigation of the total cropped
    area [2]. Recently, the achievement of the Green Revolution is endangered by a
    significant decline in water resources. As a result, water conservation and precision
    agriculture are becoming vital issues in tropical climate areas. Wheat and Maize
    are the most commonly cultivated crops and have high water consumption in Punjab,
    India. The major challenge in agriculture sustainability and dawdling is due to
    climate change; therefore, every drop of freshwater needs to be utilize effectively
    and efficiently. To overcome these challenges, the multivariate, complex, and
    unpredictable agricultural ecosystems must be well understood by continuously
    analyzing, measuring, and monitoring several physical aspects and phenomena [3].
    New technologies and knowledge can help in this complex decision-making. The fundamental
    idea is that the DSS should serve as a farm management tool, supporting farm managers
    in making decisions on irrigation, whether to irrigate and, if so, which field
    with how much water. Wani et al. [4] presented a thorough investigation to evaluate
    the possibility of using Machine Learning models to identify plant diseases. In
    the early twentieth century, irrigation is the most crucial practice no doubt
    and needs effective utilization. Farmers required to predict the need of water
    for the crops, to confirm the data provided by agricultural weather stations or
    to get insight the free water surface evaporation in lakes or dams. Agricultural
    irrigation scheduling is becoming a very important managerial activity whose ultimate
    purpose is to achieve effective and efficient utilization of water. The primary
    objective of good irrigation scheduling is to apply the right amount of water
    at right time. Irrigation scheduling improves the water use efficiency and focus
    on evapotranspiration (ET) estimation methods for understanding of spatial variations
    of ET. It determine irrigation applications such as identifying the water balance
    component, integrated various sensing technologies into irrigation scheduling
    models and control, new improved sensor technology and integrated water quality
    constraints into irrigation scheduling and control [5]. Figure 1 presents the
    six identified relevant works, indicating the smart water management related research
    work such as crop water modeling, soil monitoring, water quality, drones field
    monitoring, weather forecasting, and irrigation scheduling. Fig. 1 Smart water
    management in smart agriculture Full size image The ultimate irrigation potential
    of India has been estimated to be 139.5 million ha, comprising 58.5 million ha
    from major and medium schemes, 15 million ha from minor irrigation schemes, 66
    million ha from groundwater exploitation, and an estimated 77 million ha beyond
    2025 from freshwater use for irrigation [6]. It is approximated that after gaining
    the full potential of the irrigation, nearly 50% of the total cultivated area
    will hold out rain-fed. Irrigation is the most important factor for escalating
    the agricultural production of plants. It is essential to determine the quantity
    of water to get the optimal benefits from the irrigation, which depends on some
    factors such as the environment, type of crop, subsurface geo-hydrological condition,
    and the stage of its growth. The questions arise in the irrigation scheduling
    are as follows: (i) How to apply irrigation water?, (ii) How much to irrigate?,
    (iii) When to irrigate. Currently, irrigation decision-making systems are enforced
    to the agricultural field aiming for specific crop at a given area [7]. It is
    difficult to be practiced to different crops and areas. Under the growing environment,
    the amount of irrigation is defined as the depth of water required to meet the
    crop water loss through evapotranspiration. It can be obtained via prediction
    using indirect channels or field measurement techniques. However, the amount and
    timing of water have major impact on quality of crop and its yield. Several methods
    are applied for the irrigation scheduling such as pan evaporation, soil moisture
    basis, leaf water potential, and based on growth-stages. The demand of water can
    be fulfill by full or partial irrigation in all methods. 1.1 Motivation As technology
    rapidly spread in a few decades, precision agriculture is the key to fostering
    a new revolution in Irrigation scheduling. The United Nations statistical data
    indicate that agriculture consumes 70% of the overall use of water worldwide,
    compared with 20% for industry and 10% for domestic use [8]. To ensure the proper
    use of water supplies in irrigation we need more effective technologies. Automatic
    irrigation scheduling techniques replaced manual irrigation which was based upon
    crop water estimation. The crop evapotranspiration can be determined by weather
    parameters such as max–min temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiations,
    and even the crop factors such as the stage of growth, crop height, and the soil
    properties for the development of irrigation scheduling. The machine learning
    and deep learning advanced technologies provide direction and motivation to propose
    a novel application on crop water modeling. The influence of several factors on
    crop yields and temperature, precipitation have been found to have maximum influence
    on the yields of different crops [9]. 2 Reference Evapotranspiration ET “Evapotranspiration
    contains two processes, evaporation in which water is lost from the soil and plant
    surface, and transpiration from plant surfaces to the atmosphere” [10]. The water
    irrigation is enforced to match the needs of evapotranspiration of crop. Therefore,
    the irrigation scheduling needs to estimate the daily crop evapotranspiration
    accurately. Evapotranspiration of crops differs significantly over the growing
    season mainly due to alterations in climatic conditions and crop cover. It also
    varies among the crops. The information about crop water demand (i.e., ET) is
    a crucial practical consideration in the planning, developing, and working of
    water and irrigation management systems. Figure 2 presented the concept of ET
    . Table 1 presented the ET that affecting by weather element. The reference evapotranspiration
    is approximated from meteorological data (humidity, temperature, wind run/wind
    speed, sunshine hours/solar radiation) by using the Penman-Monteith equation.
    However, the adjusted pan evaporation measurements are also used. Fig. 2 Reference
    evapotranspiration (ET ) process Full size image 2.1 Factors Affecting ET Climate
    and weather play crucial role in determining long-term and day-to-day activities
    in the agriculture. The demand of crop water is determined largely by weather
    variables. Rainfall is the foremost weather variable that affects the water resources
    development planning, irrigation planning and agricultural cropping. The main
    climatic/weather components crucial for agriculture are rainfall, maximum/minimum
    temperature, solar radiation, sunshine duration, humidity, photo-period or sunshine
    hour, wind speed, and night temperature [11] as depicted in Fig. 3. Table 2 shows
    the different empirical methods with weather parameters for estimation of ET .
    Weather elements controls the crop water demand and crop ET. The ET depends upon
    the different weather elements such as humidity, temperature, sunshine hour, solar
    radiation, wind speed, etc. It is also affected by rainfall. The weather elements
    affect ET as follows: Table 1 Weather affecting parameters Full size table Fig.
    3 Factors affecting evapotranspiration Full size image 2.2 FAO ET Estimation Method
    There are various mathematical models used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration
    (ET ). The updated procedures for calculating the ET were introduced by FAO. The
    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recommends the method for calculating
    the ET are as follows: Although, the method FAO-56 Penman–Monteith (Allen et al.
    1998) [10] is the most dominant as compared to others empirical methods [20, 21].
    But, it requires several climatic data factors [22]. The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith
    (FAO-PM56) [10] has been broadly used to analyze ET from meteorological factors
    and it is suggested as the standard technique by the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations (FAO) [23] and calculated by Eq. (1). (1) where, ET is the
    reference evapotranspiration ;  = slope of saturation vapor pressure function
    (kPa °C ); R = net radiation (MJ ); = psychometric constant (kPa °C−1); G = soil
    heat flux density (MJ ); W = average 24-h wind speed at 2 m height ; T = mean
    air temperature (°C); e = actual vapour pressure(kPa); e = saturation vapour pressure(kPa);
    and (e ) = vapour pressure deficit (kPa). However, ET can be determined accurately
    by this method, large scale meteorological data requirement at specific spatio-temporal
    scales (vapor pressure deficit, wind speed, minimum and maximum air temperatures,
    and solar radiation) are quite often not available in many developing countries
    [24]. Thus, the alternate models are needed to estimate ET when the available
    data are either insufficient or limited. So, it is important to explore a simpler
    model to calculate ET using fewer weather properties and a reasonable precision.
    The need of crop water depends on some factors: crop growth/stages, crop type
    and the climate are given in detail [25]: Table 2 ET estimation empirical methods
    Full size table 3 Crop Evapotranspiration ET “The crop evapotranspiration denoted
    as ET ,is the crop water requirements or crop water need.” Fig. 4 Various crop-growth
    developement stages Full size image The need for crop water is the depth (or quantify
    of water required to cope with the loss of water through evapotranspiration. In
    other words, water needs to be cultivated optimally by different crops. Crop-growth
    models were developed to improve the understanding of crop dynamics and to predict
    crop growth and production under various agronomic conditions [35]. The continuous
    monitoring of the soil status water, the conditions of crop growth, and its spatial
    and temporal patterns will help in irrigation and precision water planning. Evaporation
    and transpiration variations in the field and grass crops can be integrated into
    dual crop coefficient or single crop coefficient (K ): a soil evaporation coefficient
    (K ) and a basal crop (K ) and calculated by Eq. (2). (2) 3.1 Climate Based ET
    The combination of two different processes by which water evaporates from the
    soil surface and transpiration from the plant is referred as evapotranspiration.
    It is determined by climatic factors including solar radiation, temperature, wind,
    and humidity as well as environmental factors. The evaporation account for approximately
    10% of the overall evapotranspiration and the transpiration of crops constitutes
    the remaining 90%. Hence, there is a need for crop water in hot, dry, windy, and
    sunny areas. For the lowest values when the wind is cold, humid, and cloudy, with
    little to no wind. Climate impact on crop water requirements is determined by
    reference crop evapotranspiration ET and generally expressed per unit of time
    in millimeters., e.g. mm/day, mm/month, or mm/season. 3.1.1 Crop Type The effect
    of the crop type in daily crop water requirements is often referred to as a fully
    grown crop; Plant height has reached maximum; Plants cover the ground optimally;
    probably they began to flowering or developing to set grain; The water demand
    is greatest when the crop is fully cultivated. Their water needs are called the
    “peak period”. The type of crop that has also affected the total growing duration
    of crop development is known by seasonal crop water need and can be obtained.
    The best possible local data can be obtained on the duration of the total seasons
    of the various plants cultivated in a region. Such data can be collected from,
    for example, the seed supplier, the Extension Service, the Irrigation Department,
    or the Ministry of Agriculture. Fig. 5 Irrigation methods Full size image 3.1.2
    Growth Stages of the Crop While planting and in the initial stage, evaporation
    is more essential than transpiration. When the crop is fully developed, the need
    for crop water is estimated to be 50% during the mid-season phase. At the stage
    of development, the crop demand moderately increases from 50% of the maximum crop
    water requirement to the maximum crop water. Thus, the maximum amount of crop
    water is extended to the end of crop development stage, which is the starting
    of mid-season stage. The value of K depends on different factors such as canopy
    cover density, agriculture operations, weather variable, type of crop, soil moisture,
    and growth stage [10]. The idea of crop coefficient K is proposed by Jensen [36]
    and has been improved by many researchers [37, 38]. However, K method has the
    capability to determine the actual crop evapotranspiration ET precisely. According
    to the FAO methodology, the four growing stages of a crop are the initial stage,
    crop development stage, mid-season stage, and end-season stage (Allen et al. 1998)
    [10]. The crop coefficient method can be expressed as follows: The two-step crop
    coefficient K reference evapotranspiration has been a successful method to predict
    the evapotranspiration (ET) and crop water requirements. The total growing period
    is divided into 4 growth stages shown in Fig. 4 [39]: The initial stage the period
    ranges from transplanting or sowing till crop covers the 10% of ground. The crop
    development stage the period begins at the completion of the initial stage and
    remains until the full ground has been covered (ground cover 70–80%). It does
    not certainly mean that the crop is at its maximum height. The mid-season stage
    the period begins at the completion of the crop development stage and remains
    till maturity; it consists grain-setting and flowering. The late-season stage
    the period starts at the completion of mid-season stage and remains until the
    last day of the harvest; it consists ripening. (3) where ET represents the requirement
    of crop water (mm d ), ET the reference crop water requirement (mm d ), and K
    the crop coefficient and calculated by Eq. (3). Besides, Kingra et al. (2004)
    computed crop water requirement for Wheat and transplanted Rice at Ludhiana, reported
    that the Wheat crop used about 315 mm water whereas the rice crop used about 780
    mm water during its growing season [40]. Saggi et al. [41] collected the K values
    as case study from Punjab agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana and estimated
    the ET for two crops. The K values of Wheat crop were 0.4, 1.15 & 0.4 while for
    Wheat were 0.5, 1.36, 1.42, and 0.42 for the initial, mid and last stage of growth
    respectively. The length of time (days) for four seasons of Wheat were 29, 55,
    14 32 days while for Wheat 24, 46, 35, 42 days. The K values of Maize crop were
    0.7, 0.85, 1.15 & 1.05 for the initial, mid, and end-stage of growth respectively.
    The length of time (days) for four seasons of Maize were 35, 18, 17, and 15 days
    used in different stages. Detail of selected crops and period of data for the
    study. 4 Irrigation Scheduling In 1996, Howell explored the effects on water use
    and irrigation scheduling [42]. It is an application mechanism that can lead to
    the effective and efficient use of water. This efficiency can be enhanced by using
    advanced methods of irrigation. However, even in advanced irrigation methods,
    irrigation scheduling at the farm level is required. It is necessary when rainfall
    is deficient to remunerate for the water lost by evapotranspiration. The irrigation
    water need is described as the crop water requirement minus the fruitful rainfall.
    It is defined in mm/month or mm/day. The main goal of good irrigation scheduling
    is to apply the correct amount of water at the right time, and make sure that
    water is accessible when the crop requires it. According to predetermined schedules,
    the irrigation water is supplied to the cultivation by keep track of the following
    [43]: The status of soil water; The need of crop water. Fig. 6 Types of irrigation
    scheduling Full size image The purpose of our research work is to present, analyze,
    and optimize some measure of performance of the crop production under a set of
    specified conditions, such as the limited or unlimited total volume of water for
    the growing season. The main factors that influence the solution and implementation
    of the irrigation scheduling problem are the characteristics of climate soil,
    crop, irrigation water, and irrigation technology. Judicious usage of water for
    crop production needs knowledge of water quality, soil, weather, crop, and drainage
    situation. The increase in efficiency of pumping systems and conveyance need to
    review. The soil types and climatic conditions have a considerable effect on the
    major practical aspects of irrigation such as how much amount of water should
    be supplied and when to a selected crop. A time-consuming and complex process
    is a precise estimation of the irrigation schedule [25]. However, the advent of
    advanced technology has made it simpler and the water supply can be scheduled
    precisely to meet the water requirements of cultivation. The timing for irrigation
    applications can be fixed dates or on flexible dates. The quantity should not
    exceed the crop requirements per application, including the leaching of salts;
    otherwise, any excess water would not only reduce the efficiency of its usage
    but can hinder the crop development. Standard irrigation schedule performance
    metrics are crop yields and net benefits per unit area. The optimal irrigation
    schedule is any schedule that optimizes the adopted output measurement while meeting
    several defined constraints. Any schedule that optimizes the adopted measure of
    performance while satisfying some specified constraints is the optimal irrigation
    schedule. 4.1 Methods of Irrigation Scheduling Different techniques can be apply
    to the plants with irrigation water and each approach has its benefits and limitations.
    In this context, the best approach to accommodate local conditions should be taken
    into account. Earlier, the primary irrigation method is applied via the source
    of supply such as a bucket watering or a well. Although, it is a time-consuming
    method. More advanced water application methods are used in larger areas where
    irrigation is needed. The suitability of several irrigation methods, i.e. sprinkler,
    surface, or drip irrigation, depends on the following aspects: Natural conditions,
    type of crop, type of technology, previous experience with irrigation, required
    labor inputs and costs and benefits. Surface irrigation may be categorized based
    on mode of water application as depicted in Fig. 5. [44] and Fig. 6 shown the
    different types of irrigation methods. Table 3 presented the different types of
    irrigation methods, advantages and their applications. 4.1.1 Border Irrigation
    Surface irrigation is where the water is applied to the surface of field by gravity
    flow. The water is applied into small channels (furrows) or complete surface is
    flooded with water (basin irrigation) or strips of land (borders). Border irrigation
    is a modern method of surface irrigation. Borders are uniformly graded strips
    of land and long, set apart by earth bunds. They are also known as border strips.
    There are several ways to fed the irrigation water to the border such as by using
    small gates, launching the channel bank, using spiles or siphons. A sheet of water
    is guided by the earth bunds and flows down the slope of the border. It is mostly
    suited to generate long uninterrupted field lengths for facility of machine operations
    in the huge mechanized farms. Borders can be up to 3-30m wide and at least 800m
    in length depend on several factors. It is less applicable to farms on small-scale
    consisting animal-powered cultivation techniques or hand labor. 4.1.2 Sprinkler
    Irrigation It is equivalent to natural rainfall, where water is pumped using a
    pipe system and then rotating sprinkler heads used to spray onto the crops. Further,
    the spray is applied into the air via sprinklers to breaks it into small drops
    of water that fall on the ground. The sprinklers, pump supply system, and operating
    conditions must be developed to apply the water uniformly. It is well suited for
    the most field, row, and tree crops. Water can be sprayed under or over the crop
    canopy. Although, large sprinklers are not suggested for delicate crops such as
    lettuce due to the large size water drops generated by the sprinklers can harm
    the crops. Table 3 Different types of irrigation systems Full size table 4.1.3
    Drip Irrigation It involves application of dripping water to the soil from a small
    diameter plastic pipe systems attached with outlets called emitters or drippers
    at very low rates (2–20 l/h). It is also called as trickle irrigation. Water is
    applied very close to plants so that only part of the soil in which the roots
    grow is wetted, instead of sprinkler and surface irrigation, which consists wetting
    the complete soil profile [25]. It is well suited for trees, vine crops and row
    crops (vegetables, soft fruit), where one or more emitters can be given for each
    plant. It is considered for high-value crops only due to high capital costs required
    for installation of a drip system. 4.1.4 Need of Irrigation Scheduling Hydrological,
    climatologist, and agronomical processes play an significant part in the development
    of irrigation agriculture production. These studies were mainly developed to estimate
    daily, weekly, or monthly evapotranspiration. The precise approximation of evapotranspiration
    is an important process that plays a key role in crop planning, deployment and
    production of irrigation systems. In recent years, several approaches have been
    developed to overcome the problems and obstacles that occur with smart farming,
    such as species recognition, yield prediction, disease detection, drought, crop
    productivity problems and irrigation management. So, there is a great need to
    explore more research studies to enhance the scalability of irrigation scheduling
    based on advanced data analytic and machine learning. Some research has been done
    in the decision support system to improve the right decision on agriculture data.
    5 Decision Support System The idea of a decision support system (DSS) for irrigation
    water management is introduced in the 1970’s to assist users in complex decision-
    making processes and efficient use of irrigation water at the farm level [53].
    Decision support system (DSS) has great potential in agriculture era, if the water
    irrigation management research is combined with the modeling approach using machine
    learning analytics and agriculture statistical, the research level will be achieved
    in different levels of the agricultural development sector. The decision support
    system for crop water irrigation scheduling based on crop water model by estimation
    of evapotranspiration as weather parameter, historical dataset, and using of different
    Irrigation water management methods. The decision support system is an integrated
    approach to solve complex problems, combining the computer calculation and data
    storage capacities with human language and perception, support of mathematical
    model statistics, providing decision-maker. It is known as a primary tool in management
    for better decision making and environmental resources. In 1985, Guariso et al.
    firstly introduced the concept of DSS. Various researchers surveyed the advanced
    use of the management of DSS for water resources [54]. Today, it is required for
    the on-farm irrigation water management due to its use of the computer to relate
    soil, crop, and water quality conditions. It can be used for analyzing and determining
    how much water is needed and when it should give next time. 5.1 Statistics The
    statistical approach leads to the process of collection, presentation, analyze,
    and apply the data to make decisions, problems solving, design products, and processes.
    It is very useful for us to explore the description and understand the variability.
    Statistical methods contributed for making scientific judgments in the face of
    variation uncertainty. Russo et al. (2015) Bayesian method is used to estimate
    the hydrological properties and irrigation needs for an under-constrained mass
    balance model. They presented an approach Markov chain Montecarlo algorithm to
    solve for spreading of values for each unknown parameter in a conceptual mass
    balance model [55]. 5.2 Machine Learning From the last decade, machine learning
    and data analytics is a hot-spot research area in the domain of agriculture. Among
    the other definitions, machine learning is described as the scientific are that
    allows the machines to learn without being strictly programmed [56]. Machine learning
    models have demonstrated excellent results for crop-based modeling in recent days.
    There is a variety of machine learning models based on prediction for reference
    crop evapotranspiration. The main contribution of our research prediction, by
    applying machine-learning and data analytics based modeling to predict crop evapotranspiration.
    Fig. 7 Big data based machine learning framework for agriculture application Full
    size image Yamaç and Todorovic [57], revealed the satisfactory outputs of ML with
    R2 ranged from 0.81 to 0.97 [58] by applying several ML models on the climatic
    data. A comparative analysis was performed by Shiri et al. [59] to estimate the
    ET using various intelligent models, namely ANN, ANFIS, support vector machine
    (SVM), and GEP. In the domain of agriculture, big data analytic technologies have
    offered newly predictive models for ET estimation, e.g. generalized neuro-fuzzy
    models [60], artificial neural network (ANN), [61], adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
    system [62], multi-layer Perceptrons neural network (MLPNN), Zaji and Bonakdari
    [63], extreme learning machine (ELM) Abdullah et al. [64], multivariate adaptive
    regression splines (MARS) and least square support vector regression (LSSVM) [65],
    GRNN (2016), ELM, WNN and GANN [66]. Moreover, the Auto-ML technique is found
    to show excellence in application of irrigation scheduling where border irrigation
    and sprinkler irrigation methods are deployed. 5.3 Deep Learning The deep learning
    technique is now practical to address millions or even billions of weights among
    neurons for better understanding of behaviors due to current advances in computational
    power, in terms of software, hardware and parallel processing. It is accepted
    to have established a revolutionary era since it can address the issues that have
    countered AI for a long time. Deep feed-forward neural networks are based on multi-layer
    Perceptrons (MLPs) published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965 [67]. It can
    be used to model the complicated relationship between input and output due of
    its high hierarchical structure model training, construction and feature learning
    [68]. It has been used in the hydrological and agricultural fields because of
    the difficulty of software data availability, costs, and complexity, e.g., approximation
    and modeling of crop evapotranspiration [42], Wang et al. (2018) determined that
    traditional ML and DL models are equivalent as a data-driven artificial intelligence
    method that can be used to model the complicated relationship between input and
    output [68]. However, DL has a benefit over traditional ML, due to wits high hierarchical
    structure model. 5.4 Big Data Analytics Big Data is a fascinating new field at
    the joint of advanced analytics, data science, statistics, and machine learning.
    Big data and analytics have tremendous development benefits in the agriculture
    economy. Advanced big data analytics have improved the tools and technologies
    that changed the way of real-time applications to make better decision processing,
    high-performance platform to efficiently analyze, capturing, storing and managing
    large scale of big data. In addition, agriculture practices are becoming increasingly
    data-derived and data-enabled with the recent development of 5G, artificial intelligence,
    Internet of Things and big data technologies [69]. To obtain insights from these
    data Saggi et al. [70] investigated the state-of-the-art framework for decision-making
    and different methods of integrating big data analytical methods with smart applications
    such as smart agriculture, healthcare, and cyber security. Figure 7 presented
    the framework of big data analytics and machine learning analytics for agriculture
    application as follows: Data sources The domain of data is expressed by variety
    of descriptive terms such as:-structured, unstructured, machine and sensor generated
    data, batch, and real-time processing data, biometric data, human-generated data,
    and business-generated data. Data storage and processing Database technology,
    Storage infrastructure, Distributed storage, Programming model and Data staging,
    collection, pre-processing and many tools for batch and streaming process. Data
    analytics and visualization It includes the machine learning, data mining, statistics,
    artificial neural network, natural language processing, and deep learning models
    for agriculture based applications such as DSS, forecasting weather, crop-soil
    and water monitoring and pesticides detection. Fig. 8 Number of publications,
    article types and publication title Full size image The objective of this study
    is to introduced the several advanced analytic techniques to develop a flexible
    system that would lead to better irrigation decisions (allocation, application,
    and optimization). This study is expected to provide a decision tool that will
    assist irrigators and water managers in determining reference evapotranspiration
    (ET ), crop water requirement (CWR), irrigation water requirement (IWR), and irrigation
    scheduling for more effective water allocation and application. 6 Literature of
    Irrigation Scheduling Agriculture is the world’s biggest water user, that consume
    70% of fresh water in average. However, these percentages will go as high as 95
    percent in few developed nations and Punjab is one of India’s largest contributors
    to the central grain pool. In India, ground-water (GW) is an essential source
    of water supply in agriculture and Rice-Wheat cropping system has resulted in
    significant increase in irrigation water need approximately 73% with GW in Punjab.
    India is a seventh largest subcontinent country by geographical area in South
    Asia, nowadays India ranks 2nd worldwide in farm production and 1st largest country
    in irrigated land area. Water conservation and precision agriculture is becoming
    a vital issue in the tropical climate areas. Central Indian Punjab is a well-known
    for its agriculture activities and occupied high percentage of land area in all
    over India. 6.1 A Bibliometric Perspective of Irrigation Scheduling In this section,
    the articles from Science direct digital database is considered. Figure 8 shows
    the number of papers published from 1995 to 2021 in field of irrigation scheduling,
    reference evapotranspiration and crop evapotranspiration. We have selected only
    elsevier science direct library to find out research articles, where we found
    34,083 results in area of irrigation scheduling, 32,775 papers in reference evapotranspiration
    and 14,261 results articles in crop evapotranspiration (crop water need). Irrigation
    scheduling, ET and ET trends are represented by Green, Blue, and Yellow colored
    lines respectively. Figure 8 shows the article type in which review reports, case
    reports, data articles, mini review, and many more articles. Figure 8 shows the
    number of top-journal publications. Several computer simulation techniques and
    decision support systems have been developed to estimate ET , ET and Crop Water
    Requirement (CWR). It is important to identify changes in the hydrological cycle
    when we want to predict the impacts of climate change. However, current studies
    on climate change must be expanded to cover the entire globe. The two main components
    of the global water cycle are evaporation and precipitation. Methods for measuring
    evapotranspiration from meteorological data include a number of climatology, and
    the physical inputs which is directly estimated in weather stations. Other parameters
    are associated with measured data and can be obtained by directly or empirical
    methods. Meteorological data can be expressed in several units. 6.2 Estimation
    and Forecasting of Evapotranspiration ET The application of Evapotranspiration
    (ET ) in irrigation scheduling is divided into different categories for literature
    section such as statistical, machine learning, evolutionary models, and decision
    support system [42, 71, 72]. We have presented a comprehensive review literature
    for reference evapotranspiration as follows: Fig. 9 Process of DSS for crop water
    irrigation scheduling Full size image Figure 9 presented the process of DSS for
    crop water irrigation scheduling. ET is an imperative aspect of the hydrological
    cycle that is stirring water availability on the earth surface. It is one of the
    significant criteria of accurate quantification of crop water requirement that
    influence various hydrological processes, planing of water management and resources
    [62], and requirement of irrigation [73]. Traditionally, the ET is estimated at
    the field scale, but it consumes lot of time and is difficult to process by complex
    mathematical calculations with various climatic variables. Methods for measuring
    evapotranspiration from meteorological data include a number of climatology, and
    the field inputs which is directly estimated in weather stations. Some parameters
    are associated with measured data, where as others can be obtained directly or
    through empirical methods. 6.2.1 Existing Methods Based on Empirical Since many
    years, various researchers have established reference evapotranspiration ET estimation
    with empirical methods. There are few categories of ET estimation methods: Temperature-based,
    Radiation-based, Empirical, Pan, and many more. Commonly, FAO-56 Penman-Monteith
    method is applied as the scientific, standard and temperature based method to
    estimate the ET [10, 74]. FAO-PM has been extensively adopted because to its positive
    outcomes in a variety of climates across the world. However, it needs a significant
    amount of meteorological data obtained from regular meteorological observation
    stations [75]. To overcome the existing limitation of the FAO-PM model, various
    attempts aiming to estimate ET with limited observed data have been made. A large
    number of studies have focused on estimating ET using empirical methods with limited
    ground-level data such as the Hargreaves and Samani equation, Priestley-Taylor
    equation, and Thornthwaite equation have been used for estimating (ET ) by Tomas-Burguera
    et al. [76]. ET is estimated with simplified or empirical methods (e.g. Lysimetric
    measurements) and it is highly difficult to achieve more precise and robust approaches
    [77, 78]. HS equation is the most simple and accurate approach based on temperature
    [10, 31]. There are many empirical approaches to predict the ET using five mass
    transfer-based models (Ivanov, WMO, Penman, Trabert, and Mahringer), five radiation-based
    approach (Tu, PT, Ab, JH, and Mk), and five temperature-based approach (HS, modified
    Hargreaves-Samani ) (Th, BC, MHS , and MHS ) [79]. Table 4 shows the literature
    of empirical methods for estimation of ET . Table 4 Estimation of evapotranspiration
    ET with empirical methods Full size table Malamos et al. [80] investigated the
    monthly Geo-spatial ET with FAO Penman–Monteith using line, polygon, and point
    through a geometry independent algorithm. They selected various climate parameters
    such as T , u , R , latitude , altitude (m), I . Tegos et al. [81] applied the
    radiation based model to calculate the daily potential evapotranspiration ET with
    FAO-56 Penman–Monteith using T , u , R ,and I parameters. The Potential ET is
    estimated for current and future drought condition using PDSI tool, Spatial, and
    Temperature based models such as Penman–Monteith, Thornthwaite, and Hamon methods.
    They have selected T , u , R , I input variable, and analyzed on MATLAB GUI [82].
    Yang et al. [83] analyses the daily reference evapotranspiration (ET ) using short-term
    forecasting with FAO-56 Penman–Monteith equation, Hargreaves–Samani equation,
    and Reduced-set Penman–Monteith (RPM). The R language is used to simulate with
    various climate parameters including T , T , T , u , RH , I , and Vapor pressure
    (ea). 6.2.2 Existing Methods Based on Machine Learning There have been many studies
    on hybrid models with machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms to estimation
    of ET with few climate parameters around the world. Patil and Deka [85] investigated
    the performance of extreme machine learning (ELM) to quantify the weekly ET in
    the Thar Desert of India. Also, they have showed the comparison of Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN) with three input variable. The ELM model gives slightly higher
    accuracy than empirical, and ANN models. Wu et al. [86] proposed hybrid model
    using machine learning and soft-computing to estimate the monthly ET in south
    China with 26 data stations. The proposed (Kmeans-FFA-KELM) approach developed
    with the three approaches (K-means clustering, Firefly Algorithms, and Kernel
    Extreme Learning Machine model) found higher accuracy using three input variables
    (Temperature , Temperature , and R ). Another study showed performance of six
    remote-sensing based ML models to predict the daily ET in the Andalusian. The
    two ELM and MLP models found higher accuracy than RF, SVM, GRNN, and XGBoost models
    [87]. Stacking and blending ensemble based ML models are used to calculate the
    daily ET with limited input variables. Two-layer ensemble model is build with
    RF, SVR, MLP, LR and KNN models and found higher accuracy in terms of R ranged
    from (0.66 to 0.99) as compared to empirical models [88]. Another, ensemble based
    model is build with ANN, SVM and RF to estimate the ET with geno-types and optimize
    the ET with time series data, and found the correct results [89]. Bai et al. [90]
    proposed ensemble-based four ML models with RF, BMA, KNN, SVM and MLP to calculate
    the ET . The MLP-based ensemble model provides the efficient results. However,
    the ML and DL based models are proposed to estimate a urban ET with Flux Footprint,
    Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. The RF model provides
    slightly better result in terms of R of (0.840) and RMSE of (0.0239 mm) than CNN
    model [91]. Adnan et al. [92] demonstrated the capability of different Neuro-Fuzzy
    methods to estimate the pan evaporation monthly using climatic inputs of different
    parameters obtained from Uttarakhand, (India). Recently, Adnan et al. [93] demonstrated
    the capability of dynamic evolving Neural-Fuzzy Inference System (DENFIS) and
    Least-Square Support Vector Regression with a Gravitational Search Algorithm (LSSVR-GSA)
    for estimating ET . It has been shown that the extraterrestrial radiation or temperature-based
    LSSVR-GSA models are superior to DENFIS model for estimating monthly ET . They
    [94] forecasted the monthly and daily stream flows of poorly gauged mountainous
    watershed with Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm (FGA), Least Square Support Vector Machine
    (LSSVM), and M5 model tree (M5T) models. Heddam et al. [95] estimated and compared
    daily reference evapotranspiration (ET ) using the Online Sequential Extreme Learning
    Machine (OSELM) and Optimally Pruned Extreme Learning Machine (OPELM) in the Mediterranean
    region of Algeria. The OPELM models showed good performances as compared to OSELM
    models. Recently, Tikhamarine et al. [96] combined the Support Vector Regression
    and Grey Wolf Optimizer (SVR-GWO) to predict the monthly ET at Annaba, Algiers,
    and Tlemcen stations in North Algeria. Moreover, the proposed model is compared
    with the existing variants of SVR and showed that the performance of the SVR-GWO
    gives occasionally competitive and very promising results. Maroufpoorb et al.
    [34] proposed the concept of hybrid Artificial Neural Network-Gray Wolf Optimization
    (ANN-GWO) model and predicted the ET for Iran. Further, the proposed model showed
    more efficient and accurate results as compared to ANN and LS-SVR. Mohammadi and
    Mehdizadeh [97] proposed a hybrid of two models Support Vector Regression and
    Whale Optimization Algorithm to predict the daily reference evapotranspiration
    at three stations in Iran. It has been shown that hybrid models outperformed the
    support vector regressions models. Kisi [65] obtained weather dataset from Turkish
    Meteorological Organization (TMO) for 2 stations from 1982 to 2006 and applied
    MARS, LSSVR, and M5-Tree to estimate ET . Valipour et al. [79] collected data
    for the period of (1961–2010) with 50 climate parameters from 18 regions of Iran
    to estimate monthly ET using five models namely (mass transfer, radiation and
    temperature based). Mattar [98] obtained 32 weather stations of data from United
    Nations Food & Agriculture Organization (UN-FAO) known as CLIMWAT for (2013 to
    2015) and presented gene expression programming (GEP) and empirical models to
    estimate ET . Table 5 Estimation of evapotranspiration ET based on ML and EA Full
    size table Tao [99] presented the hybrid intelligent ET model using data of three
    meteorological stations during 1998 to 2012. They used the Adaptive Neuron Fuzzy
    Inference System (ANFIS), Firefly Optimization Algorithm with ANFIS (ANFIS-FA)
    and Penman–Monteith models. Co-active Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (CANFIS) model
    is proposed for modeling the monthly evaporation of Lake Nasser, Egypt [110].
    The Gene Expression Programming (GEP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification
    and Regression Tree (CART), the Cascade Correlation Neural Network (CCNNs), and
    are proposed for estimating evaporation by Yaseen et al. [100]. Falamarzi et al.
    [101] estimated the daily ET for water resources with ANN and WNN models from
    the period of 2009 to 2012. They have applied RMSE, APE, N.S., R metrics to check
    the model accuracy with three input parameters such as T , T , and u . Models
    LS-SVM, MARS, and M5 models have been applied to estimate the Pan evaporation
    for Reservoir and water resources management. They have applied four input variable,
    T , R , u , and R with dataset of period 1986 to 2006 [102]. Another, ANN model
    is applied to forecast the ET for application of real-time irrigation scheduling
    with T , R , u , and R input parameters using dataset of (2011 to 2012) [103].
    Yassin et al. [73] analyzed the performance of ANN, and GEP models to quantify
    the ET with various climate parameters using dataset from 1980 to 2010. The GeneXpro
    Tools 5.0, and Propagation version 2.2.4 were used to developed the model and
    also provide the accuracy on the basis of these metrics MAE, RMSE, R , and OI.
    Gocic et al. [71] forecasted the ET using SVM, FFA, DWT, ANN, and GEP models with
    climate parameters for the period of 1980 to 2010. Goyal et al. [104] explored
    the four ML models namely ANN, LS-SVR, FL, ANFIS, and Gamma Test to estimate the
    pan evaporation for the duration of 2000 to 2010. They have found the efficient
    results with the FG and LS-SVR models using various climate parameters on MATLAB
    platform. However, Chen et al. [105] found the best performance of Bayesian Model
    Averaging Model to estimate the terrestrial ET using KGE and Cubist software.
    Mehdizadeh et al. [106] proposed the hybrid model to estimate the monthly ET with
    GEP, SVM-Poly, SVM-RBF, and MARS models for duration of 1951 to 2010. The performance
    of the applied models is compared with the empirical methods, where the MARS and
    SVM-RBF models give the most accurate results. The hybrid ELM model revealed a
    superior performance to estimate the daily ET at the four major countries of (US,
    Germany, Belgium, and Sweden) using 9 years of dataset [72]. Mohammadi et al.
    [97] proposed an approach that couples Support Vector Regression with Whale Optimization
    (SVM-WO) to estimate the daily ET .The T , T , RH , u , R , and SSD parameters
    are used to build the model and found accurate result with SVM-WO model. The recent
    estimation of reference evapotranspiration based on machine learning modeling,
    e.g. H2O-Deep Learning,Distributed Random Forest,Gradient Boosting Machine and
    Generalized Linear Model [107], Ensemble Extreme Machine Learning, Multi-layer
    Perceptrons-Neural Network, Support Vector Machine [108], Quantum Matrix Product
    State [111], CNN-LSTM and Conv-LSTM used for combine the features and modeling
    of ET [109], Deep learning versus gradient boosting used for predicting the pan
    evaporation [112], In the domain of agriculture, ML offered new predictive models
    for ET estimation, e.g. Generalized Neuro-Fuzzy Models (GNFM) [60], ANN model
    [61], ANFIS model [62], MLP-NN [63] [113], ELM algorithm [64] [90], M5 Model Tree
    [113], LS-SVR , MARS, ELM, WNN and GANN [66]. The DL model and ML model are applied
    in various domains such the COVID-19 analysis [114], proposed a novel method based
    on artificial intelligence (AI) to identify COVID-19 disease [115], developed
    genetically optimized Deep Neural Network [116], Tripathy et al. [117] investigated
    the performance of MARPUF approach and it is found to be better resistant to such
    modelling attacks, image classification using deep learning [118], Artificial
    Intelligence approaches used to classifying various types of cancer [119], enhanced
    the grip functionality of myoelectric hands based on deep learning [120], and
    classifiers for on-line handwriting recognition based on SVM and KNN algorithms
    [121], and a survey for software fault prediction [122]. Singh et al. [123] presented
    the efficient results and reliable algorithm for optimal design of water distribution
    networks.The literature summary of ML and EA are given in Table 5. 7 Estimation
    of Crop Evapotranspiration (ET ) Crop evapotranspiration (ET ) one the most essential
    element of the hydrological system for irrigation scheduling. The crop coefficient
    K method multiplied with (ET ) is most widely-used to determine the (ET ) Eq.
    (3). Different estimations and methods having their own advantages and disadvantages
    are available. For the estimation of ET using Machine Learning, Deep Learning
    and Evolutionary Algorithms, some potential literature work are presented in this
    section. The literature analysis of crop evapotranspiration methods is presented
    in Table 6. 7.1 Existing Methods Based on Statistics The need of precise estimation
    of crop water is an crucial aspect of agricultural planning and there exists several
    methods for determining ET in crop land [124]. The significant field based estimations
    are required, appropriate for monitoring the crop-water status at the land-scale
    level [125, 126]. The FAO-Penman, PM, and 1963 Penman applied to forecasting the
    ET for rice crop using meteorological data by Shah and Edling (2000). They have
    found the crop coefficients for initial, middle and late stage as 1.39, 1.51,
    and 1.43 [127]. The derivation and development of crop K were identified for Castor
    and Maize crops of Rajendranganagar by Reddy et al. [128]. Ko et al. [129] conducted
    study to estimate the crop water requirement for Cotton and Wheat crops at Uvalde,
    TX, USA. Fang and Ping (2013) presented an optimal the uncertainty approaches
    of interval regression analysis and crop water production function for irrigation
    and Penman-Monteith method used to obtain ET . LINGO software introduced to solve
    above model [57]. 7.2 Machine Learning and Evolutionary Models The Back-propagation
    Neural Network (BP-NN) model is proposed to evaluate the crop evapotranspiration
    ET with combination of various climate parameters (T , T , RH , S , RF and crop
    coefficient K ). It is observed that the combination of Eddy Covariance method
    and BP model achieved the best accuracy in terms of R (0.87) and accuracy (91.44%)
    than MLR model [130]. Mehta et al. [131] estimated the ET , ET and K of Wheat
    and Maize crops of Gujarat using climate data. They applied the various temperature
    and radiation based empirical methods to calculate and estimate the crop water
    requirement. It is observed that the accurate value of K for Wheat crop is more
    efficient as compared to FAO-56 Penman–Monteith method results. Whereas in case
    of maize crop the outcomes were found less accurate at Surat and higher outcomes
    as compared to FAO method at Bharuch station. Saggi et al. [41] proposed a novel
    multi-layer ensemble model based on fuzzy-genetic and regularization random forest
    (FG-RRF) for predicting the K and ET of Ludhiana station. They found that the
    models had high performance for modeling K and ET . Table 6 Estimation of ET based
    on empirical, ML and EA Full size table Elbeltagi et al. [132] presented the deep
    learning model to estimate the Wheat ET from 1970-2017 and forecasting the future
    changes from 2022-2035 of Nile Delta in Egypt using Visual Gene Developer technology.
    For calibration R of 0.95, 0.96, 0.97 and for testing R of 0.94, 0.95, 0.95 have
    been found efficient result respectively. Russo et al. [55] presented the MCMC
    and Bayesian algorithms to analysis the irrigation requirements for ground water
    mass balance with soil tensiometer of Rice crop. They have optimized the management
    decisions on crop replacement and increased the irrigation efficiency. The NN
    model and regression model are explored to estimate a greenhouse tomato crop yield,
    its growth, and efficiency in use of water with CropAssist and NeuralWare platforms
    [133]. Maurya et al. [134] developed a novel fuzzy-based energy-efficient routing
    protocol based on automated irrigation system for Maize crop on MATLAB platform.
    The FIS-DSS (Flexible Irrigation Scheduling Decision Support System) is proposed
    to analyze the optimal allocation of water resources of irrigation system. Fuzzy-inference
    and knowledge based user-friendly optimization tool is developed for Wheat and
    corn crops [135]. Chauhan et al. [136] proposed a web-based DSS to enhance irrigation
    water management for peanut crop on APSIM platform. Gavilán et al. [137] measured
    the daily greenhouse crop evapotranspiration for strawberry and found more accuracy
    using empirical methods and sensors based on soil moisture. Tabari et al. [138]
    explored a ANFIS and SVM model performance for Potato crop evapotranspiration
    ET using meteorological data. Yamaç et al. [139] applied the four scenarios based
    on features subset to accurately estimate the ET of Potato crop using ANN, ABM
    and KNN models. Further, ANN and SVM models are also applied to estimate the garlic
    ET by Abyaneh et al. [140] and the outcomes are found accurate as compared to
    lysimeter performance. The need of precise estimation of crop water is an crucial
    aspect of agricultural planning and there exists several methods for determining
    ET in crop land [124]. The field based estimations are required and appropriate
    for monitoring the crop-water status at the land-scale level [125] [126]. The
    FAO-Penman and Penman methods are applied to forecast the ET for rice crop using
    meteorological data [127]. They have found the crop coefficients for initial,
    middle and late stage as 1.39, 1.51, and 1.43. The derivation and development
    of crop K are identified for Castor and Maize crops of Rajendranganagar by Reddy
    et al. [128]. Ko et al. [129] conducted a analyses report to evaluate the crop
    water requirement for Cotton, and Wheat crops at Uvalde, TX, USA. Fang and Ping
    [57] presented an optimal solution to estimate the ET using interval regression
    analysis, crop water production function and Penman-Monteith method with LINGO
    software. Numerous experiments have been conducted in recent decades to investigate
    the possible effect of climate change on evapotranspiration ET . For efficient
    crop evapotranspiration ET modeling using VIP (Vegetation Interface Processes)
    for Wheat and Maize [141], durum Wheat in Tunisia [142], APSIM-Maize model [143],
    SEBAL model for yield, WUE, IWUE and HUE for Wheat crop [144], weighing lysimeter
    for K and ET [145], farm-level operational services in smart agriculture [146],
    crop water model based on Crop2ML framework [147] have been used. The ET estimation
    results proved that the ML and EA approaches performed better than existing classical
    methods. However, several studies have investigated the estimation of ET with
    empirical methods. But limited studies have reported the estimation of ET using
    ML, and EA models as shown in Table 6. 8 Decision Support System for Irrigation
    Scheduling This section considers the Decision support system (DSS) based on research
    that have included ET , ET , and irrigation requirement. An irrigation management
    system can offer farmers with appropriate decision-making tools in order to regulate
    the amount of water supplied to crops. A decision support system PETP V2.0.0 is
    developed to analysis and estimate the potential evapotranspiration ET using various
    empirical approaches namely Hargreaves, Jensen-Haise, Penman-Monteith, Priestley-Taylor,
    etc. Visual Studio 2010 software is used to build the computational tool to estimate
    the accurate results for water requirement of crop [148]. Navarro et al. [149]
    developed smart irrigation DSS for managing the irrigation scheduling. They purposed
    2 ML techniques i.e. PLSR and ANFIS. Maximum and minimum relative humidity, temperature,
    and direction of wind, global radiation, vapour pressure deficit, rainfall, dew
    point are the variables used to predict the daily ET with FAO Penman–Monteith
    method. Zizhong and Zenghui [150] presented a single irrigation system that enhanced
    higher corn production and also provided efficiency in use of water in Northeast
    China. They include climate parameters namely average, max and min of air temperatures,
    max and min of relative humidity, wind speed, and sunshine hours from 1980 to
    2012. Penman–Monteith approach is used to determine the soil evaporation and ET
    . Table 7 Estimation of evapotranspiration ET , ET , and Irrigation with DSS systems
    Full size table The knowledge of the irrigation management has an impact on crop
    water requirements, maintaining water balance and is the practical considerations
    to enhance productivity of crop [157]. Various research work in Punjab have demonstrated
    the requirements of crop water irrigation, irrigation water based on ET and pan
    evaporation, [158], but few studies have focused on Soil Water Deficit (SWD) [159].
    Paraskevopoulos and Singels [151] investigated the integrated content of soil
    water recordings of real-time field into the MyCanesim system to estimate its
    use in 15 sugarcane fields of South Africa for supporting irrigation system. It
    is used to determine the decision making for irrigation scheduling based on the
    status of forecasts of crop, soil water, and the next irrigation date. Ying et
    al. [152] represented the evaluation for summer Wheat and winter Maize cropping
    system for optimal irrigation scheduling. Further, they described topical versions
    of the SWAP and Wofost models for crop growing simulation and obtaining efficiency
    in use of water. Afzal et al. [160] improved water resources management using
    different irrigation strategies and water qualities by field, and modeling study.
    To deficit irrigation PRD and RDI methods are used to estimate the effects of
    waste and fresh water on salinity distribution, soil moisture, and crop yield
    of Potato, Maize in Italy, Bologna through field experiments. The fuzzy, evolutionary,
    and machine learning models are used to develop a DSS model for irrigation scheduling.
    Gaiqiang et al. [135] developed a FIS-DSS software based on knowledge, interface
    for user, and an inference engine for wheat, corn and cotton crops. It is a fuzzy
    interval programming model having multiple objectives and constraints, flexibility
    of model, data processing, and an alternative solving algorithm. The main objective
    is to maximize the economic-based benefits for crop-land in China. The NN model
    is used to train the model with precipitation and historical climate parameters.
    Giusti and Marsili-Libelli [153] developed a fuzzy-DSS to schedule the daily irrigation
    need of crop based on soil moisture as a predictive model and an inference model
    as irrigation decision maker. This model determines the actual need of water for
    kiwi, corn, and potato crops with past irrigation soil moisture, climatic parameters,
    and ET . They used meteorological data including temperature, solar radiation,
    wind, rain, etc. The objective of FDSS model is to reduce the water usage and
    provide the efficient result in terms of saving water up-to 13.55, 18.3, and 72.95
    water units for irrigating three crops respectively. Sahoo et al. [161] proposed
    fuzzy multi objective linear programming approach for planing of land-water-crop
    system. The meteorological data like daily rainfall, evaporation, temperature,
    solar radiation, daily sunshine hours, humidity, wind velocity, and albedo are
    collected from the Central Rice Research Institute, Cuttack. The objective function
    is to optimize, maximized crop production, net return, and to minimize the labor
    requirement for various vegetables and pulses. Reddy and Kumar [162] demonstrated
    a multi-objective method for the optimal crop pattern and multi-crop irrigation
    reservoir scheme by several procedures. Adeyemo and Otieno [163] explored a method
    to solve the multi objective crop planning model by an evolutionary algorithm.
    They have found excellent results in minimizing total water irrigation, maximizing
    the yield productivity, and net income from farming. Irrigation water management
    is numerically intensive for computations and provides model interpretation and
    discretization. Neural networks and evolutionary algorithms demonstrated to estimate
    the irrigation volume and also determined the effectiveness to diminish irrigation
    application and maximize production [164]. Ortega Álvarez et al. [154] proposed
    a non-linear model to recognize yield schemes and water irrigation management
    plannings using the genetic algorithms. Further, they estimated crop yield, gross
    margin and production as a function of irrigation depth. Schmitz et al. [165]
    simulated 92 percent greater production for corn using evolutionary algorithm
    as compared to dynamic programming. Application and web based DSS models are developed
    for the irrigation water scheduling by various researchers. Recently, a web-based
    DSS is proposed to estimate the soil-water balance for irrigation system with
    limited input parameters such as (dual crop-coefficient and meteorological). The
    irrigation parameters are computed through soil moisture and requirement of water.
    A web-based irrigation decision support system is introduced with limited inputs
    (WIDSSLI) for summer corn and winter Wheat irrigation management in North China
    Plain (NCP) [155]. Table 7 presents the estimation of ET , ET , and irrigation
    with DSS systems. Antonopoulou et al. [166] presented an appropriate decision
    support system for crops which is implemented on web-based software. They introduced
    this approach by using the Java and PHP technologies for specific irrigation technique
    and soil improvement instructions. Dutta et al. [167] developed a mobile application
    based on sustainable irrigation DSS. They proposed cloud sensors based approach
    to evaluate the ground water usage and availability of water. This approach includes
    the CSIRO sensor based cloud computing organization and integrated big data that
    includes machine learning technologies. Bonfante et al. [168] proposed an irrigation
    water supply management tool to obtain the maximum yield of Maize with W-tens,
    IRRISAT, and W-Mod approaches. W-Mod and IRRISAT models found more accurate results
    as compared to W-Tens in terms of irrigation water use efficiency. A Climate-Smart
    Decision-Support System (CSDSS) tool is proposed to evaluate the requirement of
    rice crop in Malaysia. They determine a daily crop-water balance based on input
    data (2010 to 2099) and (1976 to 2005) from Global climate models (GCM) and integrate
    with evapotranspiration using MATLAB simulator [156]. Ragab et al. [169] proposed
    a SALTMED model which includes the to partial root drying or deficit irrigation,
    subsurface irrigation, soil nitrogen fertilizer application, fertigation, dry
    matter production, plant nitrogen uptake, and nitrate leaching. For the model
    calibration and endorsement the statistical measurements are used such as R2 coefficient,
    RMSE, and percentage error. The DIDAS software package for irrigation system decision-making
    strategies of drip irrigation systems is developed [46]. A DSS framework have
    been introduced which includes 22 ET estimation approaches using user-friendly
    GUI (Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0) of 133 selected stations of India [170]. Potential-ET
    and FAO56-PM ET are used to estimate the ET in the Geisenheim Irrigation Scheduling
    (GS) for vegetable crops using sprinkler irrigation [171]. Ballesteros et al.
    [103] estimated the ET using FORETO software with Hargreaves Samani (HS) equation
    or the Penman Monteith (PM) and Artificial neural networks (ANNs) models. Modern
    platforms (.NET and Java) software applied to calculate the daily/monthly ET using
    meteorological parameters [172]. There are various crop simulation based models
    exists such as CropSyst [173], STICS (Brisson et al. 1998) [174], EPIC [175],
    DSSAT [176], VegSyst simulation model [177], and CERES [178]. A single approach,
    that can address all operational circumstances (weather information, crop growth
    monitoring, field data, agricultural expertise and infrastructure etc.), as well
    as the associated expenses for farmers which may limit the usage of these systems.
    Therefore, DSS’s for irrigation scheduling have been developed to integrating
    various approaches in terms of (data collection from meteorological), pre-processing
    techniques and modeling based on empirical or artificial intelligence. 9 Conclusion
    Overall agricultural systems modeling needs to rapidly adopt and absorb state-of-the-art
    data and ICT technologies with a focus on the needs of beneficiaries and on facilitating
    those who develop applications of their models. In spite of the vast literature
    available, the subject of irrigation water management and crop water modeling
    for machine learning techniques are yet in its emerging phase. Although there
    is wide literature available on statistics, machine learning, decision support
    system for general manifolds. To estimate crop water modeling on general manifolds,
    we have different approaches available in literature. Moreover, the water balance
    is well-entrenched approach for estimating irrigation amount and time (i.e. irrigation
    frequency) in irrigation scheduling. This approach is simple to use, typically
    inexpensive and very effective approach to estimates the ET , and ET . The major
    objective is to adopt the several approaches to develop a flexible system that
    supports irrigation water requirement system, which may fit into diverse fields
    of operational activities (weather information, field data collection, crop coefficients
    etc.). This study provides an overview of the irrigation water scheduling. It
    also presented the concept of reference evapotranspiration and crop evapotranspiration
    for crop water modeling. It also presents the various methods of irrigation scheduling.
    It also address the need of decision support system and its various approaches
    that lead to irrigation water management. References Keith SA (1948) A new theory

    The technological demands required to successfully practice either targeted \n\

    \  The system \nuses real-time soil moisture measurements provided by an in situ\
    \ sensor network \nto generate site-specific soil water retention curves. This\
    \ information is then used \nto predict the rate of soil drying. The decision\
    \ to irrigate is made when soil water \ncontent drops below a pre-defined threshold\
    \ and when the probability of rainfall \nis low. A deficit strategy can be incorporated\
    \ by lowering the irrigation “refill” \npoint and setting the fill amount to a\
    \ proportion of field capacity. Computer \nsimulations show how significant water\
    \ savings can be achieved through \nimproved utilisation of rainfall water by\
    \ plants, spatially targeted irrigation \napplication, and precision timing through\

    \ \nAustralia is facing a severe water shortage due to below-average rainfall\
    \ received \nover the past decade.  The agricultural sector is the hardest hit\
    \ by this as \nirrigation accounts for almost 65% of total water use nationally\
    \ [1]. Long-term \nclimate forecasts suggest that this situation is unlikely to\
    \ improve [2].  Therefore \n \n www.witpress.com, ISSN 1743-3541 (on-line) \n\

    the agricultural industry must become increasingly innovatively in its efforts\
    \ to \nuse water more effectively.   Two techniques which have been successfully\
    \ used \nto improve water use efficiency include improved irrigation scheduling\
    \ practices \n[3] and the reduction of water application rates using deficit irrigation\
    \ strategies \n[4]. \n     Optimising the timing of irrigation events involves\
    \ being able to sense when \nthe soil water reaches a threshold level estimated\
    \ either directly using moisture \nsensors, \nor \nindirectly \nthrough \nmeteorological\
    \ \ndata \n(for \nexample \nevapotranspiration – ET).  Incorporation of short-term\
    \ weather forecasts can \nimprove the projected need for irrigation and save water\
    \ by increasing the \namount of rainfall utilised by plants [5].  Solving spatial\
    \ and temporal variation \nin soil water dynamics, however, becomes more demanding\
    \ requiring real-time \nmonitoring capabilities (e.g. soil moisture sensors, hydrologic\
    \ models and \nremote sensing), and/or a high degree of empirical soil physical\
    \ data, both of \nwhich can be very expensive and labour intensive. \n     Where\
    \ water is particularly limiting, further reductions in irrigation water will\
    \ \nbe required. This has been addressed through the concept of deficit irrigation.\
    \  \nDeficit irrigation strategies deliberately allow crops to sustain some degree\
    \ of \nwater deficit and sometimes an associated yield reduction through a significant\
    \ \nreduction of irrigation water.  The classic deficit irrigation strategy involves\
    \ \nsupplying water at levels below full ET throughout the season.  In practice\
    \ this \nhas commonly been achieved by either irrigating at the same frequency\
    \ but \napplying less water during each irrigation event, or maintaining the amount\
    \ of \nwater per irrigation but increasing the interval between irrigations [6].\
    \  Where \nwater accounting has been used, irrigation decisions have generally\
    \ been based \non the ‘trigger level’ concept of available soil water. \n    \
    \ The technological demands required to successfully practice either targeted\
    \ \nirrigation control and/or deficit irrigation strategies are currently reliant\
    \ on \nnumerical models which are often underutilised due to their complexity\
    \ and low \noperational focus [7].  A simple and practical real-time control system\
    \ is \nproposed using a model-data fusion approach, which integrates information\
    \ from \nsoil water representation models and heterogeneous data sources to improve\
    \ \noutput resolution and irrigation decision making. \n     In comparison to\
    \ other numerical models which act more in a simulation \ncapacity for testing\
    \ various water-management/allocation strategies at the basin \nlevel, the model\
    \ presented here is to be applied as a functional monitoring tool \nfor automated\
    \ control at the paddock level. It has the advantage that it can adapt \nthe irrigation\
    \ plans in real-time to meet the desired soil water conditions defined \nby the\
    \ irrigation rules.  Model accuracy increases with observation as the model \n\
    learns soil water flow relationships.  Whilst this initial training period may\
    \ result \nin a degree of inaccuracy, this is outweighed by the fact that the\
    \ model can learn \nsoil physical attributes in situ.  Assigning sensors to similar\
    \ soil spatial zones \nthrough an initial training phase removes some of the high\
    \ labour and expense \ndemands associated with sensor technology.  The low manual\
    \ inputs needed to \nuse this technology and the limited knowledge required to\
    \ interpret the output \nare expected to improve uptake by the broader irrigation\
    \ community. \n \n www.witpress.com, ISSN 1743-3541 (on-line) \n© 2008 WIT Press\n\

    \ Management, Technologies and Policies II\n     This paper presents the model-data\
    \ fusion approach to irrigation control and \nhow the technology may be applied\
    \ in practising deficit irrigation.  Whilst field \nvalidation has not yet been\
    \ undertaken, preliminary simulation results suggest \nthat water savings can\
    \ be achieved through consideration of spatial variation and \nshort-term weather\
    \ forecasts into the irrigation decision-making process. \n2 Model data fusion\
    \ in deficit irrigation \nSensor network technologies are proving to be powerful\
    \ tools for monitoring \nreal-time changes in the environment. There is a need\
    \ to aggregate complex data \nfrom heterogeneous sensors, providing a rich, multidimensional\
    \ picture of the \nsystem.  Much work has been done in the field of data fusion\
    \ [8−11], which \ndeals with the functional transformation of data into human\
    \ apprehensible \ninformation.  Studies looking at “situation awareness” focus\
    \ on developing \nmodels based on how humans perceive and comprehend their environment\
    \ and \nsubsequently anticipate potential change [12, 13]. Situation is defined\
    \ as a set of \nenvironmental conditions and system states with which the participant\
    \ is \ninteracting, and can be characterised by a set of information, knowledge,\
    \ and \nresponse options [14]. Situation Awareness consists of three levels of\
    \ mental \nmodels [12]: \n• \nPerception is the process by which a participant\
    \ identifies the status, \nattributes, and dynamics of relevant elements in the\
    \ environment.   \n• \nComprehension is concerned with prioritising and evaluating\
    \ the \ninformation obtained from perception according to their relevance to current\
    \ \ngoals;  \n• \nProjection deals with forecasting future states of elements\
    \ in the \nenvironment based on the awareness achieved in Perception and \nComprehension.\
    \   \n     To provide decision support in the real-time environment, a situation-aware\
    \ \ninformation fusion system must handle problems in association with inflexible\
    \ \nknowledge representation. With respect to the soil hydrologic environment,\
    \ such \ninformation includes the spatial-temporal distribution and evolution\
    \ of soil \nmoisture which are non-deterministic due to complex interactions among\
    \ \nenvironmental factors like soil profile, precipitation, ET, etc. This requires\
    \ a \nsystem with the capability to learn new knowledge and adapt to the environment.\
    \  \nWhat follows is a description of the model-data fusion approach used to develop\
    \ \na simple real-time irrigation control system. \n2.1 A framework for model-data\
    \ fusion \nModel-data fusion is the approach via which an information system learns\
    \ \nenvironmental behavioural models and utilises the learned models to better\
    \ \nrepresent and predict environmental phenomena. Figure 1 shows the framework\
    \ \nof a model-data fusion system. The framework consists of Sensors, Effectors,\
    \ a \nClassifier, a Model Learner, and a Situation Projector; an Environment \n\
    Representation Model which represents soil characteristics, and a Decision \n\

    \ on Ecology and the Environment, Vol 112,\nSustainable Irrigation Management,\
    \ Technologies and Policies II  189\nModel which captures a set of irrigation\
    \ decisions in relation to environmental \nvariables.  \n \n \nFigure 1: \nThe\
    \ framework for a situation-aware model-data fusion system. \n     Sensors are\
    \ data collectors, which continuously observe the environment. \nDuring the learning\
    \ stage, the Model Learner learns a Representation Model of \nthe environment.\
    \ The Representation Model captures empirical relationships \nbetween data inputs\
    \ and outputs. The learnt model is then used by the Classifier \nto identify environmental\
    \ properties in a perception-related process. The \nSituation Projector “comprehends”\
    \ a situation by prioritising information \naccording to how it impacts on the\
    \ current goal.  It also generates a projection (or \nanticipation) based on the\
    \ Environment Representation Model. A Decision \nModel contains strategies to\
    \ fulfil the goal under various circumstances. \nEffectors perform tasks which\
    \ are specified in a decision. The application \ninterface enables a user to view\
    \ information generated at different components so \nas to make decisions (or\
    \ choose a recommendation).  Interactions between model \nand sensed data ground\
    \ the decision making process in a dynamic environment.   \n2.2 Learning the environment\
    \ representation model via in situ sensors \nSoil moisture, rainfall, surface\
    \ run-off, wind, humidity, temperature are some of \nthe important types of data\
    \ that can improve our understanding of the \nenvironment in the context of irrigation.\
    \ The sensors adopted in this research are \nsoil volumetric moisture sensors,\
    \ soil water potential sensors (gypsum blocks), \nsoil temperature sensors and\
    \ an automatic weather station. \n \n www.witpress.com, ISSN 1743-3541 (on-line)\

    190  Sustainable Irrigation Management, Technologies and Policies II\n     The\
    \ Environment Representation Model, is a description of environmental \nvariables\
    \ and their interrelationships, and is used for predicting future conditions.\
    \ \nThe environment is represented as three dimensional soil cubes with each cube\
    \ \nrepresenting a finite element of soil behaviour. One aspect of soil behaviour\
    \ of \nsignificant importance is the relationship between volumetric water content\
    \ (θ) \nand water potential (ψ). This relationship forms what is known as the\
    \ soil \nmoisture retention curve, and is commonly used to estimate the water-holding\
    \ \ncapacity of soil horizons within the root-zone.  \n     Within each cube,\
    \ a gypsum block measures soil water potential. Correlated \nwater potential measurements\
    \ between spatially neighbouring cubes enables \nlocalised clusters to be formed.\
    \ Each cluster of cubes with similar water potential \nbehaviour can be assigned\
    \ a volumetric soil moisture sensor. This approach \nreduces the number of expensive\
    \ volumetric sensors that need to be employed \nwithin the field. For each cube,\
    \ the relationship between water potential and \nvolumetric water content is then\
    \ learnt by the Model Learner during a training \nphase where sensor data is collected\
    \ from the field. This scenario is shown in \nFigure 2.  \n \n3D soil cubic representation\n\

    retention characteristics. \n     Direct measurement of retention curves in the\
    \ field, particularly at such fine \nscale, should provide considerable improvement\
    \ to the understanding of soil \nbehaviour compared with indirect, coarser approximations,\
    \ such as the use of \nreference soil types, which fail to take into account soil\
    \ heterogeneity within the \nfield.  Reference data may also be inaccurate due\
    \ to its measurement in a \ndifferent environment (i.e. the laboratory) and under\
    \ different conditions. There \nis considerable discrepancy between the retention\
    \ curve of a particular soil type, \nmeasured in both the laboratory and the field\
    \ [15]. \n \n www.witpress.com, ISSN 1743-3541 (on-line) \n© 2008 WIT Press\n\
    WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment, Vol 112,\nSustainable Irrigation\
    \ Management, Technologies and Policies II  191\n     Another common approach\
    \ to obtain the retention curve is to use Pedotransfer \n(PTF) functions. PTF\
    \ functions predict the water retention curve from using \nbasic, easily measured\
    \ properties of the soil. Consequently, PTF can be very \ncrude approximations\
    \ and are often only optimised for particular soil types and \nconditions.  \n\
    \     Ideally, the training of retention curves within the field should cover\
    \ \nmeasurements over a significant proportion of the retention curve (i.e. from\
    \ \nsaturation to the permanent wilting point), including the dynamic hysteresis\
    \ \nwithin wetting and drying periods.  However, it is unlikely to be possible\
    \ to \nmeasure the complete range of potential and volumetric observations in\
    \ situ \nduring the training phrase. For unmeasured regions, the curve can be\
    \ predicted \nby using non-linear regression or neural network methods such as\
    \ the Mualem-\nvan Genutchen model [16], to fit the measured data to retention\
    \ curve models \nuntil the relevant conditions have been observed. \n     Retention\
    \ curves are unique for different soil types as they are dependent \nupon the\
    \ physical properties of the soil, such as porosity and particle size. \nTherefore\
    \ deriving retention curves in situ also has the advantage of providing a \ncoarse\
    \ taxonomy of the soil composition of each cube, thus considering spatial \nvariability\
    \ in irrigation decisions. This can be achieved by fitting a model to \nreference\
    \ and field retention curves and then comparing their shape parameters.  \n2.3\
    \ Predicting soil water content \nPredicting how the soil water content changes\
    \ over time becomes an important \nparameter for deciding when to irrigate.  The\
    \ high frequency of data being \ncollected from field sensors offers the potential\
    \ to predict the short term future of \nsoil water content and enables irrigation\
    \ plans to continually adapt to meet the \ntarget objectives. \n     One of the\
    \ challenges in predicting changes in soil water content is that \nwetting and\
    \ drying behaviour is a non-deterministic process which is dependent \nupon a\
    \ number of environmental attributes. Hence, prediction of the soil water \ncontent\
    \ through modelling is complex, as demonstrated by the Hydrus program \n[17].\
    \ Hydrus has not yet been proven to be an applicable solution to support real\
    \ \ntime decision making due to the complexity in the physical modelling.   \n\
    \     We assume that the rate of soil water change can be learnt from previous\
    \ soil \nwater behaviour in the field. A relationship between the rate of soil\
    \ water content \nchange and the other dependent variables such as precipitation\
    \ and ET can be \nlearnt through observation. The benefit of this approach is\
    \ that the system is not \nattempting to learn the physical model itself, but\
    \ instead the relationship between \nsoil water change rate and other dependent\
    \ system attributes. In a sense, it is \nequivalent to the real time learning\
    \ of PTF functions from the field.  \n     With the learned characteristics of\
    \ each soil class, the Classifier can locate \nenvironmental variables in the\
    \ Representation Model (retention curves) and the \nSituation Projector can subsequently\
    \ infer the needs for irrigation by calculating \nthe distance to the refill point\
    \ (θthreshold) for each soil class. Figure 3 illustrates \nthis concept. \n \n\

    \ for irrigation scheduling decisions. \n2.4 Technical-driven deficit irrigation\
    \ decision model \nBesides the soil drying status, the decision of whether to\
    \ irrigate and the amount \nof water to apply at the current time, is dependent\
    \ upon other information \nincluding rain forecasts, ET demand, current water\
    \ allocation and other plant \nrelated factors.  Decision tree learning using\
    \ inductive inference has been the \nmethod adopted for deciding when to irrigate.\
    \ Inductive learning methods \nidentify features that empirically distinguish\
    \ positive from negative observed \ntraining examples. Figure 4 presents the results\
    \ obtained from a decision tree \nlearning algorithm. Each non-leaf node stands\
    \ for a test on an attribute. Edges of \nthe decision tree coming from the nodes\
    \ are values of attributes for that node. \nLeaf nodes are used to represent design\
    \ decisions for selecting a deficit ratio. \nNumbers in parentheses illustrate\
    \ an observation for the class defined in the leaf \nnode. For example, “10.0”\
    \ indicates that there are ten positive observations and \nno negative observations\
    \ for that class.  \n     The decision rules encoded within the model consider\
    \ historical irrigation \ntreatments, and generalises empirical knowledge that\
    \ can be applied to select an \nappropriate irrigation treatment for a specific\
    \ combination of field conditions. \nThree environment variables form the decision\
    \ tree. These variables describe \nwhether a soil cube is at the refill threshold\
    \ point (node “reachRefillPoint”), if it \nis currently raining (node “currentRain”),\
    \ and the probability of expected rain in \n12 hours (node “forecastRain”). Leaf\
    \ nodes illustrate irrigation treatments. \nIrrigation strategies are obtained\
    \ by traversing from root node to a leaf node. For \nexample, some interesting\
    \ rules can be found: \n \n www.witpress.com, ISSN 1743-3541 (on-line) \n© 2008\

    \ tree structure learnt from running a C4.5 [18] algorithm \nfrom WEKA [19] on\
    \ 46 instances of deficit irrigation treatments. \n• \nif the soil cube has reached\
    \ refill point whilst it is not raining, and the \nprobability of the predicted\
    \ rainfall is greater than 0.7, irrigation water \nshould not be applied. Irrigation\
    \ is postponed until the next decision \ntime, for example, in 4 hours; \n• \n\
    if the soil cube has reached refill point whilst it is not raining, and the \n\
    probability of the predicted rainfall is between 0.3−0.7, deficit irrigation \n\
    should be applied to mitigate the risks of water stress on plant growth. \nThe\
    \ pre-defined deficit ratio is applied to the accumulated ET since the \nlast\
    \ irrigation or rainfall event to calculate the irrigation requirements. \n  \
    \   Information fused from various sensors can be used to construct a \nrecommendation.\
    \ The system can also learn and evolve the decision model in \nreal time. For\
    \ example, by monitoring the plant response (e.g. remotely sensed \ncanopy temperature),\
    \ if the pre-defined plant-based thresholds have not been met \nunder the applied\
    \ irrigation deficit ratio, the system can re-adjust to a lower ratio \nwhen similar\
    \ environmental conditions prevail. If required, the irrigation \ndecision model\
    \ can also act autonomously to schedule irrigation events.  \n3 Model simulation\
    \ \nAn irrigation simulator was developed in NetLogo [20] to demonstrate how the\
    \ \nmodel works and contributes to water use efficiency when taking account of\

    \ and Policies II\n     The irrigation simulator uses field data including ET\
    \ and rain gathered from \nElliot research farm (North West Tasmania; 41o06′S,\
    \ 145o46′E) during the period \nof 2 November to 21 December, 2007. This data\
    \ is scaled down to fit into the \nsimulation model with essential variances unchanged.\
    \ The simulator consists of \ntwo agent-based models: \n1. A deficit irrigation\
    \ model, which integrates local weather conditions \nand rainfall forecasts to\
    \ decide when and how much to irrigate, and \ntargeted irrigation control, with\
    \ application to only those areas that \nhave reached the refill threshold point;\
    \ \n2. A point sensor-based irrigation model, which only uses threshold soil \n\
    moisture to trigger irrigation with uniformed application. \n     To exemplify\
    \ the effect of different irrigation treatments on water usage, both \nmodels\
    \ run under the same sets of environmental conditions including ET, \nrainfall,\
    \ soil profile characteristics, and boundary conditions such as irrigation \n\
    rate and drainage rate. A 3D soil water diffusion model is used to simulate soil\
    \ \nwater content changes under these conditions. The soil is represented by 3D\
    \ \ncubes, as shown in Figure 3. The simulated soil consists of loam, clay and\
    \ sand \nat different horizons (Figure 5). The soil diffusion model is a simplified\
    \ view of \nthe tendency of water to move from one soil cube to another, based\
    \ on \ndifferences in soil water contents and soil porosities. Considering a soil\
    \ cube and \nits neighbouring cubes, soil water diffusion can be simulated by\
    \ recalculating the \ndistribution soil water between cubes:  \nT i= P i× ∑1\n\
    n T\n∑ 1\nn\nP\n− ET − DR                                      (1) \nwhere  T\
    \ i denotes soil water content unit for cube i \n            i is the cube for\
    \ recalculation \n            n is the number of neighbours for cube i  \n   \
    \         P is the porosity of soil cube i \n            ET stands for water loss\
    \ from evapotranspiration for cube i (only top   \n            level cubes have\
    \ ET) \n            DR denotes water unit loss from drainage for cube i over boundary\
    \ (only \n             the bottom-level cubes consider DR) \n     Eqn. (1) describes\
    \ how soil water diffusion is calculated in the simulator.  \nEnvironmental changes\
    \ can cause the soil water content to re-distribute. Figure 6 \nalso shows an\
    \ example of how to apply Equation 1 to calculate simulated soil \nwater content\
    \ in cube i.  By iterating all soil cubes, the effect of environmental \nconditions\
    \ can be represented through soil water diffusion.    \n     Point sensor-based\
    \ irrigation treatments apply water uniformly to the whole \npaddock. Rainfall\
    \ is affected by the same environmental conditions as irrigation.  \nWater is\
    \ lost through drainage and ET with some water units retained in the soil. \n\
    Figure 6 shows the accumulated irrigation water usage during 50 time units of\
    \ an \nirrigation treatment with a model initialised to pre-defined soil water\
    \ contents.  \n     In this scenario, 6170 units of water have been consumed as\
    \ a result of 21 \nirrigation events. \n \n www.witpress.com, ISSN 1743-3541 (on-line)\

    \ 7 does not occur under a point sensor-based irrigation scenario. This has a\
    \ \ndirect impact on the amounts of water consumed. Because the two scenarios\
    \ are \nassumed to have identical environmental variables (ET, rainfall, drainage),\
    \ the \ndifference between the total soil water contents (shown in Figures 8 and\
    \ 9) is an \nindication of over-irrigation in the point sensor-based strategy.\
    \ That is, assuming \nproduction is fairly constant above the refill threshold\
    \ point, which water content \nis maintained above this level in both scenarios,\
    \ the extra water applied in the \npoint sensor-based strategy is of no benefit\
    \ to production.  \n \n \nFigure 9: \nThe total water content for the deficit\
    \ irrigation scenario.  \n4 Conclusion \nThis paper introduces an information\
    \ fusion framework to support decision-\nmaking in deficit irrigation scheduling.\
    \ The simulation results demonstrate how \nreal-time data collection may be used\
    \ to improve water use efficiency by \nconsidering future rainfall events and\
    \ practicing targeted irrigation application. \nThe simulation model is however\
    \ a reduction of a physical phenomenon. To \nincrease the credibility of the model,\
    \ data obtained from real-time sensors to \nenhance/calibrate the simulation model\
    \ is required. At present, the simulation \nmodel treats drainage as a constant\
    \ boundary condition. It is necessary to include \nbeyond root zone soil moisture\
    \ sensors to approximate deep drainage to further \nimprove the resolution of\
    \ irrigation decisions. \n     The intention is to consider crop yield models,\
    \ multiple-objective \noptimisation and remote sensing in the next phase of research.\
    \   \n     Field quantification is still required to validate this model-data\
    \ fusion \napproach for deficit irrigation.  \nAcknowledgements \nThis work is\

    \ introduction of precision agriculture increased the efficiency of plant production,\
    \ while simultaneously reducing the production cost. Precision irrigation can\
    \ be \nconsidered as the combination of sensors, computer software and irrigation\
    \ systems. Precision irrigation has reduced water consumption and increased yields,\
    \ and thus increased \neconomic profits. The development of new crop monitoring\
    \ technologies in precision irrigation has been made possible by the imaging and\
    \ analysis of real-time crop condition \ndata. The aim of this study was to describe\
    \ the present state and possibilities of precision irrigation in practice in the\
    \ EU and Croatia. An overview of the current precision irrigation \ntechnologies,\
    \ as well as its adaptive management to the decision-making in agricultural water\
    \ management, represents a fundamental basis for future practical studies in precision\
    \ \nirrigation. \nKeywords: micro-irrigation/flooding; precision agriculture;\

    \ \n1 \nINTRODUCTION \nThe application of irrigation systems in agriculture in\
    \ \nEurope is near 30%, while in Croatia it is only about 2% [1]. \nThe available\
    \ water levels are in constant decline in the \nworld, which urges for the accurate\
    \ determination of the \nexact amount of water required by the crops during the\
    \ \ngrowing season. Precision agriculture is defined as the \ntechnology based\
    \ on the identification and management of \nvariabilities within the agricultural\
    \ field for optimal \nprofitability, sustainability and protection of land resources\
    \ \n[2]. The advantages of precision agriculture in terms of \neconomic and environmental\
    \ benefits are in the reduced use \nof water, fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides\
    \ [3]. One of the \nmost important areas in which precision agriculture is applied\
    \ \nis the management of soil properties heterogeneity, which is \ncrucial for\
    \ most agrotechnical operations [4]. Precision \nirrigation requires the possession\
    \ of soil-related information \nsuch as: texture, water capacity, moisture and\
    \ crop water \ndemand at certain growth stages. The procedures within \nprecision\
    \ irrigation are supported by technical components, \nsuch as sensors and computer\
    \ processing software. \nIn the water the soil is bound to the soil particles\
    \ with the \nforce that the root system must overcome during the water \nabsorption.\
    \ Therefore, water in the soil is divided into \naccessible (free) and inaccessible\
    \ (bound). The forces that \nhold water along the soil particles are the moisture\
    \ tension \n(surface, hydrostatic and gravitational forces), and the \nosmotic\
    \ pressure of the water soil phase [5]. In [6], on \nagricultural lands that do\
    \ not have enough water for crop \nproduction during their partial or full growth\
    \ period, water \nshould be artificially applied. All operations which include\
    \ \nthe man-made and artificial increase of the soil water content \nwith the\
    \ aim of crop production are considered as irrigation. \nAuthor [7] stated that\
    \ thermal remote sensing used for \nthe determination of crop water content is\
    \ based on the \nemitted radiation of the plant in relation to the temperature\
    \ \ndifference between the leaf and stem. It significantly varies \nwith air temperature\
    \ and evapotranspiration intensity. The \nbest method for determining soil moisture\
    \ in potato \ncultivation were studied in research of [8]. The authors noted \n\
    the efficiency of watermark tensiometers for that application. \nHowever, they\
    \ emphasize the need for a calibration curve in \norder to relate the values of\
    \ pressure (kPa or cbar) and \nvolume of soil water content (vol%) to the current\
    \ soil \nmoisture. The same authors stated that Aquaterr sensors were \nsensitive\
    \ to changes in soil temperature and therefore do not \nrecommend their use in\
    \ potato cultivation. According to [9], \nthe efficiency of watermark sensors\
    \ depends on weather \nconditions. The depth of sensor placement should not be\
    \ the \nsame in average climatic years and in years with extreme \nweather conditions.\
    \ Authors [10] measured soil water content \non five soil types with the help\
    \ of electrical conductivity, and \nthe influence of the change in the amount\
    \ of water for future \nsoil mapping was confirmed, similar to measures of [11].\
    \ \nMany authors [5, 12] divided the irrigation systems into three \nfundamental\
    \ methods: surface irrigation/flooding, rainfall \nirrigation/flooding and micro-irrigation\
    \ systems. \n2 \nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF PRECISION IRRIGATION \nResearch related to\
    \ precision irrigation began in the \nUnited States in the early 1990s. The research\
    \ was largely \nbased on the modification of mobile irrigation systems that \n\
    are able to cover a large area and apply a diverse amount of \nwater. Such systems\
    \ were controlled using the input spatial \ndata [13]. Various procedures have\
    \ been evaluated to \nimplement valve control to achieve the desired application\
    \ of \nirrigation rates. It was concluded that due to the cost and \ncomplexity\
    \ of these systems, economic feasibility depends \non large agricultural production\
    \ and does not pay off for \nsmall farmers [14]. The number of studies by European\
    \ \nresearchers regarding precision irrigation increased in the \n2000s and emphasis\
    \ was placed on the purpose and \nperformance of spatially variable irrigation\
    \ rates [15-19]. \nThe studies conducted by [20] and [21] included the \napplication\
    \ of an infrared thermometer mounted on a rain \nwing. These pivot systems were\
    \ used for the data collection \nof soil temperature and plant surface temperature\
    \ for the \ndevelopment of automatic irrigation. Authors [20] concluded \nthat\
    \ the method of modeling the dynamics of crop cover \ntemperature can be cost-efficient.\
    \ Due to the low cost and \nsimplicity of the method, this method became accessible\
    \ for \nsmaller farmers as well. \nIvan Plaščak, et al.: An Overview of Agrigultural\
    \ Precision Irrigation Systems \nTEHNIČKI GLASNIK 15, 4(2021), 546-553 \n    \
    \          \n            \n    547 \nAdditional research conducted in Europe,\
    \ according to \nauthors [15], focused on variations in yields due to uneven \n\
    irrigation. In New Zealand, authors [22] investigated water \nsavings and the\
    \ economic benefits of precision irrigation \nusing pivot systems. Common features\
    \ of these studies \ninclude: the emphasis on system design and control to obtain\
    \ \nspatially diverse applications; the use of global navigation \nsatellite system\
    \ (GNSS) for irrigation control using \npreviously created soil maps; and differential\
    \ irrigation in the \nareas from 40 to 100 m2. Authors [16] focused on the \n\
    development and testing of digital control systems that use \nan embedded computer\
    \ to process and apply transmitted \nradio waves. They used the low-energy precision\
    \ application \n(LEPA) system on the pivot irrigation system. It was \nconcluded\
    \ that pivot systems and LEPA can be corrected for \nthe application of spatially\
    \ different irrigation. The common \nprecision irrigation strategy was to change\
    \ the amount of \nwater rates, and thus the depth of water application. Precision\
    \ \nirrigation relies on the development of the appropriate \nirrigation management\
    \ systems based on the data collected \nabout the crop requirements for water\
    \ and nutrients in real-\ntime. \nThe notion of spatially variable irrigation\
    \ is based on the \nhypothesis that each plant requires a non-uniform amount of\
    \ \nwater due to the difference in root system depth. The yield is \nmaximum if\
    \ each plant receives the exact amount of water it \nrequires, considering the\
    \ within-field heterogeneity [16]. \nThe primary objective of precision irrigation\
    \ is to \noptimize the amount of water in the entire agricultural field. \nVariable-rate\
    \ irrigation in specific locations can achieve \nsignificant water savings [14].\
    \ According to authors [19], \nvariable-rate can produce water savings in the\
    \ range from 10 \nto 15 % compared to the conventional methods. Authors [23] \n\
    even estimated that the potential water savings using \nprecision irrigation can\
    \ reach about 25 %. \nAuthors [24] observed that the potato yield using the \n\
    pivot systems based on the spatially variable irrigation \nsystems can increase\
    \ the yield from 4 to 6 %. Crop modeling \nand spatially variable irrigation have\
    \ proven to be essential \nand effective means of yield management. Two authors\
    \ [25] \nused the CERES model to model maize crops and the \nfeasibility of maize\
    \ irrigation. Spatially variable irrigation \nalso resulted in higher maize yields.\
    \ However, in some \ninstances, multiple authors [26-28] pointed to the fact that\
    \ \nsuch a system might not be profitable for small farmers. \n \n3 \nPRECISION\
    \ IRRIGATION METHODS AND SYSTEMS \n3.1 Surface/flooding Irrigation \n \nThe rirmod\
    \ irrigation model has been accepted as a \nstandard for the evaluation and optimization\
    \ of surface \nfurrow irrigation in Australia [29]. It is based on solving full\
    \ \nhydrodynamic equations and its accuracy is determined only \nby input parameters.\
    \ This model uses real-time irrigation data \nand creates irrigation statistics\
    \ for future use. Using the \nWinsrfr model and the aim model, many authors [30,\
    \ 31] \nused approximate hydrodynamic equations and their \naccuracy was determined\
    \ only for individual situations. \nReal-time automation and adaptability control\
    \ produced \nquality results for managing infiltration time variability. \nAccording\
    \ to authors [32], this procedure ensures greater \nefficiency of irrigation compared\
    \ to traditional irrigation \nestimates, allowing significant labor savings. The\
    \ real-time \ncontrol system monitors the water movement along the \nfurrow. It\
    \ determines the characteristics of soil absorption \nthrough the simulation procedure\
    \ and therefore modifies the \ninput variables (water flow and moment of irrigation\
    \ \ncessation). If the set irrigation parameters are continuous and \nchange automatically,\
    \ it means that the irrigation system is \nadaptable to the conditions in the\
    \ field. \nAWMA Pyt Ltd, is an Australian company that \ndeveloped the aquator\
    \ system for automatic and remote \ncontrol of water resources. Operations assigned\
    \ via aquator \nare transmitted by a device that is most commonly mounted \non\
    \ the base station roof. The control openings have built-in \nreceivers and are\
    \ powered via solar panels. Reverse remote \nreading was developed by authors\
    \ [33] as an alternative \ncontact sensor that serves to monitor the progress\
    \ of water \nentry into the furrows and allow automatic control of water \nflow.\
    \ The camera is located at the field boundary and images \nwater flowing down\
    \ the furrow during irrigation. The images \nare analyzed by a computer system\
    \ to calculate the actual \nposition of the incoming water. \nAuthors [32] laid\
    \ the foundations for the practical control \nof furrow irrigation in real-time.\
    \ The proposed system \nincludes: automatic start of inflow into furrows and its\
    \ \nmeasurement; measuring the water flow through the furrows; \nreal-time assessment\
    \ of soil infiltration and soil moisture \ndeficiency; real-time simulation and\
    \ optimization of \ninterruption time and automatic shutdown of inflow at the\
    \ set \ntime. The system performs all procedures without user \ninteraction. \n\
    \ \n \nFigure 1 IrriPro optimization screen [34] \n \nDecision-making software\
    \ is an important segment for \nsuch a system and includes: continuous flow measurement\
    \ \nusing pressure measurement in the supply system; earlier soil \ncharacterization\
    \ by determining the soil type; and the \nprobability of water infiltration into\
    \ the soil. The IrriPro \nsoftware package was developed to extend the hydraulic\
    \ \nmodeling of a single furrow or an entire field. It uses \nIvan Plaščak, et\

    \ to create 2D \nnetworks of applied depths (Fig. 1 and 2). It then determines\
    \ \nthe flow rate and the end time of the flow in order to achieve \nmaximum effect.\
    \ \nFig. 1. represents an example of the IrriPro optimization \nscreen, which\
    \ lists the parameters for multiple furrows in the \nentire field. The green area\
    \ indicates the zone of optimal \nperformance. Fig. 2 shows the predicted irrigation\
    \ end \nperiods for 84 furrows, considering the heterogeneity of the \nfurrows.\

    \ Irrigation \n \nSimulations of rainfall irrigation/flooding models have \nbeen\
    \ rapidly evolving over the last two decades. The \ncomputer software Space Pro\
    \ includes the known templates \nfor the purpose of selecting the size and spacing\
    \ of the \nsprayers for the maximization of irrigation uniformity. This \nsoftware\
    \ relies on known parameters for each sprayer, such \nas the pressure and above\
    \ ground height. The wind influence \nis usually neglected in the process, which\
    \ impairs the \nefficiency of the sprayer [35]. Two main approaches are \ncommonly\
    \ used: a ballistic approach to calculate the flight \npath of individual water\
    \ droplets; and an empirical approach \ninvolving extrapolation from measured\
    \ parameters. These \nparameters include varying wind speeds and directions, \n\
    pressure and droplet flight path. \nTravgun is the model developed by authors\
    \ [36], which \nuses the irrigation direction to calculate the wind-free pattern\
    \ \nand to determine the six parameters used to adjust the wind \nimpact pattern.\
    \ The information obtained from the model is \nan estimate of the uniformity of\
    \ irrigation application for any \nangle, distance, droplet flight path, wind\
    \ speed and direction. \nThe model does not predict irrigation depths at specific\
    \ \npoints in the field. The purpose of all models is to assess the \nuniformity\
    \ of irrigation, the selection of appropriate nozzles \nand their spacing. \n\
    Of all irrigation systems, rainwater irrigation systems \noffer the greatest potential\
    \ for uniform irrigation, as they are \neasily adaptable for spatially variable\
    \ management. \nSignificant progress has been made in the development of \nhardware\
    \ to control the pivot system with the aim of \nachieving irrigation precision.\
    \ According to authors [37], \nfurther development of decision-making tools in\
    \ irrigation \npivot systems is needed to achieve optimal irrigation \naccuracy.\
    \ \nA number of technologies for the variable water \nirrigation have been developed,\
    \ classifying them as [16]: \nmultiple discrete devices combined with a constant\
    \ \napplication rate to achieve irrigation depth; a fixed flow rate \ndevice with\
    \ the possibility of rapid interruption to ensure a \nrange of depth of irrigation\
    \ application; and variable sprayers \nwith time control. A control system has\
    \ also been developed \nto control the irrigation speed for each individual sprayer.\
    \ \nKey criteria in the development of these technologies \ninclude: ease of installation\
    \ in existing commercial irrigation \nsystems; adequate uniformity of water application\
    \ within the \nmanagement zone; compatibility with existing irrigation \nsystem\
    \ equipment; reduction of robust electronics; two-way \ncommunication; and the\
    \ possibility of future upgrade. \n \n \nFigure 3 Farmscan irrigation rates [34]\
    \ \n \nTo achieve higher precision of water application to a \nspecific location,\
    \ the exact locations of all elements for \nirrigation application must be known.\
    \ To determine the \ncenter pivot locations, either multiple electronic compasses\
    \ \nthat continuously measure inconsistencies along the length of \nthe system;\
    \ or GNSS for positioning at one or more locations \nare used. The pivot devices\
    \ for application with variable \nirrigation rates are currently commercially\
    \ available \ntechnology. The farmscan 7000VRI is a system used to \ncontrol the\
    \ center pivot device [34]. The prescribed maps \nwere created using a personal\
    \ computer (Fig. 3). The \napplication map separates the circular areas covered\
    \ by the \nsprayer into circular clips with an angle of 2° to 10° and each \n\
    clip is divided into segments. Irrigation installments per \nsegment are variable\
    \ values and it is possible to mark several \nor all segments for irrigation.\
    \ The irrigation rates calculated \nin this way can easily be transferred to the\
    \ controller. If \nirrigation rates are to be increased above 100 %, the sprayer\
    \ \nwill automatically slow down. \nIvan Plaščak, et al.: An Overview of Agrigultural\
    \ Precision Irrigation Systems \nTEHNIČKI GLASNIK 15, 4(2021), 546-553 \n    \
    \          \n            \n    549 \nFarmscan system supports the creation of\
    \ five irrigation \nrates. Up to 48 zones can be irrigated by adding auxiliary\
    \ \nnozzles located along with the supports. The nozzles are \ngrouped into blocks,\
    \ and the blocks are controlled by the \nmain line that is electronically controlled\
    \ by a controller [34]. \nFarmscan \nirrigation \nmanagement \nmap \ndivides \n\
    the \nagricultural area into cells that are differently colored \naccording to\
    \ the percentage of water available to the crops. \nSince soils have different\
    \ structures, varying water retention \ncapacities and infiltration rations, irrigation\
    \ rates may differ \nbetween different zones in one agricultural field [34]. Sensor\
    \ \nsystems can be more accurate than those based on maps due \nto access or data\
    \ collection in real-time. Control systems that \ndynamically collect data using\
    \ remote sensing or built-in \nsensors on the irrigation system are under development\
    \ [38]. \nAutomated irrigation control systems use sensors \ngrouped in one location.\
    \ This management method uses only \nthe obtained soil properties data for irrigation\
    \ planning and \naims at crop uniformity in the field, without optimizing \nproduction\
    \ in different parts of the field. However, the local \nmicroclimate, plant genetics\
    \ and the occurrence of \ninfestation/pests in crops can result in one area having\
    \ a \ndifferent yield compared to another. The system developed \nby authors [39]\
    \ creates a soil map based on data obtained \nfrom neutron probes which provide\
    \ soil moisture data and \nmeteorological stations. \nMost conventional irrigation\
    \ systems are designed to \noperate with a constant flow in the system and pressure\
    \ on \nthe sprinklers. In precision irrigation, pivot irrigation \nsystems use\
    \ constant pressure but variable water flow. \nPossible solutions for variable\
    \ water supply are multi-pump \nsystems or the use of a variable speed pump [16].\
    \ \n \n3.3 Micro-Irrigation Systems \n \nMicro-irrigation systems are designed\
    \ for the exclusive \nirrigation of the zone in the plant proximity. The advantages\
    \ \nof this approach are: irrigation of a smaller area, minimal \nwater evaporation\
    \ from the soil surface, reduced weed \npresence, and uniform water application\
    \ in the root zone of \nthe plant. A special advantage of micro-irrigation is\
    \ the \naddition of a smaller amount of water at short irrigation \nintervals.\
    \ This provides the ability to maintain soil moisture \nwith a certain water deficit\
    \ below the capacity of the field. It \ncan be managed throughout the entire season\
    \ or only its part, \nthus achieving greater irrigation efficiency and reducing\
    \ \nirrigation costs. The efficiency of micro-irrigation can be \nhigher than\
    \ 90 % [40]. \nWater losses in micro-irrigation mainly occur by \nevaporation\
    \ of water from the soil surface and outflow of \nwater into the drainage. Evaporation\
    \ losses are small due to \nthe limited irrigation area and no standing water\
    \ on the soil \nsurface. The causes of possibly uneven irrigation in micro-\n\
    systems are the length of the pipe, pressure oscillations and \nclogging of the\
    \ applicator during its operation. The micro-\nirrigation system has a higher\
    \ potential for widespread \nimplementation compared to other systems. Management\
    \ is \neasy and is usually automated based on time, soil moisture, \nor surrounding\
    \ temperature [40]. \nAuthors [41] used a system for monitoring the moisture \n\
    in the root zone in viticulture and measured soil moisture in \na closed-loop\
    \ system. Authors [42] focused on the \ndevelopment of a spatially variable micro-irrigation\
    \ system \nthat enables the management of individual micro applicators \n(droppers)\
    \ in an orchard. The basis of the research was a \nvarying water supply for one\
    \ or more individual trees located \non a single pipeline. The focus was particularly\
    \ set on \ndesigning an intelligent node of a micro-irrigation system \nthat can\
    \ individually manage applicators. This required the \ndevelopment of a physical\
    \ network for energy distribution \nand communication between applicators and\
    \ individual \nnodes along the irrigation line. Development was supported \nby\
    \ \nsoftware \nfor \nmanaging \nthe \nmain \ncontroller, \ncommunication devices\
    \ and individual micro applicator \nnodes. A total of 50 nodes were deployed.\
    \ Each node \nconsisted of a micro-controller and an electrical circuit. The \n\
    solenoid valves individually controlled the water flow on \neach applicator. A\
    \ pressure sensor was used to monitor the \npressure in the applicators. The applicator\
    \ controller \nprovided information and stored data for the irrigation \nschedule.\
    \ The laptop was used to transmit the irrigation \nschedule and access the sensor\
    \ data on the pipeline regulator. \nThe results showed that the micro-irrigation\
    \ system can be \nconfigured for varying irrigation according to the individual\
    \ \nneeds of each plant [43]. Fig. 4. displays a micro-irrigation \nsystem with\
    \ a wireless network. \n \n \nFigure 4 Micro-irrigation system [43] \n \nThat\
    \ system operates on the principle of a wireless \nnetwork. The sensor connected\
    \ to the wireless node measures \nthe soil moisture according to the set values\
    \ and determined \nthe irrigation starting period. The wireless controller \n\
    measures soil moisture and temperature and using a built-in \ntransmitter that\
    \ sends information to the central node. The \ncentral node controls the solenoid\
    \ valves and the node has a \nbuilt-in receiver that receives information sent\
    \ from the \nwireless node. The central node can be connected to a laptop, \n\
    and can also be controlled via a mobile device using a GSM \nmodule. The controller\
    \ in the central node processes the data \naccording to the set values and thus\
    \ manages the automatic \nmicro-irrigation. Water pumps and associated solar panels\
    \ \nfor pumps can be installed on this system. It is possible to \noperate the\
    \ controller via a mobile phone and to enter/export \ndata obtained from the humidity\
    \ sensor in real-time [43]. \n \nIvan Plaščak, et al.: An Overview of Agrigultural\

    \ 15, 4(2021), 546-553 \n4 SENSORS AND METHODS OF DATA COLLECTION  \n \nThe precision\
    \ irrigation systems require accurate \nspatiotemporal data of soil and crop conditions\
    \ in the field. \nThey also require the ability to identify and quantify such\
    \ \ndata in order to apply appropriate irrigation. Various \nmeasuring devices\
    \ for collecting data on soil moisture and \nplant water requirements are present.\
    \ Spatial variability of \nthe field can be measured: continuously (imaging in\
    \ motion \nusing a camera placed on pivot centers), discrete (point \nsampling\
    \ of soil properties using soil moisture probes) and \nremotely (multispectral\
    \ sensors mounted on unmanned aerial \nvehicles or satellites). A wide range of\
    \ plant sensor \ntechnologies is available for the detection of plant stress.\
    \ \nCrop monitoring technologies can be divided into two \ngroups: contact sensors\
    \ (provide detailed data for individual \nplants that are useful for understanding\
    \ daily fluctuations) \nand remote (more suitable for collecting spatial data\
    \ at the \nlocal or regional level and therefore more suitable for \nestimating\
    \ spatial differences in plant loading and application \nin precision irrigation\
    \ system). Such sensors typically \nmeasure plant responses associated with water\
    \ intake, \nmoisture evaporation, and plant growth rates. Variations in \nthese\
    \ measurements that indicate crop stress can be used in \ndecision-making in precision\
    \ irrigation. Crop sensors do not \ngive any indication of water deficiency, so\
    \ these methods \nshould be used in combination with soil moisture \nmeasurements.\
    \ Crop sensors typically have the ability to \nrecord and GNSS readings and can\
    \ produce field \nmeasurement maps. There is also a wide range of satellite \n\
    sensors from which data can be obtained for agricultural use \n[44-47].  \n \n\
    4.1 Multispectral Sensors \n \nAuthors [44] noted that a wide range of sensors\
    \ that can \nbe used regardless of their distance to imaging object to \nmeasure\
    \ the electromagnetic reflectance of the surface. \nAuthors [45] provided a description\
    \ of spectral bands that can \nbe used to monitor soil variability. Data obtained\
    \ in the \nspectral bands can usually be processed to highlight \ndifferences\
    \ in crop conditions using the normalized \ndifference vegetation index (NDVI).\
    \ Various researchers \nhave found a relationship between NDVI and crop coefficient\
    \ \nfor a wide range of crops. An alternative to using NDVI is to \npredict the\
    \ actual evaporation of crops using remote energy \nbalance research. According\
    \ to [46, 47], both approaches \nsupport obtaining a large amount of data on crop\
    \ water \nevaporation for irrigation management. Fig. 5. represents an \nexample\
    \ of the NDVI image in precision irrigation.  \nNDVI quantifies the vegetation\
    \ by measuring the \ndifferences between the reflectance in the near-infrared\
    \ band, \nNIR (which is strongly influenced by vegetation), and red \nband, RED\
    \ (which is highly absorbed by vegetation). The \nNDVI was calculated according\
    \ to formula (1) [48]: \n \n(\n) .\n(\n)\nNIR\nRED\nNDVI\nNIR\nRED\n−\n=\n+\n\
    \                                                     (1) \nHealthy vegetation\
    \ with high chlorophyll content reflects \nmore near-infrared and green wavelengths\
    \ compared to other \nwavelengths but absorbs more red and blue wavelengths. The\
    \ \nresult of the formula (1) creates the values in the number \ninterval between\
    \ ‒1 and +1. If they are low in the RED band \nand high in the NIR band, NDVI\
    \ will result in a value close \nto 1 and vice versa [48]. Thus, in the example\
    \ displayed in \nFig. 5, green pixels indicate healthy and dense vegetation \n\
    while red pixels indicate a crop under water stress. \n \n \nFigure 5 NDVI values\
    \ for precision irrigation management [48] \n \nMultispectral sensors are commonly\
    \ implemented on \nsatellites and unmanned aerial vehicles, which regularly \n\
    achieve a higher spatial resolution [43]. In Fig. 6 an example \nof determining\
    \ soil moisture and an irrigation map of the \nCeres model is presented. \n \n\
    \ \nFigure 6 An irrigation map obtained using the Ceres model [34] \n \n4.2 Thermal\
    \ Sensors \n \nCanopy cover temperature represents a relative measure \nof the\
    \ water evaporation rate and indicates crop water stress. \nInfrared thermal cameras\
    \ measure the radiation energy \n(temperature) of an object using thermal infrared\
    \ \nwavelengths. The canopy cover temperature obtained by \nthermal sensors is\
    \ compared with the crops without water \nstress for the calculation of crop water\
    \ stress index (CWSI). \nCWSI is calculated according to formula (2) [34]:  \n\

    \ can be mounted on an unmanned aerial \nvehicle for aerial monitoring [50]. \n\
    Fig. 7. displays the agricultural area divided into pixels \nwith a CWSI value\
    \ after imaging, which determines the \namount of crop water deficiency. If the\
    \ pixel value is 0, it \nindicates that the crop is not under stress and contains\
    \ the \noptimal amount of water. If the pixel value is 1, the maximum \ncrop water\
    \ stress is present and the irrigation should be \nimplemented or applied. \n\

    \ [50] \n \n \nFigure 8 Crop water stress scale [50] \n \nFig. 8. displays an\

    \ schedule for the \ncontrolled pivot system and the drop-by-drop systems were\
    \ \ncontrolled by the temperature-time threshold (TTT) method. \nThe TTT method\
    \ includes infrared thermal cameras that \ncontinuously measure the temperature\
    \ of the plant cover. If \nthe cover temperature rose by a predetermined value\
    \ in a \ncertain time, irrigation would be started. \n \n \n5 \nCONCLUSION \n\
    \ \nThe combination of crop and soil monitoring with \nappropriate growth simulation\
    \ models is the first step of \nprecision irrigation. Upgrading these models with\
    \ the control \nand optimization systems of each irrigation system completes \n\
    the precision irrigation system. These procedures rely on the \nability to manage\
    \ variations in individual plants’ water \nbalance. \nThere is no best universal\
    \ precision irrigation system. \nMoving towards precision irrigation requires\
    \ a system that \ncan adapt to the existing conditions. It also implies the idea\
    \ \nthat the system will succeed in achieving a certain goal, like \nmaximum water\
    \ utilization, maximum yield, or maximum \nprofitability. \nThe four important\
    \ steps for precision irrigation are data \ncollection, data analysis, control,\
    \ and system evaluation. \nPrecision irrigation systems require accurate and updated\
    \ \nspatial data obtained by field measurement and collected \nusing a variety\
    \ of imaging sensors. The obtained data are \ninterpreted and analyzed by computer\
    \ software to aid in \ndecision making. Precision irrigation can potentially increase\
    \ \neconomic efficiency through optimal irrigation in each part \nof the field\
    \ according to crop requirements and thus reduce \ncosts. \nAccording to available\
    \ data in the Republic of Croatia, \nirrigation is not significantly developed\
    \ and amounts to only \n0.46% of the agricultural area (less than 10 000 ha).\
    \ There \nare the most suitable soils for irrigation in Osijek-Baranja and \n\
    Vukovar-Srijem counties. According to the available quality \nand quantity of\
    \ water, Croatia can irrigate about 30% of \narable land or about 600 000 ha.\

    and content Previous article in issue Next article in issue 1. Introduction. Overview
    of updates and advances to FAO56 method FAO56 - Crop Evapotranspiration: Guidelines
    to Compute Crop Water Requirements – proposed to the irrigation and academic world
    a comprehensive methodology for computing crop water and irrigation requirements.
    It has more than 30,000 citations in its English version and more than 750 in
    its Spanish version, which means that it is very well accepted by the irrigation,
    hydrology and water resources users and related research communities world-wide.
    The community of users largely exceed those dedicated to irrigation. FAO56 responded
    to various objectives: to provide a consolidated tool to ease the calculation
    of crop water requirements and therefore providing an information for users that
    help them to optimize water use and management, to improve crop yields through
    a more appropriate application of water to the crops, to gain information usable
    by managers of collective irrigation systems in satisfying the needs of irrigation
    farmers, and to support adopting measures that control impacts of irrigation on
    environment and better responding to climate change challenges, and water demand
    in particular. Science and technology evolved in the last 20 years after FAO56
    was published and related novelties are now part of progress in water resources
    management, as well as of irrigation practices and management. Updating and advancing
    in the domain of crop water requirements respond to the need for incorporating
    in the FAO56 method the results and practices of innovative science and technology,
    such as data handling and upgrade, better use of the available research, and use
    of newer tools, e.g. remote sensing or the Internet of Things (IoT). Updates and
    advances bring more accuracy to calculation of crop water requirements, thus better
    supporting precision agriculture in terms of water application to the crops. Moreover,
    a better knowledge of evapotranspiration and related processes support improved
    responses to climate change and to the increased demand for water by other sectors.
    We attest that the updates and advances presented and discussed in the current
    Special Issue are definitely required by the irrigated agriculture and by the
    various facets of environmental upgrading, climate change demand and water saving
    agriculture. Users most often use FAO56 referring to the grass reference evapotranspiration,
    the FAO Penman-Monteith ETo (PM-ETo). The PM-ETo is defined as the evapotranspiration
    rate of a hypothetical crop with an assumed height of 0.12 m having a surface
    resistance of 70 s m−1 and an albedo of 0.23, closely resembling the evaporation
    of an extension surface of green grass of uniform height, actively growing and
    adequately watered. This definition is translated into practice by the PM-ETo
    equation, which is well parameterized for daily, monthly or hourly time steps.
    Its computation requires data on air temperature, air humidity, wind speed and
    incoming or net solar radiation and that weather observations be performed above
    a well irrigated green grass cover. That definition is rarely contradicted by
    researchers who would prefer not to have a standard evaporative surface with fixed
    characteristics but that such grass reference would be reproduced locally when
    using a grass lysimeter or other precise measurement system. As explained in FAO56,
    “because the resistance to diffusion of vapor strongly depends on crop height,
    ground cover, LAI and soil moisture conditions, the characteristics of the reference
    crop should be well defined and fixed. Changes in crop height result in variations
    in the roughness and LAI. Consequently, the associated canopy and aerodynamic
    resistances will vary appreciably with time. Moreover, water stress and the degree
    of ground cover have an effect on the resistances and also on the albedo.” Therefore,
    considering the successful use of the PM-ETo equation and acceptance of the corresponding
    equation, the current review and update on the FAO56 method does not include any
    search of advances on the PM-ETo equation. Differently, however, the current Special
    Issue does include advances on improving the point observed and/or gridded datasets
    when aridity does not allow to respect the required irrigated green grass cover,
    thereby resulting in ETo that would be biased due to higher temperature and lower
    air humidity as it would be expected if observations were performed over an irrigated
    environment. This subject is dealt by the studies of Allen et al. (2020) and Blankenau
    et al. (2020). The current Special Issue also refers to consolidated research
    alternatives for computing ETo with reduced datasets, which is a subject of abundant
    research. Paredes et al. (2020) propose improvements to the use of alternative
    approaches using temperature data only, and Paredes et al. (2021) analyze the
    use of products of Meteosat Second Generation and of data from ERA5 reanalysis.
    A main domain of irrigation users refers to compute the crop evapotranspiration
    from the product between ETo and a crop coefficient, Kc, or “Kc ETo”. The studies
    by Pereira et al. (2021a, 2021b) were aimed at updating the standard Kc of vegetable
    and field crops with appropriate analysis of the accuracy of reviewed studies.
    Rallo et al. (2021) did a similar approach relative to tree and vine crops, advancing
    methods in the consideration of the relationships of Kc with the crop density
    and training. Advances to the use of Kc consist of their prediction from ground
    cover and crop height, which are detailed by Pereira et al. (2020a and 2021c).
    The derivation of Kc from the observation of field crop ET is dealt in various
    selected studies: López-Urrea et al. (2020) provided an example using weighing
    lysimeters to derive Kc for canola; Pôças et al. (2020) reviewed the use of spectral
    vegetation indices to determine Kc values; French et al. (2020) provided an example
    of Kc derivation for durum wheat using remote sensing and eddy covariance; and
    Wang et al. (2020) used remote sensing, micrometeorological measurements and weighing
    lysimetry for deriving Kc for sugar beets. Various modelling and analysis tools
    are also part of this Special Issue: a review on soil water balance models is
    presented by Pereira et al. (2020b); a remote sensing–based soil water balance
    applied at water user association scale is presented by Garrido-Rubio et al. (2020);
    a review of strategies and methods to reduce non-beneficial consumptive water
    use at farm scale is provided by Jovanovic et al. (2020); and a review on coping
    with salinity in irrigated agriculture is given by Minhas et al. (2020). In conclusion,
    the Special Issue provides readers with updated and upgraded knowledge that advances
    the FAO56 methods on the calculation of ETo and crop ET aimed at estimating crop
    water requirements This is expected to improve FAO56 applications by a variety
    of users such as, water managers, consultants, irrigation engineers, hydrologists,
    meteorologists, agronomists, and, in general, by researchers in the land and water
    domain. The full list of papers in this Special Issue is presented in Annex 1
    and the list of symbols and acronyms used throughout the Special Issue are provided
    in Annex 2. 2. Computing reference evapotranspiration with gridded weather data
    and reduced datasets The standard grass reference ET (ETo) calculations of FAO56
    and the ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers) assume that the surfaces underlying
    collected weather data are well-watered so that near-surface meteorological measurements
    reflect the cooling and humidifying effects of an evaporating surface. However,
    in contrast, meteorological data are often collected in dry, desert regions where
    the local environments exhibit effects of aridity caused by the lack of evapotranspiration
    from the surfaces where they are collected. The study by Allen et al. (2020) assessed
    the biases in meteorological data that exhibit aridity effects and developed the
    consequently required conditioning process intended to adjust the weather data
    to better exhibit characteristics of data collected over a well-watered vegetated
    surface prior to use of the data to estimate ETo. The conditioning of gridded
    weather data to remove artifacts of aridity using theoretical boundary layer theory
    appears to be a robust method that should have good transferability to other locations
    and climates. The procedure involves the extrapolation of air temperature, vapor
    pressure, and wind speed profiles to and from a regional blending height using
    standard surface energy balance equations and flux-profile relationships. The
    process is described with appropriate detail, including the presentation of example
    applications with 24-hour weather data and hourly weather data in Idaho and Nevada.
    Results indicate that reference ETo can be overstated by as much as 25% in southern
    Idaho and 8% in eastern Nevada. The study by Blankenau et al. (2020) assessed
    the quality of gridded weather data for calculating ETo, which, by definition,
    represents a near maximum ET occurring in a well-watered agricultural environment.
    Six gridded weather data sets – GLDAS-1, NLDAS-2, the CFSv2 operational analysis,
    gridMET, RTMA, and NDFD – were compared to weather data collected from 103 weather
    stations located in well-watered settings across the conterminous United States.
    ETo along with the weather variables used to compute it – near-surface air temperature,
    vapor pressure, wind speed, and shortwave solar radiation – were compared. The
    gridded weather data sets generally overestimated the standardized FAO Penman-Monteith
    ETo produced from weather station data, with median biases ranging from 12% to
    31%. This overestimation is mainly due to chronic over-observation of air temperature,
    shortwave radiation, and wind speed and understatement of air humidity. These
    results indicate that gridded data should be carefully evaluated before being
    used in replacement of observed agricultural weather station data. Adopting bias
    correction procedures improves these gridded data making them more suitable for
    computing ETo. The above referred gridded data sets were assessed by Blankenau
    et al. (2020) with results indicating which was the best performing gridded data
    set for all variables and for ETo, with discussion of reasons for better or reduced
    ETo performance. Authors’ conclusions suggest that spatial resolution is not a
    primary factor determining correspondence to station data. The excellent performance
    of gridMET temperature and RTMA indicates that the degree to which gridded data
    depend on station data is a primary factor determining correspondence. The computation
    of the grass reference evapotranspiration with the FAO56 Penman-Monteith equation
    (PM-ETo) is hampered when only reduced weather data sets are available. Numerous
    research studies have been published in the past twenty years aiming at solving
    this problem either using heuristic numerical models or alternative ET equations,
    namely ET temperature equations. In addition, several studies have focused on
    assessing the accuracy of the FAO56 approaches to estimate the dew point temperature
    and the shortwave solar radiation from temperature data only, as well as the use
    of wind speed default values or wind regional or local average values. However,
    many of those approaches are purely numerical and do not take into consideration
    the basic physics underlying the PM-ETo equation, which is mandatory when selecting
    alternative approaches to compute ETo. Because temperature is commonly observed
    and it is less prone to measurement errors, the temperature methods for estimating
    ETo are the most studied. The article by Paredes et al. (2020) presents a consolidated
    step-by-step method to parameterize two simplified temperature methods, the FAO
    Penman-Monteith temperature (PMT) approach and the Hargeaves-Samani (HS) equation.
    In both cases the shortwave solar radiation is estimated from the air temperature
    difference combined with a calibrated radiation adjustment coefficient (kRs).
    The innovation of this study refers to the calculation of kRs for use with the
    PMT and the HS equation using multiple linear regression equations whose independent
    variables are the temperature difference, relative humidity and wind speed long-term
    averages of the local or a nearby weather station. Using as benchmark the PM-ETo
    computed with full datasets, the accuracy of both PMT and HS was assessed for
    numerous locations with diverse climate types, from hyper-arid to humid, daily
    and monthly time steps. Results have shown small root mean square errors (RMSE),
    ranging from 0.58 to 0.72 mm d−1, which are generally better than those reported
    in literature for similar environmental conditions. The study reported similar
    PMT and HS accuracy; however, the PMT approach shows a clear advantage over HS
    because it allows the use of locally observed weather data during periods when
    it is available in combination with estimates of the missing variables, which
    reduces estimation errors. Aiming at overcoming the limitations imposed by reduced
    weather data sets, recently, research has focused on the use of alternative sources
    of weather data, such as reanalysis and geostationary satellite products. These
    products have the advantage of the continuity of the weather datasets, as well
    as the consistency of the information that span along various decades. Furthermore,
    these products are freely available, provided at diverse spatial resolutions and
    allowing high temporal sampling. The study by Paredes et al. (2021) assessed the
    accuracy of shortwave radiation (Rs) products in the estimation of PM-ETo when
    combined with ground-observations of temperature, air humidity, and wind speed.
    The study analyzed a product from the Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface
    Analysis (LSA-SAF) which uses observations provided by the Meteosat Second Generation
    geostationary system. The second Rs product was obtained from ERA5 reanalysis
    provided by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Additionally,
    the study also analyzed the accuracy of a reference ET product provided by the
    LSA-SAF. The assessment was performed over a wide range of continental Portugal
    climate conditions, from semi-arid to humid, as well as of the oceanic islands
    of Azores, frequently cloudy, with high air humidity and high winds. Results show
    a clear advantage in using both Rs products for estimating ETo, either when all
    other weather variables are observed (RMSE averaging 0.13 mm d−1 and 0.34 mm d−1
    respectively for LSA-SAF and ERA5 products) or even when ingesting these products
    into the PMT approach (RMSE averaging 0.52 mm d−1 and 0.62 mm d−1 respectively
    for LSA-SAF and ERA5). The accuracy of the products was poorer in the oceanic
    islands due to the reduced ability of LSA-SAF and ERA5 reanalysis to capture the
    high heterogeneity and variation of the weather conditions at a point-scale (weather
    station). Nevertheless, the reference ET product of LSA-SAF showed quite good
    results in the absence of quality weather data measurements (RMSE averaging 0.70
    mm d−1 and 0.74 mm d−1 respectively for continental climates and oceanic islands).
    Overall, the study allowed to demonstrate the usability of both products to estimate
    ETo when weather data sets are reduced or are lacking, with estimation errors
    similar or smaller than those provided in the literature, with particular innovation
    referring to the oceanic islands. 3. Crop evapotranspiration: single and basal
    crop coefficients FAO56 followed FAO24 in computing crop ET (ETc) as the product
    of the grass reference ETo and the crop coefficient (Kc), where the latter scales
    ET according to the crop type and the crop development stage (ETc=Kc ETo). Kc
    is standard when cropping conditions are close to pristine cropping conditions;
    otherwise, when plant density, crop management, soil fertility and fertilization,
    plant diseases, soil salinity and/or water deficits reduce crop development, ETc
    and crop yields, the actual Kc (Kc act) is reduced relative to the standard value
    (Kc act < Kc). Kc are transferable among sites but not Kc act since they depend
    upon local practices. Therefore, the standard Kc and their uses are central in
    FAO56, and the reason why very much research has been developed since 1998 to
    update Kc values for crops tabulated in FAO56, and/or to determine Kc values for
    crops not previously considered, as well as, to produce other advances in FAO56
    Kc use. However, much of the recent research produced non-transferable Kc act.
    Pereira et al. (2021a, 2021b) and Rallo et al. (2021) reviewed the research published
    since the publication of FAO56 relative to crop water requirements of vegetables
    and field crops, and tree and vines, respectively, which used the FAO56 methods,
    but considering only the studies aimed at the Kc-ETo approach whose results permitted
    to identify the standard crop coefficients, Kc, and/or the standard basal crop
    coefficients, Kcb. Upgrades relative to FAO56 grouped the vegetable crops according
    to the edible parts (Pereira et al., 2021a). Four groups were considered: 1) roots,
    tubers, bulbs and stem vegetables; 2) leaves and flowers vegetables; 3) fruits
    and pods vegetables; and 4) herbs, spices and special crops. Further advances
    consisted in the introduction of Kc data for new vegetable crops, namely herbs
    and spices. Field crops were also grouped differently from FAO56 (Pereira et al.,
    2021b): 1) grain legumes, 2) fiber crops, 3) oil crops, 4) sugar crops, 5) small
    grain cereals, 6) maize and sorghum, and 7) rice. Upgrades of FAO56 consisted
    in presenting Kc and Kcb data for new crops (camelina, linseed, mustard, amaranth
    grain, quinoa, rye, teff, durum wheat, silage maize and silage sorghum) and describing
    rice according to diverse rice irrigation management systems. Upgrades to FAO56
    relative to vine and tree crops relate adopted the following groups (Rallo et
    al., 2021): 1) vine fruit crops, berries and hops, 2) temperate climate evergreen
    fruit trees, 3) deciduous fruit trees, and 4) tropical and sub-tropical fruit
    crops. Further upgrades consisted in the inclusion of various new crops: pomegranate,
    hazelnut, pecan, pistachio, fig tree, persimmon, avocado, cherimoya, guava, mango,
    papaya. Moreover, Kc and Kcb of each crop are generally provided differentiating
    orchard densities and fractions of ground cover as well as vines training systems.
    The main objective of those reviews was to update the FAO56 tabulated information
    on standard Kc and Kcb values. The literature review identified numerous articles
    using that approach, but many of them could not be considered because the PM-ETo
    equation was not used, rather diverse methods were adopted to estimate ETo or
    ETc or were not field-measured with accurate methods. The use of different ETo
    computation approaches leads to estimation bias in the derived Kc or Kcb values,
    which hampers their transferability. Relative to ETc measurements, related accuracy
    requirements could not always be considered, thus impeding the use of related
    studies. Detailed and well-founded recommendations for ensuring accuracy requirements
    relative to experimental procedures are reported by Pereira et al. (2021a, 2021b)
    and Rallo et al. (2021). These papers also pay particular attention to the recognition
    of the upper limits of Kc and Kcb. These upper limits are fixed in direct relation
    with the available energy at the cropped surface. In addition, the impacts of
    local or regional advection are discussed and it is made clear that Kc values
    obtained under advective conditions are only valid for local conditions and are
    not transferable to other conditions. In addition, those review articles report
    on the quality criteria used to support the selection of the reviewed crop coefficient
    papers. The transferability of the Kc and Kcb values retrieved from literature
    on vegetable and field crops (Pereira et al., 2021a,b) was made possible when
    studies adopted the segmented Kc curve or, at least, allowed to identify the mid-
    and end-season Kc and Kcb. When Kc or Kcb are given as a non-linear function of
    time after planting, or as function of LAI, they could not be used because they
    just fit local conditions. Moreover, it was required that the description of selected
    studies was such that allowed a recognition that they were performed under pristine,
    non-stressed cropping conditions. In addition, transferability of the collected
    literature Kc/Kcb values was performed adopting the standard climate conditions
    assumed in FAO56 (average RHmin = 45% and average u2 = 2 m s−1 over the mid- and
    the late-season growth stages). A different selection approach was used for vine
    and tree crops studies (Rallo et al., 2021) because irrigation management is commonly
    performed adopting crop-specific beneficial water stress (eustress) aimed at maximizing
    crop yield and quality, not ET. The adjustment to standard climate condition was
    not performed because tree and vine crops present a different aerodynamic behavior
    that does not match the climate adjustment equations proposed in FAO56. Further
    updates on the tabulated values proposed in FAO56 relative to maximum root zone
    depth, maximum crop height and ground cover, and depletion fraction for no water
    stress were provided by Pereira et al. (2021a, 2021b) for vegetable and field
    crops. While Rallo et al. (2021) updated the information relative to the fraction
    of ground covered by the crop and maximum tree height, in the majority of cases
    this information was linked with the training systems and tree density. However,
    users must take into consideration changes of the production system that will
    impact crop water requirements. Thus, tabulated Kc and Kcb values should be reduced
    when water stress tolerant varieties are used, when cropping is performed using
    plastic or organic mulch, soil amendments, plastic tunnels or other technologies
    that impact crop ET. An alternative to using the tabulated Kc values is to compute
    Kcb and Kc from observed ground cover (fc) and height (h). The study by Pereira
    et al. (2020c) aimed at reviewing and providing advances on methods for estimating
    and applying crop coefficients from observations of fc and h. The review first
    focuses on the relationships between Kc and/or Kcb and various parameters describing
    the canopy cover, mainly fc. Secondly, the study reviews the ground and remote
    sensing observation of fc. The approach proposed earlier by Allen and Pereira
    (2009), called the A&P approach, used fc and h data to define a crop density coefficient
    that is used to directly estimate Kc and Kcb values for a variety of annual and
    perennial crops in both research and practice. Applications used to test the approach
    included various tree and vine crops, vegetable crops, field crops, as well as
    a grassland and a Bermudagrass pasture. Comparisons of Kcb values observed and
    computed with the A&P method produced regression coefficients close to 1.0 and
    coefficients of determination (R2) larger than 0.90, however with lower values
    for orchards. Overall, these results indicated that the A&P is able to accurately
    estimate Kcb using cropped vegetation characteristics only, and are useful for
    refining Kcb predictions considering plant spacing, size and density. In addition,
    the A&P approach was applied with remotely sensed fc data for various crops in
    California using the Satellite Irrigation Management Support (SIMS) framework.
    Combining satellite derived fc and Kcb from the A&P approach with ETo data from
    Spatial CIMIS (California Irrigation Management Information System) produced ET
    estimates that were compared with daily actual crop ET derived from energy balance
    calculations using micrometeorological instruments. Results produced coefficients
    of regression of 1.05 for annual crops and 1.08 for perennial crops, and R2 values
    of 0.81 and 0.91, respectively. These values suggest that daily ETc-SIMS-based
    can be accurately estimated, and that the A&P approach is appropriate to support
    that estimation. Accuracy may be improved via progress in remote sensing determination
    of fc. Aiming at the practical application of the A&P approach for a wide variety
    of crops – vegetable and field crops, and vines and tree fruits - Pereira et al.
    (2021c) optimized the values of the non-observed parameters representing the canopy
    transparency (ML) and the stomatal adjustment (Fr) using a numerical search. That
    search was used to find the ML and Fr values that minimize the differences between
    the Kcb from A&P and the standard Kcb previously tabulated by Pereira et al. (2021a,
    2021b) and Rallo et al. (2021). The observed fc and h values were obtained combining
    the tabulated values in the referred review articles, with literature review,
    and data provided by the SIMS remote sensing survey. All parameter values were
    tabulated as well as the estimated Kcb and Kc for the mid- and end-season. To
    test the usability of the tabulated values of ML and Fr, Pereira et al. (2021c)
    performed a cross validation using an independent data set obtained from field
    observations. Results show a very good agreement between observed and estimated
    Kcb values, with errors of estimation representing less than 10% of the standard
    tabulated Kcb. Overall, results show that the tabulated values of Fr and ML could
    be used as default values to support A&P field practice when combined with observed
    values of fc and h. The A&P approach shows to be appropriate for supporting irrigation
    decision-making. 4. Case studies using ground and remote sensing data for upgrading
    the FAO56 method The study by López-Urrea et al. (2020) is a very good example
    of the use of weighing lysimeters for measuring actual crop ET, which allowed
    deriving canola crop coefficients, both single Kc and basal Kcb. The article adequately
    describes the large size precision weighing lysimeters facilities, including calibration
    and maintenance details used to achieve accurate measurements of crop ET. The
    results of the 2-year canola experiment, performed under pristine conditions,
    allowed an upgrade of the FAO56 standard tabulated Kc and Kcb values presented
    by Pereira et al. (2021a). Furthermore, the reported ancillary crop data (maximum
    root depth and crop height, and depletion fraction for no stress) were also tabulated
    in that review article. The study also reports the good agreement between Kcb
    and fc, and remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs) which will allow further
    monitoring and estimation of the spatially distributed canola water requirements
    at field and regional scales using multispectral satellite imagery. Thus, the
    use of a reflectance approach to estimate Kc (and Kcb) improves and advances the
    FAO56 single and dual Kc approach because it allows capturing unexpected water
    stress conditions within a season, and therefore supporting farmers in day-to-day
    irrigation management. Pôças et al. (2020) present an overview of the past twenty
    years of research on the use of remote sensing data, in the form of spectral vegetation
    indices (VI), to provide spatially distributed information about actual single
    and basal crop coefficients (Kc act, Kcb act) aiming at improving water management
    and irrigation scheduling. The review presents a comprehensive set of good practices
    aimed at defining a common framework for the critical analysis of the large diversity
    of Kc-VI and Kcb-VI relationships that have been defined for different crops in
    the last two decades. The Kcb-VI relation reflects the actual growth conditions
    of the crops throughout the crops season, and thus allows local adjustments of
    Kc and Kcb; this information may be ingested in modeling tools allowing a more
    precise irrigation scheduling. The review shows well how remote sensing of vegetation
    may contribute to assess actual crop ET and related crop coefficients. An operational
    application of the Kcb-VI approach using the framework of the FAO56 guidelines
    is presented in the article by French et al. (2020). They used the normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) from two space-borne platforms to estimate
    durum wheat ETc at seven farm-scale fields located in the U.S. Southwest region.
    The NDVI time-series were acquired from Sentinel 2 and the new microsatellite,
    Venus, at five- and two-day temporal frequencies and spatial resolutions of 10
    and 5 m, respectively. The FAO56 PM-ETo was obtained from nearby state-run weather
    stations in the area. Eddy covariance towers, installed in each field, recorded
    actual daily wheat ETc. These data combined with ETo were then used to derive
    FAO56 segmented Kc curves for durum wheat, Kc values not presented in the original
    FAO56 tables. High variability of Kc seen during the initial/development stages
    shows the need for procedures like the FAO56 dual Kc procedures to more adequately
    describe early season conditions. Using the two-day Venus sensor, the study demonstrated
    that when augmented by a background soil water balance model, water stressed wheat
    can be detected by NDVI at mid-season. The study findings on the microsatellite’s
    ability to provide well-calibrated images every two days suggests additional opportunities
    to resolve other soil water balance components in addition to ETc, such as planting
    and irrigation dates. The study by Wang et al. (2021) presents a case study relative
    to the application of the Satellite Irrigation Management Support (SIMS) framework
    applied to drip-irrigated sugar beet in California. SIMS uses fully automated
    methods to estimate and map actual crop ET by incorporating satellite data to
    derive crop fractional cover and estimate Kcb through the A&P approach, which
    is further combined with ETo data. Results show a good agreement between ground
    observed actual ET and daily estimates of actual ET from SIMS. Ground measurements
    consisted of weighing lysimeters and energy balance instrumentation. The fitting
    of actual ET from SIMS was very good, with low mean bias error of 0.31 mm d−1
    and 0.15 mm d−1 respectively when compared with lysimeter and energy balance ET.
    The satellite data was able to capture localized variability in rates of crop
    canopy development driven by variations in agronomic practices, and to accurately
    set the dates of the crop growth stages with a lag of 4–5 days. Thus, the proposed
    automated framework is a promising tool to operationally support the improvement
    of water use efficiency in agriculture. In addition, the crop coefficients determined
    for the sugar beet revealed to be an excellent source of information that was
    used for the tabulation of standard Kc and Kcb in the paper by Pereira et al.
    (2021b). Moreover, this paper is a good example for remote sensing assessment
    of actual crop ET and determining the crop coefficients when using appropriate
    weather data. 5. Modeling crop and irrigation requirements for improved use of
    FAO56 in the irrigation practice Since the publication of FAO56 several computational
    tools have been developed to help users in the determination of crop water requirements
    and irrigation scheduling using diverse approaches to estimate the soil water
    balance (SWB). The FAO56 methodology adopted in the SWB is very accurate with
    moderate data requirements. Pereira et al. (2020b) reviewed these tools and focused
    on the parameterization and calibration requirements of models. Emphasis was given
    to those tools adopting the dual Kc approach, including the upgrade of the FAO56
    method to be used with intercropping systems. Application examples are provided
    including assessment of impacts of alternative sowing dates on the crop water
    requirements and on water productivity, determination of beneficial and non-beneficial
    water uses by an irrigated crop, as well as an example of the contribution of
    a shallow ground water table to crop ET in a rainfed cropping system. The article
    further analyzes the challenges of real time irrigation including handling and
    processing multiple sources of data (e.g. remote sensing, plant and soil sensors,
    weather data), quality checking particularly in large scale multi-users applications,
    use of cloud computing and adopting the Internet of Things (IoT), as well as an
    improved wireless association of modeling with soil and plant sensors. Further
    challenges refer to the use of remote sensing energy balance and vegetation indices
    to map Kc, ETc act and crop water and irrigation requirements. Trends are expected
    to change research issues relative to SWB modeling, with traditional models mainly
    used for research while new, fast-responding and multi-users models based on cloud
    and IoT technologies will develop into applications to the farm practice. The
    “Kc-ETo” will likely continue to be used, with ETo from gridded networks, re-analysis
    and other sources, and Kc data available in real time from large databases and
    remote sensing. Garrido-Rubio et al. (2020) present a remote sensing–based soil
    water balance model implemented in both field and water user association spatial
    scales. The study’s goal is to confirm the reliability of the remote sensing (RS)
    model as an operative tool that provides accurate Irrigation Water Accounting
    (IWA) for use in irrigation management. The primary model inputs are time series
    of FAO56 Kcb and fractional vegetation cover fc, estimated by NDVI derived from
    satellite images. Crop classification of irrigated areas was carried out using
    supervised classification of remote sensing images. The RS-IWA model was validated
    by measured irrigation water volumes obtained at two different spatial scales.
    At the field scale, modeled RS-IWA agreed with measured values with an average
    error of 12%, whereas the error was 15% at the water user association scale. The
    data also show that the RS-IWA operates well in crops, such as vineyards, using
    deficit irrigation practices. The RS-IWA model driven by FAO56 application provides
    useful information to water managers at different spatial scales. Jovanovic et
    al. (2020) reviewed the research developed on strategies, methods and technologies
    to reduce consumptive water use at farm level to better cope with the increasing
    incidence of water scarcity, agricultural droughts and multi-sectoral competition
    for water. This topic presents particular interest under water scarcity conditions
    and in the climate change context. The reviewed water-saving practices imply accurate
    quantification of crop water requirements with the FAO56 crop coefficient approach
    as developed in other papers in this Special Issue. This paper critically reviews
    notions and means for maintaining high levels of water consumed through transpiration,
    land and water productivity, and for minimizing non-beneficial water consumption
    at farm level. The review focused on diverse water-saving practices related to
    irrigation methods, irrigation management and scheduling, crop management, remote
    sensing, mulching and soil management. Overall, the reviewed practices applied
    at farm level may lead to water savings of up to 20%, which at watershed level
    may result in significant water volumes. Tables were developed on the benefits
    of these practices, their effects on non-beneficial water consumption, crop yields
    and crop water productivity, and the directions for adjustment of FAO56 crop coefficients
    when they are adopted. Optimization is required for the application of some practices
    that involve a large number of possible combinations (e.g. wetted area in micro-irrigation,
    row spacing and orientation, plant density, different types of mulching, in-field
    water harvesting) and for strategies such as deficit irrigation that aim at balancing
    water productivity, the economics of production, infrastructural and irrigation
    system requirements. FAO56 has developed an innovative approach to assess the
    effects of salinity on crop yields and crop ET aiming at coping with salinity
    adopting a steady-state approach without requiring the use of transient models.
    The study by Minhas et al. (2020) reviewed different approaches available, focusing
    on the FAO56 framework, commonly used to compute crop water requirements, including
    leaching requirements, thus leading to a better understanding of the impacts of
    temporal and spatial dynamics of salinity on soil water balances and evapotranspiration
    (ET), then devising optimal irrigation schedules and efficient methods. Under
    salinity conditions a daily soil water balance is required, and the actual crop
    ET (ETc act) is computed with the Kc-ETo approach adopting a stress coefficient
    (Ks), representing both water and salt stresses, to adjust the crop coefficient
    (K⁠c or Kcb) then resulting ETc act equal to Ks Kc ETo or to (Ks Kcb + Ke) ETo
    when the dual Kc approach is applied. The Ks coefficient is a function of both
    the soil water deficit and the salinity effects. The latter refers to the salt
    concentration in the soil and irrigation water, the salt tolerance of the crop,
    and the water-yield response factor. These coefficients are updated and tabulated
    in the paper. The article further discusses the required soil-crop-water management
    practices to cope with salinity environments, including the computation of the
    leaching fraction, cyclic uses of multi-salinity waters and appropriate irrigation
    scheduling and methods. Annex 1 Authors Title DOI Introduction. Overview of updates

    Abstract: California has unsustainable use of agricultural water and energy, as\
    \ well as problems\nof severe drought, nitrate pollution and groundwater salinity.\
    \ As the leading producer and ex-\nporter of agricultural produce in the United\
    \ States, 5.6 percent of California’s energy is currently\nused for pumping groundwater.\
    \ These problems and new regulatory policies (e.g., Sustainable\nGroundwater Management\
    \ Act, Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program) pressure growers to schedule,\naccount\
    \ and maintain records of water, energy and nutrients needed for crop and soil\
    \ management.\nGrowers require varying levels of decision support to integrate\
    \ different irrigation strategies into\nfarm operations. Decision support can\
    \ come from the public or private sector, where there are\nmany tradeoffs between\
    \ cost, underlying science, user friendliness and overall challenges in farm\n\
    integration. Thus, effective irrigation management requires clear deﬁnitions,\
    \ decision support and\nguidelines for how to incorporate and evaluate the water–nutrient–energy\
    \ nexus beneﬁts of different\npractices and combinations of practices under shifting\
    \ water governance. The California Energy\nCommission-sponsored Energy Product\
    \ Evaluation Hub (Cal-EPE Hub) project has a mission of\nproviding science-based\
    \ evaluation of energy-saving technologies as a direct result of improved water\n\
    management for irrigation in agriculture, including current and future irrigation\
    \ decision support\nsystems in California. This project incorporates end-user\
    \ perceptions into evaluations of existing\ndecision support tools in partnership\
    \ with government, agricultural and private stakeholders. In this\narticle, we\
    \ review the policy context and science underlying the available irrigation decision\
    \ support\nsystems (IDSS), discuss the beneﬁts/tradeoffs and report on their efﬁcacy\
    \ and ease of use for the\nmost prevalent cropping systems in California. Finally,\
    \ we identify research and knowledge-to-action\ngaps for incorporating irrigation\
    \ decision support systems into new incentives and requirements for\nreporting\
    \ water and energy consumption as well as salinity and nitrogen management in\
    \ the state\nof California.\nKeywords: food–water–energy nexus; nitrate leaching;\

    1. Introduction\nAgricultural production in California includes the cultivation\
    \ of approximately 400 crops\naccounting for one-third of vegetable and two-thirds\

    \ Agricultural Production Statistics (2019), this\nagricultural abundance makes\
    \ California a leading US state accounting for over 13% of the\ncountry’s total\

    \ [1]. In\norder to produce these crops for export across the country and other\
    \ parts of the world,\ngreat amounts of water, fertilizer and energy are used.\
    \ In California, agricultural water\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12081962\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n2 of 31\nuse represents\
    \ one-ﬁfth of the electricity consumed for water use and four percent of total\n\
    electricity consumption annually [2]. Approximately 75–80% of the total water\
    \ pumped is\nused to irrigate three million hectares throughout the state [3,4].\
    \ The majority of the water\nand energy consumption is during the summer growing\
    \ season (June to August), relying on\ngroundwater that uses between 496 to 1750\
    \ Megajoules per Megaliter of water [5]. Declines\nin aquifer levels, increased\
    \ land subsidence and loss of storage strain growers for energy\nefﬁciency improvements\
    \ in drought years. The ampliﬁed demand for water and energy\nduring drought also\
    \ lowers stream ﬂows and lake levels, which impact the production\nof hydroelectric\
    \ power. In addition, the water table is lowered continually during these\nperiods,\
    \ as growers pump groundwater from deeper wells demanding more power. The\nCalifornia\
    \ drought assessment of 2014 reported a loss of 8.1 million ML of surface water\n\
    with a simultaneous increase of 6.3 million ML in groundwater pumped for an additional\n\
    cost of USD 454 million [6]. Flood and furrow irrigation still account for approximately\n\
    40 percent of the total irrigated area in California, despite the advances and\
    \ investments in\nirrigation systems. The adoption of the drip and micro-sprinkler\
    \ irrigation signiﬁcantly\nincreased in acreage between 1991 (0.52 million hectares)\
    \ and 2010 (16 million hectares) [7].\nFigure 1 identiﬁes the hydrologic regions\
    \ across the state of California and the distribution\nof major crops, irrigation\
    \ methods and levels of salinity in irrigation water.\nCalifornia’s increasing\
    \ severity of droughts not only depletes groundwater but also\nincreases the carbon\
    \ footprint and greenhouse gas emissions from increased burning of\nfossil fuels\
    \ to generate the power for pumping groundwater. After facing several severe\n\
    drought years, state leaders implemented incentives, regulations and policies\
    \ to manage\ngroundwater that require record keeping and reporting of water use,\
    \ nitrogen (N) leaching\nand energy consumption. Simple and scalable irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are\nneeded to facilitate base information for growers\
    \ to manage and maximize irrigation\nwater, energy and N use efﬁciency. On-farm\
    \ water management using irrigation decision\nsupport systems coordinates the\
    \ development and management of water, land and related\nresources aimed toward\
    \ equitable economic welfare and sustainable water use for future\ngenerations\
    \ [8,9]. Irrigation decision support systems (IDSS) are integrated solutions\n\
    combining and interpreting real-time meteorological, soil moisture and/or crop\
    \ water\nstress data using telemetric services to help growers make irrigation\
    \ decisions. Most of\nthe ﬁrst IDSS developed in California ranged from spreadsheets\
    \ to stand-alone software.\nWith recent improvements in public weather-station\
    \ networks, sensor technology, satellite\nand aerial imaging, wireless communications\
    \ and cloud computing, web and smartphone\napplications automating a range of\
    \ complex calculations involved in evapotranspiration-\nbased irrigation scheduling,\
    \ crop and soil nitrogen status IDDS have been developed.\nThe California Energy\
    \ Product Evaluation Hub (or Hub) was proposed by the Califor-\nnia Energy Commission\
    \ to ﬁll an information gap between energy sector manufacturers\nand large commercial\
    \ and institutional customers. The purpose of the Hub is to accelerate\nthe adoption\
    \ of beneﬁcial technologies by informing customers purchasing distributed\nenergy\
    \ resource products through procurement processes. The objectives of the Hub are\
    \ to\nevaluate the selected distributed energy resource products (e.g., IDSS)\
    \ in a rigorous and\ntransparent manner and widely disseminate the evaluation\
    \ results to large commercial and\ninstitutional customers. The evaluations will\
    \ allow comparisons of similar technologies,\nas well as comparisons to existing\

    The overall goal of this narrative review is to identify, compile and assess the\
    \ available\nIDSS in California and how they may serve multiple water, energy\
    \ and nutrient manage-\nment goals. Here, we discuss the different water budget\
    \ components and measurements\nused in crop canopy, soil moisture, aerial reﬂectance\
    \ and satellite-based IDSS. We also\nconsider diverse California cropping and\
    \ irrigation systems and how different IDSS are\nintegrated into existing crop\

    \ Product Evaluation Hub. Finally, we identify knowledge gaps in\nIDSS research\
    \ and current available tools for integrating energy, nitrogen leaching and soil\n\
    salinity management.\n2. Objective and Review Methodology\nWe identiﬁed all active\
    \ IDSS in California through a comprehensive search of all IDSS\non the search\
    \ engines and in consultation with a California IDSS product advisory group.\n\
    The IDSS product advisory group consisted of growers, certiﬁed crop advisors,\
    \ cooperative\nextension advisors, the California Department of Agriculture, California\
    \ Agricultural\nIrrigation Association and additional government, industry and\
    \ trade organizations. The\nadvisory group helped deﬁne the IDSS needs for the\
    \ California cropping system. This\ninformation was used to identify the commercially\
    \ or freely available technologies and\nexclude the IDSS that have not yet been\
    \ made available for widespread use.\nSection 3 deﬁnes California’s water management\
    \ context and the need for IDSS un-\nder increasing drought, regulation and risk\
    \ management. Section 4 provides a broad\noverview of soil–plant–atmosphere approaches\
    \ for IDSS. Section 5 describes the commer-\ncially available IDSS based on soil\
    \ tension, canopy temperature, stem water potential and\nremote-sensing techniques.\
    \ Section 6 describes the science, policy and role of IDSS for\nintegrated irrigation\
    \ and energy management in agricultural systems. Section 7 describes\nthe science,\
    \ policy and role of IDSS for integrated irrigation and nitrogen (N) management\n\
    to control the environmental problems or groundwater contamination due to excessive\n\
    N fertilizer uses. Section 8 describes the science, policy and role of IDSS for\
    \ integrated\nirrigation and salinity management. Sections 9 and 10 focus on IDSS\
    \ as a holistic effort\nfor water, nutrient and salinity management and consider\
    \ the innovation, validation and\nadoption strategies.\n3. Context for IDSS in\
    \ California Agriculture\n3.1. Water Scarcity\nOverdrawn aquifers, decline in\
    \ snowpack, frequent droughts and rising evaporative\ndemand are increasing water\
    \ scarcity in California. These water resource concerns have\nled to decreasing\
    \ water availability for irrigation, increasing regulation (e.g., reduced allo-\n\
    cations), increasing energy consumption, difﬁculty in water/fertilization co-management\n\
    and increasing water and energy prices. Because the annual evaporative demand\
    \ exceeds\nprecipitation in the majority of California, irrigation is generally\
    \ considered compulsory.\nWhile most of the precipitation falls in the winter,\
    \ key economic crops have high water\ndemands during the spring–summer–fall season.\
    \ Additionally, there is a spatial disconnect\nbetween precipitation and agricultural\
    \ water demand in California. Most of the surface\nwater used for agriculture\
    \ comes from precipitation in the northern part of the state, while\nthe Central\
    \ Valley and southern parts of the state have the greatest demand for agricultural\n\
    water. These discrepancies in space and time have led to complex water conveyance,\n\
    storage and transfer systems that are important for understanding the potential\
    \ beneﬁts of\nIDSS for California growers [10].\nAlthough California spans a wide\
    \ range of climates, much of the state, including\nsome of the most productive\
    \ farmland, occupies semi-arid regions of the Central and Impe-\nrial Valleys,\
    \ which are characterized by a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers\nand\
    \ mild, wet winters. Statewide, the average water use is roughly 50% environmental,\n\
    40% agricultural and 10% urban [11]. By necessity, California has adopted management\n\
    strategies to deal with water shortages, such as reusing water, long-distance\
    \ water con-\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n5 of 31\nveyance and desalination technologies\
    \ to complement local ground and surface water [12].\nUnfortunately, water supply\
    \ diversiﬁcation strategies can also lead to increased energy use\nand, consequently,\
    \ to increased greenhouse gas emissions [13]. California’s water system is\nestimated\
    \ to emit 10% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions [14]. Water–energy nexus\n\
    approaches recognize the close connection between water and energy and the importance\n\
    of considering all aspects of these complex systems [15,16]. As irrigation makes\
    \ up a large\nportion of the water supply system in the state, it is under critical\
    \ consideration by both\ngovernment agencies and agricultural end users. Policy\
    \ makers face the difﬁcult task of\nbalancing the needs of diverse stakeholders,\
    \ protecting the environment and providing\nreliable, sustainable water supplies\
    \ to agricultural, industrial and residential customers [16].\nAt the same time,\
    \ California growers face more frequent and severe drought events, warmer\ntemperatures\
    \ and variable rainfall associated with climate change [17], leading to increasing\n\
    dependence on irrigation [18].\nGrowers also face increasing competition for irrigation\
    \ water and growing concerns\nabout the environmental impacts of irrigation. Growers\
    \ pay for water, energy and infras-\ntructure to irrigate crops. California growers\
    \ pay between USD 12/106 ML−1 water in\ndirect costs and USD 17/151 ML−1 water\
    \ in energy costs [19–21]. While growers are willing\nto adopt new technologies\
    \ to reduce risks during periods of water shortage, the information\nprovided\
    \ by extension services and other educational sources plays an important role\
    \ in\nnew irrigation technology adoption [22].\n3.2. Regulations\nCalifornia growers\
    \ identify the key barriers to water and energy conservation efforts as\n(1) cost,\
    \ (2) a lack of return on investment (3) and uncertainty about the future of available\n\
    water. Cost alone is not enough to increase IDSS adoption or agricultural water\
    \ conserva-\ntion [23]. In semi-arid regions, regulating surface water without\
    \ regulating groundwater (or\nvice versa) increases pressure on the unregulated\
    \ water source instead of increasing the use\nof IDSS [24]. However, approaches\
    \ that involve cooperation across institutional ecosystems\nas well as multi-actor\
    \ governance and participation to jointly regulate groundwater and\nsurface water\
    \ quantity, nutrient/pollutant transport and energy usage may increase IDSS\n\
    adoption [23,25].\nFor the past century, California has been a demonstrative example\
    \ where the reg-\nulation and governance of surface water quantity and quality\
    \ have placed tremendous\nstress on groundwater supply and energy required to\
    \ pump groundwater in years with\nlimited surface water allocation. However, the\
    \ legislation and policies adapted in 2014–2016\nare attempting to jointly regulate\
    \ groundwater and surface water quantity, quality and\ncooperation across institutions.\
    \ In 2014, California passed the Sustainable Groundwater\nManagement Act (SGMA),\
    \ in which two state agencies (Department of Water Resources and\nState Water\
    \ Resources Control Board) mandate and oversee communities self-organizing\ninto\
    \ groundwater sustainability agencies [26]. Each agency created groundwater sustain-\n\
    ability plans to achieve sustainability goals by 2040–2042. Similarly, in 2014,\
    \ the California\nIrrigated Lands Regulatory Program was expanded to regulate\
    \ nitrates in discharge to\nboth surface and groundwater from irrigated agricultural\
    \ lands [27]. California’s 2020\nheat wave and widespread agricultural power outages\
    \ have spurred agricultural trade\norganizations to consider the need for IDSS\
    \ to accommodate off-peak energy usage and\nregulations imposed by utility companies\
    \ [28]. However, there are not yet any direct\nstatewide regulations on the energy\
    \ used for groundwater pumping in California.\n3.3. Loss and Risk Management\n\
    3.3.1. Infrastructure Failures\nIDSS could help growers plan for water usage throughout\
    \ the growing season when\nadjustments may be required to accommodate irrigation\
    \ interruptions to avoid yield losses\nat critical moments. For example, in the\
    \ 2018 Census on Irrigation and Water Management,\n1792 CA growers (29,538 ha)\
    \ reported yield losses because of irrigation interruptions related\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 1962\n6 of 31\nto groundwater/surface water shortages, equipment failure,\
    \ energy shortages, high salinity,\nloss of water rights or increase in water\
    \ costs [29]. Having a formal IDSS in place does not\nprevent water, energy or\
    \ infrastructure disruptions but instead could assist in identifying\nequipment\
    \ failures and providing the projected data and calculations needed for difﬁcult\n\
    decisions—how best to prioritize the available water across the farm to the crops\
    \ that will\nhave the highest potential for short- and long-term revenue.\n3.3.2.\
    \ Disease-Based Losses and Water\nGrowers using intuitive, informal irrigation\
    \ practices may err on the side of applying\n‘extra’ water to ensure that crop\
    \ water requirements are met. Additionally, some IDSS may\nalso err on the side\
    \ of overprediction of evapotranspiration and crop water requirements\nto match\
    \ grower management practices. Although this logic may decrease the risk of\n\
    underwatering or water stress, it can increase water logging, nitrate leaching,\
    \ anoxia,\ndenitriﬁcation, salinity, soil erosion and runoff, in addition to the\
    \ wasted energy and water\ncosts [30]. In California perennial crops, overirrigation\
    \ or irrigating too soon can impact\nroot development—especially of shallow, ﬁne\
    \ roots—which can lead to long-term yield\nlosses, especially if the root zone\
    \ oxygen concentration drops below 10% [31]. In both\nannual and perennial crops,\
    \ overirrigation that increases soil and/or canopy moisture can\noften increase\
    \ the survival, growth, infection and dispersal of pathogens, which ultimately\n\
    leads to disease-based yield losses [32]. However, it is important to note that\
    \ not supplying\nenough water to meet crop needs can also trigger many belowground\
    \ diseases [32]. For\na comprehensive review of irrigation–disease interactions,\
    \ please see Swett (2020) [32].\nAlthough IDSS could integrate crop-speciﬁc co-management\
    \ of water and diseases in the\nfuture, to the best of our knowledge, no IDSS\
    \ currently have this function for California\ncropping systems.\n4. Soil–Plant–Atmosphere\
    \ Approaches and Data for IDSS in California\n4.1. Precipitation\nPrecipitation\
    \ is an important component of the hydrologic cycle considered for all\nwater\
    \ budgets. In California, real-time rainfall data can be acquired from different\
    \ sources,\nsuch as the Department of Water Resources California Irrigation Management\
    \ Information\nSystem (CIMIS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s\
    \ California Nevada\nRiver Forecast Center (CNRFC) and United States Climate Data.\
    \ For annual water budget-\ning, monthly precipitation data are often used. Several\
    \ researchers have observed decreases\nin precipitation and increases in autumn\
    \ temperatures since the 1980s [33,34]. In 2018, the\ndelayed start of precipitation\
    \ months resulted in the most destructive wildﬁres of California,\nburning about\
    \ 766,439 hectares of land area [34,35]. This has not only disturbed water\nbudget\
    \ planning and estimation, but it has also impacted the contamination of groundwater\n\
    and other available sources of irrigation by changing the pH due to debris and\
    \ ash [36].\n4.2. Evapotranspiration\nEvapotranspiration depends on weather conditions,\
    \ crop type, canopy density/\ndevelopment, stomatal conductance and regulation,\
    \ irrigation system and management,\nsoil management and soil type. In California,\
    \ the estimates of reference evapotranspiration\n(ETo) come from the 153 active\
    \ CIMIS stations that are sited, maintained and equipped\nby the California Department\
    \ of Water Resources to measure shortwave solar radiation\n(pyranometer), soil\
    \ temperature (thermistor), air temperature (HMP35), relative humidity\n(HMP35),\
    \ wind direction (wind vane), wind speed (anemometer) and precipitation (tipping\n\
    bucket rain gauge). The state is divided into 18 ETo climatic zones based on long-term\n\
    monthly CIMIS averages. Additionally, a spatial CIMIS data product combines the\
    \ network\nof available stations for ground measurement and satellite data in\
    \ order to simulate the\nETo of the whole state. CIMIS estimates hourly ETo for\
    \ cool-season grass with a height\nof 0.10–0.15 m using the CIMIS Penman equation,\
    \ which is modiﬁed from the Penman\nequation [37], with an approach for estimating\
    \ net radiation from shortwave solar radiation,\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n7 of\
    \ 31\ntemperature and relative humidity measurements developed and validated using\
    \ 71 net\nradiometers across California [38]. The CIMIS Penman equation also uses\
    \ different weights\nfor wind speed in the hourly estimation of ETo depending\
    \ on whether it is day or night\ntime and a unique cloud factor obtained from\
    \ each CIMIS station [39].\nIn addition to the CIMIS network, the National Oceanic\
    \ and Atmospheric Administra-\ntion (NOAA) Geostationary Operational Environmental\
    \ Satellite (GOES) satellites have\nbeen used to predict incoming solar radiation\
    \ as the main source energy for evapotran-\nspiration. Satellite-based ETo maps\
    \ are calculated on a two-kilometer grid, which is an\nimportant contribution\
    \ of data for decision making, given that the distance between the\nCIMIS stations\
    \ can be tens of kilometers. These freely available estimates of ETo can be\n\
    paired with crop-speciﬁc coefﬁcients (Kc) to estimate crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETc) during\nthe growing season. It is important to note that evapotranspiration\
    \ offers decision support\nas to how much water has been used by the crop based\
    \ on meteorological data or will be\nused by the crop based on meteorological\
    \ forecasting [40,41].\n4.3. Irrigation Scheduling Resources\nThe quantity and\
    \ timing of water application to irrigate a crop is a critical part of\nplanning\
    \ a growing season. Crop management activities are mainly dependent on the\nmoisture\
    \ present in the soil and root matrix. Scheduling depends on the combination\n\
    of evaporative demand from the atmosphere, spatial and temporal heterogeneity\
    \ in soil\nproperties and changes in crop canopy during a growing season. California\
    \ IDSS currently\nschedule irrigation by measuring, remotely sensing and/or modeling\
    \ some combination of\nthree different categories: (1) evapotranspiration, (2)\
    \ allowable depletion of soil moisture\nand (3) canopy characteristics [42]. In\
    \ this work, we discuss California IDSS and state\nspeciﬁc data sources that can\
    \ be used to ascertain data from these categories and represent\nthese tools and\
    \ sensors in Figure 2. These categories are used in IDSS throughout the world,\n\
    and we recommend Gu et al. (2020) for an in-depth general review [43].\n4.3.1.\
    \ In Situ Calculation of Crop Coefﬁcient Values\nCrop coefﬁcient (Kc) values can\
    \ be obtained for the entire growing season from his-\ntorical evapotranspiration\
    \ databases for specialty crops (almonds, walnuts, pistachios,\nprocessing tomatoes,\

    \ program. There are available databases maintained by the University of Califor-\n\

    management/irrigation-guide/ (accessed on 20 August 2021)) that provide regional\
    \ esti-\nmates of ETo and ETc for growers. Signiﬁcant efforts have been made to\
    \ measure actual\nevapotranspiration to derive the Kc values speciﬁc to California\
    \ crops and management.\nDirect measurements using lysimetry, eddy covariance\
    \ and surface renewal have estimated\nKc values for almond, pistachio, walnut,\
    \ processing tomato, wine grapes, lettuce, rice,\ncorn, wheat, and alfalfa (Table\
    \ 1) [44–68]. It is important to note that the Kc values derived\nfrom actual\
    \ evapotranspiration studies have several assumptions and site-speciﬁc limita-\n\
    tions for widespread adoption and water use projections. Attention should be given\
    \ as\nto whether water stress had occurred during the actual evapotranspiration\
    \ measurement\nperiods as well as the uncertainty of actual evapotranspiration\
    \ estimates by a method-\nological approach. The use of crop coefﬁcients for irrigation\
    \ of perennial crops is often\nmore challenging than for annual crops. This is\
    \ because there can be signiﬁcant variability\nas a consequence of the crop density,\
    \ crop load, row orientation, variety, irrigation sys-\ntem, pruning, ﬂoor management,\

    \ for more details.\n4.3.2. Scheduling with Allowable Depletion\nThe allowable\
    \ depletion of soil moisture approach requires some knowledge or a priori\nassumption\
    \ of the effective crop rooting depth, soil textural and hydrological properties\
    \ and\nestimates of either soil volumetric water content or soil water potential.\
    \ These parameters\nare used to estimate the plant available water content (AWC)\
    \ as the difference between ﬁeld\ncapacity and permanent wilting point. The allowable\
    \ depletion is established as a threshold\nbased on a fraction of AWC or speciﬁc\
    \ soil water potential at which water stress will occur\nwithout irrigation. The\
    \ allowable depletion can differ by soil texture, crop type, as well\nas phenological\
    \ stage. In California, the allowable depletion can range from 25% AWC in\nonions\
    \ to 90% AWC in ripening wheat but generally runs in the 45–50% AWC range [69–71].\n\
    Allowable depletion, whether measured or modeled, offers decision support regarding\n\
    how much to irrigate (e.g., reﬁll the soil proﬁle), as well as when to initiate\
    \ irrigation. It\nis important to note that allowable depletion is not a direct\
    \ assessment of plant water\nstress but rather assumes plant water stress based\
    \ on empirical relationships between plant\nphysiological stress (e.g., stem water\
    \ potential, canopy temperature, reduced transpiration)\nand soil volumetric water\
    \ content or soil water potential.\nSoil cohesion and adhesion to water molecules\
    \ determines the soil water potential\n(suction or negative pressure). Plants\
    \ take up water when water potential is between\nthe ﬁeld capacity (−0.33 bar)\
    \ and permanent wilting point (−15 bar). Therefore, irriga-\ntion scheduling is\
    \ performed by maintaining the soil moisture within this range of soil\nwater\
    \ potential. The most commonly used methods for soil moisture or water potential\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n10 of 31\nmonitoring in California are tensiometers,\
    \ electrical resistance block (watermark sensors)\nor capacitance-based sensors\
    \ [72]. Recent developments in telemetric operations allow\nmanufacturers to combine\
    \ the soil moisture sensors with web or mobile applications as\nremote systems.\
    \ Additionally, the user friendliness of remote telemetry and real-time\nmoisture\
    \ data in the ﬁeld are now integrated with automated irrigation systems. Some\n\
    of the common telemetric operators for soil moisture sensors in California are\
    \ Wildeye,\nFarm(X), Hortau, Irriwatch and AquaSpy.\n4.3.3. Scheduling with Crop\
    \ Canopy Characteristics\nRecent advancements in the capture and interpretation\
    \ of remotely sensed vegetative\nindices (e.g., normalized difference vegetation\
    \ index or NDVI) allow growers to empirically\nderive real-time values of crop\
    \ coefﬁcients throughout the growing season [73–75]. Remote\nsensing tools, such\
    \ as directly or remotely piloted aerial vehicles or satellite imagery, aid in\n\
    the use of algorithms to combine remotely sensed vegetative indices and soil reﬂectance\n\
    maps [76–79]. This combination helps growers manage irrigation in orchard cropping\n\
    systems where NDVI and other index values for individual trees can be calculated.\
    \ In\nCalifornia, these services are widely provided by Ceres Imaging Inc. to\
    \ specialty crop grow-\ners. Additionally, CropManage uses satellite-based estimates\
    \ of phenology for irrigation\nscheduling [80–82].\n5. IDSS for Crop Water Management\
    \ in California\nThe use of IDSS has increased in California in the last decade,\
    \ especially for efﬁcient\nwater application preparation for the SGMA regulatory\
    \ standards. The most common\nIDSS in California integrate two major components:\
    \ (1) data input/analysis and (2) user\ninterface. The data input/analytical techniques\
    \ acquire data based on soil, crop and/or\nweather parameters, and the user interface\
    \ is based on telemetry that simpliﬁes the acquired\ndata using statistical interpretation,\
    \ photogrammetry and/or simulation modeling. The\nease of understanding or user\
    \ friendliness of the acquired information depends on the\nuse of graphics, color\
    \ notations and approach to simplify the complex data [83]. The\nIDSS commonly\
    \ used in cultivating specialty crops in California can be classiﬁed into\nthree\
    \ types (Table 2): (1) soil-based IDSS, (2) canopy-based IDSS and (3) remote-sensing\n\
    IDSS. Irrigation strategies, such as deﬁcit irrigation, subsurface drip irrigation,\
    \ overhead\nlinear move sprinkler irrigation, deep root irrigation, pressure-compensated\
    \ drip irrigation,\nautomated surface irrigation, and tail recovery systems may\
    \ enhance water use efﬁciency\nfor high-value crops in California [84].\n5.1.\
    \ Soil-Based IDSS\nIn IDSS, soil moisture is generally reported in inches of water\
    \ per foot of soil or as\na percentage of weight or volume [2,85], while soil\
    \ water potential is usually reported in\nbars or kPa. The California IDSS based\
    \ on soil moisture usually also estimate or infer soil\nhydrologic properties\
    \ (e.g., texture, AWC) to contextualize the recommendations. Therefore,\nthe soil\
    \ sensors used as IDSS can be divided into two types.\nType 1—IDSS based on volumetric\
    \ moisture content. These soil moisture sensors include\ntime domain reﬂectometry,\
    \ capacitance and frequency domain reﬂectometry sensors [80,86].\nType 2—IDSS\
    \ based on soil water potential. These sensors include tensiometers and\ngranular\
    \ matrix sensors [87,88].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n11 of 31\nTable 2. List of\

    \ 12, 1962\n12 of 31\nSoil sensors are generally provided by IDSS vendors in combination\
    \ with their telemet-\nric services to access the data through cloud-based data\
    \ storage applications. The selection\nof these sensors is based on evaluating\
    \ water and energy savings, installation and mainte-\nnance, ease of use and suitability\
    \ for specialty crops and soil type, data interpretation and\nadditional services.\
    \ Vendors have the capability of making recommendations to growers\nby integrating\
    \ and installing in situ weather stations. However, the CIMIS weather stations\n\
    are widely spread throughout the state and provide reliable and validated information\
    \ on\nthe required weather parameters for water budgeting. Some commonly used\
    \ soil moisture\nsensors can be combined with telemetric services provided either\
    \ by the sensor company\nor by a separate IDSS vendor.\nSoil moisture probes are\
    \ widely used to determine the real-time volumetric moisture\ncontent allowing\
    \ user-friendly or site-speciﬁc calibrations. Measurements can be taken\nat the\
    \ desirable depths throughout the soil proﬁle. These sensors also provide additional\n\
    information on soil temperature and salinity. These sensors, based on design,\
    \ can also\nmeasure soil water potential up to −10 bars. The sensors are provided\
    \ to growers as leased\nassets, and real-time irrigation recommendations are made\
    \ through telemetry services.\nExamples include tensiometers that are designed\
    \ to measure soil water potential in heavy\n(0–1 bar) and light soils (0–0.3 bar).\
    \ Watermark sensors are based on electrical resistance in\nsoils and are widely\
    \ useful for measuring soil matric potential up to 2 bars.\n5.2. Canopy-Based\
    \ IDSS\nThe metabolic processes in a plant system are driven by its water content.\
    \ Plant water\nstatus can be estimated by monitoring physiological and metabolic\
    \ processes, such as stem\nor leaf water potential, relative moisture content,\
    \ stomatal conductance, canopy temperature\nand xylem cavitation [2,73,89–92].\
    \ The most commonly measured water stress parameters in\nCalifornia are canopy\
    \ temperature, canopy cover and stem water potential [2]. These plant\nwater status\
    \ indicators are most useful for irrigation timing and can be used to inform when\n\
    irrigation is required, when crops are not receiving enough irrigation, when there\
    \ are problems\nwith irrigation systems (e.g., distribution uniformity), as a\
    \ proxy for soil salinity stress and\nfor applying controlled stress to improve\
    \ crop quality or health. Plant water status indicators\nare less useful for understanding\
    \ how much irrigation is needed, as they do not provide\ninformation about soil\
    \ moisture or evaporative demand. Plant-based IDSS are generally\ncombined with\
    \ meteorological parameters and/or evapotranspiration data.\n5.2.1. Canopy Cover\n\
    Radiation interception and evapotranspiration depend on the canopy cover and sur-\n\
    face area of a crop. Canopy cover serves as an important parameter for several\
    \ remote-\nsensing techniques used as IDSS. As crop canopies change throughout\
    \ the growing season\nin terms of their size, area and reﬂectance properties,\
    \ so do the values of the crop coefﬁcient\n(Kc). The spectral reﬂectance of vegetation\
    \ or crop canopy can help growers understand\nthe variability in the ﬁeld by assessing\
    \ the plant vigor and chlorophyll content [93,94].\nA key component of canopy-based\
    \ IDSS is the crop and growth stage-speciﬁc Kc value.\nThe Kc values are usually\
    \ determined from ﬁeld studies measuring actual evapotranspi-\nration and ETo\
    \ [95,96] but can also be assessed using measurements of leaf area index,\nlight\
    \ interception and percent canopy cover. Some of the commonly used IDSS based\n\
    on evapotranspiration and canopy parameters include Arable Mark 2 sensors and\
    \ Tule\nsensors. These sensors are leased by the respective vendors, and the irrigation\
    \ recom-\nmendations based on canopy parameters are informed through web/mobile\
    \ applications.\nArable Mark 2 sensors are often combined with the soil moisture\
    \ probes to apply the soil\nand canopy parameters to complete the water budget\
    \ equation for irrigation decisions.\n5.2.2. Canopy Temperature\nCanopy temperature\
    \ indirectly measures water deﬁcit when it increases above the\nsurrounding ambient\
    \ temperature [97]. In general, the variability in canopy temperature\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 1962\n13 of 31\nis also a result of solar radiation and air temperature.\
    \ Different indices are used for\nirrigation scheduling using canopy temperatures.\
    \ Some examples include the Crop Water\nStress Index, Stress Degree Days, Stomatal\
    \ Conductance Index, Degrees Above Canopy\nThreshold and Time Temperature Threshold\
    \ (TTT) [98–101]. In California, the Crop Water\nStress Index and Degrees Above\
    \ Canopy Threshold have been evaluated for wine grapes,\ncorn, pistachios and\
    \ wheat growers using infrared thermal radiometry [102,103]. The\nCrop Water Stress\
    \ Index is calculated by determining the canopy temperature minus\nthe air temperature\
    \ relative to a well-watered and non-transpiring reference crop [103].\nContrary\
    \ to the Crop Water Stress Index, the Degrees Above Canopy Threshold only\nrequires\
    \ a single canopy temperature measurement for quantifying water stress [103,104].\n\
    For point-based measurements, canopy temperature can be acquired using an infrared\n\
    thermal radiometer [103]. At larger spatial scales, thermal and spectral imagery\
    \ IDSS\n(e.g., Ceres Imaging) using remote-sensing tools can be used for determining\
    \ indices based\non canopy temperature.\n5.2.3. Stem Water Potential\nStem water\
    \ potential is an indicator of how hard a plant is pumping to move water\nfrom\
    \ the soil (−15 to 0 bars) through the xylem (−2 to −60 bars) to the atmosphere\n\
    (−200 to −800 bars) [105]. In California, stem water potential is most commonly\
    \ used\nand recommended for high-value perennial crops, such as grapes, almonds,\
    \ walnuts and\nprunes [106,107]. Stem water potential is most often measured by\
    \ a pressure chamber, which\napplies pressure to a sample leaf until the water\
    \ is pushed out of the stem [90,106,108].\nThere are growing numbers of sensors\
    \ available for measuring the stem water potential.\nThese sensors can function\
    \ as micro-chips or micro-tensiometers or dendrometers for\ninstallation in woody\
    \ vines or trunks [108]. In order to be useful, stem water potential\nmeasurements\
    \ need to be contextualized in relation to the environmental demand, as they\n\
    are sensitive to temperature and vapor pressure deﬁcit [105]. Local tools are\
    \ available for\ngrowers to correct stem water potential readings in reference\
    \ to the evaporative demand and\ncompare the readings to baseline values when\
    \ water is not limited. The use of stem water\npotential measurements is high\
    \ in wine grapes, as growers are interested in maintaining\nspeciﬁc levels of\
    \ stress after veraison in order to maintain the quality (M. Cooper, personal\n\
    communication). Larger California vineyards have ‘pressure bomb teams’ to constantly\
    \ test\nstem water potential throughout the vineyards during the key time periods.\
    \ Although there\nare disease management beneﬁts to maintaining stress at hull\
    \ split, nut growers have still\nbeen slow to adopt the pressure chambers to measure\
    \ stem water potential, with adoption\nrates of under 20% among almond growers\
    \ [109].\n5.3. Remote-Sensing IDSS\nRemote and proximal sensing tools can be used\
    \ either independently or in conjunction\nwith ground measurements to estimate\
    \ actual evapotranspiration, ETc, allowable depletion\nand plant water status.\
    \ Remote sensing can use several modes of data collection, including\nsatellite,\
    \ aerial imaging and scanning towers. Remotely sensed measurements of evapotran-\n\
    spiration typically use thermal imaging as an indicator of canopy radiometric\
    \ temperature,\nwhere higher temperatures indicate relatively lower rates of evapotranspiration\
    \ (relatively\nhigher partitioning to sensible heat ﬂux), and relatively lower\
    \ temperatures indicate higher\nrates of evapotranspiration (relatively higher\
    \ partitioning to latent heat ﬂux). Remotely\nsensed vegetation indices from multispectral\
    \ data, such as NDVI, can be used as analogs for\nthe leaf area index, canopy\
    \ cover and height, which are also required for evapotranspiration\nmapping algorithms.\
    \ All remotely sensed evapotranspiration models solve for sensible\nheat ﬂux,\
    \ soil heat ﬂux and net radiation, which leaves the latent heat ﬂux or the energy\n\
    equivalent of evapotranspiration as the remainder of the energy budget. Some of\
    \ the en-\nergy balance models commonly used in evapotranspiration estimation\
    \ include Two-Source\nEnergy Balance (TSEB), Surface Energy Balance Algorithm\
    \ for Land (SEBAL), Surface En-\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n14 of 31\nergy Balance\
    \ System (SEBS), Mapping EvapoTRanspiration using Internalized Calibration\n(METRIC)\
    \ and High-Resolution Mapping of EvapoTranspiration (HRMET) [77,110–115].\nThese\
    \ types of evapotranspiration maps and crop stress indices have been integrated\n\
    into several IDSS that serve California, such as Ceres Imaging (Oakland, CA, USA),\
    \ Ir-\nriwatch (Maurik, The Netherlands) and Open ET (a satellite-based water\
    \ data resource\nlaunched by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\
    \ and United States\nGeological Services (USGS)). However, one potential concern\
    \ or drawback is that detectable\ndifferences in evapotranspiration based on canopy\
    \ radiometric temperature may be re-\nvealed too late for irrigation intervention,\
    \ in that crops exhibiting this level of water stress\nhave already suffered some\
    \ yield loss from decreased photosynthesis [116]. This limitation\nof thermal\
    \ imaging has led to new areas of development for IDSS that may involve combin-\n\
    ing a variety of spectral bands, solar-induced ﬂuorescence and thermal imagery\
    \ to provide\nadditional information relating water status to yields [117,118].\n\
    Proximal sensing of soil apparent electrical conductivity can be a useful tool\
    \ to de-\nvelop high-resolution maps of AWC and other important soil physical\
    \ and hydrological\nproperties [119]. These soil maps can be used in conjunction\
    \ with maps of evapotranspira-\ntion or stem water potential measurements to assess\
    \ plant water status [77,78]. In many\nareas outside of California, commercial\
    \ IDSS have been developed to assign management\nzones based on soil properties,\
    \ especially in regions where center pivot irrigation systems\ndominate and can\
    \ be retroﬁtted or designed with variable rate application technology. New\nopportunities\
    \ for precision irrigation exist in California micro-irrigation systems using\n\
    variable frequency drives to irrigate based on the management zones. However,\
    \ there\nare not yet commercially available IDSS in California that rely primarily\
    \ on soil apparent\nelectrical conductivity mapping to delineate zone-based irrigation\
    \ management.\n6. IDSS for Energy Management in California\n6.1. General Considerations\n\
    The California agricultural sector consumes 75% of total water use in California\n\
    compared to 24% and 1% for municipal and industrial sectors, respectively [4].\
    \ During\nthe most recent megadrought between 2012 and 2016, the groundwater contribution\
    \ to\ntotal water use nearly doubled from 30–40% to 60%, with most of this being\
    \ used for\nagricultural irrigation [120,121]. Agricultural groundwater consumption\
    \ is directly linked\nwith the energy required to pump groundwater from the aquifers.\
    \ In California, 8% of total\nenergy use is for agriculture, and 70% of the agricultural\
    \ energy used is for groundwater\npumping [122]. Agricultural water and energy\
    \ demand surge in dry years and the summer\nmonths—especially in the afternoons\
    \ during peak daily energy demand for water to cool\nboth crops and humans [123].\
    \ Additionally, 60% of daily water-related energy demand is\ndue to pumping irrigation\
    \ water in California from surface and groundwater sources [124].\nMost surface\
    \ irrigation systems have an irrigation efﬁciency of 67.5–70%, while the\ntraditional\
    \ sprinkler system ranges between 70 and 82.5%. Drip and micro-sprinkler\nsystems\
    \ have the highest irrigation efﬁciency compared to sprinkler or surface systems,\n\
    ranging between 87.5 and 90% [125]. Pressurized surface and subsurface drip or\
    \ micro-\nsprinkler irrigation systems improve irrigation efﬁciency but require\
    \ more energy than\nsurface ﬂood or gravity irrigation [121,126]. Because there\
    \ has been a nearly commensurate\nconversion in half of California’s irrigated\
    \ lands from surface ﬂood or gravity systems to\npressurized systems since 1972\
    \ [127], California’s irrigation infrastructure has unfortunately\nincreased its\
    \ overall energy consumption while increasing its overall water use efﬁciency.\n\
    6.2. Science\nThere are opportunities for coupled energy and water conservation\
    \ in agriculture\nthrough improving irrigation system efﬁciency, application efﬁciency,\
    \ as well as crop water\nuse efﬁciency. Agricultural pumping of irrigation water\
    \ uses approximately 10 TWh of\nelectricity per year [128], and at least 1 TWh\
    \ or 10% of this usage could be conserved\nthrough improved control of water with\
    \ better water metering and improved distribution\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n15\
    \ of 31\nuniformity [4]. Additionally, pumping reductions through science-based\
    \ irrigation schedul-\ning efforts on farm- or district-wide scales may also reduce\
    \ energy consumption [123].\nAdditional energy savings may be available through\
    \ increasing the pump efﬁciency to\n55–65% and using variable frequency drives\
    \ to facilitate changes in pump speeds when\nsystem pressure demands are not peaking\
    \ [129]. Moreover, on-farm solar generation and\nsolar or hybrid solar pumps can\
    \ also curb peak energy demands that coincide with peak\nwater demands [123].\n\
    Finally, either front loading pumping to on-farm water storage structures in advance\n\
    of peak energy demand [123,130] or applying a larger magnitude of irrigation a\
    \ week in\nadvance of a predicted heat wave could mitigate peak energy usage during\
    \ heat waves [126].\nHowever, scheduling larger irrigation events in advance of\
    \ a heat wave would have to\nensure that soil properties facilitated storage rather\
    \ than drainage of excess water. Similarly,\ndeﬁcit irrigation has been suggested\
    \ for energy conservation; however, this would need to\nensure that there either\
    \ would not be a signiﬁcant yield loss or that the yield losses would be\nlow\
    \ enough to justify an overall proﬁt based on reduced energy and irrigation costs.\
    \ Finally,\nthere is an opportunity for collective and community-based action\
    \ from irrigation districts\nand newly formed groundwater sustainability agencies\
    \ to use and develop district-wide\ntools for common pool energy users to pump\
    \ and store water in advance of peak times, as\nwell as prioritize and optimize\
    \ groundwater pumping based on the crop stage and need\nduring droughts and heat\
    \ waves [131].\n6.3. Policy\nThe above coupled energy and water management measures\
    \ require supportive poli-\ncies and governance for success, in which California\
    \ has made some promising progress. In\nresponse to the groundwater-pumping-related\
    \ energy use and high greenhouse gas emis-\nsions during the megadrought of 2012–2016,\
    \ California enacted the State Water Efﬁciency\nand Enhancement Program (SWEEP)\
    \ in 2014, which is the ﬁrst and largest program of its\nkind in the United States\
    \ to date. The SWEEP program involves a competitive application\nprocess for growers\
    \ to receive grants to make improvements that will reduce water and\nenergy consumption,\
    \ greenhouse gases, as well as improve drought resilience and air\nquality. Agricultural\
    \ operations can receive grants for three project categories: (1) pump\nand motor\
    \ enhancements, which include installing variable frequency drives and replacing\n\
    or improving the efﬁciency of motors or pumps; (2) irrigation system enhancements\
    \ for\nsystems with pumps, which include system pressure reduction measures, soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors, automating irrigation systems and IDSS; (3) fuel conversion\
    \ and renewable energy,\nwhich include changing fuel types to low-carbon fuel,\
    \ as well as the installation of on-site\nrenewable energy sources to offset fuel\
    \ use [132].\nApplicants must quantify the baseline information about current\
    \ energy, infrastruc-\nture efﬁciency and water use. Approximately one-third of\
    \ applicants have been awarded\nSWEEP at a maximum of USD 100,000 for 18 months\
    \ [133]. The awardees must use base-\nline water and energy data, as well as the\
    \ SWEEP Irrigation Water Savings Assessment\nTool and California Air Resources\
    \ Board Greenhouse Gas Calculator tool, to quantify the\nprojected water and energy\
    \ savings. The SWEEP program has invested USD 80 million in\nover 800 projects\
    \ for an annual water saving of 88,496 Megaliters and GHG reduction of\n80,077\
    \ MTCO2e [134]. The program’s challenges include the need for a stable, continuous\n\
    funding source and increased accessibility for small and socially disadvantaged\
    \ grow-\ners [133]. Speciﬁcally, although a third of projects have been located\
    \ in disadvantaged\ncommunities, only 10% of the funds have gone to socially disadvantaged\
    \ growers and\nranchers [133,134]. Although the SWEEP program has incentivized\
    \ and improved the\nirrigation system infrastructure and design for energy optimization,\
    \ there is still a need and\nlarge opportunity for IDSS and training related to\
    \ coupled water and energy management\nin California [133].\nAgronomy 2022, 12,\
    \ 1962\n16 of 31\n6.4. Decision Support for Irrigation and Energy Management\n\
    Although there has been an identiﬁable need for co-management of irrigation and\n\
    energy, there is currently only one decision support tool deployed for this purpose\
    \ in\nCalifornia. The California Energy Commission funded the research and development\
    \ of\nAgMonitor [135]. AgMonitor integrates irrigation schedules based on the\
    \ crop coefﬁcient\napproach and monthly aerial imagery with ﬂow metering and all\
    \ on-farm energy sources\nand sinks. This IDSS provides information on irrigation\
    \ magnitude and timing events\nthat will also optimize energy conservation across\
    \ a farm and has been validated in key\nCalifornian crops, such as processing\
    \ tomato, almond, pistachio and alfalfa. Although\ncommercially available IDSS\
    \ are limited in this area, there are currently research-level\nIDSS in development\
    \ to optimize irrigation applications with photovoltaic power produc-\ntion [136,137].\n\
    7. IDSS for Nitrogen (N) Management in California\n7.1. General Considerations\n\
    California’s intensive irrigated agricultural production has led to the use of\
    \ large\namounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizers. In contrast, N over-application\
    \ has been associated with\nwater pollution and various human health concerns\
    \ [138]. More than 50 years of tradeoffs\nbetween the use of N fertilizer and\
    \ the health of the environment have been documented in\nCalifornia [139,140].\
    \ Over the past years, the volume of inorganic N fertilizer used in the\nstate\
    \ has expanded dramatically. The annual sales between 1980 and 2001 have exceeded\n\
    600,000 tons of N [141].\nA signiﬁcant increase in the N fertilizer application\
    \ rate was observed in the Sacra-\nmento Valley, San Joaquin Basin and Tulare\
    \ Basin of the Central Valley for the period\n2002–2012 compared to 1991–2001\
    \ [142,143]. Nitrogen loading in the Sacramento Valley,\nSan Joaquin Basin and\
    \ Tulare Basin saw a signiﬁcant increase in 2002–2012 compared to\n1991–2001 [138].\
    \ More than 740,000 tons of N fertilizer was loaded on roughly 2.7 million\nhectares\
    \ of irrigated farmland in California. The excess N fertilizer leaches to groundwater\n\
    and affects the quality of drinking water [144]. Improper management of N fertiliza-\n\
    tion in California has contributed to the unsustainability of agricultural production\
    \ and\nhas threatened the health of Central Valley communities whose drinking\
    \ water relies on\ngroundwater resources.\n7.2. Science\nCrop N needs have been\
    \ investigated to provide growers with tools to determine\nproper fertilizer applications.\
    \ Numerous quantitative and complex decision-making tools\nhave been consistently\
    \ used to achieve improved nutrient management and irrigation.\nOnline spreadsheet\
    \ models and IDSS that process large amounts of information have been\nimplemented\
    \ by the University of California to help growers determine the appropriate\n\
    amounts of N fertilizers to apply (Table 3) [82]. Early season leaf sampling in\
    \ tree crops was\ndeveloped to estimate N status in tree tissues and make adjustments\
    \ in fertilizer timing\nand amount. Brown et al. [145] developed online spreadsheet\
    \ models for managing N\nin almonds and developed the four Rs of N management\
    \ (right rate, right time, right\nplace, right source). The right rate consists\
    \ of applying N in appropriate proportion to tree\ndemand. The right time is the\
    \ N application with the accurate timing with tree uptake,\nwhich starts at 70%\
    \ leaf out and stops soon after harvest. The right place encompasses\nvariable\
    \ rate irrigation and N application to address in-orchard soil and yield variability\n\
    as well as N application to the tree’s active root zone or foliage. The right\
    \ source refers\nto using the type of fertilizer that optimizes other nutrients\
    \ and suits the crop and the\nenvironment [146]. The Soil Nitrate Quick Test (SNQT),\
    \ developed for vegetables, provides\nan estimate of the soil mineral N status\
    \ capable of offsetting a fraction of the total N\nrequired by a crop. Hartz et\
    \ al. [147] developed N requirements for processing tomatoes in\nthe Central Valley.\
    \ Nitrogen application guidelines were later modelized to help growers\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 1962\n17 of 31\noptimize N application in processing tomato production\
    \ [148] and across several key\nCalifornia crops [149].\nTable 3. Principal decision\

    \ issues, the State Water Board has evaluated the\nexisting policies to determine\
    \ if existing water regulations are sufﬁcient and have improved\nthe wastewater\
    \ regulations to protect groundwater quality (www.cvsalinity.org (accessed\non\
    \ 20 August 2021)). The dischargers, such as growers, food processors, municipalities\n\
    and ranchers, have to comply with new regulations (e.g., Salt and Nitrate Management\n\
    Plan). Californian growers are under rising regulatory pressure to improve N use\
    \ efﬁciency\nin agricultural production to decrease nitrate leaching. Therefore,\
    \ they need the tools to\naccurately estimate crop N needs and availability to\
    \ conﬁdently adjust the N application\nrates. The federal and state agencies responsible\
    \ for protecting air and water quality have\nbeen assessing the causes, consequences\
    \ and costs of California’s agriculture-wide N use.\nThis concern explains the\
    \ various regulatory initiatives, such as the Central Valley Regional\nWater Quality\
    \ Control Board’s Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program, the Central Coast\nRegional\
    \ Water Quality Control Board’s renewal process for the Irrigated Agricultural\n\
    Lands Waiver, the Climate Action Reserve’s N Fertilizer Reduction Protocol and\
    \ the Central\nValley Regional Water Quality Control Board’s General Order for\
    \ Dairy Waste Dischargers\nand the Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long-term\
    \ Sustainability (CV-SALTS)\nprogram [150].\nCV-SALTS is a collaborative program\
    \ tasked to develop environmentally and eco-\nnomically sustainable management\
    \ plans for nitrates and salts in the Central Valley. The\nExecutive Committee\
    \ encompasses diverse stakeholder groups, such as agricultural groups,\ncities,\
    \ industry, regulatory agencies and community and environmental justice representa-\n\
    tives. The Salt and Nitrate Management Plan (SNMP) developed by CV-SALTS is built\
    \ on a\nrange of existing water quality management policies. It proposes additional\
    \ policies, mech-\nanisms and tools to provide the Central Valley Water Board\
    \ with the appropriate means for\naddressing the long-term loading of salt and\
    \ nitrates in the different regions of the Central\nValley. CV-SALTS is also tasked\
    \ with developing an all-inclusive regulatory program with\nadequate strategies\
    \ to address the management of salts and nitrates sustainably [151].\n7.4. Decision\
    \ Support for Irrigation and N Management\nNumerous IDSS for irrigation + N have\
    \ been developed by extension services, uni-\nversities and other institutions\
    \ involved in water management for states or regions [152].\nSome IDDS that help\
    \ manage N in CA include CropManage, Food, Agriculture, Resource\nManagement System\
    \ (FARMs) and the N Budget Calculator.\nCropManage can help growers and farm managers\
    \ determine watering and fertilizer\nN schedules on a ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld basis. All\
    \ the required components to determine crop water\nneeds, such as ETo and weather\
    \ data (from CIMIS), estimated Kc, as well as adequate\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ based on soil properties, are available without the need for in-ﬁeld\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 1962\n18 of 31\nsensors. CropManage is publicly available at: https://cropmanage.ucanr.edu/\
    \ (accessed\non 21 August 2021). The software automates all steps required to\
    \ calculate crop water\nrequirements, including N recommendations, based on soil\
    \ crop N uptake models, nitrate\nquick test values and credits for nitrate in\
    \ irrigation water and preceding crop residues.\nCropManage also helps growers\
    \ track irrigation and fertilizer schedules on multiple ﬁelds\nand allows data\
    \ sharing among users from the same farming operations. The web-based\napplication\
    \ record-keeping capability allows growers to review water and N applications\n\
    on each ﬁeld and maintain data required to comply with water quality regulations.\
    \ Crop-\nManage can be integrated with other web applications and data sources\
    \ to improve the\naccuracy of irrigation and fertilizer models [82].\nFARMs is\
    \ a user-friendly geospatial web-based application that simpliﬁes the use of\n\
    the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) model by automating\
    \ pro-\ncesses such as weather, climate and soil input. FARMs was developed using\
    \ DSSAT-CSM\nand open-source GIS software. FARMs allows adaptive management to\
    \ perform in-season\nyield predictions using both weather and climatic data to\
    \ evaluate the potential impacts of\nmanagement decisions on end-of-season yield.\
    \ FARMs uses NASA POWER weather data\nintegrated through an API [153]. FARMs simulates\
    \ nitrogen cycling of the cropping systems\nand quantiﬁes crop N stress based\
    \ on nitrogen uptake versus available nitrogen and is\nexpressed as a range between\
    \ 0 (no stress) to 1 (maximum stress). FARMs also simulates\nthe probability of\
    \ nitrate leaching from a given irrigation and N management strategy.\nThe N Calculator\
    \ is a predictive model that helps growers by advising on the timing\nand the\
    \ appropriate amount of N fertilizer to meet yield-based demand [145]. The N\n\
    Calculator has many functions, including calculating fertilization rates based\
    \ on the newest\nUC N management research, applying the four Rs of nutrient management\
    \ (right source,\nright rate, right timing and right location), enabling efﬁcient\
    \ fertilizer use, calculating N\nsupplies from non-fertilizer sources, such as\
    \ cover crops groundwater and compost, and\ncloning the N budget from one orchard\
    \ to another within and between years.\nFor example, using this tool for almonds\
    \ requires entering a yield estimate for pre-\nand post-bloom and adding early\
    \ season tissue-sampling results. The N Calculator helps\nto meet much of the\
    \ nutrients management required from the Irrigated Lands Regulatory\nProgram.\
    \ The Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program requires keeping an Irrigation and N\n\
    Management Plan (INMP) worksheet onsite and submitting a summary report to one’s\n\
    coalition in post-harvest time.\n8. IDSS for Salinity Management in California\n\
    8.1. General Considerations\nAbout 40% of global irrigated land is located in\
    \ arid/semi-arid zones, and this irriga-\ntion is often associated with salinization\
    \ [154]. With the development of intensive irrigation\npractices, the Central\
    \ Valley of California has become one of the world’s most productive\nfarming\
    \ regions. The continuously increasing levels of crop production are threatened\
    \ due\nto the deteriorating irrigation water quality. Clay layers impeding percolation\
    \ to deeper\ngroundwater regions have led to salt accumulation in drainage water\
    \ in many Central\nValley regions. One of the primary sources of salts is the\
    \ water supply imported from the\nSacramento–San Joaquin River Delta. About 250\
    \ tons of salt a day are imported into the\nSan Joaquin Valley through the state\
    \ and federal water project canals [155]. The soils of the\nCentral Valley’s western\
    \ regions are sedimentary and alluvial from the origin and formed\nin an uplifted\
    \ seabed. The native salts have mineralized and leached to the shallow water\n\
    tables over time due to irrigation and ﬂooding [156]. In the predominantly clay\
    \ and silty\nclay soil textures, as plants extract water from the soil and transpire,\
    \ the salt concentration\nlevel of the drainage water is likely to increase. As\
    \ a result, salts are likely to concentrate in\nthe root zone and accumulate in\
    \ shallow water tables through leaching [157]. Excessive salt\nconcentrations\
    \ affect a plant’s osmotic balance and trigger a reduction in plant water uptake\n\
    and stomata closing, which causes transpiration inhibition to occur [158]. The\
    \ increasing\nsoil salinity slowly and steadily contaminates water supplies and\
    \ reduces crop production.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n19 of 31\nVarious factors,\
    \ such as drought, climate change, water shortages and land-use changes,\ncould\
    \ exacerbate the salinity conditions.\nMore than 1.8 million hectares of irrigated\
    \ cropland in Central Valley (primarily in\nthe San Joaquin Valley) are affected\
    \ either through saline irrigation water or saline soils,\nand tens of thousands\
    \ of hectares of productive agricultural land are at risk (Figure 1) [159].\n\
    Salt accumulation has triggered more than 99957 hectares to be taken out of agricultural\n\
    production, and another 0.6 million hectares are considered damaged by salinity\
    \ [155].\nCurrent management activities address only 15% of the annual salt load\
    \ [150]. The direct\nannual costs from increasing salinity will range from USD\
    \ 1 billion to USD 1.5 billion, and\ntotal annual income impacts to the State\
    \ of California are predicted to range between USD\n1.7 billion and USD 3 billion\
    \ by 2030 [160]. The income reduction in the Central Valley\nwill range between\
    \ USD 1.2 billion and USD 2.2 billion [160]. In 2014, salinity reduced\nCalifornia’s\
    \ agricultural revenues by USD 3.7 billion, amounting to 8.0 million tons of crop\n\
    production lost [161].\n8.2. Science\nThe U.S. Salinity Laboratory (1954) classiﬁed\
    \ ﬁve cases of agricultural soil salinity: non-\nsaline (0–2 dS m−1), slightly\
    \ saline (2–4 dS m−1), moderately saline (4–8 dS m−1), strongly\nsaline (8–16\
    \ dS m−1) and extremely saline (>16 dS m−1) [162]. Although this salinity system\n\
    is the most commonly used, many other classiﬁcation systems of salt-affected soils\
    \ exist\nand are available in the literature [163]. The presence of salt in soil\
    \ water may affect plant\ngrowth either through salt-speciﬁc or osmotic effects.\
    \ The salt-speciﬁc or ion-excess effect\nof salinity occurs when excessive salt\
    \ amounts enter the crop, accumulate and damage the\ntranspiring leaves’ cells\
    \ and trigger plant growth reductions. The osmotic or water deﬁcit\neffect of\
    \ salinity occurs when salt in the soil solution decreases the plant’s water uptake\n\
    ability and leads to a decrease in the crop growth rate [164]. Salinity stress\
    \ affects all the\nmajor plant processes, such as germination, growth, water uptake\
    \ and yield [165].\nSalinity can be classiﬁed as natural or primary salinity and\
    \ second-hand salinity or\nhuman-induced salinity. Primary salinity comes from\
    \ salts accumulation over long periods\nof time via natural soil or groundwater\
    \ processes. Two natural processes contribute to\nprimary salinity. The ﬁrst is\
    \ the weathering process that breaks down rocks and releases\nvarious types of\
    \ soluble salts, including chlorides (of sodium, calcium and magnesium),\nsulfates\
    \ and carbonates. The passive results from oceanic salt that the wind carries\
    \ inland\nare deposited in the soil by rainfall. Passive salinity occurs due to\
    \ human activities, leading\nto the modiﬁcation of the soil’s hydrologic balance\
    \ [165].\n8.3. Policy\nThe increase in salts concentration in the California Central\
    \ Valley due to many factors,\nincluding intensive irrigation, has led to crises\
    \ and political decisions toward remediation.\nHigh concentrations of selenium\
    \ were found in ﬁsh in Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge,\nand vast numbers of\
    \ deformed and dead waterfowl were discovered at the refuge [166].\nIn 2006, the\
    \ Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board’s Salt and Boron Total\n\
    Maximum Daily Load for the San Joaquin River was approved, and a salinity control\
    \ plan\nentitled ‘Actions to Address the Salinity and Boron Total Maximum Daily\
    \ Load Issues\nfor the Lower San Joaquin River’ was adopted in response to the\
    \ Salinity and Boron\nTotal Maximum Daily Loads [156]. Solutions for addressing\
    \ salinity in the Central Valley\nwater require considering innovative salt management\
    \ strategies for both the short term\nand the long term to reach salt balance\
    \ and restoration of the impacted areas. In 2015,\nthe State Water Resources Control\
    \ Board adopted Resolution No. 2015–0010 to approve\nBasin Plan amendments and\
    \ to include the Salinity Variance Program, which applies to\nsurface water under\
    \ the Clean Water Act (CWA). The Salinity Variance Program follows\nwater quality\
    \ standards that include the following constituents: electrical conductivity,\n\
    total dissolved solids, chloride, sulfate and sodium [155]. Recognizing the challenges\
    \ of\nmanaging salinity in surface and ground waters, the Salt and Nitrate Management\
    \ Plan\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n20 of 31\n(SNMP) was implemented as part of the\
    \ Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long-Term\nSustainability (CV-SALTS).\n\
    The long-term salinity management strategies recommended by the SNMP are divided\n\
    into three different phases, as described below.\n(i)\nPhase I focuses on developing\
    \ a prioritization and optimization study for salinity\nmanagement by using an\
    \ interim salinity approach.\n(ii)\nPhase II is related to environmental permits,\
    \ obtaining funding, engineering\nand design.\n(iii)\nPhase III consists of the\
    \ implementation of physical projects to manage salt in the\nlong term.\nThe interim\
    \ salinity permitting approach is recommended by the SNMP to be set\nin place\
    \ for 15 years. The interim salinity approach requires dischargers to participate\n\
    in the prioritization and optimization study. However, the dischargers opting\
    \ out of\nparticipating in the prioritization and optimization study would not\
    \ be eligible for obtaining\na variance under the Salinity Variance Program (https://www.cvsalinity.org\
    \ (accessed on\n29 August 2021)).\n8.4. Decision Support for Irrigation and Salinity\n\
    Although there are not currently any California IDSS that also factor salinity\
    \ manage-\nment, there are several decision tools available to manage salinity\
    \ in California. One of\nthe water quality regulation tools used throughout the\
    \ U.S. is the EPA-supported Total\nMaximum Daily Load (TMDL). The TMDL is a controlling\
    \ tool for allocating responsibility\nfor contamination in impaired waterbodies\
    \ by assessing the assimilative capacity of the\nwaterbody for the contaminant,\
    \ determining the mass loading from non-point and point\nsources, which contribute\
    \ to the pollution, and developing downstream water quality\nstrategies reducing\
    \ the excess of the pollutants in the waterbody. The implementation of\nthe TMDL\
    \ tool in the Central Valley of California has led to the development of decision\n\
    support system tools, such as the Watershed Management Risk Management Framework\n\
    (WARMF) and the San Joaquin River Real-Time Management (SJRRTM).\nThe Watershed\
    \ Management Risk Management Framework (WARMF) model is a de-\ncision support\
    \ system designed to guide stakeholders towards a comprehensive watershed\nmanagement\
    \ plan. The tool helps speciﬁcally to facilitate TMDL implementation at the\n\
    watershed level. The embedded model uses a mass balance approach for an extensive\
    \ suite\nof potential San Joaquin River pollutants, such as total dissolved solids\
    \ (measured as EC),\nsuspended solids, phosphates and nitrates. Models are also\
    \ used to simulate agricultural\nand wetland drainage return ﬂows and estimate\
    \ the salts buildups from shallow ground-\nwater. Components such as simulation\
    \ models, graphical software and GIS software are\nincorporated into a graphical\
    \ user interface (GUI) to easily visualize the model ﬂow and\nsalinity information.\
    \ The WARMF model contains hydrologic routing that is capable of\ncalculating\
    \ ﬂow and water quality at roughly one-mile intervals [156,167].\nThe SJRRTM is\
    \ a web-based salinity DSS that combines WARMF and assimilative salt\ncapacity\
    \ forecasts information to increase stakeholder awareness of the unique opportuni-\n\
    ties and measures to improve water quality resource management in the San Joaquin\
    \ River\nBasin. The decision support system was implemented using OpenNRM, an\
    \ open-source\nsoftware that systematically allows users to perform tasks such\
    \ as creating, modifying and\nmanaging data and web content. One of the speciﬁc\
    \ features of the SJRTM web portal has\nbeen the integration of WARMF model-generated\
    \ ﬂow with real-time SJR tributary ﬂow\nand EC data with salt load assimilative\
    \ capacity predictions [156].\nIn addition to decision support systems, various\
    \ models are widely used for salinity\nmanagement studies in the Central Valley.\
    \ Models such as Westside Agricultural Drainage\nEconomics (WADE) [168] and the\
    \ Agricultural Production Salinity Irrigation Drainage\nEconomics (APSIDE) [169]\
    \ are examples of policy models used in the Central Valley. The\nAPSIDE model\
    \ has the speciﬁcity of simulating the agricultural production and projected\n\
    income in response to irrigation water quality and drainage policy constraints\
    \ [169].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n21 of 31\n9. IDSS for Irrigation System Management\n\
    Under increasing water deﬁcit or drought conditions, distribution uniformity plays\
    \ a\ncritical factor in managing the available water efﬁciently while simultaneously\
    \ improving\nand maintaining the yield and quality of specialty crops [170,171].\
    \ Distribution uniformity\ncan be deﬁned as the even distribution or spread of\
    \ applied irrigation to avoid over- or\nunder-watering at speciﬁc locations across\
    \ the ﬁeld. Non-uniform distribution can not only\nreduce the yield, but it affects\
    \ the drainage, increases soil erosion risk through runoff, in-\ncreases nitrate\
    \ leaching and reduces the available nitrate content in the soil [172,173]. Under\n\
    California’s arid conditions, a reduced use of water and energy in the agricultural\
    \ sector is\nlargely dependent on efﬁcient DU. Although it is impossible to attain\
    \ 100% distribution\nuniformity, the goal is to maximize the uniform and efﬁcient\
    \ distribution of the applied\nirrigation water.\nApplication use efﬁciency is\
    \ the ratio of the amount of water lost through evapotran-\nspiration to the amount\
    \ of water applied for crop production [174]. The joint initiative of\nthe California\
    \ Department of Food and Agriculture and Department of Water Resources\nhas a\
    \ goal of decreasing 1200–1220 ML of agricultural water use per year through on-farm\n\
    efﬁciency improvements. The majority of California’s crops are now cultivated\
    \ using micro-\nirrigation systems, such as sprinkler, drip and subsurface drip\
    \ irrigation. The distribution\nuniformity for drip and subsurface drip irrigation\
    \ systems is determined by taking the\nratio of average ﬂow of the lowest quarter\
    \ of emitters to all emitters sampled [130,175].\nDecision support tools offer\
    \ the potential for site-speciﬁc irrigation management,\nwhich optimizes distribution\
    \ uniformity by delineating the ﬁelds into management\nzones [176,177]. The UCANR’s\
    \ Bilingual Emission Uniformity Calculator uses a bilin-\ngual (English and Spanish)\
    \ interface with an Excel spreadsheet model to help growers\ncalculate distribution\
    \ uniformity based on emitter discharge measurements [178]. Using\nwireless sensor\
    \ networks (soil and crop canopy-based), irrigation automation and telemet-\n\
    ric control through mobile or cloud-based applications allows the growers to efﬁciently\n\
    increase the distribution uniformity based on real-time data. Growers can use\
    \ automation\nequipment to avoid over- or under-watering with remote access [179,180].\
    \ In California,\nmany nut growers in the state are using an alternative method\
    \ of determining transpira-\ntion uniformity rather than using distribution uniformity\
    \ [181]. Transpiration uniformity\ndescribes the uniform loss of water from the\
    \ ﬁeld, in contrast to DU, which deﬁnes the\nspread across the ﬁeld. Because transpiration\
    \ is an indicator of plant metabolism, it can\nalso be affected by nutrients,\
    \ pests or soil heterogeneity, which would not be related to the\nuniformity of\
    \ an application. Remote-sensing IDSS are useful in evaluating the distribution\n\
    uniformity based on thermal and NDVI maps generated using multispectral imagery.\
    \ In\nCalifornia, Ceres Imaging is widely used by orchard and vegetable growers\
    \ to identify the\nwater stress due to uneven distribution uniformity based on\
    \ colorized NDVI and thermal\nmaps, as shown in Figure 3. The identiﬁcation of\

    \ IDSS Evaluation and Ongoing Work in California\nIn this rapidly growing ﬁeld\
    \ of products and services, detailed information on the\nutility, user friendliness,\
    \ reliability, accuracy and precision of IDSS is of primary importance\nto the\
    \ end user. The purpose of the Hub project is to evaluate the irrigation decision\

    \ innovation, validation and adoption are cyclical, iterative processes engaged\n\
    in by the agricultural technology industry, applied or Cooperative Extension researchers\n\
    and growers (Figure 4). In the cyclical process of innovation–validation–adoption,\
    \ it is\nhelpful to form a project advisory group to achieve a more practical,\
    \ secure and cohesive\napproach [179]. This user feedback is pivotal for implementing\
    \ and improving new IDSS\ntechnologies [184]. The primary focus of the advisory\
    \ group members is to assist in shaping\nthe process of research that can simplify\
    \ the later steps for adoption [185,186].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n23 of 31\n\

    Ideally, IDSS should be assessed for data accuracy, linearity, precision, response\
    \ time\nand reliability [187,188]. This can be carried out using research-grade\
    \ equipment with eddy\ncovariance and neutron probe measurements of key water\
    \ budget components, as well\nas estimates of leaf area index, to better understand\
    \ and predict the Kc values. Different\ncomplexity may be required for different\
    \ end users (i.e., farm manager versus irrigators).\nThe system’s user friendliness\
    \ can be assessed by user interview or survey that generally\nfocuses on: (a)\
    \ graphic interface features, (b) graphic interface ease of use, (c) ﬁeld placement\n\
    decision support, (d) comprehensiveness, (e) update frequency, (f) reliability,\

    \ systems (IDSS) may greatly beneﬁt the >400 crops grown\nthroughout the State\
    \ of California to support diverse challenges, including drought, en-\nergy, nitrogen\
    \ and salinity management. Here, we conducted a comprehensive review of\nexisting\
    \ IDSS available to California growers, their underlying science, incentive policies\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n24 of 31\nand anticipated outcomes. Effective energy,\
    \ water, nitrogen and salinity management in\nCalifornia under regulatory policies,\
    \ such as the Sustainable Groundwater Management\nAct, require the integration\
    \ of different strategies to improve precision irrigation schedul-\ning, uniform\
    \ water and nutrient application, and the soil–plant–water monitoring. In\naddition\
    \ to water management, these policies also aim to manage groundwater and require\n\
    the record keeping of water use, nitrogen (N) leaching, salinity management and\
    \ energy\nconsumption. Most of the irrigation decision support tools used in California\
    \ are based on\nfewer components of the water budget, and none of the available\
    \ IDSS provide estimation\nof all parameters together. For example, soil-based\
    \ IDSS consider soil water potential or\nvolumetric water content, while crop\
    \ canopy IDSS are based on crop evapotranspiration.\nThese IDSS can potentially\
    \ be used in combination to obtain the overall inﬂow and outﬂow\nof water to and\
    \ from the soil–plant–atmospheric continuum of the crops. However, het-\nerogeneity\
    \ in agronomic and ﬁeld soils can lead to poor management practices at certain\n\
    locations in agricultural ﬁelds. Remote sensing IDSS are useful in determining\
    \ the spatial\nscale information based on spectral data, but the interpretation\
    \ of multispectral/thermal\nimagery is complicated and difﬁcult for growers to\
    \ base decisions for water, nutrient and\nsalinity hotspots. In a nutshell, there\
    \ has been an identiﬁable need for the co-management\nof irrigation decision support,\
    \ nitrogen and salinity management and energy efﬁciency.\nThe integration of IDSS\
    \ for nexus beneﬁts is a cyclical process of innovation by service\nproviders/researchers,\
    \ validation by extension research professionals and adoption by\ngrowers. Therefore,\
    \ for a widescale adoption of these tools, the synergetic evaluation of\npoint-based\
    \ and spatial IDSS needs to be studied and validated on different scales (farm\n\
    to county). Not only is the information presentation and availability important;\
    \ the inte-\ngration within the farm management hierarchy is equally signiﬁcant.\
    \ The recommended\ninformation on water, nitrogen, salts and energy management\
    \ must be clearly and simply\ntransmitted to and from farm managers to individual\
    \ irrigators.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.J., R.S. and M.A.N.;\

    \ most obstacle faced by irrigation water requirements, likewise, lim-\nited available\
    \ meteorological data to calculate reference evapotranspiration. Consequently,\
    \ \nthe focal aims of the investigation are to assess the potential of machine\
    \ learning mod-\nels in forecasting irrigation water requirements (IWR) of snap\
    \ beans by evolving multi-\nscenarios of inputs parameters to figure out the impact\
    \ of meteorological, crop, and soil \nparameters on IWR. Six models were applied,\
    \ support vector regressor (SVR), random for-\nest (RF), deep neural networks\
    \ (DNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-\nterm memory (LSTM),\
    \ and Hybrid CNN-LSTM. Ten variables including maximum and \nminimum temperature,\
    \ Relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, root depth, basal crop \ncoefficient,\
    \ soil evaporation, a fraction of surface wetted and, exposed and soil wetted\
    \ frac-\ntion were used as the input data for models with their combination, 8\
    \ input scenarios were \ndesigned. Overall models, the best scenario was scenario\
    \ 4 (relative humidity, wind speed, \nbasal crop coefficient, soil evaporation),\
    \ however, the best scenario for DNN and RF model \nwas scenario 7 (root depth,\
    \ basal crop coefficient, soil evaporation, fraction of surface wet-\nted, exposed\
    \ and soil wetted fraction). While the weakest one was the group of climatic \n\
    factors in scenario 6 (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ \nwind speed, and precipitation). Among the models, the hybrid LTSM & CNN was\
    \ the \nmost accurate and the SVR model had the lowest estimation accuracy. The\
    \ outcomes of \nthis research work could set up a modeling strategy that would\
    \ set in motion the improve-\nment of efforts to identify the shortages in IWR\
    \ forecasting, which sequentially may sup-\nport alleviation strategies such as\
    \ policies for sustainable water use and water resources \nmanagement. The current\
    \ approach was promising and has research value for other similar \nregions.\n\

    \ changes in the twenty-first century and the negative impacts that \nfollow on\
    \ the available water resources have become one of the most important issues that\
    \ \ncast their shadows on the focus of contemporary environmental events and issues\
    \ (Smith \net al. 2012; UNEP 1999). The irrigated agriculture sector represents\
    \ the largest consumer \nof water in Egypt, representing 85% of the total water\
    \ share available to Egypt, which rep-\nresents 55.5 billion cubic meters. In\
    \ addition, the biggest problem is that most of the irri-\ngated lands apply surface\
    \ irrigation systems where the efficiency of application and dis-\ntribution of\
    \ water do not exceed 50%, which represents the biggest challenge that must be\
    \ \nfaced to reduce water losses (Monem 2021). Irrigated agriculture covers about\
    \ 25% of the \ncultivated area in the world, yet it contributes 50% of the global\
    \ food basket. Despite the \nincrease in production with irrigated agriculture,\
    \ it consumes 67% of the water in agricul-\ntural production and 87% of the water\
    \ is consumed in the irrigation sector (Smith et al. \n2012; Shiklomanov 1997).\
    \ The availability of food is the main element for the survival of \nthe human\
    \ race, although it faces many challenges, the main cause of which is humans,\
    \ \nperhaps the most prominent of which are the rapid population growth and climatic\
    \ changes \nresulting from global warming that affect the hydrological cycle (Bellido-Jiménez\
    \ et al. \n2021). Therefore, irrigation scheduling, which is determining the amount\
    \ of irrigation \nwater added and the time of its addition during the growing\
    \ season of the crop, is one of \nthe things that must be taken into account under\
    \ conditions of water scarcity (Kalboussi \net al. 2019).\nThere are many methods\
    \ used for irrigation scheduling, including visual and thermal \nmonitoring, soil\
    \ moisture content measuring devices, rainfall estimation devices, and refer-\n\
    ence evapotranspiration estimation, from which it is possible to estimate the\
    \ crop evapo-\ntranspiration by knowing the crop coefficient, through available\
    \ climatic data on local basis \nor through commercial scheduling programs available\
    \ through the international informa-\ntion network (Zhang et al. 2013). The actual\
    \ crop evapotranspiration (ETa) is considered \none of the main criteria for estimating\
    \ the amount of water consumed by the crop, and \nthus greatly affects the hydrological,\
    \ environmental and agricultural management, and then \nthe ETa is one of the\
    \ basic elements when designing and managing irrigation networks in \nthe agricultural\
    \ project. ETa is estimated through field measurements using lysimeters or \n\
    through empirical equations by estimating the reference evapotranspiration (ETo)\
    \ and the \ncrop coefficient (Djaman et al. 2018). The water balance method for\
    \ irrigation schedul-\ning includes estimating of the crop water consumption during\
    \ the growing season, which \nincludes the amount of water added, whether through\
    \ irrigation, precipitation and capil-\nlary rise, which subtracts the amount\
    \ of water losses, whether by evaporation from the soil \nsurface, deep percolation\
    \ the rootzone area, and runoff (Andales et al. 2014; Karam et al. \n2019a, b).\n\
    The estimation of ETo is one of the most important indicators used in irrigation\
    \ water \nmanagement and hydrological studies, and despite the difficult requirements\
    \ of the empiri-\ncal equations of ETo, it gives accurate values in addition to\
    \ its validity on various climatic \nconditions, which are the main indicators\
    \ in the empirical equations (Ferreira and da Cunha \n2020a, b; Pereira et al.\
    \ 2015a, b). In light of the limited climatic parameters available for \nestimating\
    \ ETo, fast and accurate methods that require least number of meteorological indi-\n\
    cators are considered among the most important requirements for irrigation water\
    \ schedul-\ning (Fan et al. 2021). The Penman–Monteith equation is the standard\
    \ equation for calculat-\ning ETo and is recommended by the United Nations Agriculture\
    \ and Food Organization. \n1558\nA. Mokhtar et al.\n1 3\nThe Penman Monteith equation\
    \ requires many daily meteorological parameters to calculate \nsuch as maximum\
    \ and minimum temperature, wind speed, net solar radiation, and rela-\ntive humidity.\
    \ However, under the conditions of limited climatic parameters available in \n\
    the study area, which requires the availability of methods that require less climatic\
    \ data, \nwhile maintaining the accuracy of the calculated values of ETo in the\
    \ same range to a large \nextent (Fan et al. 2019). The application of the Penman\
    \ Monteith equation faces many dif-\nficulties, especially in developing countries,\
    \ which face many challenges represented in the \nlimited monitoring stations\
    \ and their lack of regular distribution in each country, where the \nfocus is\
    \ in the areas of spread of irrigated agricultural areas in addition to the lack\
    \ of ability \nto measure all the climatic criteria required to apply the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation with \nthe required accuracy (Fan et al. 2021).\nRecently used computer\
    \ software’s models have shown high accuracy in estimating and \nforecasting ETo,\
    \ e.g. Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Fan et al. 2019). In recent years, \nthe\
    \ use of machine learning programs for ETo estimation has spread with making rela-\n\
    tionships between the inputs and outputs used in ETo estimation, which are mainly\
    \ mete-\norological data, which gives higher accuracy and power to apply machine\
    \ learning pro-\ngrams in ETo modeling (Ferreira and Cunha 2020a, b; Kumar et al.\
    \ 2011). The use of both \nRandom Forest (RF) and Generalized Regression Neural\
    \ Network (GRNN) to predict ETo \nproved highly accurate under local conditions\
    \ and across-stations applications, but RF was \nbetter than GRNN (Feng et al.\
    \ 2017). The common method of predicting ETo values using \nmachine learning models\
    \ is based on the use of former ETo values as input data (Ashrafza-\ndeh et al.\
    \ 2020; Landeras et al. 2009; Trajkovic et al. 2003). In addition, the use of\
    \ former \ndaily meteorological data used to estimate ETo through the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation in \naddition to the lagged ETo values greatly enhances the performance\
    \ of machine learning \nmodels and the accuracy of the forecasting ETo.\nIn addition\
    \ to what machine learning programs provide an estimate of ETo values for \nthe\
    \ previous and current agricultural seasons, it gives the possibility to predict\
    \ the ETo \nvalues for the upcoming seasons using the so-called deep learning\
    \ models, which are \nrestricted to knowing the expected changes in temperature\
    \ and the amount of precipitation \nrelated to global warming, from which it can\
    \ be make good planning and management of \nirrigation water for the coming years\
    \ with an attempt to correct the existing strategies to \navoid the negative effects\
    \ of global warming (Ferreira and da Cunha 2020a, b). By increas-\ning the forecast\
    \ period from 1 to 30 days, the accuracy of the resulting data decreases (Fer-\n\
    reira and da Cunha 2020a, b). Several deep learning models have been used to forecasting\
    \ \ntime series, including long short-term memory (LSTM) (Son and Kim 2020; Tian\
    \ et al. \n2018; Zhou et  al. 2019), and a one-dimensional convolutional neural\
    \ network can (1D \nCNN) (Barzegar et al. 2020). In addition to the above, Barzegar\
    \ et al. (2020) and Kim \net al. (2019) create hybrid software from both LSTM\
    \ and 1D CNN. Although deep learn-\ning programs have proven outstanding performance\
    \ in many fields, their use in the field of \nclimatic and hydrological studies\
    \ is still limited.\nTherefore, this paper aims to participate in saving water\
    \ tasks by forecasting irriga-\ntion water requirement (IWR) for green bean by\
    \ an on-field scale experiment, where there \nwasn’t common literature about modeling\
    \ of irrigation water requirement forecasting in \nversus of ETo estimation studies.\
    \ Moreover, the irrigation water requirements forecasting \ncould make irrigation\
    \ scheduling improved, and so give better solutions for decision mak-\ners. This\
    \ research is based on determining the most important criteria required to forecast\
    \ \nIWR of green bean to achieve the best irrigation scheduling in light of the\
    \ challenges of \nclimatic changes and water scarcity using six models (SVR, RF,\
    \ DNN, CNN, LSTM and \nCNN-LSTM) to forecast IWR. To the best of authors’ knowledge,\
    \ the applied approaches \n1559\nPrediction of Irrigation Water Requirements for\

    \ in literature dealing with the importance of IWR prediction, the main \nobjectives\
    \ of this study are to 1) evaluate the potential of machine and deep learning\

    \ inputs variables \n(combinations) to study the impact of meteorological, crop\
    \ and soil parameters on IWR \nand, 3) figure out the best scenario with best\
    \ model performance in IWR prediction.\n2  Materials and Methods\nThe workflow\
    \ of this study is showing in Fig. 1. The first phase of the workflow involves\
    \ \nthe climate, soil and crops data collection and the calculation of the IWR\
    \ during two sea-\nsons. Within the second phase, we applied five machine learning\
    \ models (SVR, RF, DNN, \nLSTM and CNN) and hybrid between LSTM and CNN to predict\
    \ the IWR based on 8 Sce-\nnarios (combinations of climate, soil and crop data).\n\
    2.1  Climate Conditions\nThe climatic variables (maximum air temperature, minimum\
    \ temperature of air, the aver-\nage air temperature, air relative humidity, and\
    \ the number of hours of sunshine) were daily \nrecorded during both growing seasons.\
    \ The maximum air temperature ranged during the \ngrowing season (October to December)\
    \ between 19–30 °C, while minimum air tempera-\ntures ranged from 11 to 21 °C\
    \ during growing season. The total rainfall was negligible \nFig. 1  Flowchart\

    2.2  Machine Learning Implementations\n2.2.1  Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nSVM\
    \ is a supervised learning algorithm, and it can also be used as a regression\
    \ model, \nmaintain all the main features that describe the algorithm (maximal\
    \ margin). SVR uses \na similar theory as SVM for classification method, with\
    \ a few slightly changes. The main \naim is minimizing error, individualizing\
    \ the hyperplane that increases the tolerance limit, \ntaking in consideration\
    \ that the part of error is tolerated. The approximated function in the \nalgorithm\
    \ of SVM is cleared as follows:\nwhere φ (x) is feature space of higher-dimensional\
    \ converted from the input vector x, ω is \nthe weights vector and b are a threshold,\
    \ which were estimated by minimizing the follow-\ning regularized risk function:\n\
    where C is the penalty parameter of the error,  di is the desired value, n is\
    \ observations \nnumber, and C 1\nn\nn∑\ni=1\nL(di, yi) is the empirical error,\
    \ in which the function  Lε is determined \nas:\nwhere 0.5 Ѡ2 is the so-called\
    \ regularization term and ɛ is the tube size. The approximated \nfunction in Eq. (1)\
    \ is finally expressed in an explicit form by introducing Lagrange multi-\npliers\
    \ and exploiting the optimality constraints as:\n(1)\nf(휒) = 휔휑(휒) + b\n(2)\n\

    \ Forest (RF)\nThe RF model was developed by Breiman (2001) and used Breiman’s\
    \ “bagging” idea to \nensemble a collection of decision trees with controlled\
    \ variance. The RF model is com-\nmonly used for regression and predicting problems.\

    \ model has become a fundamental but recently still powerful \ndeep learning model\
    \ (Achieng 2019; Montes-Atenas et al. 2016). The DNN is an artifi-\ncial neural\
    \ network (Springmann et al. 2018) with multiple layers between the inputs, hid-\n\
    den layers and output layers to learn more complex nonlinear relationships between\
    \ inputs \nand output. The rectified linear unit (ReLu) was applied as activation\
    \ function which is \ncommonly employed (Ghimire et al. 2019; Achieng 2019).\n\
    The loss function in the DNN model is expressed as:\nwhere n is the number of\
    \ observation data, and T\n′ is the estimated value by the DNN \nmodel, which\
    \ can be defined below for a three-hidden-layer DNN model with the ReLu \nactivation\
    \ function:\nwhere ω1, ω2, ω3 and ω4 are the weights in the network,  b1,  b2,\
    \  b3 and  b4 are the bias \nterms.\n2.2.4  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n\
    CNN consists of a sequence of convolutional layers, the output of which is connected\
    \ only \nto local regions in the input. This is achieved by sliding a filter,\
    \ or weight matrix, over \nthe input and at each point computing the dot product\
    \ between the two (i.e., a convolu-\ntion between the input and filter). This\
    \ structure allows the model to learn filters that are \nable to recognize specific\
    \ patterns in the input data. Recent advances in CNNs for time \nseries forecasting\
    \ include (Mittelman 2015). Zuo et al. (2019) stated that the architecture \n\
    of a typical CNN consists of a convolutional layer pooling layer, and fully connected\
    \ layer. \nFinally, these abstract features are merged through the fully connected\
    \ layer, and an activa-\ntion function is used to solve the classification or\
    \ regression problem (Fig. 2).\n(4)\nf(x, 훼i, 훼∗\ni ) =\nn\n∑\ni=1\n(훼i − 훼∗\n\

    LSTM network contains different memory blocks which are linked through layers.\
    \ Each \nlayer includes a set of frequently connected memory pixels and three\
    \ multiplicative units, \nnamely the input, forget and output gates. LSTM has\
    \ the ability to automatically store and \nremove temporal state information.\n\
    2.2.6  Hybrid LSTM and CNN\nLSTM and CNN were trained with the same input, and\
    \ they were hybrid to forecast results, \nthe proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM model uses\
    \ CNN layers for feature extraction from the input \ndata with LSTM layers for\
    \ sequence learning. The CNN and the LSTM are the most com-\nmonly used deep learning\
    \ models. Our main aim in designing the hybrid model of CNN and \nLSTM layers\
    \ is to exploit their characteristics for developing an efficient model for forecasting.\

    \ for training and the remaining \n25% data for testing.\nThe mean absolute error\
    \ (MAE), the root mean square error (RMSE), and mean bias \nerror (Springmann\

    \ into training and testing phases, then \nentered the models. The models were\
    \ implemented, and their estimations were evaluated \nby the criteria MBE, RMSE\
    \ and NSE (Table 3).\nThere are noticeable differences between the models, but\
    \ also some similarities in rela-\ntion to individual scenarios. The performance\
    \ of the models is more favorable when the \nRMSE and MBE are closer to zero,\
    \ and NSE are closer to 1. In all models, the NSE values \nare higher than 0.75,\
    \ which shows that the models are well performed in IWR estimation. \nThe best\
    \ estimation of the models are mostly presented by the S4 scenario and after that\
    \ S7. \nThe weakest accuracy was obtained by SVR model with MBE = 0.007, RMSE\
    \ = 0.077 mm \nand NSE = 0.850, under the S4 input scenario. The most accurate\
    \ estimation was \nresulted by DNN model under S7 scenario, with MBE = -0.001,\
    \ RMSE = 0.055 mm and \nNSE = 0.824. In order to examine the correlation between\
    \ the actual and predicted IWR \nvalues, scatter plots were developed (Fig. 3).\n\
    The analysis showed that in the S1 scenario, the highest correlation was obtained\
    \ for \nthe LSTM and CNN models  (R2 = 0.9421,  R2 = 0.9119, respectively, the\
    \ lowest for SVR. \nS1 scenario takes into account air temperature (Tmax and Tmin)\

    \ scenario S2, where in addition to S1, \nrelative humidity (RH), the strongest\
    \ correlation between real and predicted IWR was also \nshown for the LSTM model\
    \  (R2 = 0.83225), and the weakest for SVR  (R2 = 0.6369). In the \nS3 scenario\
    \ (4 parameters: temperature, wind speed and Kcb), the best correlation between\
    \ \nactual and predicted IWR values  was determined for the LSTM & CNN hybrid\
    \ model \n (R2 = 0.7618). This is a relatively low correlation, which indicates\

    \ is classified when 0.00 ≤ RSR ≤ 0.50, while unsatisfac-\ntory when RSR > 0.70.\
    \ The analyzes show that the lowest RSR values  (≤ 0.50), covering \nvery good\
    \ ranges of classification, were achieved by all models for the S4 scenario (Input:\
    \ \nRH, WS, Kcb, Ke in Table 2), and then by four models: LTSM, CNN, DNN and RF\
    \ for the \nS1 scenario (Fig. 4).\nThe LTSM, LTSM & CNN and DNN models additionally\
    \ achieved high perfor-\nmance in the S7 scenario, and the CNN and DNN models\
    \ also in the S2 scenario. \nThe SVR model was the only one that achieved very\
    \ good quality in only one S4 \nscenario. The SVR model was the only one that\
    \ achieved very good quality in only \none S4 scenario. In most models, the lowest\
    \ RSR was achieved in those scenarios \nwhere the lowest values  also reached\
    \ the RMSE criterion (Table 3), which proves that \nthe scenarios seem to be the\
    \ most optimal for IWR prediction. Unsatisfactory results \nwere achieved in those\
    \ scenarios where the RSR criterion > 0.70. The most common \nscenarios are: S3\
    \ (Input: Tmax, Tmin, WS, Kcb), S5 (Input: RH, WS) and S6 (Input: \nTmax, Tmin,\
    \ RH, WS, P), thus mostly scenarios that include climatic parameters as \ninput\
    \ to the model (Fig. 4). In the next stage (Fig. 5), radar charts were developed\
    \ to \ncompare the models in each scenario based on the SI criterion.\nThe SI\
    \ values  obtained for the models in various S1-S8 scenarios. According to \n\
    the value of the SI criteria, the performance of models can be divided into several\
    \ \nlevels. In the discussed case, the SI < 0.1 was not obtained, which would\
    \ classify the \nmodels as \"excellent\". Good (if 0.1 < SI < 0.2) and satisfactory\
    \ (if 0.2 < SI < 0.3) per-\nformance of most models was obtained for the S8 scenario,\
    \ which takes into account \nall the inputs: climate, vegetation characteristics\
    \ and soil data, and for the scenarios: \nS4 (takes into account 4 components\
    \ RH, WS, Kcb and Ke) and the S7 scenario \n(Root depth, Kcb, Ke, Fw and Few).\
    \ Satisfactory performance was achieved by the \nmodels in the S1 scenario, which\
    \ takes into account temperature data, Kcb and Ke, \nand in the S5 scenario, which\
    \ includes only two outputs, namely RH and WS. Poor \nperformance was achieved\
    \ by the SVR model for the S2 and S3 scenarios, and the \nRF and CNN models for\
    \ the S6 scenario, which takes into account only climatic \ndata. The models in\
    \ the S6 scenario show the least satisfactory performance (Fig. 5).\nThe LTSM\
    \ model, according to the Scatter index, achieved the best performance for S4\
    \ \nand the weakest for S6, the LTSM & CNN hybrid model for S4 and S1 / S6 respectively,\
    \ \nthe CNN model for S1 / S4 and S6 respectively, the DNN model for S4 / S7 and\
    \ S5, the \nSVR model for S4 and S3, while the RF model for the S7 and S6 scenarios.\
    \ Figure 5 shows \nthat, apart from the distinguished single cases related to\
    \ specific scenarios, the prediction \naccuracy in most of the developed models\
    \ regarding the SI value was good (0.1 < SI < 0.2) \nand satisfactory (0.2 < SI\
    \ < 0.3). Figure 6 shows the MAE values  for 6 different models for \n2 options:\
    \ under and over estimation.\nThe MAE is a measure of performance (model quality)\
    \ used to evaluate the perfor-\nmance of a model after finalization. Investigating\
    \ the models under and over estimations, \ni.e., the study of underestimating\
    \ and overestimating model estimates was carried out \nusing mean absolute error\
    \ (MAE). In the context of machine learning, absolute error refers \nto the magnitude\
    \ of the difference between the prediction of an observation and the true \nvalue\
    \ of that observation. The values  on two different data sets indicate that MAE\
    \ values  \nin under estimation in almost all models were higher than after Over\
    \ estimation, except \nfor the RF model, where higher MAE was achieved in over\
    \ estimation. The RF approach \nis another widely used decision tree method (Cavallo\
    \ et al. 2017; García Nieto et al. 2017, \n2018) which, using the classification\
    \ and regression tree procedure, combined with ran-\ndom node optimization and\
    \ packing (Breiman 2001) builds a forest of uncorrelated trees. \n1570\nA. Mokhtar\

    \ of fit (Naghibi et al. 2017). The MAE values  decrease \nsignificantly after\
    \ over estimation in the case of the following models: LTSM, LTSM & \nCNN, CNN\
    \ and SVR) (they are within 0.05). This proves that over estimation can reduce\
    \ \nthe MAE values  for most tested models. The smallest MAE differences between\

    \ while the largest in \nthe SVR model. The use of the LTSM & CNN hybrid model\
    \ reduced the MAE between \nthe two options Under and over estimation.\n4  Discussion\n\
    The assessment of the amount of irrigation for individual types of crops requires\
    \ the analy-\nsis of a large number of parameters, which are often difficult to\
    \ obtain through direct meas-\nurement and observation are often considered burdensome\
    \ and costly for farmers. Hardly \nany country has a good system for measuring\
    \ and recording the total water consumption of \ncrops, and more than 40% of crops\
    \ are grown under irrigation conditions. Hence, in order \nto assess the future\
    \ situation in terms of obtaining high yields and maintaining ration-\nalization\
    \ in water abstraction for crops, it is necessary to model irrigation water require-\n\
    ments (Pulido-Calvo and Gutierrez-Estrada 2009; Döll and Siebert 2002). Modeling\
    \ of the \nirrigation water needs as a function of the irrigated area, climatic\
    \ conditions and type of \ncrops has a broader context, providing the basis for\
    \ estimating the future impact of climate \nchange, as well as demographic, socio-economic\
    \ and technological changes.\nFig. 6  Investigating the models’ under and over\
    \ estimations\n1572\nA. Mokhtar et al.\n1 3\nIn this study, various machine learning\
    \ models (SVM, RF, DNN, CNN, LSTM and \nhybrid LSTM & CNN) are investigated to\
    \ predict the IWR indispensable for the green bean \ncrops in Egypt. Importantly,\
    \ it presents the adaptation of typical deep neural network mod-\nels, which include\
    \ the DNN model and the convolutional neural network, long short-term \nmemory\
    \ network, and finally a combination of some of their variants. An important ele-\n\
    ment in the study was the selection of the scenario and model that obtains the\
    \ best perfor-\nmance for the conditions declared in the scenario. Indication\
    \ of the best predictive model \nfor IWR, with the given input data for modeling,\
    \ is of great importance for the selected \nresearch area that experiences extreme\
    \ droughts and the related needs for intensive irriga-\ntion of crops. Mokhtar\
    \ et al. (2021a, b) emphasizes that the droughts in the research area \nin 2015–2019\
    \ covered even 80–90% of the area, and 30% in 2010–2019 were affected by \nextreme\
    \ and very extreme droughts.\nThe reason for water shortages in the root zone\
    \ is primarily water consumption by \ncrops and evapotranspiration, while rainfall\
    \ and irrigation ensure water supply (Andales \net al. 2011; 2014; Karam et al.\
    \ 2019a, b). However, it should be emphasized that the actual \nevapotranspiration\
    \ of green bean crops, one of the dominant components in the water bal-\nance,\
    \ significantly reduces the size of its harvest, which on the other hand, with\
    \ increas-\ning evaporation, will require increased irrigation of the area. Due\
    \ to the complexity of the \nevapotranspiration process, it is most often estimated\
    \ on the basis of meteorological data \n(Pereira et al. 2015a, b; Ferreira and\
    \ Cunha 2020a, b). However, in this case, monitoring of \nall parameters is often\
    \ insufficient (El Bilali and Taleb 2020).\nIn the performed IWR prediction for\
    \ green bean crops in Egypt, the accurate predic-\ntion of IWR was largely dependent\
    \ on the number of input variables and their impact on \nthe modeling results\
    \ under certain scenario variants. According to Krupakar et al. (2016), \nthe\
    \ sources of parameters influencing the irrigation process tend to differ depending\
    \ on the \narea where agriculture is grown. In addition, there are new characteristics\
    \ that we obtain \nthanks to new technologies for terrestrial and satellite measurements.\
    \ The sources that \nmake irrigation water demand prediction possible can be broadly\
    \ categorized into meteoro-\nlogical factors, crop input and agricultural parameters.\
    \ Meteorological factors are impor-\ntant in determining the irrigation water\
    \ needs of crops as rain is the main source of water in \nsome areas (e.g., India).\
    \ Wind speed also affects the amount of irrigation needed, although \nnot as much\
    \ as the temperature (O’Toole and Hatfield 1983; Schlenker and Roberts 2009; \n\
    Krupakar et al. 2016).\nIn the presented work, the climate data was adapted to\
    \ the S6 scenario (Table 2), which \ntook into account the following parameters:\
    \ maximum and minimum temperature, rela-\ntive humidity, wind speed and precipitation.\
    \ In the case of having information only from \nthe group of climatic factors\
    \ (treated as input data), taking into account the S6 scenario, \nthe best prediction\
    \ was shown by the CNN model  (R2 = 0.8275), and the weakest SVR \n (R2 = 0.3).\n\
    One of the most important criteria for determining irrigation needs is soil type,\
    \ and dif-\nferences are seen when the amount of water required for different\
    \ crops on different soil \ntypes is compared. The models take into account factors\
    \ including the type of crop itself \n(Tolk et al. 1999) or other crop area factors\
    \ that change over time and affect the water \nrequirements of plants (Allen 2000).\
    \ According to Krupakar et al. (2016) the RNN model \nis robust enough to map\
    \ the differences in observations that occur due to various factors \nsuch as\
    \ global warming, faulty hardware, etc. In the presented study, if only data on\
    \ crops \nand soils were considered as predictors: root depth, basal crop coefficient,\
    \ soil evaporation, \nfraction of surface wetted and exposed and soil wetted fraction,\
    \ in the absence of climate \n1573\nPrediction of Irrigation Water Requirements\
    \ for Green…\n1 3\ndata, as presented in the S7 scenario, the best results were\
    \ obtained for a hybrid model \n(LSTM & CNN) and separately for LSTM and CNN.\n\
    The box plot was developed to show the error distribution in the test section\
    \ (Fig. 7). \nFor IWR prediction, the best models turned out to be LSTM, CNN,\
    \ LSTM & CNN and \nSVR for the S4, which takes into account the RH, WS, Kcb and\
    \ Ke parameters, and the \nDNN and RF models for the S7 scenario, which includes\
    \ root depth, Kcb, Ke, Fw and Few. \nIn the group with the S4, the LSTM and LSTM\
    \ & CNN models performed best because \nthey have the lowest values  of Q1, Q3\
    \ and IQR (Fig. 7), and the SVR model the worst. \nHowever, for the S7 scenario,\
    \ the DNN model turned out to be the best for IWR predic-\ntion. In the RF 7 model,\
    \ the lowest Q3 was obtained among the others, but the IQR was not \namong the\
    \ lowest and amounted to 0.09. The LSTM 4 and LSTM & CNN 4 have the same \nIQR\
    \ as the DNN 7 model and slightly lower compared to the RF 7 model (Fig. 7).\n\
    In all the models used, the error distribution is around zero, while the median\
    \ line shows \nthe normality of the error distribution, primarily for the LSTM\
    \ & CNN hybrid model S4. \nAdditionally, it should be noted that the models developed\
    \ for the S4 and S7 scenarios \nobtained the best results in the assessment at\
    \ the previous stage (Table 2). These scenarios \nare intermediate between the\
    \ use of all input variables (S8) and the smallest number of \ninput data represented\
    \ by the S5 scenario (RH and WS data).\nHowever, none of the models in the S6\
    \ scenario, which takes into account only climatic \ndata, was included in the\
    \ group of the best models distinguished on the basis of distribution \nof the\
    \ estimation errors of the IWR in the test section for the best model-scenarios\
    \ (Fig. 7). \nIn turn, research by Krupakar et al (2016) showed that ANNs models\
    \ perform well in predic-\ntion based on training but have a lower ability to\
    \ infer semantic meaning from the sequential \nflow. SVMs models are designed\
    \ to be tested on normal data, hence they cannot capture the \nessential sequential\
    \ information. According to Xie and Tang (2010), the factors influencing \nFig.\
    \ 7  Boxplots showing the distribution of the estimation errors of the IWR in\
    \ the test section for the best \nmodel-scenarios. Q1 and Q3 are lower and upper\
    \ quartile of errors, and IQR is interquartile range for each \nmodel\n1574\n\
    A. Mokhtar et al.\n1 3\nthe amount of irrigation are complex and non-linear, and\
    \ the support vector machine (SVM) \nhas many advantages for non-linear small\
    \ samples. A forecasting model of irrigation water \nrequirement based on least\
    \ squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) was used in Tarim \nRiver Basin. These\
    \ authors demonstrated in their research that the prediction model based on \n\
    the LS-SVM has excellent generalizability and low error, which provides an efficient\
    \ method \nof forecasting irrigation water requirements (Xie and Tang 2010).\n\
    In turn, El Bilali and Taleb (2020), using correlation coefficients, showed the\
    \ inaccuracy \nof the SVR model in predicting the quality of irrigation water\
    \ for training and validation \nprocesses sequentially. Artificial neural network\
    \ (Springmann et  al. 2018), multiple linear \nregression (MLR), decision tree,\
    \ random forest (RF), stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and \nadaptive boosting\
    \ (AdaBoost) demonstrated good prediction accuracy. Krupakar et al. (2016) \n\
    emphasize that the models described for an irrigation prediction system are generally\
    \ devel-\noped and trained using a large amount of historical data (training data)\
    \ on objects or character-\nistics that influence the amount of water required\
    \ for irrigation. The new RNN LSTM model \nproposed by them can be used to obtain\
    \ better results, richer in semantic correlations found \nin the parameters used\
    \ in real-time data. When testing machine learning models in predicting \nirrigation\
    \ water, it is emphasized that they are efficient tools for accurately predicting\
    \ irriga-\ntion only using parameters that can be directly measured in a short\
    \ time. There have been \na lot of hybrid models that have been used for time\
    \ series prediction (Ruan 1997; Kavousi-\nFard 2013). Pulido-Calvo et al. (2003)\
    \ developed a hybrid model of combining CNNs with \nfuzzy membership function,\
    \ optimized by a genetic optimization algorithm to test the effi-\ncacy of irrigation\
    \ demand prediction, a Pulido-Calvo and Gutierrez-Estrada (2009) presented \n\
    improved irrigation water demand forecasting using a soft computing hybrid model.\n\
    For the prediction of irrigation for green bean crops in Egypt, the LSTM & CNN\
    \ hybrid \nmodel was proposed, which enhances the information potential for IWR\
    \ prediction. Deep \nlearning concerns multilayer neural networks, which simultaneously\
    \ act as a generator of \ndiagnostic features for the analyzed process and the\
    \ final function of a classifier or regres-\nsion system. It also makes it possible\
    \ to improve the accuracy of the system operation. The \nrecurrent network called\
    \ LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a recursive network character-\nized by a long\
    \ memory of short patterns (Schmidhuber 2015; Greff et al. 2017). The levels of\
    \ \nthe LSTM and CNN models are often combined when forecasting time series. This\
    \ allows \nthe LSTM layer to account for sequential dependencies across time series,\
    \ while the CNN \nlayer additionally informs about this process through the use\
    \ of extended convolutions. Unlike \nLSTM, the CNN model does not keep memory\
    \ of previous time series patterns, and instead \ncan only train have based on\
    \ data entered over a specific period of time. Krupakar et al. (2016) \npropose\
    \ a novel methodology of using a sequence learning based recurrent neural network\
    \ \n(RNN) model that uses the LSTM activation function to model for irrigation\
    \ requirement so \nthat it doesn’t have memory problems on long input streams.\n\
    The IWR prediction results for Egyptian green bean crops, performed for different\
    \ scenario \nvariants, show the models’ ability to predict irrigation potential.\
    \ The proposed predictive irri-\ngation planning approach, compared to field studies,\
    \ makes it possible to reduce or prevent \nwater stress in crops. Predicting future\
    \ IWR values   from the results of predictive models can \nimprove the real-time\
    \ irrigation planning system depending on the meteorological situation \nand terrain\
    \ factors (plants, soil). Sustainable irrigation aims to adjust water availability\
    \ and \ndemand in terms of quantity and quality, space and time, at reasonable\
    \ cost and with accept-\nable environmental impacts, whereby forecasting water\
    \ demand is proving to be a valuable \nmanagement tool.\n1575\nPrediction of Irrigation\
    \ Water Requirements for Green…\n1 3\n5  Conclusions\nWater and food need crisis\
    \ is facing all over world, furthermore agriculture consume the larg-\nest amount\
    \ of water to cover plant requirement of water. Therefore, the current research\
    \ applies \nmachine models in order to predict the irrigation water requirement\
    \ for one of the most important \ncrops in Egypt (green bean) by actual field\
    \ experiment, which there weren’t common literature \nabout modeling of irrigation\
    \ requirement forecasting in versus ETo evaluation studies.\nThe main conclusions\
    \ were reported as follow; the scenario S4 (relative humidity, wind speed, \n\
    basal crop coefficient, the soil evaporation), is the best scenario for SVR, LSTM,\
    \ CNN and LSTM \n& CNN models, while the best scenario in DNN and RF model was\
    \ in scenario (S7) (root depth, \nbasal crop coefficient, the soil evaporation,\
    \ fraction of surface wetted, exposed and soil wetted \nfraction). The climatic\
    \ factors in scenario (S6) presented the highest  R2 for the CNN model and \n\
    the weakest result in the SVR model. Further, by taking into account only the\
    \ two predictors rela-\ntive humidity and wind speed, the performance of all models\
    \ ranged from very good to satisfac-\ntory fit for all models, while it was an\
    \ unsatisfactory fit for SVR.\nOn contrast, the hybrid LTSM & CNN model was the\
    \ best model for the IWR prediction. \nFinally, the models applied can improve\
    \ the irrigation planning with few available data. The cur-\nrent approach was\
    \ promising and has research value for other similar regions. Therefore, the future\
    \ \nwork will focus much more in predicting the irrigation water requirements\
    \ in other crops in other \nregions to draw a general picture of the predicting\
    \ of the irrigation water requirements in order to \nensure the water resources\
    \ management under the impact of the climate changes.\nAcknowledgements The authors\

    \ have a positive inﬂuence on adoption. The ﬁndings\nhighlight the importance\
    \ of increasing farmers’ awareness and providing access to information\nand training\
    \ on IoT technologies. The study emphasizes the need for government support in\n\
    facilitating adoption. Recommendations include exploring additional factors, conducting\
    \ longitudinal\nstudies, and developing tailored training programs. Collaboration\
    \ among stakeholders and ﬁnancial\nsupport mechanisms is also crucial. This study\
    \ contributes to the understanding of IoT technology\nadoption in agriculture,\
    \ providing insights for policymakers, agricultural extension agencies, and\n\
    technology providers. By embracing IoT technologies and implementing the recommended\
    \ actions,\nfarmers in Jizan can enhance their crop monitoring practices, improve\
    \ productivity, and promote\nsustainable farming.\nKeywords: IoT technologies;\

    \ has witnessed signiﬁcant advancements in\ntechnology, paving the way for improved\
    \ monitoring and management practices. One\nsuch technological innovation that\
    \ holds great promise is the use of Internet of Things (IoT)\ntechnologies for\
    \ monitoring crop health, growth, and yield prediction. The integration\nof IoT\
    \ devices, sensors, and data analytics offers new possibilities for farmers to\
    \ gain\nreal-time insights into their crops and make informed decisions for optimizing\
    \ agricultural\nproductivity [1,2].\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541. https://doi.org/10.3390/su151914541\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n\
    2 of 19\nAgricultural productivity cannot be overstated when it comes to the importance\
    \ of\ncrop monitoring. In order for farmers to make informed decisions concerning\
    \ irrigation,\nfertilization, pest control, and other agronomic practices, accurate\
    \ and timely information\nabout crop health, growth, and yield potential is necessary\
    \ [3]. There has been a long\nhistory of crop monitoring that relies on manual\
    \ observation and a limited range of sam-\npling methods, which often results\
    \ in inadequate resource allocation and a reduction in\nproductivity. This is\
    \ in spite of the fact that farmers have been able to access continuous\nand detailed\
    \ information about their crops as a result of IoT technologies, enabling them\
    \ to\npractice precision agriculture [4].\nIn agriculture, IoT technologies have\
    \ the potential to offer a number of beneﬁts. As a\nﬁrst step, IoT enables farmers\
    \ to collect real-time data on the health and growth of their\ncrops, allowing\
    \ them to gain valuable insights about them. This allows for proactive inter-\n\
    vention and timely adjustments in irrigation, nutrient application, and pest management\n\
    strategies. Secondly, IoT technologies enhance the accuracy of yield prediction\
    \ models\nby capturing detailed data on environmental conditions, crop physiology,\
    \ and growth\npatterns [5]. Accurate yield prediction enables better planning\
    \ and resource allocation,\noptimizing overall agricultural productivity.\nMoreover,\
    \ IoT technologies facilitate resource management in agriculture by optimiz-\n\
    ing the use of water, energy, and fertilizers. By monitoring soil moisture, temperature,\n\
    and nutrient levels, IoT systems can provide precise recommendations for irrigation\
    \ and\nfertilization, reducing waste and the environmental impact [6]. Additionally,\
    \ IoT-based\nmonitoring can help to identify pest infestations and diseases at\
    \ early stages, enabling\ntargeted interventions and minimizing crop losses [4].\n\
    The Vision 2030 of Saudi Arabia aims to diversify the country’s economy and reduce\n\
    its oil dependence. Agri-food sustainability is the focus of the plan. The achievement\
    \ of\nthese goals will be dependent on technological advancements and innovations.\
    \ The Centre\nfor the Development of Agricultural Techniques (CDAT) is a research,\
    \ development, and\ntechnology adoption center established to promote agricultural\
    \ research, development, and\ntechnology adoption. In order to achieve this aim,\
    \ advanced farming techniques must be\nimplemented, water resources should be\
    \ conserved, and agricultural productivity must\nbe improved. AgTech Investments:\
    \ There has been a lot of investment in agricultural\ntechnology startups and\
    \ innovations in Saudi Arabia. A large portion of these investments\nare targeted\
    \ towards fostering technological advancements in various aspects of agricultural\n\
    production, such as crop monitoring and the optimization of yield.\nThe objective\
    \ of this research is to explore the perception and adoption of IoT tech-\nnologies\
    \ for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia. Jizan, located in\
    \ the\nsouthwestern region of Saudi Arabia, is known for its diverse agricultural\
    \ activities and\nis a prime area for investigating the potential of IoT technologies\
    \ in improving farming\npractices. By understanding the perceptions, challenges,\
    \ and adoption intentions of farmers\nin Jizan regarding IoT-based crop monitoring,\
    \ valuable insights can be gained to enhance\nthe implementation and effectiveness\
    \ of these technologies in the local agricultural context.\nA major objective\
    \ of this study is to determine how much awareness farmers in Jizan\nhave regarding\
    \ the use of IoT technologies for crop monitoring and what the level of\nawareness\
    \ is. What are the perceived beneﬁts associated with adopting these technologies?\n\
    What is the intention of farmers to adopt IoT technologies for crop monitoring\
    \ in the future?\nAdditionally, this study will explore farmers’ preferred IoT\
    \ technologies, their perception\nof government support, access to information,\
    \ and training resources.\nBy investigating these aspects, this research aims\
    \ to contribute to the existing knowl-\nedge on the use of IoT technologies for\
    \ crop monitoring and provide valuable insights\nfor policymakers, agricultural\
    \ practitioners, and technology providers in Jizan, Saudi Ara-\nbia. The ﬁndings\
    \ of this study will help to identify the factors inﬂuencing the successful\n\
    implementation and adoption of IoT-based crop monitoring solutions, ultimately\
    \ leading\nto improved agricultural practices, enhanced productivity, and sustainable\
    \ farming in\nthe region. In this research paper, we aim to explore the perception\
    \ and adoption of IoT\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n3 of 19\ntechnologies for\
    \ monitoring crop health, growth, and yield prediction among farmers in\nJizan,\
    \ Saudi Arabia, by understanding the awareness, beneﬁts, and adoption intentions\
    \ of\nfarmers regarding IoT technologies in the region.\n2. Literature Review\n\
    In recent years, IoT technologies have gained substantial attention for crop monitoring\n\
    due to the fact that they have the potential to revolutionize agriculture by enabling\
    \ the\nprovision of real-time data on crop health, growth, and yield prediction\
    \ [7,8]. This emerging\nﬁeld offers promising opportunities for farmers to optimize\
    \ resource management, enhance\nproductivity, and make data-driven decisions for\
    \ sustainable farming practices. However,\nthe adoption and successful implementation\
    \ of IoT technologies in agriculture depend on\nmultiple factors that can vary\
    \ across different regions and contexts.\nIoT technologies have been shown to\
    \ have a number of beneﬁts in agriculture in\nprevious research. In the study\
    \ conducted by [7] in a different geographical context, it was\nfound that farmers\
    \ were able to collect precise and timely information about environmental\nfactors\
    \ such as soil moisture, temperature, and other elements through the use of IoT-based\n\
    monitoring systems. This enhanced data availability allowed farmers to optimize\
    \ irrigation\nschedules, resulting in improved water efﬁciency and increased crop\
    \ yields. Similarly,\nref. [8] emphasized the potential of IoT technologies in\
    \ crop yield prediction, demonstrating\ntheir ability to integrate data from multiple\
    \ sensors and provide accurate predictions for\ninformed decision-making.\nIn\
    \ Pathmudi et al. [9], IoT is considered a modern technology comprising physical\n\
    entities that communicate over the Internet with one another. The Internet of\
    \ Things is\neverywhere. Globally, connected systems/organizations are driving\
    \ the growth of IoT\ndevices [10]. Ref. [11] developed an irrigation management\
    \ system that uses the Internet of\nThings. There was a discussion of various\
    \ IoT architectures, deployment models, sensors,\nand controllers that are used\
    \ in agriculture today, cloud platforms for IoT, irrigation\nscheduling software,\
    \ and machine-learning algorithms that allow us to predict real-time\nirrigation\
    \ water demand in the future [12]. A system of automated monitoring of the\nsoil–plant–atmospheric\
    \ continuum at a high spatiotemporal resolution is being developed\nto replace\
    \ the current labor-intensive, experience-based methods of agricultural decision-\n\
    making with a data-driven approach based on data collected by automated monitoring\
    \ [13].\nIt is proposed to develop an Internet of Things (IoT) framework that\
    \ consists of wireless\nsensor networks with intelligent algorithms based on an\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) approach\nthat increases food production while combating\
    \ climatic change [14]. An IoT system\ncould be used for agricultural automation\
    \ and could be governed by a variety of protocol\ncommunications that are used\
    \ to describe its rules. Several factors must be considered\nwhen analyzing parameters\
    \ such as the speed at which data are transferred, the mechanism\nby which data\
    \ are transferred, the encryption level, range, latency, and number of items\n\
    controlled when analyzing parameters.\nIt has been proven that agriculturalists\
    \ and farmers can take advantage of the Internet\nof Things (IoT) not only in\
    \ order to enhance the efﬁciency with which they are able to\ngrow crops and to\
    \ make them more proﬁtable but also to improve their post-harvest\nprocesses and\
    \ the end users’ experience with agricultural products [15]. Furthermore, one\n\
    of the most effective uses of the IoT for agriculture involves implementing technologies\n\
    such as drones for agriculture through the use of the IoT [16], remote sensing\
    \ [17], smart\ngreenhouses [18], smart livestock management [19], computer imaging\
    \ [20], and efﬁcient\nclimate monitoring [21] as indicated in Figure 1.\nSustainability\

    \ factors that inﬂuence the adoption intentions of farmers in\nJizan is crucial\
    \ for the successful implementation and utilization of IoT technologies in the\n\
    region’s agricultural sector. Factors such as farmers’ level of awareness, perceived\

    \ support play a\nsigniﬁcant role in shaping their attitudes towards adopting\
    \ these technologies. However,\nthe literature lacks empirical evidence and insights\

    \ study aims to investigate the perception and adop-\ntion of IoT technologies\
    \ for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia. By\nconducting surveys\
    \ and analyzing the collected data, this research will provide valuable\ninsights\
    \ into the speciﬁc factors inﬂuencing farmers’ adoption intentions and inform\
    \ the\ndevelopment of strategies to promote the successful integration of IoT\
    \ technologies in\nJizan’s agricultural practices.\n2.2. Level of Awareness of\
    \ IoT Technologies in Agriculture\nIt has become increasingly apparent in recent\
    \ years that IoT technologies can be used\nfor improving agricultural productivity\
    \ and efﬁciency. IoT technologies offer numerous\nopportunities for enhancing\
    \ crop monitoring, improving productivity, and optimizing\nresource management\
    \ in the agricultural sector. This section discusses the evolving level\nof awareness\
    \ among farmers and stakeholders regarding the potential beneﬁts of IoT\ntechnologies\
    \ in agriculture.\nUsing IoT technologies, the authors of [8] argue that farmers\
    \ will be able to make\nmore informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources\
    \ in order to maximize crop\nhealth and growth during the growing season. The\
    \ study highlights the importance of\ncreating awareness among farmers about the\
    \ capabilities and beneﬁts of IoT technologies.\nSimilarly, [30] emphasize the\
    \ role of IoT-based crop growth monitoring systems in enabling\nfarmers to monitor\
    \ key parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels,\nleading\
    \ to improved crop management practices.\nIn a survey conducted by [31], it was\
    \ found that a majority of farmers had some level\nof awareness regarding IoT-based\
    \ smart agriculture. However, the study also revealed\nvariations in awareness\
    \ levels across different regions and farm sizes. This suggests the\nimportance\
    \ of tailoring awareness campaigns and educational initiatives to speciﬁc contexts\n\
    and target groups.\nThe authors discuss the importance of bridging the digital\
    \ divide and ensuring equal\naccess to information and resources related to IoT\
    \ technologies in agriculture. They empha-\nsize the need to address technological\
    \ literacy and provide adequate training and support\nto farmers to enhance their\
    \ awareness and adoption of IoT solutions.\n2.3. The Adoption of IoT Technologies\
    \ in Agriculture\nThe adoption of IoT (Internet of Things) technologies in the\
    \ agricultural sector has\ngained signiﬁcant attention in recent years. Farmers\
    \ are increasingly recognizing the\npotential beneﬁts of using IoT technologies\
    \ for monitoring crop health, growth, and yield\nprediction. This section explores\
    \ the adoption of IoT technologies among farmers and\nhighlights key factors inﬂuencing\
    \ their adoption decisions.\nA study conducted by [32] among farmers in the United\
    \ States found that 70% of the\nrespondents were aware of IoT technologies and\
    \ expressed a positive attitude toward their\nadoption. This indicates a growing\
    \ interest and acceptance of IoT technologies among\nfarmers.\nThe adoption of\
    \ IoT technologies is inﬂuenced by various factors. One crucial factor\nis the\
    \ perceived beneﬁts of using these technologies. Research by [30] demonstrated\
    \ that\nfarmers perceive IoT technologies as beneﬁcial for the real-time monitoring\
    \ of crop health,\nenabling proactive decision-making and optimizing resource\
    \ allocation. The ability to\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n6 of 19\nobtain\
    \ accurate and timely information about crop conditions and environmental factors\
    \ is\nseen as a signiﬁcant advantage of IoT technologies [33].\nHowever, there\
    \ are also challenges associated with the adoption of IoT technologies\nin agriculture.\
    \ Limited technical knowledge and skills to operate IoT devices have been\nidentiﬁed\
    \ as a barrier to adoption [34]. Farmers may require training and support to\n\
    effectively utilize IoT technologies in their farming practices. Additionally,\
    \ concerns about\ndata privacy and security pose challenges to adoption. Farmers\
    \ want assurance that their\ndata will be protected and not misused [2,35].\n\
    Government support plays a crucial role in facilitating the adoption of IoT technologies\n\
    in agriculture. Policies and initiatives that promote the use of IoT technologies\
    \ and provide\nﬁnancial incentives can positively inﬂuence farmers’ adoption decisions.\
    \ Research by [36]\nshowed that farmers who perceived strong government support\
    \ were more likely to adopt\nIoT technologies.\nMoreover, the availability of\
    \ information and training resources is vital for successful\nadoption. Farmers\
    \ need access to reliable and relevant information about IoT technologies,\ntheir\
    \ beneﬁts, and how to effectively implement them. Training programs and workshops\n\
    can enhance farmers’ understanding and competence in utilizing IoT technologies\
    \ for crop\nmonitoring [37–39].\n2.4. Perceived Beneﬁts of IoT Technologies\n\
    The perception of beneﬁts of IoT (Internet of Things) technologies in agriculture\
    \ plays\na signiﬁcant role in determining their adoption. Farmers are increasingly\
    \ recognizing the\npotential advantages that IoT technologies offer for monitoring\
    \ crop health, optimizing\nresource allocation, and improving overall agricultural\
    \ productivity.\nReal-time monitoring and data collection: One of the key perceived\
    \ beneﬁts of IoT\ntechnologies is the ability to monitor crop conditions and collect\
    \ data in real time. IoT de-\nvices equipped with sensors can provide farmers\
    \ with accurate and up-to-date information\nabout soil moisture levels, temperature,\
    \ humidity, and other environmental factors. There\nis a growing need for farmers\
    \ to be given access to data in real-time so that they can make\ngood decisions\
    \ regarding irrigation, fertilization, and pest control and thus improve crop\n\
    health and maximize resource utilization [30,33].\nProactive decision-making:\
    \ IoT technologies enable farmers to take a proactive ap-\nproach to agricultural\
    \ management. By continuously monitoring crop health and environ-\nmental conditions,\
    \ farmers can identify potential issues or anomalies early on and take\nnecessary\
    \ actions to mitigate risks. For example, if a sensor detects a sudden drop in\
    \ soil\nmoisture levels, the system can automatically trigger an irrigation schedule\
    \ adjustment or\nsend an alert to the farmer, allowing for prompt intervention\
    \ and preventing potential crop\ndamage [34].\nYield prediction and crop planning:\
    \ IoT technologies also contribute to yield pre-\ndiction and crop planning. Through\
    \ data analysis and machine-learning algorithms, IoT\nsystems can generate insights\
    \ and forecasts regarding crop yield potential. This information\nenables farmers\
    \ to plan their harvesting, storage, and marketing activities more effectively.\n\
    Additionally, yield prediction helps farmers estimate their future produce, allowing\
    \ for\nbetter ﬁnancial planning and decision-making [36].\n2.5. Willingness to\
    \ Adopt IoT Technologies\nThe willingness to adopt IoT (Internet of Things) technologies\
    \ is a critical factor in the\nsuccessful implementation and integration of these\
    \ technologies in the agricultural sector.\nThis section explores the factors\
    \ inﬂuencing farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies\nand the potential\
    \ beneﬁts associated with their adoption.\nPerceived usefulness: Farmers’ perception\
    \ of the usefulness of IoT technologies sig-\nniﬁcantly inﬂuences their willingness\
    \ to adopt them. Studies have shown that farmers\nare more likely to adopt IoT\
    \ technologies when they perceive them as valuable tools that\ncan enhance their\
    \ farming practices and decision-making processes. The perceived useful-\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 14541\n7 of 19\nness of IoT technologies stems from their ability\
    \ to provide real-time data on crop health,\noptimize resource management, and\
    \ improve overall agricultural productivity [30,33].\nPerceived ease of use: The\
    \ perceived ease of use refers to farmers’ perception of\nhow easy it is to learn\
    \ and operate IoT technologies. Farmers are more likely to adopt\nIoT technologies\
    \ when they perceive them as user-friendly and accessible. Factors such\nas the\
    \ simplicity of the interface, ease of installation and maintenance, and availability\n\
    of training and technical support inﬂuence farmers’ perception of the ease of\
    \ use. User-\nfriendly IoT technologies increase farmers’ conﬁdence in their ability\
    \ to adopt and utilize\nthese technologies effectively [2,34].\n2.6. Access to\
    \ Information and Training, Perception of Government Support\nAccess to information\
    \ and training, as well as the perception of government support,\nare important\
    \ factors that inﬂuence farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies in our\n\
    targeted area. Here, we explore the impact of these factors on farmers’ adoption\
    \ decisions\nbased on recent studies conducted from 2020 onward.\nAccess to information\
    \ and training: Farmers’ access to relevant information and train-\ning on IoT\
    \ technologies is crucial for their successful adoption. Studies have shown that\n\
    farmers who have access to comprehensive information and training programs are\
    \ more\nlikely to adopt and effectively use IoT technologies in their farming\
    \ practices. Accessi-\nble information channels, such as agricultural extension\
    \ services, workshops, seminars,\nand online resources, contribute to farmers’\
    \ understanding of the potential beneﬁts and\nfunctionalities of IoT technologies.\
    \ Training programs that provide hands-on experience\nand technical knowledge\
    \ further enhance farmers’ conﬁdence and competency in utilizing\nthese technologies\
    \ [8,40].\nPerception of government support: Farmers’ perception of government\
    \ support plays\na signiﬁcant role in their decision to adopt IoT technologies.\
    \ When farmers perceive that\nthe government actively supports the adoption and\
    \ implementation of IoT technologies\nin agriculture, they are more likely to\
    \ embrace these technologies. Government support\ncan take various forms, including\
    \ ﬁnancial incentives, subsidies, policy frameworks, and\nthe establishment of\
    \ dedicated support programs. The perception of government support\ncreates a\
    \ favorable environment for farmers, instilling conﬁdence and reducing potential\n\
    barriers to adoption. It also signals the government’s commitment to the modernization\
    \ of\nthe agricultural sector and the promotion of sustainable farming practices\
    \ [6,41].\nIn our targeted area, the availability of relevant and up-to-date information\
    \ on IoT\ntechnologies through government initiatives and agricultural extension\
    \ services is vital.\nFarmers should have access to training programs that provide\
    \ them with the necessary\nskills and knowledge to effectively use IoT technologies\
    \ for crop monitoring. Additionally,\nthe government should demonstrate a supportive\
    \ stance by offering ﬁnancial assistance,\nsubsidies, and policy measures that\
    \ incentivize the adoption of IoT technologies in agri-\nculture. These efforts\
    \ foster a positive perception of government support, encouraging\nfarmers to\
    \ embrace IoT technologies and integrate them into their farming operations [42].\n\
    2.7. Research Gap\nDespite the growing body of research on the use of IoT technologies\
    \ in agriculture,\nthere is still a notable gap when it comes to understanding\
    \ the perception and adoption of\nthese technologies among farmers in speciﬁc\
    \ regions, such as Jizan, Saudi Arabia. Most of\nthe existing studies have focused\
    \ on general discussions of IoT applications in agriculture\nor have examined\
    \ adoption patterns in different geographical contexts [8,43]. However, the\n\
    speciﬁc factors inﬂuencing the perception and adoption of IoT technologies in\
    \ the context\nof Jizan’s agricultural sector remain largely unexplored.\nJizan,\
    \ located in the southwestern region of Saudi Arabia, has its own unique agricul-\n\
    tural landscape, characterized by speciﬁc climatic conditions, crop varieties,\
    \ and farming\npractices. These contextual factors can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence farmers’\
    \ attitudes, awareness,\nand willingness to adopt IoT technologies for crop monitoring\
    \ and management. Therefore,\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n8 of 19\nit is crucial\
    \ to conduct region-speciﬁc studies to bridge the gap in knowledge and provide\n\
    insights that are tailored to the needs and challenges faced by farmers in Jizan.\n\
    By conducting a focused investigation on the perception and adoption of IoT tech-\n\
    nologies for crop monitoring among farmers in Jizan, this study aims to ﬁll this\
    \ gap in\nthe literature. It is hoped that the ﬁndings will allow us to better\
    \ understand the speciﬁc\nfactors that inﬂuence the adoption intentions of farmers\
    \ in Jizan. These factors include the\nfarmers’ level of awareness, their perception\
    \ of the beneﬁts, and their perception of the\nchallenges associated with IoT,\
    \ as well as their perception of the government’s support.\nThis knowledge can\
    \ inform the development of targeted strategies and policies to promote\nthe successful\
    \ implementation and utilization of IoT technologies in Jizan’s agricultural\n\
    sector.\nObjective and Hypothesis\nObjective 1: To examine the association between\
    \ farmers’ level of awareness of IoT\ntechnologies and their perception of the\
    \ beneﬁts.\nHypothesis 1. There is a signiﬁcant association between farmers’ level\
    \ of awareness of IoT\ntechnologies and their perception of the beneﬁts.\nObjective\
    \ 2: To assess the inﬂuence of perceived beneﬁts of using IoT technologies for\n\
    crop monitoring on farmers’ willingness to adopt these technologies.\nHypothesis\
    \ 2. The perceived beneﬁts of using IoT technologies for crop monitoring have\
    \ a signiﬁ-\ncant and positive inﬂuence on farmers’ willingness to adopt these\
    \ technologies.\nObjective 3: To explore the inﬂuence of access to information\
    \ and training, as well as\nthe perception of government support, on farmers’\
    \ willingness to adopt IoT technologies.\nHypothesis 3. The access to information\
    \ and training and perception of government support have\na positive inﬂuence\
    \ on farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies.\n3. Methodology\n3.1. Research\
    \ Design\nIt is the aim of this research study to identify the factors that inﬂuence\
    \ farmers in Jizan,\nSaudi Arabia, to adopt Internet of Things (IoT) technologies\
    \ for crop monitoring using the\nquantitative method as part of the research design.\
    \ In quantitative research, numerical data\nare collected and analyzed in a systematic\
    \ way, with the objective of testing hypotheses\nand drawing objective conclusions\
    \ based on the statistical analysis of the data.\n3.2. Sampling Technique\nAn\
    \ examination of a representative sample of farmers in Jizan was conducted by\
    \ using\na sampling technique based on stratiﬁcation. Based on relevant criteria\
    \ such as farm size,\nfarming experience, and geographic location, the population\
    \ of the study was divided\ninto distinct strata, which were categorized according\
    \ to relevant factors. To ensure that a\nproportionally representative sample\
    \ of each subgroup was selected, a random sampling\nalgorithm was used within\
    \ each stratum in order to select participants.\n3.3. Data Collection\nData were\
    \ collected through a structured questionnaire administered to the selected\n\
    sample of farmers. The questionnaire consists of multiple-choice and Likert scale\
    \ items\nto gather both demographic information and respondents’ perceptions,\
    \ attitudes, and\nbehaviors related to the adoption of IoT technologies for crop\
    \ monitoring. The questionnaire\nwas pre-tested with a pilot group of farmers\
    \ to ensure clarity and validity.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n9 of 19\n3.4.\

    the primary respondents. The total number of questionnaires distributed to farmers\
    \ for\ndata collection was 550. Out of the 550 questionnaires distributed, 500\
    \ questionnaires were\nreturned by the farmers. These results indicate that there\
    \ was a high response rate among\nthe farmers, with 90.91% of the questionnaires\
    \ being returned and providing valuable data\nfor the study. This suggests a good\
    \ level of engagement and interest from the farmers in\nthe topic of using IoT\
    \ technologies for crop monitoring in Jizan, Saudi Arabia. According\nto [44],\
    \ 70% or more is considered to be a good response rate and the response rate can\
    \ be\nconsidered as being excellent if that rate is greater than 70%.\nAccording\
    \ to Table 2 and a graphical representation of demographics analysis, the\nsurvey\
    \ included 500 respondents, of which 68.8% were male and 31.2% were female. The\n\
    participation of both genders indicates a diverse representation among farmers\
    \ in Jizan,\nSaudi Arabia. Among the respondents, 21.5% had an undergraduate degree,\
    \ 54.0% were\ngraduates, 19.3% held a master’s degree, and 5.3% had a Ph.D. The\
    \ majority of farmers in\nthe study had attained higher levels of education, indicating\
    \ a potential correlation between\neducation and the adoption of IoT technologies.\
    \ The distribution of farming experience\nshows that 36.0% of respondents had\
    \ no prior farming experience. Among those with\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n\
    10 of 19\nexperience, 32.8% had 1 to 3 years, 19.4% had 4 to 5 years, 10.0% had\
    \ 6 to 7 years, and\nonly 1.8% had more than 7 years of farming experience. The\
    \ ﬁndings suggest a mix of\nexperienced farmers and individuals relatively new\
    \ to farming, providing insights into the\nperspectives of both experienced and\
    \ novice farmers regarding IoT technology adoption.\nThe marital status of the\
    \ respondents indicates that 20.8% were single, 53.8% were married,\n20.2% were\
    \ divorced, and 5.2% were widowed. The diversity in marital status reﬂects the\n\
    varied life situations of farmers and allows for a comprehensive understanding\
    \ of different\nperspectives on IoT technology adoption. Among the surveyed farmers,\
    \ 68.8% of males\nand 31.2% of females have adopted IoT technologies. This ﬁnding\
    \ highlights a potential\ngender disparity in the adoption of IoT technologies\
    \ among farmers in Jizan, Saudi Arabia.\nTable 2. Demographical details.\nVariables\n\

    \ perceptions and adoption patterns regarding IoT technologies for\ncrop monitoring,\
    \ health assessment, growth tracking, and yield prediction.\nAccording to the\
    \ results in Table 3, the topic of using IoT technologies to monitor\ncrop health,\
    \ growth, and yield prediction exhibits a relatively moderate mean, a relatively\n\
    high variance and standard deviation, and a good level of internal consistency.\
    \ The high\nvariance and standard deviation indicate a signiﬁcant degree of variability\
    \ in the data, and\nthe good internal consistency suggests that the measured items\
    \ or variables in the analysis\nare reliable. The Cronbach’s alpha value for the\

    \ have an internal consistency of 0.872. As a result, all factors\nare internally\
    \ consistent with each other. In order to verify the reliability of a test, a\
    \ good\nmeasure is a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.7 or higher, which, when using\
    \ Cronbach’s alpha\nas a guideline, is generally considered a good measure of\

    \ (r = 0.835\n**) for Hypothesis 1, which examines the relationship between farmers’\
    \ level of awareness\nof IoT technologies and their perception of the beneﬁts\
    \ of using these technologies for crop\nmonitoring. The correlation coefﬁcient\
    \ of 0.835 ** indicates a strong positive correlation\nbetween farmers’ level\
    \ of awareness of IoT technologies and their perception of the beneﬁts\nassociated\
    \ with using these technologies for crop monitoring. This suggests that as farmers’\n\
    awareness of IoT technologies increases, their perception of the beneﬁts also\
    \ tends to\nincrease. The strength of the correlation coefﬁcient suggests that\
    \ there is a substantial\nrelationship between these two variables. The positive\
    \ correlation implies that farmers who\nhave a higher awareness of IoT technologies\
    \ are more likely to perceive greater beneﬁts\nfrom using these technologies for\
    \ crop monitoring. This ﬁnding supports the hypothesis\nthat there is a signiﬁcant\
    \ association between farmers’ level of awareness of IoT technologies\nand their\
    \ perception of the beneﬁts. It indicates that farmers who are more aware of IoT\n\
    technologies are more likely to recognize the advantages and positive outcomes\
    \ associated\nwith implementing these technologies in their crop monitoring practices.\n\

    \ no signiﬁcant evidence to suggest that the variances\nbetween the groups are\
    \ different from one another. Furthermore, there is no strong reason\nwhy the\
    \ null hypothesis should be rejected, as the assumption of homogeneity of variance\
    \ is\nmet. These results are considered good because they imply that the variability\
    \ within each\ngroup is relatively consistent, which makes it more appropriate\
    \ to use statistical methods\nthat assume equal variances, such as the analysis\
    \ of variance (ANOVA) or t-tests.\nAccording to the results in Table 6, the correlation\
    \ coefﬁcient (R) represents the strength\nand direction of the relationship between\
    \ the independent variable (perceived beneﬁts) and\nthe dependent variable (willingness\
    \ to adopt IoT technologies). In this case, the correlation\ncoefﬁcient is 0.458,\
    \ indicating a moderate positive correlation between the perceived bene-\nﬁts\
    \ and willingness to adopt IoT technologies. The coefﬁcient of determination (R\
    \ Square)\nexplains the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that\
    \ can be accounted for\nby the independent variable(s). In this model, the R Square\
    \ value is 0.210, which means\nthat approximately 21% of the variance in farmers’\
    \ willingness to adopt IoT technologies is\nexplained by the perceived beneﬁts.\
    \ The adjusted R Square is a calculation that takes into\naccount the number of\
    \ predictors that are included in a model and calculates the adjusted\nR Square\
    \ value accordingly. A more accurate R Square in this case is 0.209, which is\
    \ slightly\nlower than the standard R Square in this case. As a result, it is\
    \ suggested that when taking\ninto consideration the other variables in the model,\
    \ the perception of the beneﬁts alone\nexplains about 20.9% of the variance in\
    \ farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies. The\nSustainability 2023, 15,\

    \ the amount of variance in the dependent variable (farmers’ willingness to adopt\n\
    IoT technologies) that is explained by the predictors (access to information and\
    \ training,\nperception of government support). In this particular case, the regression\
    \ sum of squares is\n3180.032, which is a signiﬁcant value. The amount of unexplained\
    \ variance in a dependent\nvariable is represented by the residual sum of the\
    \ factor of the square. By using this method,\nwe can measure the difference between\
    \ the observed values and the values predicted by\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n\
    14 of 19\nthe regression model based on the observed data. According to this equation,\
    \ the residual\nsum of squares is 13,495.416, which is a signiﬁcant value. In\
    \ order to calculate the variance\nin the dependent variable, the total sum of\
    \ squares must be calculated. The sum of squares\nis calculated based on the regression\
    \ sum of squares and the residual sum of squares. This\nmeans that the total sum\
    \ of the squares is 16,675.448 in this case. There are degrees of\nfreedom that\
    \ serve as a measure of the amount of independent information that can be\ngathered\
    \ for estimation. In the regression model, the degrees of freedom for the predictors\n\
    are two, which is the number of predictors (access to information and training,\
    \ perception\nof government support). The degrees of freedom for the residual\
    \ are 497, which is the total\nnumber of observations minus the number of predictors.\
    \ The mean square is calculated by\ndividing the sum of squares by the degrees\
    \ of freedom. It represents the average amount\nof variance. The F statistic is\
    \ the ratio of the mean square for regression to the mean\nsquare for the residual.\
    \ It indicates whether the regression model as a whole is statistically\nsigniﬁcant.\
    \ In this case, the F statistic is 58.556. As a result of the F statistic, you\
    \ will be able\nto determine the signiﬁcance level (p-value). In other words,\
    \ it represents the probability of\nobtaining an observable F value by chance\
    \ alone, rather than using an algorithm. Using\nthis method of analysis, the p-value\

    \ of increasing farmers’ awareness of IoT technolo-\ngies in order to enhance\
    \ their perception of the beneﬁts and promote the adoption of these\ntechnologies\
    \ for effective crop monitoring. The perceived beneﬁts of using IoT technologies\n\
    for crop monitoring (PBIT) have a moderate positive relationship with farmers’\
    \ willingness\nto adopt these technologies. However, it is important to note that\
    \ the perceived beneﬁts\nalone explain only a portion of the variance in the willingness\
    \ to adopt, and there may\nbe other factors inﬂuencing farmers’ adoption behavior\
    \ that are not accounted for in the\ncurrent model. The ANOVA table indicates\
    \ that the regression model with the perceived\nbeneﬁts of using IoT technologies\
    \ (PBIT) as the predictor variable explains a signiﬁcant\namount of variability\
    \ in farmers’ willingness to adopt these technologies. The p-value\n(<0.001) suggests\
    \ that the relationship between the perceived beneﬁts and willingness\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 14541\n16 of 19\nto adopt IoT technologies is statistically signiﬁcant.\
    \ Overall, these ﬁndings support the\nsecond hypothesis, indicating that the perceived\
    \ beneﬁts of using IoT technologies for crop\nmonitoring have a signiﬁcant and\
    \ positive inﬂuence on farmers’ willingness to adopt these\ntechnologies. The\
    \ results suggest that highlighting the advantages and positive outcomes\nof using\
    \ IoT technologies can enhance farmers’ motivation to adopt them in their crop\n\
    monitoring practices.\nThe predictors (access to information and training, perception\
    \ of government support)\nhave a moderate positive relationship with farmers’\
    \ willingness to adopt IoT technologies,\nand they collectively explain a signiﬁcant\
    \ proportion of the variance in the dependent\nvariable. The regression model,\
    \ which includes the predictors (access to information and\ntraining, perception\
    \ of government support), is statistically signiﬁcant in explaining the\nvariance\
    \ in farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies. The predictors collectively\n\
    contribute signiﬁcantly to the model, as indicated by the F statistic and the\
    \ associated\np-value. Overall, the coefﬁcient table provides information about\
    \ the estimated effects of\nthe predictors on farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT\
    \ technologies. The signiﬁcant coefﬁcients\nindicate that both access to information\
    \ and training and the perception of government sup-\nport have a positive inﬂuence\
    \ on farmers’ willingness to adopt IoT technologies, although\nthe effect of access\
    \ to information and training (AIT) is relatively stronger compared to the\nperception\
    \ of government support (PGS).\n6. Conclusions\nThe purpose of this study is to\
    \ make contributions to the understanding of how farmers\nperceive IoT technologies\
    \ and their adoption for crop monitoring among themselves. The\nﬁndings shed light\
    \ on the roles of these technologies in enhancing agricultural practices\nand\
    \ emphasize the need for further research and support in promoting their effective\n\
    implementation in the agricultural sector. The discoveries of the study show the\
    \ importance\nof increasing farmers’ awareness of IoT technologies to enhance\
    \ their perception of the\nbeneﬁts and promote the adoption of these technologies\
    \ for effective crop monitoring. The\nperceived beneﬁts of using IoT technologies\
    \ for crop monitoring have a moderate positive\nrelationship with farmers’ willingness\
    \ to adopt these technologies. However, it is important\nto note that the perceived\
    \ beneﬁts alone explain only a portion of the variance in the\nwillingness to\
    \ adopt, suggesting the presence of other factors inﬂuencing farmers’ adoption\n\
    behavior that were not accounted for in the current model. The predictors, namely\
    \ access to\ninformation and training and the perception of government support,\
    \ also have a moderate\npositive relationship with farmers’ willingness to adopt\
    \ IoT technologies. Collectively,\nthese predictors explain a signiﬁcant proportion\
    \ of the variance in farmers’ willingness to\nadopt. The regression model including\
    \ these predictors is statistically signiﬁcant, indicating\ntheir inﬂuence on\
    \ farmers’ adoption behavior.\n6.1. Decision\nAccording to the results, it is\
    \ recommended that IoT technologies be promoted to\nfarmers and highlighted for\
    \ the beneﬁts associated with their use. Agricultural IoT tech-\nnology beneﬁts\
    \ and practical applications can be explained to farmers through targeted\ninformation\
    \ dissemination and training programs. IoT technologies should also be im-\nproved\
    \ to ensure farmers have access to information and training to adopt and use these\n\
    technologies effectively. Additionally, government initiatives and policies can\
    \ foster a\nsupportive environment for IoT adoption among farmers. Farmers’ adoption\
    \ behavior\nmay not be captured by the current model. IoT technologies in agriculture\
    \ should be\nexplored further in future research. These variables include economic\
    \ considerations, social\ndynamics, and technological infrastructure.\nAs a result\
    \ of the study, we conclude that the key drivers of the adoption of IoT tech-\n\
    nologies for crop monitoring in Jizan, Saudi Arabia include raising awareness,\
    \ promoting\nperceived beneﬁts, and providing access to information and training.\
    \ To improve crop\nSustainability 2023, 15, 14541\n17 of 19\nhealth, growth, and\
    \ yield prediction, policymakers, agricultural extension agencies, and\ntech providers\
    \ can use these ﬁndings to develop strategies and interventions.\n6.2. Future\
    \ Recommendations\n1.\nIn-depth analysis of other factors: Conduct further research\
    \ to explore and under-\nstand additional factors that may inﬂuence farmers’ adoption\
    \ behavior towards IoT\ntechnologies in crop monitoring. Consider variables such\
    \ as economic viability, social\ndynamics, technological infrastructure, and regulatory\
    \ contexts. This will offer a more\ncomprehensive considerate of the barriers\
    \ and drivers of adoption.\n2.\nLongitudinal studies: Conduct longitudinal studies\
    \ to track the adoption of IoT\ntechnologies over time among farmers in Jizan,\
    \ Saudi Arabia. This will help to\nidentify trends, challenges, and opportunities\
    \ associated with long-term adoption,\nas well as to assess the impact of IoT\
    \ technologies on crop health, growth, and yield\nprediction.\n3.\nTailored training\
    \ programs: Develop and implement tailored training programs for\nfarmers in Jizan,\
    \ Saudi Arabia, focusing on building their skills and knowledge related\nto IoT\
    \ technologies. These programs should be designed to address speciﬁc challenges\n\
    and opportunities in the local context, making them more effective in promoting\n\
    adoption and maximizing the beneﬁts of IoT technologies in crop monitoring.\n\
    4.\nCollaboration and partnerships: Foster collaboration and partnerships among\
    \ key\nstakeholders, including farmers, agricultural extension agencies, technology\
    \ providers,\nand government entities. Such collaborations can help in knowledge\
    \ sharing, capacity\nbuilding, and the co-development of IoT solutions that are\
    \ relevant and practical for\nthe local agricultural sector.\n5.\nFinancial support:\
    \ Explore ﬁnancial support mechanisms, such as subsidies, grants,\nor loans, to\
    \ assist farmers in the adoption of IoT technologies. Financial incentives\ncan\
    \ help to alleviate the initial investment costs associated with acquiring IoT\
    \ devices\nand implementing the necessary infrastructure, thus encouraging more\
    \ farmers to\nadopt these technologies.\n6.\nDemonstration farms: Establish demonstration\
    \ farms or pilot projects in Jizan, Saudi\nArabia, where farmers can observe and\
    \ learn ﬁrsthand about the beneﬁts and prac-\ntical applications of IoT technologies\
    \ in crop monitoring. These farms can serve as\nliving examples to showcase the\
    \ effectiveness and economic viability of IoT solutions,\nencouraging other farmers\
    \ to adopt similar practices.\n7.\nPolicy and regulatory frameworks: Develop supportive\
    \ policies and regulatory frame-\nworks that facilitate the adoption and integration\
    \ of IoT technologies in agriculture.\nThis can include standards for data privacy\
    \ and security, streamlined approval pro-\ncesses for IoT devices, and policies\
    \ promoting open data sharing for research and\ninnovation.\nBy implementing these\
    \ recommendations, stakeholders can contribute to the broader\nadoption of IoT\
    \ technologies in crop monitoring in Jizan, Saudi Arabia, ultimately leading to\n\
    improved agricultural practices, enhanced productivity, and sustainable farming\
    \ systems.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, F.A.R., A.J., A.H., M.U.,\

    \ in a country’s economy, which can be increased\nby providing the proper water\
    \ needed for crops. Proper water provision ensures suitable moisture\nand appropriate\
    \ conditions essential for crops, water resource preservation, minimized water\
    \ wastage,\nand energy consumption. However, adequate water provision is challenging\
    \ due to intermittent\nand uncertain environmental and weather conditions. On\
    \ this note, a model with uncertain and\nstochastic conditions (rain, wet, dry,\
    \ humidity, and moisture) capturing abilities is needed. Thus,\na smart-sensors-based\
    \ solar-powered system is developed for monitoring and controlling the tube\n\
    well that ensures proper water provision to crops. The developed system properly\
    \ checks weather\nand environmental conditions (rain, temperature, irradiance,\
    \ humidity, etc.), soil conditions (wet\nor dry), and crop conditions to monitor\
    \ and regulate water ﬂow accordingly to minimize water\nand energy consumption\
    \ wastage. The developed system is an integrated system of four modules:\nArduino\
    \ with a built-in Atmel AT mega microcontroller, sensors, solar power, and a global\
    \ system for\nmobile communication (GSM). The GSM module exchanges acknowledgement\
    \ messages with the\noperator and controller about the various statuses, such\
    \ as weather and environmental conditions,\nsoil conditions (wet or dry), crop\
    \ conditions, and the toggle status of the motor (OFF, ON/main\npower supply,\
    \ or solar power). In order for the controller module to determine the motor state,\n\
    the sensors module computes many parameters, including rain, wet, dry, humidity,\
    \ and moisture.\nIn addition, the sensor module also prevents the motor from dry\
    \ running. The developed smart\nirrigation system is superior to existing irrigation\
    \ systems in aspects of water wastage and energy\nconsumption minimization.\n\

    \ has a signiﬁcant impact on the economic development of a country. Pro-\nmoting\
    \ agriculture and improving crop yield is indispensable to meet the rising food\n\
    demand of the population. The crop yield depends on a proper irrigation system\
    \ (proper\nwater supply). Despite such importance, the irrigation systems in most\
    \ areas are obsolete.\nIn obsolete methods of irrigation, the improper (under\
    \ or over irrigation/scarce or bulk)\nProcesses 2022, 10, 1654. https://doi.org/10.3390/pr10081654\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/processes\nProcesses 2022, 10, 1654\n2 of 27\nprovision\
    \ of water damages crops [1]. Thus, outdated methods are manual [2], time con-\n\
    suming and ineffective [3], causing water and energy loss [4]. In addition, several\
    \ million\nliters of water are required for primitive irrigation methods. In remote\
    \ areas, the power\nunavailability problem is also a critical issue, where still\
    \ a reliable solution has not been\ndeveloped [5]. In fact, water resources, energy,\
    \ and agriculture land are enough to produce\nfood for the next decades if water\
    \ is well managed in irrigation [6]. Thus, innovative and\nmodern solutions must\
    \ be explored using advanced technologies to intelligently control\nwater in irrigation\
    \ and minimize water and energy loss.\n1.2. Literature Review\nOn this note, researchers\
    \ conducted research on smart irrigation systems in the litera-\nture. For instance,\
    \ a precision agriculture model was developed in [7] for the purpose of\nincreasing\
    \ the crop yield and minimizing energy and water usage. The precision agricul-\n\
    ture collects observations via different means, such as sensors, drones, satellite\
    \ connected\nto the web, and mobile application-based decision support system\
    \ [8]. Reducing water\nand energy wastage in irrigation is an important challenging\
    \ issue for many countries [9].\nAround the globe, more than 70% of water is used\
    \ for agriculture [10], and mostly water\nis wasted, causing water shortage in\
    \ the majority of countries; they have to adopt smart\nintelligent methods for\
    \ irrigation [11].\nFuzzy logic (FL) applications [12–14] in agriculture for irrigation\
    \ has captured the\nattention of most researchers because the FL controller does\
    \ not require an exact model and\nis helpful for farmers to make optimal decisions\
    \ in irrigation for their crops [15]. On this\nnote, an intelligent smart irrigation\
    \ system based on the FL controller was developed in [16].\nThe obtained results\
    \ were compared to the proportional-integral-derivative controller and\ntraditional\
    \ feedback system to endorse the applicability of the FL controller in irrigation.\n\
    The alfalfa irrigation management system based on the FL controller was developed\n\
    in [17]. A dedicated software was developed to ﬁnd irrigation timing and amount\
    \ for\nalfalfa irrigation management system to operate efﬁciently. This system\
    \ was tested in\nZhuozhou, in Hebei Province of China, and the obtained results\
    \ show that the developed\nsystem is promising for real-time irrigation [18].\
    \ The FL controller is used in several\nstudies, such as [19–21], for smart irrigation\
    \ application considering the availability of\nwater, humidity, and soil moisture\
    \ conditions to ensure water saving by providing water to\ncrops whenever needed.\n\
    Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging technology that has solved various problems\n\
    in different sectors [4,22]. In this regard, Refs. [23,24] developed an IoT-based\
    \ automatic\nirrigation system that collects farm information, alerts the irrigation\
    \ unit, and checks\nwater level in real time. The authors developed an integrated\
    \ system based on Bluetooth\ntechnology [25] to monitor and control irrigation.\
    \ However, a major disadvantage of\nBluetooth technology is its limited range\
    \ of a few meters and impracticality for those\nﬁelds which are at a distance\
    \ of a few kilometers. A system based on the PIC 16F88\nmicrocontroller was designed\
    \ in [26] to monitor the moisture, temperature, and humidity\nof crop ﬁelds using\
    \ sensors. Similarly, adaptive control strategies were developed in [27–31].\n\
    A global system for mobile communication (GSM) based model was introduced in [32]\
    \ to\norganize the irrigation schedule. Short message service (SMS) messages are\
    \ exchanged\nwhen there is a possibility of rain based on weather predictions\
    \ in the ﬁeld. Machine\nlearning methods were introduced for the irrigation application\
    \ in [33]. A decision-making\nmodel for irrigation was developed in [34] for the\
    \ purpose of increasing the quantity and\nquality of the crop yield. Efﬁcient\
    \ water management is a major concern in irrigation, which\nis solved using an\
    \ integrated model of deep learning and sensors [35,36]. Researchers\ndeveloped\
    \ a model based on Raspberry Pi to record the growth rate of plants during\nvarious\
    \ environmental conditions [37]. The model is suitable for record keeping in various\n\
    environmental conditions [38]. However, this model is not suitable for remote\
    \ areas, where\nInternet service is unavailable. In [39], the authors studied\
    \ different technologies and\npolicies on smart irrigation systems used in the\
    \ ﬁeld of agriculture. In [40], an integrated\nProcesses 2022, 10, 1654\n3 of\
    \ 27\nframework of wireless sensors network, Raspberry Pi, and fuzzy logic controller\
    \ using\nIoT was developed for the zoning irrigation smart system to save water\
    \ and money. This\nintegrated framework is powered from solar energy [41]. Recently,\
    \ a hybrid model of global\npositioning system with radial function network was\
    \ developed in [42] for monitoring\nand controlling an irrigation system in India.\
    \ The authors [43] developed a real-time\nsmart irrigation system to achieve higher\
    \ yields with less irrigation water. An innovative\nirrigation system based on\
    \ long short-term memory neural networks was proposed in [44].\nSimilarly, optimization\
    \ models were developed in [45–58]. For example, the intelligent\nmodel optimizes\
    \ and schedules water usage using the sensors’ humidity, temperature,\nand soil\
    \ moisture data. A comprehensive review was conducted in aspects of hardware\n\
    systems developed for smart irrigation systems in [59]. A study was conducted\
    \ in [60] on\nmonitoring and controlling irrigation systems.\n1.3. Research Gaps\n\
    The above stated works are valuable assets of literature and are capable of performing\n\
    irrigation. However, the problem with existing systems is that they are either\
    \ too costly to\nbe installed in the ﬁeld, or the range of communication system\
    \ used is limited, and real-time\nremote monitoring is not possible, especially\
    \ for ﬁelds located far enough from the user.\nAdditionally, the authors in the\
    \ above works either focused on water wastage or energy\nconsumption minimization,\
    \ appropriate conditions selection, or proper water provision to\nﬁelds. In addition,\
    \ none of the works considered water wastage, energy consumption mini-\nmization,\
    \ appropriate conditions selection, and proper water provision, simultaneously.\n\
    1.4. Contributions\nTo overcome these problems, a smart-sensors-based solar-powered\
    \ system is devel-\noped to control and monitor water ﬂow from a tube well for\
    \ irrigation applications. The\ndeveloped system remotely controls and monitors\
    \ irrigation for crops in the ﬁeld, minimiz-\ning water wastage and energy consumption,\
    \ appropriate conditions selection, proper water\nprovision, and labor cost reduction.\
    \ To clarify the novelty and uniqueness of this study,\nthe proposed smart irrigation\
    \ system is compared with current existing systems ranging\nfrom [61–67], and\
    \ a brief comparison is listed in Table 1. The GSM technology has made\na signiﬁcant\
    \ advancement in the recent era and is used in many ﬁelds, including smart\nirrigation.\
    \ The reason is that it is cheap, reliable, and easily deployable.\nTable 1. A\

    \ different types of sensors, including soil humidity, rain, water level, and\n\
    irradiance sensors, are deployed in the ﬁeld. These sensors sense data and send\
    \ them to\nthe Arduino microcontroller. The Arduino is programmed to receive data\
    \ from sensors\non speciﬁed pins. After receiving data, ﬁrst, it will send these\
    \ data to an LCD screen for\ndisplay and, in the meantime, make some decisions.\
    \ In the ﬁrst place, the humidity of\nthe soil is checked. If it is humid, then\
    \ the water level in the ﬁeld is checked using water\nlevel sensors. If the water\
    \ level is not up to the mark, the Arduino will send a command to\nswitch on the\
    \ motor. The same information is conveyed to the user using the GSM module\nof\
    \ the system. When the water level reaches a speciﬁc predeﬁned value, the Arduino\
    \ will\nsend another command to switch off the motor. Similarly, if the soil is\
    \ dry, then the rain\ndetection sensor is checked, and the motor is not switched\
    \ on until there is no sign of\nrain. The water ﬂow rate is also monitored using\
    \ the ﬂow rate sensor. All the updates are\ndisplayed on the LCD screen and subsequently\
    \ sent to the user. The user can also know\nthe status of all these sensors and\
    \ parameters by sending an SMS to the system. So, the\nwhole system works in close\
    \ coordination with each other. Information is collected by\nsensors, and sent\
    \ to the Arduino, which sends it to the LCD and GSM module. The GSM\nthen sends\
    \ it to the user or subscriber. This way, a smart and controlled irrigation system\
    \ is\nimplemented. It is also worth mentioning here that all of this system is\
    \ solar powered. The\ngreen energy is eco-friendly and uninterrupted, with no\
    \ power outage issue. The major\ntechnical contributions and uniqueness of the\
    \ paper are described as follows:\n•\nThe GSM module of the proposed system exchanges\
    \ acknowledgement messages with\nthe operator and controller about the various\
    \ status, such as weather and environmen-\ntal conditions, soil conditions (wet\
    \ or dry), crop conditions, and toggle status of motor\n(OFF, ON/main power supply\
    \ or solar power).\n•\nBased on the weather and environmental conditions, soil\
    \ conditions, crop conditions,\nand parameters sensor output, the motor is turned\
    \ on or off automatically via the\nArduino microcontroller to prevent excessive\
    \ usage of water and electricity.\n•\nThe motor is turned off automatically when\
    \ rain is started to save power.\n•\nThe proposed system is powered via solar\
    \ plant that reduces power consumption and\npower outages.\n1.5. Organization\n\
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The approach and methodology of\
    \ the\nproposed system is discussed in Section 2. The experimental setup and results\
    \ are presented\nin Section 3, and discussion is conducted in Section 4. Finally,\
    \ the paper is concluded in\nSection 5 with future works.\nProcesses 2022, 10,\
    \ 1654\n5 of 27\n2. Approach and Methodology\nAgriculture ﬁelds are located far\
    \ away from the farmers’ residence, and it is difﬁcult\nfor them to visit a few\
    \ times a day to turn on and off the motor to guard crops against\nimproper irrigation\
    \ and unconditional rain. To resolve these issues, a smart-sensors-based\nsolar-powered\
    \ system for smart irrigation is developed, which will be discussed in detail\n\
    in this section. The designed system monitors and controls water ﬂow to the ﬁeld\
    \ by\nturning on and off the motor based on weather and ﬁeld conditions. The developed\n\
    framework comprises Arduino with a built-in Atmel ATmega microcontroller module,\n\
    sensors (humidity, soil, moisture, rain, level, ﬂow, etc.) module, solar power\
    \ module, and\nGSM module, as shown in Figure 1. The Arduino microcontroller module\
    \ works as a\ncentral control device in the developed framework. The sensors modules\
    \ acquire data.\nThe acquired data are sent to the analog-to-digital converter\
    \ (ADC) of the microcontroller.\nThe microcontroller makes the decision based\
    \ on the received data from the sensors to\neither switch on or off the motor\
    \ via a digital signal generated at its digital I/O pin.\nThe decision taken by\
    \ the microcontroller is communicated via the GSM module to the\noperator/user\
    \ via SMS. The operator/user can remotely control the motor via handset and\n\
    also view the operation status via a handset upon receiving acknowledgments of\
    \ the sent\ncommands. In addition, LCD is used to view the operation status and\
    \ various parameters\nunder consideration. The developed system works on 12 v\
    \ DC supply due to the Arduino.\nTherefore, 220 v AC supply is converted to 12\
    \ v DC to operate the system and is also\ninitially used to power up the AC pump\
    \ to ﬁll the tube well. The solar power module\ngenerates 12 v DC, which is used\
    \ to power a submersible pump to push the water from the\nwell to agriculture\
    \ ﬁelds for irrigation. Relays are used to control the switching of motors.\n\
    All data recorded of the whole process are shared with the user via SMS. The tube\
    \ well\npump is turned on and off as per the decision taken by the microcontroller\
    \ based on the\nweather, ﬁeld, and water conditions.\nThe whole process is shown\
    \ in Figure 2 via a ﬂow chart. An SMS about the status of\nthe motor is sent back\
    \ as an acknowledgment to the user. The ﬂow chart of the controlled\nsequence\
    \ commands to operate tube well in manual or automatic mode is depicted in\nFigure\
    \ 3. To check the feasibility of the smart-sensors-based solar-powered system,\
    \ aspects\nof availability, cost, various sensors, voltage converters, motors,\
    \ and other performance\nparameters are evaluated. The components are selected\
    \ based on careful evaluation, which\nis used in the developed framework. Furthermore,\
    \ all components used in the developed\nsystem are initially simulated to analyze\
    \ and check its feasibility and functionality. This sim-\nulation analysis facilitated\
    \ us to develop the design of a smart-sensors-based solar-powered\nsystem with\
    \ minimal effort and time. Both the simulation (software) and prototype’s\n(hardware)\

    \ follows:\n% Efﬁciency =\npmax\nA × 1000 × 100\n(4)\nwhere Pmax denotes solar\
    \ panel maximum power output, A represents the solar panel total\narea, and the\
    \ size of used solar panel is 7′′ × 11′′. The efﬁciency of the solar panel at\
    \ the\nabove discussed speciﬁcation is 16.1%.\n2.4. Motor Switching\nThe developed\
    \ system mainly controls motor operation based on speciﬁc conditions,\nsuch as\
    \ weather and environmental conditions (rain, temperature, irradiance, humidity,\n\
    etc.), soil conditions (wet or dry), and crop conditions to monitor and regulate\
    \ water ﬂow\naccordingly to minimize water and energy consumption wastage. For\
    \ instance, the motor\nwill be turned on when the soil is dry, and the tube well\
    \ has sufﬁcient water; otherwise, it\nwill remain off. The switching circuitry\
    \ employed for this purpose is shown in Figure 8. A\ntransistor is used as a switch\
    \ in the switching circuitry, and it has three operation regions:\ncut-off, linear,\
    \ and saturation region. The microcontroller decides to either turn on or off\n\
    the motor. The microcontroller issues a command to turn on the motor. It generates\
    \ a high\nsignal on the I/O pin, which drives the base to operate the transistor\
    \ in a saturation region\nthat energizes the relay to shift from a normally closed\
    \ (NC) position to a normally open\n(NO) position, which makes a path for the\
    \ current ﬂow. As a result, the motor will be\nturned on. In contrast, when the\
    \ motor turn-off command is fed to a microcontroller, it\nsets the I/O pin to\
    \ low, removing the base signal from the transistor that operates it in the\n\
    cut-off region. Consequently, the motor will be turned off. The LCD will display\
    \ the on or\noff status of the motor for visualization.\n2.5. ADC\nADC is a device\
    \ used to convert an analog signal to a digital signal by converting\ncontinuous\
    \ amplitudes to ﬁxed discrete levels. The working mechanism of ADC is visu-\n\
    alized in Figure 9. This work used sensors whose outputs are analog signals that\
    \ must\nbe converted to digital signals before feeding to the microcontroller.\
    \ The Arduino has\non-chip ADCs with 10-bit resolution. Thus, ADCs assign 1024\
    \ discrete, distinct levels to\neach incoming analog signal. The higher the resolution,\
    \ the better the accuracy. The ADCs\nconversion is formulated as follows:\nDout\
    \ = 2n − 1 × Vin\nVref\n(5)\nwhere Vref represents reference analog voltage, and\
    \ Dout denotes the digital value of the\ncorresponding analog input voltage Vin.\n\
    To convert the obtained digital value to an analog value, rearranging Equation\
    \ (5), we\nobtain Equation (6), which ensures conversion as follows:\nVin = Dout\

    \ are of two types: (i) linear regulators and (ii) switching regulators. \nLinear\
    \ regulators use variable resistances to regulate and maintain the constant output\
    \ \nvoltage. Positive (78xx) and negative (79xx) voltage regulators are examples\
    \ of linear reg-\nulators. In positive and negative regulators, input voltage\
    \ > output/desired regulated volt-\nage. In contrast, switching regulators turn\
    \ on/off transistors at different intervals for main-\ntaining a constant/regulated\
    \ output voltage. In switching regulators, input voltage < or > \noutput voltage/regulated\
    \ voltage, e.g., buck and boost converter. Moreover, it is obvious \nfrom Figure\
    \ 10 that the efficiency of the linear regulator is constant for the same amount\
    \ \nof output current. In contrast, a switching converter has higher efficiency\
    \ and improves \nwith the increase in current. Switching regulators are more effective\
    \ and efficient than \nlinear regulators, as depicted in Figure 11. For instance,\
    \ a regulator with 24 v input voltage \nand 1A load generates a 6 v constant output\
    \ voltage resulting in input power Pin = Vin × \nIin = 24 W and output power Pout\
    \ = 6 v × 1 A= 6 W returning 25% efficiency (% efficiency \n= Pout/Pin), dissipated\
    \ power Pd = 24 − 6 = 18 W. Thus, more power is dissipated while \nperforming\
    \ regulation than the power consumed, which raises the junction temperature. \n\
    In this work, we use a linear voltage regulator due to the following reasons:\
    \ (i) devices \ninput voltages and output voltages do not have enough difference,\
    \ (ii) low noise, cost, and \nsimple circuit configuration. \nFigure 9. ADCs working\
    \ for smart sensors based solar powered system.\n2.6. Voltage Regulator\nVoltage\

    \ 10 that the efﬁciency of the linear regulator is constant for the same\namount\
    \ of output current. In contrast, a switching converter has higher efﬁciency and\n\
    improves with the increase in current. Switching regulators are more effective\

    \ smart irrigation framework is designed and implemented in\nProteus software,\
    \ as depicted in Figure 11. The developed framework has four modules\nsuch as\
    \ a controller module, power supply module, GSM module, and sensors module.\n\
    The controller module has Arduino with a built-in ATmega-328 microcontroller,\
    \ the power\nsupply module has main supply/PV panels, the GSM module is SIM900D,\
    \ and the sensors\nmodule has soil moisture, temperature, humidity, level, and\
    \ rain detection sensors. The\ncontroller module is the main part, which monitors\
    \ the whole irrigation process. The\npurpose of this implementation is to test\
    \ and select the efﬁcient system’s parameters.\nThe change in the behavior of\
    \ components under different conditions (environmental\nconditions) was taken\
    \ and kept under consideration. For example, the linear regulator\nhas much signiﬁcant\
    \ power dissipation when its input voltage is more than double the\noutput voltage.\
    \ In other words, the more signiﬁcant the difference in voltages, the larger\n\
    the power dissipation. Since the used sensors operate on 5 v, a 7805 linear voltage\
    \ regulator\nis used in the proposed system. A heat sink is also placed for excessive\
    \ heat absorption.\nAfter testing and analyzing via simulations, appropriate hardware\
    \ components are selected,\nand a hardware prototype is developed. The hardware\
    \ components used for prototype\ndevelopment are as follows: PC with Arduino software,\
    \ Arduino ATmega-328, soil moisture\nsensor (YL 69), humidity and temperature\
    \ sensor (DHT22), rain level monitoring sensor,\nGSM module (SIM900D), relays,\
    \ solar PV panels, LCD, and pumps. The speciﬁcations of\nthe developed system\

    \ case, the need to calculate the threshold depth is omitted because\nthe sensor\
    \ will automatically generate an output after sensing raindrops.\n4. Discussion\n\
    Many models in the literature have been proposed, which rely only on utility supply.\n\
    Since solar energy is used by both the proposed model and [65], some similarities\
    \ and\ndifferences can be highlighted with existing systems. Firstly, both models\
    \ used different\nsensors for data collection and GSM technology for communication\
    \ to automate irrigation.\nAlso, both models used a central controller (microcontroller)\
    \ for making smart decisions.\nSecondly, both models achieved excellent results\
    \ in terms of the measurement and accuracy\nof sensors, water, and energy consumption\
    \ minimization. However, in [65], some confronta-\ntions can be seen with low\
    \ daylight. The blustery/windy climate was also an issue. The\nproblem with low\
    \ sunlight means low irradiance, which means lesser solar power output,\nleading\
    \ to motor operation below its rated value. This problem was addressed in our\n\
    system by constantly monitoring solar irradiance. As the irradiance falls below\
    \ a threshold\nand enough solar energy is not available to operate the motor,\
    \ the motor is automatically\nturned off. This issue can also be addressed by\
    \ adding a maximum power point tracking\ntechnique. At maximum power point, speciﬁc\
    \ voltage and current values are calculated, as\nshown in Figure 15. The blue\
    \ and green lines show current–voltage and power–voltage\nrelations, respectively.\
    \ It is evident from the graphs that in the case of partial shading or\nlow irradiance,\
    \ the power drop from the maximum value is signiﬁcant. In contrast, there is\n\
    no power drop in the case of no shading, and at high irradiance, the power is\
    \ maximal. To\nfurther elaborate on this concept, as shown in Figure 16a, ﬁve\
    \ different irradiances with\nvalues ranging from 600 W/m2 to 1400 W/m2 and a\
    \ step size of 200 are taken at a ﬁxed\ntemperature of 250 ◦C. The results indicate\
    \ that current and power are directly proportional\nto the irradiance. Furthermore,\
    \ it also helps to select suitable solar panels for the system.\nSimilarly, ﬁve\
    \ different temperatures ranging from 12–350 ◦C with a step size of 50 ◦C were\n\
    taken at ﬁxed solar irradiance of 1000 W/m2. The results indicate that current\
    \ and voltage\nare in inverse proportion with the temperature, as shown in Figure\
    \ 16b. Furthermore, it\nalso helps in the selection of suitable solar panels for\
    \ the developed smart irrigation system.\nA water level sensor is also installed\
    \ in the well to show the status of the water level in\nthe well to prevent the\
    \ motor from dry running. Hence, if the water level in the well falls\nbelow the\
    \ motor level, the motor will remain off, even if the soil is dry and there is\
    \ no rain.\nThis sensor will also help to monitor the availability of water deep\
    \ inside the earth.\nProcesses 2022, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n21 of 28 \n \n \n\

    \ a comparison is conducted in aspects\nof performance with existing models, such\
    \ as [65–67]. These systems are selected as\nbenchmark due to architectural similarities\

    systems, such as [65–67]. It is difﬁcult to estimate the exact percentage improvement\n\

    \ are needed,\nwhich is difﬁcult because each system has its pros and cons. However,\
    \ the concluding\nremarks are as follows:\n•\nThe obtained results listed in Table\

    \ and 14.92% less time compared to existing systems,\nsuch as [65], [66], and\
    \ [67], respectively. Additionally, the capital cost of the pro-\nposed approach\
    \ is nearly 10% less than the existing systems, such as [65], [66],\nand [67],\
    \ respectively.\n•\nThe obtained comparative results (proposed and existing ([65–67])\
    \ listed in Table 9\nshow that the proposed system gives an improvement in water\
    \ and energy consump-\nProcesses 2022, 10, 1654\n23 of 27\ntion of 51.1% and 44.82%\
    \ compared to [65], 35.5% and 31.0% compared to [66], 26.6%\nand 20.6% compared\
    \ to [67], respectively.\nFrom the above discussion, we conclude that the proposed\
    \ smart irrigation system is\nthe most suitable system for farmers to irrigate\
    \ the crops in their ﬁelds, which will return\nsavings in terms of cost, time,\
    \ water, and energy.\n5. Conclusions\nThis research focused on the serious issue\
    \ of water and energy loss during irrigation\nand proposed an optimal solution\
    \ to the problem by developing a low-cost smart-sensor-\nbased solar-powered irrigation\
    \ system. The proposed smart irrigation system has four\nmodules: Arduino with\
    \ a built-in ATmega microcontroller, sensors, solar power/utility,\nand GSM. The\
    \ Arduino microcontroller module takes input from different sensors such as\n\
    soil moisture, rain, humidity, and water level sensors installed in the ﬁeld.\
    \ The Arduino\nmakes a decision based on the information received from the sensor\
    \ module. The Arduino\nwill send a command to turn on the tube well if the soil\
    \ is dry, there is no rain, and the crops\nneed water. The Arduino will send a\
    \ command to turn off the tube well when the water\nlevel reaches the desired\
    \ level, conserving water and saving crops from over-irrigation.\nA sensor installed\
    \ in the well also prevents the motor from dry running and ultimately\noverheating.\
    \ An LCD screen is also installed, which shows the status of the motor and\nsensors.\
    \ The GSM module installed conveys all this information to the user located remotely.\n\
    The user can also enquire about the status of the tube well (on or off) and sensors\
    \ using his\ncellphone. It is worth mentioning here that primarily, the system\
    \ works on solar power.\nOverall, the proposed system is economical (as the sensors\
    \ are low cost and operation\ncost is also zero), reliable, and easily deployable.\
    \ The proposed system saves a lot of time,\nmoney, energy, and water. It also\
    \ reduces the need for more human resources, as it is\nsmart, automatic, and user\
    \ friendly. Even someone with just basic cellphone know-how\ncan use it without\
    \ any inconvenience. Results show that the proposed system is superior to\nexisting\
    \ systems in terms of water wastage, energy consumption, and cost minimization,\n\
    and revolutionizes the existing irrigation system.\nThis work can be extended\
    \ in future in the following directions:\n•\nThe controller will be programmed\
    \ based on the Lyapunov optimization technique\nto solve the irrigation scheduling\
    \ problem in real time, where on-ﬁeld events and\nrequests will be responded to\
    \ for effective irrigation.\n•\nA Lyapunov-optimization-technique-based controller\
    \ will be employed in fog- and\ncloud-based environments to solve the irrigation\
    \ scheduling problem under dynamic\nand uncertain conditions for remote ﬁelds\
    \ that the farmer is unable to access.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    is a major issue in the field of sustainable development. Several models of solving
    this problem can be found in the literature, especially in the agricultural sector
    which represents the main consumer through irrigation. Therefore, Irrigation management
    is an important and innovative field that has been the subject of several types
    of research and studies to deal with the different activities, behaviors, and
    conflicts between the different users. This article introduces an intelligent
    irrigation system based on smart sensors that can be used moderately and economically
    to monitor farms by integrating some connected electronic devices and other advantageous
    instruments widely used in the field of IoT, it determines the water requirement
    of each farm according to the water loss due to the process of evapotranspiration.
    The water requirement is calculated from data collected from a series of sensors
    installed in the plantation farm. This project focuses on smart irrigation based
    on IoT and agent technology, it can be used by farmer associations whose endowments
    and irrigation planning are defined according to the need and quantity of water
    available in the rural municipality. The system includes a microcontroller with
    the integration of sensors, actuators, and valve modules where each node serves
    as an IoT device. Environmental parameters are monitored directly through a multi-agent
    system that facilitates the control of each node and the configuration of irrigation
    parameters. The amount of water calculated for irrigation is based on the Penman
    model for calculating the daily evapotranspiration baseline. Compared to the conventional
    irrigation method, it is expected that the proposed irrigation model would contribute
    to saving water use and distributing it impartially without compromising its production.

    \ Water and Environment Research Institute, ARC, Giza, Egypt. \n \nABSTRACT \n\
    \ \n \nTwo field experiments were carried out at Sakha Agricultural Research \n\
    station (31oo5` N latitude and 30o57` E longitude) Kafr El-Sheikh governorate\
    \ during \nthe two successive summer growing seasons 2012 and 2013 to investigate\
    \ the effect \nof water stress through various growth stages, biofertilizers and\
    \ nitrogen application \nrates on cowpea yield, its components, uptake of phosphorus,\
    \ nitrogen and protein \ncontent in some plant organs and some water relations\
    \ in the North Middle Nile Delta \nregion. A split split plot design with four\
    \ replicates was used in this present study \nwhere the main treatments were randomly\
    \ assigned by irrigation treatments which \nwere I1 (control treatment), I2 (withholding\
    \ one irrigation at the vegetative growth \nstage), I3 (withholding one irrigation\
    \ at the flowering growth stage) and I4 (withholding \none irrigation at pod formation\
    \ stage), where the sub-plot  were randomly assigned by \napplication of nitrogen\
    \ which were three rates of application, N1 (control treatment, \nwithout nitrogen\
    \ application), N2 (application of 15 kg N/fed.) and N3 (application of 30 \n\
    kg N/fed. which considers the recommended dose for cowpea).where the sub sub plot\
    \ \nwere randomly assigned by biofertilizers which were b1 (without biofertilizers\
    \ \napplication) and b2 (application of biofertilizers for the soil after emergence),\
    \ \n \nThe main results of this present investigation can be summarized as follows:\
    \ \namount of seasonal water applied were clearly affected by irrigation treatments.\
    \ The \nhighest values were recorded under irrigation treatment I1  comparing\
    \ with other \nirrigation treatments I2, I3 and I4 in the two growing seasons.\
    \ The highest values were \n2950 m3/fed. (70.2 cm) and 2980 m3/fed (70.95 cm)\
    \ in the first and second growing \nseasons, respectively. \n \nConcerning the\
    \ effect of irrigation treatments on the mean values of seasonal \nconsumptive\
    \ use, the highest values were also recorded under irrigation treatment I1 \n\
    in the two growing seasons and the mean values were 1823.3 and 1846.7 m3/fed in\
    \ \nthe first and second growing seasons, respectively. On the contrary, under\
    \ other \nirrigation treatments, I2, I3 and I4 recorded mean values which less\
    \ than that recorded \nunder irrigation treatment (I1).  \n \nThe highest mean\
    \ values for both (WP) and (PIW) were recorded under stress \nconditions I2, I3\
    \ and I4 comparing with non-stressed treatments I1 (traditional irrigation) in\
    \ \nthe two growing seasons. also, both biofertilizers application and nitrogen\
    \ rates have an \neffect on both (WP) and (PIW) where the highest mean values\
    \ for both the two irrigation \nefficiencies , cowpea yield and yield components,\
    \  nitrogen, phosphorus percentage and \nprotein content were recorded under N3\
    \ b2 . \n \n \nConcerning with the nitrogen percentage and protein content the\
    \ highest overall \nmean values were recorded under irrigation treatment I1 and\
    \ the values are 3.336 and \n3.277% for nitrogen and 20.85 and 20.48% for protein\
    \ content in the first and second \ngrowing seasons, respectively. On the contrary,\
    \ the lowest overall mean values were \nrecorded under irrigation treatment I4\
    \ the overall mean values are 3.191 and 2.942% for \nnitrogen and 19.94 and 18.39%\
    \ for protein content in the first and second growing \nseasons, respectively.\
    \ Also, data showed that the highest overall mean values for \nMoursi, E. A. et\
    \ al. \n \n1290 \nphosphorus percentage in the two growing seasons were also recorded\
    \ under irrigation \ntreatment I1 and the overall mean values are 0.201 and 0.195%\
    \ in the first and second \ngrowing seasons, respectively. On the contrary, the\
    \ lowest overall mean values were \nrecorded under water stress conditions in\
    \ the two growing seasons. \n \nKeywords: water stress, cowpea yield, , Water\
    \   productivity. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \nCowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp)\
    \ considers one of the most important \nvegetable legumes due to its high protein\
    \ content, heat tolerant, low fertilizer \nrequirements and can grow easily in\
    \ the new reclaimed lands. The protein \ncontent in cowpea seeds in high and rich\
    \ in amino acids, lysine and \ntryptophan compared to cereal grains. Therefore,\
    \ cowpea can be valued as a \nnutritional supplement to cereals especially in\
    \ the semi-arid region where \ncereals are the staple food and there is the menace\
    \ of nutritional disorders \nand food insecurity (El-Bably and El-Waraky, 2006).\
    \ The new cowpea \ncultivar, Kafr El-Sheikh-1 has a short growth period, an erect\
    \ and determinate \ngrowth habit and resistance to loading (Knany et al., 2002;\
    \ Masoud, 2002 and \nWaraky, 2007). \n \nIrrigation is a significant factor affecting\
    \ cowpea yield and its quality. \nThe irrigation number, amount and uniformity\
    \ water application are used \nmainly to determine the efficiency of irrigation\
    \ scheduling. Excessive doses of \ninfrequently applied water will lead to high\
    \ percolation losses. So, a large \namount of applied water will take their way\
    \ to drains, also, increasing \navailability of nutrients in the soil. So, it\
    \ is easy for these nutrients to find their \nway to drains; consequently, increase\
    \ amount of water will be polluted by \nthese nutrients, in addition to that bad\
    \ effects for increasing amounts of \napplied water on soil properties and hence,\
    \ affects badly plant growth. The \nwater saved by reducing drainage losses can\
    \ be used to obtained higher \nyields by giving additional application to irrigate\
    \ other farmlands or to store it \nas an insurance against the more severe periods\
    \ of drought. While, real time \nirrigation schedules can be used to maximize\
    \ the yield for a specific growing \nseason, they are less useful for planning\
    \ and management as simulation \nmodels (Adekalu, 2006 and Uarrato, 2010). \n\
    \ \nEl-Bably and El-Waraky (2006) and Lemma et al. (2009) reported \nthat the\
    \ highest irrigation rate 1.2 of ETc gave the highest values of plant \nheight,\
    \ number of leaves/plant, number of pods/plant, number of seeds/plant, \n100-seed\
    \ weight as well as the largest seed yield/plant, seed yield/fed. and \nprotein\
    \ content in percent, compared to irrigation at 1.0 and 0.8 of ETc. \nBecause\
    \ of limitation of irrigation water resources in Egypt, there is a strict \ncompetition\
    \ on water by the agriculture which uses about 85% from Egypt’s \nwater allocation,\
    \ domestic and industrial users during the dry season, hence, \nmaking rationalization\
    \ for using water in agriculture is becoming a must this \nplays an important\
    \ for saving  a large amount of water, it can be used in \nwatering other crops\
    \ or adding new areas which so-called horizontall \nexpansion. Adekalu and Okunade\
    \ (2006) and Kayombo et al. (2002) \nindicated that the crop water use efficiency\
    \ has been shown to depend on \nJ. Soil Sci. and Agric. Eng., Mansoura Univ.,\
    \ Vol. 4 (11), November, 2013 \n \n1291 \nirrigation amount and frequency, also,\
    \ the type of irrigation system and tillage \npractice can influence the water\
    \ use efficiency for a given irrigation \nfrequency. Byan et al. (2002) indicated\
    \ that water consumptive use (WCU) of \ncowpea amounted to 0.426, 0.532 and 0.639\
    \ m3m-2 when irrigated by 80, \n100, 120% of water calculated by class A Pan method,\
    \ respectively. Cowpea \ndoesn’t withstand water logged or flooded conditions.\
    \ Cowpea grows under a \nwide extreme of moisture conditions and once established\
    \ it is fairly drought \ntolerant. It is often grown in rainfed agriculture receiving\
    \ at least 24 inches \n(600 mm) annual rainfall or less if some minimal irrigation\
    \ is available. \n \nNitrogen fertilization, application of microbial inoculants\
    \ and following \nirrigation regime are important factors have a great effect\
    \ on cowpea yield as well \nas its quality. Application of nitrogen fertilizers\
    \ increased vegetative growth \ncharacters as well as yield and its components\
    \ of cowpea (Hussaini et al., 2004 \nand El-Bably and El-Waraky, 2006).  and Varughese\
    \ (2001), and El-Waraky and \nKasem (2007) indicated that cowpea plants fertilized\
    \ with 30 kg N/fed. produced \nthe greatest pods/yield, also, increasing nitrogen\
    \ fertilization level up to 40 kg \nN/fed. gradually increased cowpea plant growth,\
    \ yield and its components. Even \nthough, cowpea, a leguminous crops has the\
    \ ability to fix atmosphereic nitrogen, \nit requires a starter dose of nitrogen\
    \ for early growth and establishment. Hussaini \net al. (2004) reported that small\
    \ doses of applied nitrogen (from 30 to 40 kg \nN/fed.) may be synergistic and\
    \ stimulate nodulation and symbiotic fixation in \ncowpea and even improve seed\
    \ yield. \n \nApplication of microbial inoculants also considers one of the most\
    \ \nimportant factors affecting cowpea yield and quality, where it plays an \n\
    important role for increasing nodules number on roots (Blorowi and Focht, \n1981).\
    \ So, increasing plant ability to make fixation for atmospheric nitrogen, \ntherefore,\
    \ decreasing amount of mineral nitrogen applied and hence \ndecreasing fertilization\
    \ costs this is from one point and also increasing \nproductivity and quality.\
    \ Application of this kind of fertilizers has also a good \nbenefit to reduce\
    \ the bad effects for applying mineral fertilizers which make \npollution for\
    \ the soil and water and this makes a big problem for reusing of \ndrainage water\
    \ because it contaminates by a lot of pollutants. \n \nFor \nthe \nabovementioned\
    \ \nfacts \nabout \nirrigation, \napplication \nbiofertilizers and nitrogen. The\
    \ main targets for this present study were to: \n investigate water behavior\
    \ of cowpea under the studied area. \n study the effects of irrigation treatments\
    \ on yield, its components, quality \nand some water relationships. \n study\
    \ the effects of mineral and biofertilizers on yield, its components, \nquality\
    \ and some water relationships and  \n rationalize mineral fertilizers by using\
    \ biofertilizers \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \n \nTwo field experiments were\
    \ conducted at the Experimental Farm at Sakha \nAgricultural Research Station\
    \ during the two successive summer growing \nseasons 2012 and 2013 to investigate\
    \ the effect of water stress, biofertilizers \napplication and nitrogen rates\
    \ on cowpea yield, its components, nitrogen \nMoursi, E. A. et al. \n \n1292 \n\
    concentration, protein content and some water relations. The station is \nsituated\
    \ at 31o05` N latitude, 30o57`E longitude. It has elevation of about 6 \nmetres\
    \ above mean sea level (MSL). It represents the conditions of \ncircumstances\
    \ of the Northern Part of the Nile Delta region. Soil samples for \ndifferent\
    \ depths at the experimental site were collected at each (15 cm soil \ndepth)\
    \ up to 60 cm and analyzed for some physical characteristics (Table 1). \nOther\
    \ soil samples were taken from the same experimental site which were \ncollected\
    \ at each (15 cm soil depth) up to 60 cm and analyzed for some \nchemical characteristics\
    \ (Table 2). \nPhysical and chemical characteristics for the studied experimental\
    \ site: \n \nPhysical characteristics of the studied site such as soil field capacity\
    \ \n(FC) was determined at the site. permanent wilting point (PWP) and available\
    \ \nwater were determined according to James (1988) and soil bulk density were\
    \ \ndetermined according to (Klute, 1986). To study the soil texture, the particle\
    \ \nsize distribution was determined according to the international method (Klute,\
    \ \n1986),. The obtained results indicated that the soil texture is clayey. \n\

    \ and 2013, respectively. All farming practices were the same as \nrecommended\
    \ for the crop in the studied area except the studied parameters \n(irrigation\
    \ treatment), biofertilizers and mineral nitrogen application rates. The \nexperimental\
    \ plots were arranged in a split- split plot design with four \nreplicates in\
    \ both growing seasons. The main plots were randomly assigned \nby irrigation\
    \ treatments which were: \nA. \nMain treatments (Irrigation) \nI1 = \nControl\
    \ treatment without any water stress through the whole growing \nseason (like\
    \ local farmers practice in the studied area). \nI2 = \nWithholding one irrigation\
    \ at the vegetative growth stage, \nI3 = \nWithholding one irrigation at the flowering\
    \ growth stage and  \nI4 = \nWithholding one irrigation at the pod formation growth\
    \ stage. \nb. \nSub treatments(Mineral nitrogen application rates, N) \nN1 = Without\
    \ nitrogen fertilization (control treatment), \nN2 = Application of 15 kg N/fed.\
    \  \nN3 = Application of 30 kg N/fed. (this is the recommended dose for \ncowpea)\
    \ \nC. \nSub -Sub treatments (biofertilizers, Rhizobium bacteria) \nb1 = \nWithout\
    \ application of biofertilizers  \nb2 = \nApplication of biofertilizers (for the\
    \ soil after emergence). \n \nThe irrigation plot area is 70 m2 (7 m x 10 m),\
    \ the irrigation plots were \nisolated by ditches of 1.5 m in width to avoid lateral\
    \ movement of water. The \narea of biofertilizers treatment is 35 m2 (10 m x 3.5\
    \ m), while the area of \nmineral nitrogen application rates treatment is 3.5\
    \ m2 (1 m x 3.5 m). \nPhosphorus fertilization was used during seedbed preparation\
    \ in the form of \ncalcium superphosphate (15.5% P2O5) at rate of 100 kg/fed.\
    \ Cowpea seeds \nof Kafr El-Sheikh cultivar were inoculated by rhizobium bacteria\
    \ just before \nplanting. Planting process was performed in hills at 20 cm apart\
    \ on two sides \nof rows. Plants were thinned to two plants per hill after three\
    \ weeks  from \nplanting. At harvesting, ten plants were randomly chosen from\
    \ the fourth \ninner ridges to determine yield and yield components. Seed yield\
    \ was \ndetermined from central area to avoid the border effect. Seed yield of\
    \ cowpea \nwas adjusted at 12% moisture content.  \nSoil moisture content was\
    \ determined gravimetrically on oven dry basis \nbefore each irrigation and also\
    \ after irrigation with 48 hours and as well as at \nharvesting times. Four soil\
    \ samples were taken with a soil auger from four \nconsecutive layers, every 15\
    \ cm depth to total depth of 60 cm.  \nData collection: \n1. \nIrrigation water\
    \ applied (Wa): \n \nSubmerged flow orifice with fixed dimension was used to convey\
    \ and \nmeasure the irrigation water applied, as the following equation (Michael,\

    \                   Water consumptive use was calculated using the following \

    \ 48 hours after irrigation (on mass \nbasis, %). \n.  \nI \n= \nNumber of soil\
    \ layers each (15 cm) depth \n3. \nWater productivity (WP): \nIt was calculated\
    \ according to (Ali et al., 2007). \nWP = GY/ET. \nWhere WP (kg/m3), GY is grain\
    \ yield (kg/fed). \n and ET total water consumption of the growing season (m3/fed.)\
    \  \n4.          Productivity of applied irrigation water (PIW)     \n was calculated\
    \ as (Ali  et al., 2007) \nPIW= GY/I \n            Where I is irrigation water\
    \ applied (m3/fed.). \n \nTo make determination for nitrogen and phosphorus uptake,\
    \ the dried \nplant samples were grind and then wet digested according to the\
    \ method \ndescribed by Chapman and Pratte (1961). Total nitrogen percent in the\
    \ \ndigested was determined by using the modified Kjeldahl method (Cottenie et\
    \ \nal., 1982). Total phosphorus was determined using the calorimetric method\
    \ \n(Jackson, 1973). The protein content in cowpea grains was calculated by \n\
    multiplying nitrogen percent by 6.25. \nYield and yield components: \n1. \nSeed\
    \ yield (ardab/fed) \n2. \nPlant height (cm) \n3. \nNumber of branches/plant \n\
    4. \nNumber of leaves/plant \n5. \nNumber of pods/plant \n6. \nWeight of 100-seed\
    \ (g) \nStatistical analysis: \n \nAll data were statistically analyzed according\
    \ to the technique of \nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) as published by Gomez and\
    \ Gomez (1984). \nMeans of the treatments were compared b the least significant\
    \ difference \n(LSD) at 5% level of significance which developed by Waller and\

    \ November, 2013 \n \n1295 \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n1.Amount of seasonal\
    \ water applied: \n \nData presented in Table (3) clearly showed that the values\
    \ of cowpea \nseasonal water applied were affected by irrigation treatments in\
    \ the two \ngrowing seasons. The highest mean values through the two growing seasons\
    \ \nwere recorded under irrigation treatment I1 (traditional irrigation) comparing\
    \ \nwith other irrigation treatments (I2, I3 and I4) which exposed to water stress\
    \ \nthrough growth stages during the two growing seasons and the values are \n\
    2950 m3/fed (70.20 cm) and 2980 m3/fed. (70.95 cm) in the first and second \n\
    growing seasons, respectively. On the other hand, the lowest values for \ncowpea\
    \ seasonal water applied were recorded under irrigation treatment I4 \n(which\
    \ suffered from skipping one irrigation at pod formation growth stage) in \nthe\
    \ two growing seasons and the values are 2400 m3/fed. (57.1 cm) and \n2420 m3/fed.\
    \ (57.6 cm) in the first and second growing seasons, respectively. \nGenerally,\
    \ the values of seasonal water applied through the two growing \nseasons can be\
    \ descended in order I1>I2>I3>I4. Increasing the values of \nseasonal water applied\
    \ in the two growing seasons under irrigation treatment \n(I1, control treatment)\
    \ comparing with other irrigation treatments which \nexposed to water stress through\
    \ the two growing seasons (I2, I3 and I4) might \nbe due to increasing number\
    \ of irrigations under irrigation treatment (I1) in \ncomparison with (I2, I3\
    \ and I4). These results are in a great harmony with \nthose obtained by Ali et\
    \ al. (2007), Abou Kheira (2009), Uarrota (2010), El-\nAtawy and Kasem (2011)\
    \ and Ardel and Stephen (2012). \n \nTable (3): Effect of irrigation treatments\

    \ are presented in Table (4). \nThese values showed that the consumptive use of\
    \ cowpea was clearly \naffected by both irrigation treatments, biofertilizers\
    \ and nitrogen application \nrates in the two growing seasons. Concerning with\
    \ the effect of irrigation \ntreatments, the highest values were recorded under\
    \ irrigation treatments I1 \n(traditional irrigation) comparing with other irrigation\
    \ treatments (I2, I3 and I4 \nwhich exposed to water stress during the whole growing\
    \ season). The \nhighest overall mean values are 1823.3 and 1846.7 m3/fed. under\
    \ irrigation \ntreatment (I1) in the first and second growing seasons, respectively.\
    \ \nGenerally, the mean values of seasonal consumptive use can be descended \n\
    in order I1>I2>I3>I4 in the two growing seasons. Also, data in the same table\
    \ \nMoursi, E. A. et al. \n \n1296 \nshowed that the lowest mean values were recorded\

    \ comparing with other irrigation treatments (I2, I3 and I4) \nwhich exposed to\

    \ water applied under the conditions of this treatment as \npreviously mentioned\
    \ in water applied discussion, consequently, forming \nstrong plants with a thick\

    \ Consequently, increasing the mean values of \nwater consumptive use under the\
    \ conditions of irrigation treatment (I1) \ncomparing with other irrigation treatments\
    \ (I2, I3 and I4) which exposed to \nwater stress at different growth stages in\
    \ the two growing seasons. Also, \nthese results demonstrate that water consumptive\
    \ use increased as soil \nmoisture content was maintained high by increasing amount\
    \ of water applied \ndue to increasing number of irrigations. These findings are\
    \ in a close \nharmony with those obtained by Byan et al. (2002), Anitha et al.\

    \ the effect of irrigation treatments, the highest \nmean values were recorded\
    \ under stressed treatments (I2, I3 and I4) in the \ntwo growing seasons comparing\
    \ with non-stressed one (control). As shown in \nTable (5), the lowest overall\

    Under the conditions of this experiment, application of 30 kg N/fed. was \nenough\

    \ a result of increasing nitrogen rate of application might be directly attributed\
    \ to \nthe increase in pod number/plant, number of seeds/pod and 100 seed weight.\
    \ \nThese results seemed to be in accordance with those reported by Bin Ishag\
    \ \n(2003), Ardell and Stephen (2012) and Shahi (2012). They found that the soil\
    \ \napplication of N at the rate of 40 or 60 kg N/fed. gave the highest mean values\

    Title:  Optimization of irrigation water in South Africa for sustainable and beneficial
    use Authors:  Ikudayisi, Akinola Mayowa  Issue Date:  2017 Abstract:  Water is
    an essential natural resource for human existence and survival on the earth. South
    Africa, a water stressed country, allocates a high percentage of its available
    consumptive water use to irrigation. Therefore, it is necessary that we optimize
    water use in order to enhance food security.  This study presents the development
    of mathematical models for irrigation scheduling of crops,...       Description:  Submitted

    Tables Share Abstract With the advancement of computation and sensor technology,
    new strategies and tactics are being employed in the development of state-of-art
    operations tools in energy and water resources management. As agriculture is one
    of the sectors that consumes significant amount of energy and water, these cutting
    edge tools are particularly important for their management. While one strategy
    to save energy cost may come from the optimum pump operation considering peak
    and off-peak hours, the real energy reduction can result from monitoring the water
    conveyance system regularly and delivering the true water demand at optimum pressure
    requirement. Similarly, water consumption can be reduced by calculating the true
    water demand, using correct irrigation method, application time and frequency,
    and monitoring the conveyance system. This study proposes a framework to reduce
    energy and water usage in irrigation water distribution system (WDS) by quantifying
    correct crop water demands through utilization of soil moisture information, weather
    data, and hydraulics information including flow and pressure throughout the system.
    Results show that about 13 to 24% water savings is possible when feedback from
    soil moisture sensor is considered. Similarly, additional 10% water savings is
    possible if field capacity is considered to be the upper limit for irrigation
    which will save about 6% of pumping energy consumption. Formats available You

    \ \n1. Resumen \nEl cambio climático hará que la temperatura de la Tierra aumente\
    \ 2,2 ◦C de aquí a \n2040. Se prevé que este aumento de la temperatura del aire\
    \ vaya acompañado de una \nreducción de las precipitaciones, lo que aumentará\
    \ la intensidad y la frecuencia de los \nepisodios de sequía. Paralelamente, la\
    \ población mundial es más de tres veces mayor que \na mediados del siglo XX y\
    \ seguirá aumentando en los próximos años, lo que incrementará \nla demanda de\
    \ agua para la producción de alimentos. En la actualidad, la producción \nmundial\
    \ de alimentos mediante regadío representa más del 40 % del total y sólo utiliza\
    \ \nalrededor del 20 % de la superficie destinada a este fin. Los cítricos son\
    \ una de las \nprincipales especies cultivadas en todo el mundo, repartidas en\
    \ más de 140 países. Esta \nespecie depende del riego y tiene una demanda de agua\
    \ media-alta. Para hacer frente a la \nsequía, la agricultura de regadío se ve\
    \ obligada a realizar los máximos esfuerzos para \nmejorar la eficiencia en el\
    \ uso del agua.  \nEn este contexto, la presente tesis doctoral tiene como objetivo\
    \ evaluar la \nsostenibilidad del riego de precisión de cultivos de cítricos (pomelo\
    \ y lima), con especial \natención al estudio de la evapotranspiración del cultivo\
    \ (ETc) y al uso de indicadores del \nestado hídrico de suelo y planta. Para alcanzar\
    \ estos objetivos se han llevado a cabo varios \nexperimentos (Artículos del I\
    \ al IV).  \nUn buen conocimiento de la ETc es necesario para decidir \"cuándo\"\
    \ regar y \"cuánta\" \nagua aplicar. En el Artículo I, se calculó la ETc de limeros\
    \ jóvenes por el método del \nbalance hídrico del suelo utilizando lisímetros\
    \ de pesada. A lo largo del ciclo de cultivo, \nla ETc fue más alta en Julio (2,56\
    \ L planta-1día-1), debido al elevado consumo de agua \ndurante la última fase\
    \ de crecimiento del fruto. Cuando los cambios en la biomasa de la \nlima fueron\
    \ insignificantes, las variaciones en el peso de las macetas servían para validar\
    \ \nla ETc calculada por el método del balance hídrico (r2=0,92***). En este artículo,\
    \ se \npropone un prototipo de lisímetro de pesada escalable, sencillo y robusto,\
    \ para árboles \njóvenes cultivados en maceta, que proporciona una forma práctica\
    \ y rentable de medir la \nETc durante todo el año.  \nEn limeros jóvenes cultivados\
    \ al aire libre y bajo malla de sombreo se midieron \nindicadores discretos del\
    \ estado hídrico de la planta, como el potencial hídrico del tallo \n(Ψstem),\
    \ la conductancia estomática (gs) y la fotosíntesis neta (Pn), así como indicadores\
    \ \ncontinuos como la temperatura de la copa (Tc) (Artículos II y III). En el\
    \ Artículo II, el \nCHAPTER I: GENERAL ABSTRACT \n3 \n \nsombreado incrementó\
    \ un 54 y 37 % la gs y la Pn diaria acumulada, respectivamente. \nAdemás, bajo\
    \ malla se incrementó el Ψstem en 0,05 MPa y se redujeron los valores de la \n\
    diferencia de temperatura entre la copa y el aire (Tc-Ta) en 1,7 ◦C según los\
    \ Artículos II \ny III. Estos hechos apuntaron un mejor comportamiento fisiológico\
    \ de los limeros en \ncondiciones de sombreado. En el Artículo III, se evaluó\
    \ el efecto combinado del sistema \nde cultivo y el riego deficitario en los indicadores\
    \ de estado hídrico del suelo y de la \nplanta. Los resultados indicaron que cuando\
    \ el estrés hídrico del suelo fue moderado, las \ncondiciones de sombreado amortiguaron\
    \ el efecto negativo sobre el estado hídrico del \nsuelo y de la planta, permitiendo\
    \ posponer el déficit hídrico. Sin embargo, cuando el estrés \nhídrico del suelo\
    \ fue severo, se observaron valores igualmente bajos de estos indicadores \ntanto\
    \ en campo abierto como en condiciones de sombreado. Además, se proponen dos \n\
    nuevos índices basados en la Tc, que mostraron una respuesta diferente según el\
    \ sistema \nde cultivo y el tratamiento de riego considerado. \nLa programación\
    \ del riego basada en indicadores del estado hídrico del suelo y de \nla planta\
    \ permite ajustar la dosis de riego a las necesidades hídricas del cultivo. En\
    \ esta \ntesis, el riego de los limeros se gestionó automáticamente, en base a\
    \ valores umbrales del \ncontenido de agua del suelo medidos en la zona radicular\
    \ activa. El uso de este protocolo \nde riego promovió un estado hídrico óptimo\
    \ de la planta, como se observó en los limeros \ncultivados en maceta (Artículo\
    \ I) y en el suelo (Artículos II y III). En cuanto a los \nindicadores del estado\
    \ hídrico de la planta, la medida de la Tc a distancia y en tiempo real \nsupone\
    \ una gran ventaja para la gestión del riego. En este sentido, en el Artículo\
    \ III, se \npropusieron valores umbrales de la Tc-Ta de 2,4 y 0,8 ◦C para limeros\
    \ bien regados \ncultivados al aire libre y bajo malla de sombreo, respectivamente.\
    \ En el Artículo IV, se \nevaluó la robustez de varios índices basados en la Tc\
    \ para estimar la gs en pomelos adultos \nregados con diferentes cantidades (riego\
    \ completo y deficitario) y calidades de agua \n(trasvase y agua regenerada) de\
    \ riego durante dos estados fenológicos (floración-\nbrotación y crecimiento del\
    \ fruto). Además, se comprobó la capacidad de diferentes \níndices térmicos para\
    \ determinar la gs en diferentes intervalos de datos térmicos y en \ndiferentes\
    \ condiciones de déficit de presión de vapor (VPD) y de radiación \nfotosintéticamente\
    \ activa (PAR). Los resultados sugirieron que los índices térmicos y la \ngs tenían\
    \ el mayor grado de correlación cuando los datos térmicos se promediaron a 60\
    \ \nmin, a VPD entre 0 y 3,5 kPa, y a PAR 1200 μmol m-2 s-1. En estas condiciones,\
    \ los \nárboles con riego deficitario y los regados con agua regenerada fueron\
    \ los que mostraron \nCHAPTER I: GENERAL ABSTRACT \n4 \n \nlas mejores correlaciones\
    \ entre los índices térmicos y la gs. El índice de estrés hídrico del \ncultivo\
    \ (CWSI) y la Tc-Ta estimaron mejor la gs durante la floración-brotación, y los\
    \ \nvalores absolutos de Tc durante el estado fenológico de crecimiento del fruto,\
    \ \nindependientemente de la calidad y cantidad de agua aplicada. Esto indicó\
    \ que durante \nfloración-brotación la Tc dependía principalmente de las condiciones\
    \ climáticas más que \ndel estado hídrico de la planta, mientras que durante el\
    \ período de crecimiento del fruto \nla Tc estaba más influenciada por factores\
    \ intrínsecos de la planta (apertura estomática). \nEn general, los índices térmicos\
    \ han demostrado ser buenos indicadores del estado hídrico \nde la planta para\
    \ una gestión precisa del riego en cítricos. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCHAPTER I: GENERAL ABSTRACT \n5 \n \n2. Abstract \nIn the\
    \ coming years, climate change will cause the earth's temperature to rise 2.2\
    \ \n◦C by 2040. This increase in air temperature is expected to be accompanied\
    \ by a reduction \nin precipitation, which will increase the intensity and frequency\
    \ of drought events. In \nparallel, the world’s population is more than three\
    \ times larger than it was in the mid-\ntwentieth century. It will continue increasing\
    \ in the subsequent years, driving up water \ndemand for food production. Currently,\
    \ global food production from irrigation represents \nmore than 40 % of the total\
    \ and uses only about 20 % of the land area designated to this \nend. Citrus is\
    \ one of the main species cultivated worldwide, spread in more than 140 \ncountries.\
    \ This species is irrigation-dependent, and it has a medium-high water demand.\
    \ \nIn order to cope with this water scarcity, irrigated agriculture is forced\
    \ to make utmost \nefforts to improve water use efficiency.  \nIn this context,\
    \ this thesis is aimed to assess the sustainability of precise irrigation \nof\
    \ citrus crops (grapefruit and lime), with special attention to the study of crop\
    \ \nevapotranspiration (ETc) and the use of soil and plant water status indicators.\
    \ To achieve \nthese objectives several experiments were carried out (Articles\
    \ I to IV).  \nA sound knowledge of ETc is necessary to decide ‘when’ to irrigate\
    \ and ‘how much’ \nwater to apply. In Article I, young lime’s ETc was calculated\
    \ by soil water balance \nmethod using drainage-weighing pot-lysimeters. Along\
    \ the crop cycle, ETc was the \nhighest in July (2.56 L plant-1day-1), due to\
    \ the elevated water consumption during the \nlast fruit growth stage. When lime\
    \ tree biomass changes were negligible, pot weight \nvariations served for ETc-water\
    \ balance validation (r2=0.92***). A prototype of a simple \nand robust scalable\
    \ drainage-weighing lysimeter for young potted trees was proposed, \nwhich provided\
    \ a practical and cost-effective way to measure ETc throughout the year.  \nDiscrete\
    \ plant water status indicators, as stem water potential (Ψstem), stomatal \n\
    conductance (gs) and net photosynthesis (Pn), as well as continuous ones like\
    \ canopy \ntemperature (Tc) were measured on lime trees grown in shaded and in\
    \ open-field \nconditions (Articles II and III). In Article II, shading increased\
    \ by 54 and 37 % daily \naccumulated leaf gs and Pn, respectively. Moreover, in\
    \ shaded conditions Ψstem was \nincreased by 0.05 MPa and canopy to air temperature\
    \ difference (Tc-Ta) values were \nreduced by 1.7 ◦C according to Articles II\
    \ and III. These facts pointed to a better \nphysiological performance of lime\
    \ trees under shading conditions. In Article III, the \nCHAPTER I: GENERAL ABSTRACT\
    \ \n6 \n \ncombined effect of cropping system and deficit irrigation on soil and\
    \ plant water status \nindicators was evaluated. The results indicated that when\
    \ soil water stress was moderate, \nshading conditions cushioned the negative\
    \ effect on soil and plant water status, allowing \nto postpone water deficits.\
    \ However, when soil water stress was severe, similar low values \nof these indicators\
    \ were observed in open-field and in shaded conditions. Additionally, \ntwo new\
    \ thermal-based indices were proposed, which showed a different response by \n\
    cropping system-irrigation treatment considered. \nIrrigation scheduling based\
    \ on soil and plant water status indicators allows adjusting \nthe irrigation\
    \ dose to crop water needs. In this thesis, irrigation of lime trees was \nautomatically\
    \ managed, based on soil water content threshold values measured in the \nactive\
    \ root zone. This irrigation protocol promoted an optimal plant water status,\
    \ as \nproved in pot grown (Article I), and in field grown (Articles II y III)\
    \ lime trees. \nRegarding plant water status indicators, remote and real-time\
    \ Tc measurement supposes \na great advantage for irrigation management purposes.\
    \ In this sense, in Article III, Tc-Ta \nthreshold values of 2.4 and 0.8 ◦C were\
    \ proposed for full irrigated lime trees in open-field \nand shaded conditions,\
    \ respectively. In Article IV, the robustness of several thermal-\nbased indices\
    \ to estimate gs for different irrigation strategies (full and deficit irrigation),\
    \ \nwater sources (transfer and reclaimed water) and phenological stages (flowering-\n\
    sprouting and fruit growth) in grapefruit trees were evaluated. In addition, the\
    \ ability of \nthermal indices to determine gs at different averaged thermal data\
    \ intervals, vapour \npressure deficit (VPD) and photosynthetically active radiation\
    \ (PAR) conditions, was \ntested. The results suggested that thermal indices and\
    \ gs had the highest degree of \ncorrelation at 60 min thermal average data, VPD\
    \ between 0 and 3.5 kPa and PAR 1200 \nμmol m-2 s-1. In these conditions, trees\
    \ under deficit irrigation and those irrigated with \nreclaimed water showed the\
    \ best thermal indices-gs correlations. Crop water stress index \n(CWSI) and Tc-Ta\
    \ estimated gs better during flowering-sprouting (FS), and Tc during fruit \n\
    growth (FG), independently of quality of the irrigation source and the amount\
    \ of water \napplied. This fact indicated that in FS stage Tc depended mainly\
    \ on climatic conditions \nrather than on plant water status, whereas in FG stage\
    \ it was more influenced by intrinsic \nplant factors (stomatal opening). Overall,\

    CHAPTER II: OBJECTIVES \n8 \n \nOngoing climate change will disrupt the hydrological\
    \ cycle, which concurrently \nwith other factors will reduce the availability\
    \ of freshwater. Irrigation agriculture is the \nmain water consumer, accounting\
    \ for 70 % of the world’s freshwater. Thus, in this water \nscarcity context,\
    \ it is important to apply precision irrigation in order to supply crop water\
    \ \ndemand, reducing its negative effects. \nIn order to apply irrigation in a\
    \ precise way, an accurate knowledge of crop \nevapotranspiration is needed. Similarly,\
    \ the use of soil and plant water status indicators \nin the irrigation scheduling\
    \ also contributes to this purpose. Among these indicators, the \nones based on\
    \ the soil water content and canopy temperature continuous measurements \nallow\
    \ adjusting water applied in real-time supposing this a great advantage from an\
    \ \nirrigation management point of view.  \nIn the Mediterranean area, cropping\
    \ techniques, such as shading or irrigation \nstrategies, like regulated deficit\
    \ irrigation, have been proposed to increase water use \nefficiency. In line with\
    \ this, the use of alternative water sources, such as reclaimed water, \nalso\
    \ contributes to mitigate freshwater scarcity. The application of these techniques\
    \ and \nstrategies could affect plant and soil water status indicators behaviour,\
    \ so this issue needs \nto be studied before using these indicators for irrigation\
    \ management.  \nWithin this framework, this thesis aims to integrate novel multidisciplinary\
    \ \napproaches in the sustainability of precision irrigation of grapefruit and\
    \ lime trees (two \nCitrus sp. with an added value), grown in Mediterranean climate,\
    \ focussing on the study \nof crop evapotranspiration and the use of soil and\
    \ plant water status indicators. For this \npurpose, the following specific objectives\
    \ were proposed: \n● Determine the water requirements of young lime trees by real-time\
    \ monitoring of \nwater balance parameters in pot-lysimeters (Article I). \n●\
    \ Establish soil (Articles I, II, and III) and plant (Article III) water status\
    \ indicators \nthreshold values for precise irrigation scheduling of lime trees.\
    \ \n● Compare discrete plant water status indicators with continuous thermal-based\
    \ indices \nin lime and in grapefruit trees (Articles II, III and IV). \n● Assess\
    \ the effect of the cropping system (shaded vs. open-field) and soil water deficit\
    \ \non soil and lime tree water status (Articles II and III). \nCHAPTER II: OBJECTIVES\
    \ \n9 \n \n● Evaluate the effect of regulated deficit irrigation and reclaimed\
    \ water on the \nrobustness of thermal-based indices to estimate stomatal conductance\

    11 \n \n1. Citrus genus  \n1.1. Taxonomy and origin \nCitrus genus is one of the\
    \ most widely cultivated plants around the world (Wu et al., \n2018). This genus\
    \ is taxonomy classified into Geraniales Order (Inglese and Sortino, \n2019),\
    \ Rutaceae Family (Salvo et al., 2010) and Aurantioideae Subfamily (Morton et\
    \ al., \n2003). Most Citrus species belong to the cross of four ancestral species:\
    \ Citrus reticulata \n(mandarins), Citrus maxima (pummelos), Citrus medica (cidros)\
    \ and Citrus micrantha \n(Luro et al., 2017) (Figure 1). From an agronomic point\
    \ of view, the most important \nspecies are:  \n Clementine (C. clementina Hort.)\
    \  \n Grapefruit (C. paradisi Macf.) \n Key lime or Mexican lime (C. aurantifolia\
    \ (Christm.) Swing)  \n Lemon (C. limon (L.) Burn.) \n Mandarin (C. reticulata\
    \ Blanco) \n Persian lime or Tahiti lime (C. latifolia Tan.) \n Pummelo (C.\
    \ maxima (L.) Osb.)  \n Satsuma (C. unshiu (Mak.) Marc.) \n Sour orange (C.\
    \ aurantium L.)  \n Sweet orange (C. sinensis (L.) Osb.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    CHAPTER III: STATE OF THE ART \n12 \n \n \nFigure 1. Genetic origin of the main\
    \ Citrus species. Source: Luro et al. (2017). \n \nOver the years, several authors\
    \ have reported information on the geographical \norigin of Citrus species. Vavilov\
    \ (1927) identified two origin centres: the Indo-Burna \ncentre (Assam and Myanmar)\
    \ and the Indo-Malayan centre (Indochinese Peninsula and \nthe Malay Archipelago).\
    \ Swingle and Reece (1967) suggested that most important \ncultivars of true Citrus\
    \ appeared in an extensive region of Southeast Asia comprising: \nNortheast India,\
    \ Myanmar and Southeast China. Recently, Talon et al. (2020) reported \nthat the\
    \ origin of Citrus genus is in a broad area comprising India, Southeast Asia,\
    \ \nAustralasia, Melanesia, and Polynesia. \n \n1.2. Botanical traits \nCitrus\
    \ is an evergreen tree 3 to 6 m high. The underground part of the tree corresponds\
    \ \nto the root system, composed by: (i) the main taproot, which anchors the plant\
    \ to soil and \n(ii) lateral or secondary roots, responsible for the absorption\
    \ of water and nutrients \n(Ancillo and Medina, 2015). The aerial part of the\
    \ tree is formed by trunk and branches. \nTrunk is green and tender in young trees\
    \ and brown and more rigid in adult ones. Branches \nare brown, irregularly shaped\
    \ and often angled. These can be classified into primary and \nsecondary ones,\
    \ being leaves, flowers and fruits in the secondary ones. The leaf is \ncompound\
    \ by blade and petiole, which joins the blade with stem. Leaf blade is dark green\
    \ \nCHAPTER III: STATE OF THE ART \n13 \n \nin the top and light green in the\
    \ down. The shape of it can be elliptical, oval or lanceolate \ndepending on Citrus\
    \ species (Ancillo and Medina, 2015). The petiole is dark green and \nin some\
    \ species as grapefruit or sour orange is winged. In most cases, leaves contain\
    \ a \nsolitary thorn at the petiole-stem joint. Flowers, also called ‘azahar’\
    \ (Mazorra-Manzano \net al., 2013), are white or purple with a green calyx and\
    \ a corolla of five petals containing \n20 to 40 stamens. Fruit is a hesperidium\
    \ (Tadeo et al., 2008) composed by: the exocarp \nor flavedo (peel), mesocarp\
    \ or albedo and endocarp. The exocarp is rigid and contains \nessential oils and\
    \ the mesocarp is white and spongy (Tütem et al., 2020). The endocarp \ncomprises\
    \ juice vesicles (Inglese and Sortino, 2019), which contain sugars and organic\
    \ \nacids among other nutritional valuable substances. Some fruit characteristics,\
    \ such as \nnumber of seeds and peel colour, depend on Citrus species.  \n1.3.\
    \ Phenological stages \nPlants' phenological growth stages can be classified using\
    \ BBCH (Biologische \nBundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt and CHemische Industrie,\
    \ Germany) scale. This \nclassification system was proposed by Bleiholder et al.\
    \ (1989), and since then it has been \nwidely used to describe the phenological\
    \ stages of several herbaceous and woody crops \n(Lancashire et al., 1991; Pérez-Pastor\
    \ et al., 2004; Sanz-Cortés et al., 2002). Agustí et al. \n(1995) proposed the\
    \ BBCH scale for Citrus species, composed for the following principal \ngrowth\
    \ stages:  \n0: Sprouting/Bud development  \n1: Leaf development  \n3: Shoot development\
    \  \n5: Inflorescence emergence  \n6: Flowering (Figure 2) \n7: Development of\
    \ fruit (Figure 2) \n8: Maturity of fruit  \n9: Senescence, beginning of dormancy\
    \ \n \n \n \nCHAPTER III: STATE OF THE ART \n14 \n \n \nFigure 2. Main flower\
    \ and fruit phenological stages of Bearss lime tree (C. latifolia \nTan.). \n\
    \ \n \nThe main phenological stages can be grouped in vegetative and reproductive\
    \ \ndevelopment:  \n1.3.1. Vegetative development \nIn Mediterranean areas, citrus\
    \ vegetative growth is a discontinuous process, which \nincludes flush periods\
    \ alternating with phases of quiescence (Carvalho et al., 2020). This \nprocess\
    \ englobes the growth of shoots, leaves, roots and trunk. Shoots growth takes\
    \ place \nthrough sprouting, which, in Citrus species, occurs two to four times,\
    \ often three during \ncrop cycle. The first sprouting is the most important and\
    \ starts at the end of winter and \nlasts throughout spring (Arenas-Arenas et\
    \ al., 2021); the second one happens early in the \nsummer and the last one in\
    \ autumn. Leaves growth coincides with shoot elongation period \nand lasts two\
    \ months. Root growth initiates with the development of a primary root from \n\
    the radicular meristem of the embryo. As the main root lengthens, lateral roots\
    \ appear \nfrom the primary one. Trunk growth is vertical until it reaches the\
    \ height of about 1 m. \nThen, it emits lateral branches and on these the secondary\
    \ ones and so on.  \n1.3.2. Reproductive development \nCitrus is a profusely bloomy\
    \ species that can produce more than 250,000 flowers per \ntree (Agustí et al.,\
    \ 2022). In Mediterranean areas, the main flowering occurs in spring, \nand some\
    \ secondary flowerings may happen after autumn and summer flushes but with a \n\
    reduced number of flowers. Flowering comprises the following stages: flower-bud\
    \ \ninduction, bud differentiation and anthesis (Valiente and Albrigo, 2004).\
    \ The main \nflowering bud induction occurs in the second half of autumn and is\
    \ controlled by a \nCHAPTER III: STATE OF THE ART \n15 \n \nstimulation received\
    \ by the leaf that allows the transition from vegetative to reproductive \nstatus.\
    \ Later, the differentiation of these buds occurs by mid-winter (February) when\
    \ the \nbuds release from dormancy and primordia begin to grow. Subsequently flower\
    \ \ndevelopment takes place, and when the flowers are fully formed, its pollination\
    \ leads to \nfruit. Fruit growth follows a sigmoidal curve with three well differentiated\
    \ stages (Allen, \n1979; Kim et al., 2021). The first stage (stage I) is approximately\
    \ two months from \nanthesis to physiological fruit fall. It includes the phase\
    \ of cell division, which leads to \nthe increase in volume of the fruit endocarp,\
    \ and the formation of juice vesicles.  The \nstage II lasts several months (2\
    \ to 6 depending on Citrus species) and comprises the \nelongation cellular process\
    \ (Iglesias et al., 2007). The increase in fruit size in this stage is \nmainly\
    \ due to the development of locules or segments, which allow juice vesicles \n\
    reaching their final size. In the last stage of fruit development (stage III),\
    \ changes \nassociated to fruit maturation occur, fruit growth slows down and\
    \ peel colour change, \nbecause of chlorophyll degradation and an increase in\
    \ the carotenoid synthesis. Also, fruit \nsugar content reaches stable levels\
    \ in this stage (Batista-Silva et al., 2018).  \n1.4. Commercial varieties and\
    \ rootstocks \nCommercial citrus trees are composed by: i) variety, which comprised\
    \ the upper \npart of the trunk to the canopy, and ii) rootstock, referring to\
    \ the lower part of the trunk \nand roots. The main Citrus species cultivated\
    \ are sweet orange (C. sinensis), mandarin \n(C. reticulata), lemon (C. limon),\
    \ key lime or Mexican lime (C. aurantifolia), Persian \nlime or Tahiti lime (C.\
    \ latifolia) and grapefruit (C. paradisi). Lime and grapefruit trees, \nthe two\
    \ Citrus species studied in this thesis, are briefly described: \nLime is a natural\
    \ triploid result from a diploid gamete of C. aurantifolia 'Mexican' \nlime recombined\
    \ with a C. micrantha × C. medica hybrid (Rouiss et al., 2018). There are \nacid\
    \ and sweet lime cultivars. The most spread acid cultivars are the Mexican (C.\
    \ \naurantifolia) and Persian (C. latifolia). In this thesis, the variety of lime\
    \ studied is Persian \nor also called ‘Bearss’, in honour of J. T. Bearss, who\
    \ developed it in 1895 in California, \nUSA. Bearss trees are vigorous and spiny\
    \ (Figure 3) in comparison with the Mexican \nones (Singh et al., 2021). The fruits\
    \ are large with a green intense colour and a greenish \nyellow pulp. The total\
    \ soluble solids (TSS) of Bearss lime juice ranges between 7 to 9 \n◦Brix (Jittanit\
    \ et al., 2013) and its acidity is around 2 % (Bisen et al., 2012).  \nCHAPTER\
    \ III: STATE OF THE ART \n16 \n \n \nFigure 3. Five-year-old Bearss lime tree\
    \ (Citrus latifolia Tan.). \n \nGrapefruit is one of the most recently known commercial\
    \ Citrus species (De Moraes \net al., 2007). It was firstly described in 1750\
    \ by G. Hughes who called it the forbidden \nfruit of Barbados. This hybrid seems\
    \ to come from an accidental crossing event between \npummelo (C. maxima) and\
    \ sweet orange (C. sinensis) on these islands. For this reason, in \n1828 J. Macfayden\
    \ gave it the botanical name of Citrus x paradisi indicating its hybrid \norigin\
    \ (Scora et al., 1982). Grapefruit commercial varieties are divided in two groups:\
    \ \nwhite fleshed (Marsh) and pigmented (Ruby Red, Ruben Pink, Henderson, Ray\
    \ Ruby, \nStar Ruby, Rio Red among others) (Barry et al., 2020).  In this thesis,\
    \ the variety of \ngrapefruit studied is Star Ruby, which is one of the most commercial\
    \ red-fleshed varieties \ncultivated (Gentile et al., 2020). Star Ruby trees are\
    \ dense and medium size in comparison \nwith other grapefruit varieties (Hueso-Martín\
    \ and Cuevas-González, 2014) (Figure 4). \nThe fruit usually presents skin areas\
    \ with reddish colouration and an intense red pulp. The \nTSS of Star Ruby grapefruit\
    \ juice ranges between 8 to 10 ◦Brix, and its acidity is around \n1.8 to 2.4 %\
    \ (Romero-Trigueros et al., 2017b). \nCHAPTER III: STATE OF THE ART \n17 \n \n\
    \ \nFigure 4. Fourteen-year-old Star Ruby grapefruit trees (Citrus paradise Macf.).\
    \ \n \nIn citriculture, the selection of a good rootstock is a key factor, as\
    \ it affects fruit \nweight and quality (Aguilar-Hernández et al., 2020). Also,\
    \ rootstock influences plant \nresistance to biotic stresses as diseases and pests\
    \ and in the tolerance to abiotic stresses \nsuch as flooding, drought and cold\
    \ (Oustric et al., 2017). In Spain, prior to the arrival of \nthe citrus’s tristeza\
    \ virus (CTV), sour orange was the main rootstock used (Legua et al., \n2018).\
    \ Yet as a consequence of its high sensibility to this disease, the use of alternative\
    \ \nrootstocks is promoted. These are some of rootstocks used in citriculture:\
    \ \n‐ \nCitrus macrophylla is a hybrid of C. micrantha and C. medica (Curk et\
    \ al., 2016). \nThis rootstock induces vigorous trees with a high crop load, and\
    \ good-quality and \nlarge fruits (Bowman and Joubert, 2020). It is tolerant to\
    \ salinity as it excludes the \ntransport of saline ions (as Cl- and Na+) from\
    \ root to plant (Ruiz et al., 2018). This \nrootstock is also tolerant to boron\
    \ rich soils. Nevertheless, it is susceptible to \nsevere CTV strains, when it\
    \ is used in other varieties different to lemon. In turn, \nC. macrophylla is\
    \ sensitive to water deficit conditions in comparison with other \nrootstocks.\
    \ Despite this, this rootstock is commonly used in California, and it has \nbecome\
    \ popular in Spain and Morocco, where water with high salinity levels is \nused\
    \ for irrigation purposes. \n‐ \nCarrizo is used in the main citrus-producing\
    \ countries: Spain, South Africa, \nAustralia, California and Italy (Morales-Alfaro\
    \ et al., 2021). It provides a medium \ntree vigour and fruit size with an excellent\
    \ internal fruit quality, but a lower crop \nCHAPTER III: STATE OF THE ART \n\
    18 \n \nload than C. macrophylla. This rootstock is sensitive to salinity, soil\
    \ B enrichment \n(Aparicio-Durán et al., 2021) and chlorosis (Martínez-Cuenca\
    \ et al., 2016). \nHowever, it is more tolerant to deficit irrigation conditions\
    \ than C. macrophylla. \n‐ \nForner-Alcaide 5 (F-A 5) induces lower tree size\
    \ but higher yield than Carrizo. \nIt is resistant to CTV and nematodes and tolerant\
    \ to calcareous, salinity and \nflooded soils (Priyadarshan and Mohan-Jain, 2009).\
    \ \nOther rootstocks used in citriculture are Cleopatra Mandarin, Citrange Troyer,\
    \ \nCitrus volkameriana and Citrumelo CPB (González, 2017). In this thesis, the\
    \ rootstock \nused is C. macrophylla, due to its great resistance of soil salinity\
    \ and its high crop load \nand good-quality and large fruits. \n1.5. Citrus production\
    \ and exportations   \nCitrus species are widely cultivated in more than 140 countries\
    \ (Gentile et al., 2020). \nEurope is one of the main citrus producers with an\
    \ annual production of 11.8 Mt (FAO, \n2021). Spain is the European leader (Figure\
    \ 5), accounting for 58.7 % of the total citrus \nproduction (FAOSTAT, 2020).\
    \  In fact, in this country, the surface designated to this crop \nis 296477 ha,\
    \ being one of the most cultivated agricultural species (MAPA, 2021).    \n \n\
    Figure 5. Main European citrus producers in 2020. Source: Food and Agriculture\
    \ \nOrganization of the United Nations. Statistics division (FAOSTAT). \n \nSpanish\
    \ production of this crop is concentrated mainly in Comunidad Valenciana, \nRegion\
    \ of Murcia and Andalucia (MAPA, 2021). In the Region of Murcia, citrus is a key\
    \ \ncrop, comprising 54.1 % of the total production of woody trees (CREM, 2021)\

    \ Murcia in 2021. \nSource: Centro Regional de Estadística de Murcia (CREM). \n\
    \ \nIn the global context, lime and grapefruit are not the main Citrus species\
    \ cultivated \n(FAO, 2021). Despite this, Spanish grapefruit production is relevant,\
    \ accounting for 76.6 \n% of the total European production of this crop (FAOSTAT,\
    \ 2020). Additionally, \nproduction of lime in Spain, although scarce, has been\
    \ gaining importance in the last few \nyears (CIRAD, 2021). Currently, much of\
    \ Spanish grapefruit and lime production comes \nfrom the Region of Murcia (CARM,\
    \ 2020). In fact, grapefruit and lime production in the \nRegion of Murcia in\
    \ 2021 was 34999 and 820 t, respectively, being the highest in recent \nyears\
    \ (CREM, 2021) (Figure 7). \nIn Spain, citrus exportations (4043.9 kt) are more\
    \ significant than its importations \n(146.5 kt). Indeed, this country is Europe’s\
    \ leading exporter of this crop (FAOSTAT, \n2020). The Spanish citrus exportations\
    \ are destined principally to Germany and France, \nwith annual figures of 1105.6\
    \ and 787.6 kt, respectively (MAPA, 2021).  \n \nFigure 7. Grapefruit (A) and\

    \ III: STATE OF THE ART \n20 \n \nThe main Citrus species exported in Spain is\
    \ orange, comprising 44.1 % of the total \n(MAPA, 2021). The international trade\
    \ of grapefruit in this country is considerably lower \nthan the orange one, but\
    \ it accounts 91.9 % of the European trade of this crop. In turn, \nSpanish lime\
    \ exportations, even though marginal, are expected to increase in the coming \n\
    years (CIRAD, 2021). The Region of Murcia is the supplier of much Spanish grapefruit\
    \ \nand lime exported (CREM, 2021). \n2. Water management in a scarce context\
    \ \nThe on-going climate change context favours global warming especially in \n\
    Mediterranean areas. Nowadays, in these areas, average annual air temperature\
    \ (Ta) is \napproximately 1.5 ◦C higher than during the preindustrial period (1880-1899)\
    \ and is \nexpected to have increased 2.2 ◦C by 2040 (MedECC, 2019) (Figure 8).\
    \  \n \nFigure 8. Warming of the atmosphere (annual mean temperature anomalies\
    \ with respect \nto the period 1880-1899), in the Mediterranean Basin (blue lines,\
    \ with and without \nsmoothing) and for the globe (green lines, with and without\
    \ smoothing). Source: \nMediterranean Experts on Climate and Environmental Change\
    \ (MedECC). \n \nThis increase in Ta is expected to be accompanied by a reduction\
    \ of 10-20 % in \nprecipitations (IPCC, 2021), increasing the intensity and frequency\
    \ of drought events. In \nthe Region of Murcia, this water scarcity scenario will\
    \ be aggravated, since mean annual \nTa is already up to 18 ◦C and precipitation\
    \ is already low, being less than 400 mm per \nyear (SIAM, 2021).  \nIn parallel,\
    \ the world population is more than three times larger than it was in the \nmid-twentieth\
    \ century (UN, 2022), driving up the demand of water for food production. \nAgricultural\
    \ production is highly dependent on water availability to ensure an optimal \n\
    crop yield and fruit quality (Capra et al., 2011; Iniesta et al., 2009). Therefore,\
    \ in this \nCHAPTER III: STATE OF THE ART \n21 \n \nwater scarcity context, it\
    \ is key to increase the precision of irrigation in agriculture, to \navoid negative\
    \ effects on the crops. In this sense, scheduling irrigation based on water \n\
    status indicators contributes to this end. \n2.1. Water status indicators \nWater\
    \ flows from soil to atmosphere throughout the plant, which has been termed \n\
    soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) (Philip, 1966). Knowledge of where and\
    \ how \nmuch water is available at each point of the SPAC can be explained by\
    \ soil and plant \nwater status indicators. The most commonly used are described\
    \ below. \n 2.1.1. Soil-based water status indicators \nThe soil water status\
    \ can be assessed by the gravimetric method. This method \nconsists in taking\
    \ a soil sample and weighing it, oven drying, and after that reweighs again \n\
    (Lunt et al., 2005). The water content in the soil sample is expressed as the\
    \ weight loss. \nTraditionally, the gravimetric method has been widely used in\
    \ the determination of soil \nmoisture. Nevertheless, the use of this method has\
    \ numerous disadvantages like, it does \nnot permit measuring soil moisture on\
    \ a continuous basis and it is destructive and time-\nconsuming.  \nSoil moisture\
    \ can be also measured with neutron probes, which has numerous \nadvantages as\
    \ the high speed and accuracy of its measurements (Yu et al., 2021). \nHowever,\
    \ radiation hazards to health and certain safety concerns limit the use of these\
    \ \nprobes in agriculture. The use of soil water content or soil matric potential\
    \ sensors allows \ndetermining real-time monitoring the soil water status (Vera\
    \ et al., 2021).   \n2.1.1.1. Soil water content \nSoil water content (SWC) sensors\
    \ measure soil moisture indirectly based on the soil \ndielectric constant or\
    \ in the H+ content. Nowadays, SWC sensors most used in agriculture \nare based\
    \ on the real soil dielectric constant, estimated by frequency domain reflectometry\
    \ \n(FDR) and time domain reflectometry (TDR) (Table 1). \nFDR sensor operation\
    \ is based on the study conducted by Hilhorst et al. (1996). \nThese sensors measure\
    \ the SWC indirectly by determining the bulk dielectric constant \nfrom frequency\
    \ variations of an electromagnetic pulse propagated into the soil (Hardie, \n\
    2020). One drawback in the use of these sensors is that their calibration process\
    \ is more \nextensive than the TDR ones, due to the complexity of generating an\
    \ electrical field for \nthe different soil types. Despite this, they are currently\

    irrigation scheduling in agriculture (Conesa et al., 2021; Gasque et al., 2016;\
    \ Martí et al., \n2013). Instances of these sensors are Theros, EnviroSCAN, EnviroPro\
    \ among others \n(Table 1). \n The theoretical background of TDR sensors is based\
    \ on the research conducted by \nFellner-feldegg (1968). These sensors determine\
    \ soil dielectric permittivity by measuring \nthe delay in time between the incident\
    \ and reflected electromagnetic pulses (Suchorab et \nal., 2014). The travel time\
    \ of the wave through the sensor is a function of the apparent or \neffective\
    \ permittivity of bulk soil. This travel time is translated to SWC by using the\
    \ \nTopp’s equation (Topp et al., 1980). Currently, TDR sensors are also widely\
    \ accepted for \nagricultural irrigation management (Datta et al., 2018; Marković\
    \ et al., 2021). TDR 315H \nand SoilVUE are examples of TDR sensors (Table 1).\

    \ potential \nSoil matric potential (SMP) sensors measure soil moisture as a function\
    \ of the force \nwith which water is held by the soil matrix (Kukal et al., 2014).\
    \ The SMP can be measured \nusing tensiometers, gypsum blocks or granular matrix\
    \ among other sensors (Hardie, \n2020). The tensiometer consists of a porous cup,\
    \ generally of ceramic material, connected \nthrough a tube to a manometer. Its\
    \ low price makes this sensor one of the most widely \nused in the agricultural\
    \ sector for the measure of SMP (Montesano et al., 2015). Yet, the \nuse of tensiometers\
    \ for irrigation purposes has disadvantages such as its high \nmaintenance, its\
    \ bad performance in dry soil conditions (Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2005) and \nits\
    \ limited measurement range (Menne et al., 2022). Granular matrix sensors are\
    \ an \nadaptation of the gypsum block ones, since they consist of two electrodes\
    \ located above \na gypsum wafer, embedded within a granular fill matrix. They\
    \ are simple to use and \ninstall, require a low maintenance (Jabro et al., 2020)\
    \ and are a robust and reliable way \nto measure SMP (Irmak and Haman, 2001; Nolz\
    \ et al., 2013; Vellidis et al., 2008). One \nof the granular matrix sensors commonly\
    \ used is the Watermark (Irrometer Co. \nCalifornia, USA). \n \n2.1.2. Plant-based\
    \ water status indicators \nPlant itself has long been recognized as the best\
    \ indicator of its water status. Plant \nwater status can be evaluated by direct\
    \ measurements of leaf (Ψleaf) and stem (Ψstem) water \npotentials or indirectly\
    \ by measuring leaf gas exchange (stomatal conductance (gs), net \nphotosynthesis\
    \ (Pn)), trunk diameter shrinkage, sap flow, leaf turgor or canopy \ntemperature\
    \ (Tc) (Fernández, 2017). \n2.1.2.1. Water potential \nWater potential (Ψ) is\
    \ closely related with plant water status. Traditionally, Ψ is \nmeasured with\
    \ a pressure chamber (Figure 9), according to Turner (1988). This method \nconsists\
    \ in measuring the hydrostatic pressure (with negative sign) contained in the\
    \ xylem \nof the plant (Scholander et al., 1964), so, the more negative the Ψ\
    \ values are, the worse \nthe plant water status is. \nCHAPTER III: STATE OF THE\
    \ ART \n25 \n \n \nFigure 9. Pressure chamber (model 3000, Soil Moisture Equipment\
    \ Corp. Santa Barbara, \nCA, USA). \n \nΨ varies along the day, depending not\
    \ only on the meteorological conditions (Suter \net al., 2019) (Figure 10), but\
    \ also according to other factors as leaf position and age \n(Syvertsen, 1982).\
    \ In a diurnal time-course some variants of Ψ can be measured: predawn \nwater\
    \ potential (Ψpredawn) and midday leaf (Ψleaf) and stem (Ψstem) water potential.\
    \ The \nΨpredawn is measured before sunrise when plant and soil water content\
    \ are in equilibrium \n(Jones, 2007). Ψleaf and Ψstem are measured at midday,\
    \ when the meteorological conditions \nare more demanding. The Ψleaf is measured\
    \ in sunny leaves without covering, whereas \nΨstem is measured in shaded leaves\
    \ which are enclosed in an aluminium bag prior to its \nmeasure (McCutchan and\
    \ Shackel, 1992). Between both variants of Ψ, Ψstem measures \nare less sensitive\
    \ to changes in meteorological conditions than Ψleaf ones.  \n \nFigure 10. Typical\
    \ diurnal time-course of stem water potential (Ψstem) in Citrus species.\n \n\

    -0.50\n-0.25\n0.00\nCHAPTER III: STATE OF THE ART \n26 \n \nNowadays, Ψ is recognized\
    \ as a robust plant water status indicator for irrigation \nmanagement purposes\
    \ (García-Tejera et al., 2021) in several tree crops like olive (Shackel \net\
    \ al., 2021), peach (Mirás-Avalos et al., 2016a) or nectarine (De la Rosa et al.,\
    \ 2013). \nWith this purpose, baselines between Ψstem and meteorological variables\
    \ as reference \nevapotranspiration, solar radiation, vapour pressure deficit\
    \ and air temperature have been \nestablished in several fruit crops (Conejero\
    \ et al., 2011; Conesa et al., 2016; Ortuño et al., \n2006). Besides, different\
    \ Ψstem threshold values have been proposed for scheduling \nirrigation in several\
    \ crops and their effect on some agronomic traits were also studied. \nFor instance,\
    \ in peach it was observed that irrigated at Ψstem threshold values ranged \n\
    between -1.5 and -1.8 MPa during fruit growth and between -1.5 and -2.0 MPa during\
    \ \npostharvest period, being reduced vegetative growth of trees, without affect\
    \ yield and \nimproving fruit quality (Mirás-Avalos et al., 2016a). Additionally,\
    \ in mandarin, irrigation \nscheduling based in the threshold value of Ψstem of\
    \ -1.8 MPa during phase II of fruit \ngrowth did not affect negatively crop yield\
    \ (Berríos et al., 2022). \n2.1.2.2. Leaf gas exchange \nLeaf gas exchange refers\
    \ to the rate of water vapour going out through stomata, the \nstomatal conductance\
    \ (gs), and the CO2 entering stomata, the net photosynthesis (Pn). \nUsually,\
    \ it is measured using a porometer or a portable photosynthesis system (Figure\
    \ \n11).  \n \nFigure 11. Portable photosynthesis system (model LI-6400, LI-COR,\
    \ Lincoln, NE, \nUSA). \n \nThe gs may be affected by changes in the soil water\
    \ status, in such a way that under \noptimal soil water conditions stomatal aperture\
    \ is favoured, while under soil water deficit \nstomatal closing is promoted (Devi\
    \ and Reddy, 2020).  Indeed, meteorological conditions \nCHAPTER III: STATE OF\
    \ THE ART \n27 \n \nalso have an influence in gs measurements (Struthers et al.,\
    \ 2015), showing maximum \nvalues early in the morning and in the evening hours,\
    \ when vapor pressure deficit (VPD) \nis soft, and minimum values at midday when\
    \ the VPD is the highest (Figure 12). \nAdditionally, plant hormones like abscisic\
    \ acid (Castro et al., 2019) and crop \nphenological stage (Romero-Trigueros et\
    \ al., 2014) are also involved in the stomatal \nresponse.  \nLeaf gs is related\
    \ with leaf Pn, in such a way that stomata regulate CO2 input, and \nthen, photosynthesis\
    \ process (Urban et al., 2017). In a diurnal course, Pn, shows a similar \ntrend\
    \ to gs (Figure 12).  \n \nFigure 12. Typical diurnal time-course of stomatal\
    \ conductance (gs) in Citrus species. \n \nLeaf gas exchange (gs and Pn) is considered\
    \ a good plant water status indicator in \nseveral woody crops (Rodriguez-Dominguez\
    \ et al., 2019; Spinelli et al., 2016) and in \nCitrus species (Pérez-Pérez et\
    \ al., 2009; Romero-Trigueros et al., 2021a). In olive trees, \nit was reported\
    \ that it is possible to schedule irrigation from automated estimations of gs,\
    \ \nensuring an adequate soil water status and avoiding any hard effect on olive\
    \ yields \n(Hernandez-Santana et al., 2019). Ramírez et al. (2016) also confirmed\
    \ that gs \nmeasurements could be appropriate to irrigation scheduling in potatoes.\
    \ In Citrus species, \nless information exists relative to the use of gs in the\
    \ irrigation scheduling. Despite this, \noptimal gs values of several Citrus species\
    \ are known (Conesa et al., 2018; Pedrero et al., \n2015) and could be used with\
    \ irrigation management purposes. \nSolar time\n  1:00   5:00   9:00  13:00  17:00\

    28 \n \n2.1.2.3. Canopy temperature \nCanopy temperature (Tc) is an indirect measurement\
    \ of the degree of stomatal \naperture (Iseki and Olaleye, 2020; Leinonen et al.,\
    \ 2006) and then, to the plant water \nstatus (Jackson, 1982). In such a way that,\
    \ when stomatal aperture is favoured, an increase \nin leaf cooling is observed,\
    \ decreasing its temperature. In contrast, when stomatal closing \nis promoted,\
    \ a reduction in leaf refrigeration occurs and consequently an increase in its\
    \ \ntemperature. In this way, Tc is a good plant water status indicator in Citrus\
    \ species \n(González-Dugo et al., 2014; Romero-Trigueros et al., 2019) but also\
    \ in other crops \n(Belfiore et al., 2019; Khorsandi et al., 2018).  \nTc can\
    \ be in-situ or remotely measured using infrared radiometer sensors (Figure \n\
    13) or thermal cameras. This plant water status indicator presents numerous advantages\
    \ \nrespect to the traditional ones (Ψ and gs), since it allows us to study a\
    \ large population of \nleaves (Bellvert et al., 2016), its measures are easily\
    \ extrapolated from leaf to field scale \n(González-Dugo et al., 2014) and its\
    \ a rapid and non-destructive technique to monitor \nplant water status (Blaya-Ros\
    \ et al., 2020).  \n \nFigure 13. Infrared radiometer sensors (model SI-431, Apogee\
    \ Instruments, Inc., Logan, \nUT, USA). \n \nIn a diurnal course, Tc fluctuates\
    \ with maximum values at midday, when the air \ntemperature (Ta) is the highest,\
    \ and minimal at the beginning and at the end of the day, \ncoinciding with the\
    \ lowest values of Ta (Figure 14). To attenuate the effect of \nmeteorological\
    \ conditions on the absolute values of Tc, several thermal canopy indices \nhave\
    \ been proposed, as canopy to air temperature difference (Tc-Ta) and the crop\
    \ water \nstress index (CWSI) (Idso et al., 1981).  \nCHAPTER III: STATE OF THE\
    \ ART \n29 \n \n \nFigure 14. Typical diurnal time-course of canopy temperature\
    \ (Tc) in Citrus species. \n \nCWSI is calculated according to the equation: \n\
    ܥܹܵܫ ൌ \nሺ்೎ି்ೌሻି ሺ்೎ି்ೌሻ௅௅\nሺ்೎ି்ೌሻ௎௅ି ሺ்೎ି்ೌሻ௅௅ \n \n \n(1) \nWhere, Tc-Ta is\
    \ the measured canopy to air temperature difference, and (Tc-Ta)LL \nand (Tc-Ta)UL,\
    \ correspond with the lower and upper limit of (Tc-Ta), respectively. (Tc-\nTa)LL\
    \ is equivalent to a canopy transpiring at the potential rate. Graphically, it\
    \ can be \nrepresented as a linear relationship between Tc-Ta and VPD for well\
    \ irrigated trees. (Tc-\nTa)UL corresponds to a canopy which transpiration has\
    \ ceased and can be obtained as the \nmaximum Tc-Ta value recorded in the stressed\
    \ trees (Yang et al., 2021) or as a value \nrelated with Ta (Sepaskhah and Kashefipour,\
    \ 1994). \nOne of the potential applications of thermal-based indices in agriculture\
    \ includes \nits use in irrigation scheduling (Ishimwe et al., 2014). In this\
    \ sense, Akkuzu et al. (2013) \nestablished in olive trees the CWSI threshold\
    \ value of 0.4 for an optimal irrigation \nmanagement. Additionally, Erdem et\
    \ al. (2005) suggested the CWSI threshold value of \n0.6 as the optimal for irrigation\
    \ initiation in watermelon. In peach, Zhang et al. (2017) \nestablished different\
    \ Tc-Ta thresholds values ranging between -5 to 3 ◦C to schedule \nirrigation\
    \ during the post-harvest period. In Citrus species, Ballester et al. (2013) \n\
    observed that values of Ψstem around -1.0 MPa, indicatives of an absence of plant\
    \ water \nstress, correspond with the Tc-Ta threshold value of 1 ◦C. \nSolar time\n\

    \ III: STATE OF THE ART \n30 \n \n2.1.2.4. Other plant water status indicators\
    \ \n● Trunk diameter variations \nAnother indirect plant water status indicator\
    \ is the trunk diameter variations (TDV). \nIn a daily performance, trunk diameter\
    \ experiments cycles of shrinkage and dilatation. \nThus, during light hours,\
    \ when climatic conditions are more demanding, water loss by \ntranspiration is\
    \ higher than root water uptake, resulting in a movement of water phloem \nto\
    \ xylem and a trunk shrinkage. On the contrary, at night hours, when climatic\
    \ conditions \nare smoother, there is a water movement from xylem to phloem resulting\
    \ in a trunk \ndilatation. These micro-variations in the trunk diameter can be\
    \ continuous and \nautomatically measured using dendrometers. From the TDV measurements\
    \ several \nindices can be calculated, one of the most widely used is the maximum\
    \ daily shrinkage \n(MDS) proposed by Goldhamer and Fereres (2001). This index\
    \ is calculated as the \ndifference between the maximum (MXTD) and minimum (MNTD)\
    \ trunk diameter daily \nvalues. The use of MDS for irrigation management has\
    \ been evaluated with good results \nin several crops ( Fernández and Cuevas,\
    \ 2010; Mirás-Avalos et al., 2017, 2016b; Ortuño \net al., 2010). \n● Sap flow\
    \ \nSap flow is an indicator of plant water needs/status as it can estimate transpiration\
    \ \nrate (Lu et al., 2002; Smith and Allen, 1996; Venturin et al., 2020) as the\
    \ water loss by \nthe plant in a continuous way. Several methods to calculate\
    \ sap flow exist; one of the \nmost used is the heat-pulse technique (Green and\
    \ Clothier, 1988). This method consists \nin emitting a heat pulse, measuring\
    \ the time it takes to register the same temperature in \nthe probes installed\
    \ at both sides of the heater. Subsequently, this time delay is used to \ncalculate\
    \ sap velocity and then, sap flow according to Cohen et al. (1981). This plant\
    \ \nwater status indicator is proposed as suitable to be used with irrigation\
    \ scheduling \npurposes by several authors (González-Altozano et al., 2008; Nicolás\
    \ et al., 2008; Ortuño \net al., 2005).  \n● Leaf turgor \nLeaf turgor also has\
    \ been proposed as a predictor of plant water status in several \nwoody crops\
    \ like olive (Padilla-Díaz et al., 2018), clementine (Ballester et al., 2017)\
    \ and \npersimmon (Martínez-Gimeno et al., 2017). It is measured with ZIM-probe\
    \ as the \npressure transfer through a patch of an intact leaf, which is inversely\
    \ correlated with the \nturgor pressure (Zimmermann et al., 2008). The sensor\
    \ consists of two stamps equipped \nCHAPTER III: STATE OF THE ART \n31 \n \nwith\
    \ a magnet. One of the two stamps contains a sensitive pressure sensing-element,\
    \ \nwhich sends the detected pressure changes to the transmitter. The use of the\
    \ ZIM-probe \npresents great advantages as it is a non-invasive technique that\
    \ allows continuous \nmonitoring of the plant water status (Fernández, 2017).\
    \ These sensors have been used in \nirrigation management approaches (Barriga\
    \ et al., 2022; Padilla-Díaz et al., 2016). \n2.2. Water use efficiency techniques\
    \ and strategies \nIn the current water scarce context, cropping techniques, as\
    \ shading, or irrigation \nstrategies, like regulated deficit irrigation, have\
    \ been proposed to increase water use \nefficiency in Mediterranean areas. Moreover,\
    \ the use of alternative water sources such as \nreclaimed water also contributes\
    \ to mitigate the freshwater shortage problem. The usage \nof these techniques\
    \ and strategies could affect plant and soil water status indicators \nbehaviour,\
    \ so this issue needs to be studied before using these indicators for precise\
    \ \nirrigation management. \n2.2.1. Shading technique \nShading is a cropping\
    \ system that protects crops against abiotic (e.g. extreme \nmeteorological conditions:\
    \ high temperature or radiation) and biotic (e.g. diseases and \npest) stresses\
    \ (Mditshwa et al., 2019). It is performed by covering the trees with a net \n\
    (Figure 15). The efficiency of the net is influenced by its shading factor, which\
    \ is a \ncommercial parameter that refers to the ability of it to absorb or reflect\
    \ solar radiation \n(Manja and Aoun, 2019). This factor depends on the colour\
    \ and the material of the net \namong other characteristics (Castellano et al.,\
    \ 2008). In general, most agricultural shade \nnets are white (Tinyane et al.,\
    \ 2018) (Figure 15), but black, blue and other colours are \nalso used. Net materials\
    \ used can be high-density polyethylene (Wachsmann et al., 2014) \nor aluminate\
    \ (García-Sánchez et al., 2015) among others. \nCHAPTER III: STATE OF THE ART\
    \ \n32 \n \n \nFigure 15. White high-density polyethylene shade net house with\
    \ a zig-zag roof. \n \nThis cropping technique modifies microclimate surrounding\
    \ the plants by inducing \nchanges in air temperature, relative humidity, wind\
    \ speed and the incoming \nphotosynthetically active radiation (PAR). For instance,\
    \ Alaphilippe et al. (2016) found \na decrease in PAR radiation by 15 % in a pear\
    \ orchard cultivated under Altocarpo-nets. \nWachsmann et al. (2014), observed\
    \ a decrease in the wind speed by 80-90 % in ‘Ori’ \nmandarin cultivated under\
    \ red net. These microclimate modifications affect the plant \nwater status indicators\
    \ behaviour. Thus, in apple trees grown under photo-selective blue \nnetting,\
    \ an increase of 28 % in the net photosynthesis was observed (Bastías et al.,\
    \ 2012). \nIn ‘Pera’ orange, shading induced higher gs and CO2 assimilation rates\
    \ than in open-field \nconditions (Medina et al., 2002). The use of netting also\
    \ induces changes in other plant \nwater status indicators such as Tc. Thus, Blakey\
    \ et al. (2016) observed an increase in Tc \nin ‘Carmen-Hass’ avocado trees grown\
    \ under white netting. In contrast, Jifon and \nSyvertsen (2003) reported in ‘Ruby\
    \ Red’ grapefruit trees cultivated under aluminized \nscreen a decrease in Tc,\
    \ in comparison with the grown in open-field conditions.  \nAgronomic traits as\
    \ vegetative growth of trees can also be affected by the cropping \nsystem. In\
    \ this sense, Iglesias and Alegre (2006) observed an increase in the trunk \n\
    diameter growth in shaded apple trees. Other vegetative parameters like height\
    \ also \nresulted positively affected by this cropping system, as pointed out\
    \ by García-Sánchez et \nal. (2015) and Gimeno et al. (2015) in ‘Fino 49’ lemon\
    \ trees. In addition, Incesu et al. \n(2016) reported an increase in the leaf\
    \ number of ‘Lane Late’ orange trees growing under \nshade net.  \nCHAPTER III:\
    \ STATE OF THE ART \n33 \n \nProductive parameters such as yield and fruit quality,\
    \ could also be influenced by \nthe cropping system. This statement was confirmed\
    \ in the avocado crop, in which shaded \nconditions induced a higher yield than\
    \ in open-field ones (Tinyane et al., 2018). The \npositive effect of shading\
    \ in yield was also reported in Citrus species, like ‘Ori’ mandarin, \nin which\
    \ was observed an increase of 17.3 kg per tree under netting (Wachsmann et al.,\
    \ \n2014). This cropping system also affects positively external fruit quality\
    \ traits as fresh \nweight (Meena et al., 2016) and internal fruit quality parameters\
    \ as sugar content (total \nsoluble solids) (Otero et al., 2011). \n2.2.2. Regulated\
    \ deficit irrigation \nDeficit irrigation is an irrigation strategy, which consists\
    \ in the application of water \nbelow crop evapotranspiration (ETc) requirements\
    \ (Fereres and Soriano, 2007). Under the \ndeficit irrigation term, several strategies\
    \ are included such as regulated deficit irrigation \n(RDI) and partial root-zone\
    \ drying (PRD) (Amorim et al., 2021; Ruiz-Sanchez et al., \n2010). RDI consists\
    \ in applying restrictions in the water supply when the sensitivity of \nplant\
    \ to water stress is the minimum and fulfil irrigation during the critical phenological\
    \ \nperiods (Pedrero et al., 2015). This irrigation strategy was firstly applied\
    \ in Australia by \nChalmers et al. (1981) in order to control the vegetative\
    \ growth of peach trees. Nowadays, \nthis irrigation strategy has been successful\
    \ applied in many fruit and nut tree species such \nas almond (Goldhamer and Viveros,\
    \ 2000), pistachio (Goldhamer and Beede, 2004), \ncitrus (Gasque et al., 2016),\
    \ apple (Ebel et al., 1995), apricot (Ruiz-Sánchez et al., 2000), \nolive (Moriana\
    \ et al., 2003), cherry (Blanco et al., 2019) and peach (Ruiz-Sánchez et al.,\
    \ \n2018). \nReductions in the irrigation doses induce modifications in the plant\
    \ water status. In \nthis sense, deficit irrigation conditions promoted a decrease\
    \ of Ψstem values in mandarin \ntrees (Conesa et al., 2018). In grapefruit trees,\
    \ Romero-Trigueros et al. (2017a) observed \nthat irrigated at 50 % of ETc during\
    \ the phase II of fruit growth caused a reduction by 11 \n% in Ψstem values respect\
    \ to the control trees. Besides, lowering in the irrigation dose \naffects negatively\
    \ soil water status promoting a decrease in the gs (Amorim et al., 2021; \nPérez-Pérez\
    \ et al., 2009) and intercellular CO2 (Miranda et al., 2021), limiting \nphotosynthetic\
    \ capacity of trees. \nAgronomic traits as vegetative growth is soil water availability\
    \ dependent. In this \nsense, Ballester et al. (2014) observed a reduction by\
    \ 19 % in trunk growth rate in RDI \nCHAPTER III: STATE OF THE ART \n34 \n \n\
    ‘Clementina de Nules’ mandarin trees. In line with this, Pérez-Pérez et al. (2016)\
    \ reported \nin lemon trees a decrease in the trunk growth rate by 44 % because\
    \ of irrigating at 25 % \nof ETc along the crop cycle except during the phase\
    \ II of fruit growth when trees were \nfully irrigated.  \nDealing with crop yield,\
    \ reductions of 20-40 % of irrigation dose during ripening \nstages did not significantly\
    \ affect mandarin yield (Conesa et al., 2018). Similarly, \nGonzález-Dugo et al.\
    \ (2018) observed that reductions by 50-55 % n the irrigation doses \nduring summer\
    \ months (mid-June to early September) had a minimal effect on mandarin \nand\
    \ orange yield. In addition, García-Tejero et al. (2010) reported that yield was\
    \ not \nstatistically different between RDI and control treatments. Respect to\
    \ fruit quality a \npositive effect was reported in RDI citrus trees, with an\
    \ increase in sugars (Conesa et al., \n2014), sugar/acid ratio (Romero-Trigueros\
    \ et al., 2017b) and flavonoid and phenolic \ncontent of fruits (Navarro et al.,\
    \ 2015).  \n2.2.3. Reclaimed water  \nReclaimed water (RW) is a promising alternative\
    \ to ensure water supply in areas \nwith freshwater limitations. In the last few\
    \ years, RW production has been increasing in \nthe worldwide context (Giakoumis\
    \ et al., 2020). Spain is the first European country in \nwater recycling and\
    \ it belongs to the top ten worldwide (Jodar-Abellan et al., 2019). In \nthe national\
    \ territory, the production of RW is concentrated in the Region of Murcia, \n\
    Comunidad Valenciana, and Baleares, which recycle 71.8, 47.5 and 33.0 % of total,\
    \ \nrespectively (INE, 2018). The Region of Murcia is the national recycling water\
    \ leader \nwith 99 reclaimed water treatment plants and an annual production of\
    \ 110 hm3 year-1 \n(CARM, 2022). In this Region most of the water regenerated\
    \ (approximately 95 %) is \nused for agricultural purposes. \nThe use of this\
    \ water source in agriculture has many advantages associated with its \nhigh nutrient\
    \ content (Romero-Trigueros et al., 2021b), which promotes a soil nutrient \n\
    enrichment (Gao et al., 2021; Pereira et al., 2012). This fact supposes a potential\
    \ reduction \nof the fertilisation rate, and a consequently increasing in farmers´\
    \ economic benefits \n(García-Caparrós et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the application\
    \ of nutrients in large \nquantities could contribute to water body’s pollution\
    \ (Thompson et al., 2020), making \nnecessary an appropriate management of this\
    \ type of water. Besides, the salinity character \nCHAPTER III: STATE OF THE ART\
    \ \n35 \n \nof RW, higher than fresh water (Pedrero et al., 2013), should be considered\
    \ in the \nirrigation management. \nThe use of RW with agricultural purposes could\
    \ influence plant water status. \nRecently it was reported that irrigate with\
    \ RW reduces leaf gas exchange (gs and Pn) and \nΨstem of Salvia officinalis consequence\
    \ of the salinity of this water source (Lorente et al., \n2022). The same trend\
    \ observed Romero-Trigueros et al. (2021a) in grapefruit trees \nirrigated with\
    \ RW.  \nIrrigation water source can also affect agronomic traits as vegetative\
    \ growth. In this \nsense, Nicolás et al. (2016) reported a reduction in the vegetative\
    \ growth of mandarin \ntrees irrigated with RW. In addition, RW treatment also\
    \ affected nectarine yield, reducing \nthe number of fruits, although this reduction\
    \ was compensated by an increase in the \nindividual fruit weight (Pedrero et\
    \ al., 2018). Additionally, in grapefruit trees, fruit quality \nparameters such\
    \ as sugar/acid ratio and juice content were increased as a consequence of \n\
    the irrigation with the saline RW (Romero-Trigueros et al., 2017b). Despite these\
    \ minor \ndrawbacks, this water source mitigates the freshwater shortage problem\
    \ (Li et al., 2021) \nand is an alternative for farmers above desalinated water\
    \ in terms of profitability and \nsustainability (López-Serrano et al., 2021).\

    \ \nThis study was aimed at measuring the evapotranspiration (ET) of potted young\
    \ \nlime trees, with water balance method, using a drainage-weighing lysimeter\
    \ prototype. \nThe novelty of the proposed methodology was that it includes a\
    \ soil-based irrigation \nscheduling protocol that calculates the irrigation dose\
    \ based on threshold values of \nvolumetric soil water content (θv). \nMaterials\
    \ and Methods \nThe experiment was carried out at the CEBAS-CSIC experimental\
    \ field-station in \nMurcia, Spain. Plant material comprised two-year old Bearss\
    \ lime trees (Citrus latifolia \nTan.) grafted on Citrus macrophylla L. rootstock.\
    \ These trees were planted in 45 L \npolyethylene pots, which contained a clay-loam\
    \ textured soil. Lime trees were drip \nirrigated with two emitters per pot (2\
    \ L h-1 each). The threshold values of θv were fixed \nto 30 % of management allowed\
    \ depletion and field capacity to trigger and stop irrigation, \nrespectively.\
    \ Plant water status was assessed on a seasonal and daily basis by discrete \n\
    measurements of stem (Ψstem) and leaf (Ψleaf) water potentials, with a pressure\
    \ chamber, \nand net photosynthesis (Pn) and stomatal conductance (gs), with a\
    \ portable photosynthesis \nsystem.  \nLime tree ET was calculated through the\
    \ generic water balance method, as water \ngained by irrigation and rainfall and\
    \ the lost by drainage, once θv variations were assumed \nto be nil. Irrigation,\
    \ drainage and θv variations were real-time monitored by flowmeters, \ndrip gauges\
    \ and capacitance probes, respectively. In addition, pot weight was measured \n\
    in a continuous way by a scale. Water balance and plant water relations measures\
    \ were \ntaken in four drainage-weighing pot-lysimeters, each considered as a\
    \ replicate. \nResults and Discussion \nDuring the experimental period, the lime\
    \ trees were well irrigated showing midday \nΨstem values close to -0.8 MPa. These\
    \ Ψstem values were indicative of non-limiting soil \nwater conditions. A parallel\
    \ trend was noted for sunny transpiring leaves (Ψleaf), with \nmean seasonal values\
    \ fluctuating around -1.1 MPa. The mean seasonal values of Pn and \ngs were ≈\
    \ 7 µmol m−2 s −1 and 80 mmol m−2 s−1, respectively, indicative of an optimum\
    \ \nplant water status in Citrus species. \nCHAPTER IV: ARTICLE I \n39 \n \nThe\
    \ diurnal course of Ψstem, Ψleaf, gs and Pn followed a circadian rhythm, according\
    \ \nto evaporative demand with maximum values early in the morning and in the\
    \ afternoon \nhours and minimum at midday. The fact that their highest values\
    \ were observed in the \nafternoon hours, were due to alleviations in ambient\
    \ conditions. Along the crop cycle the \nmaximum values of these plant water status\
    \ indicators were observed at harvest. This fact \nconfirmed the positive effect\
    \ of fruits on plant water relations. \n The fortnightly ET values for two-year\
    \ old lime trees increased from the \nbeginning of the year (starting with 0.25\
    \ plant-1 day-1 in January) to mid-July when the \nmaximum value was recorded\
    \ (2.56 L plant-1 day-1). Subsequently, lime ET gradually \ndecreased until reaching\
    \ 0.20 L plant-1 day-1 in December. The high ET values observed \nin July, during\
    \ the active lime fruit development stage, were attributed to the elevated \n\
    water consumption by the crop during the cell expansion process. \nAlong the experimental\
    \ period, pot weight showed diurnal cycles decreasing \nduring daylight hours,\
    \ when the main water consumption of the plants occurred, and \nremaining almost\
    \ constant during night hours.  \nConclusions \n The drainage-weighing lysimeter\
    \ prototype allowed measuring crop ET \nthroughout the year in a simple, robust\
    \ and cost-effective way. The automated irrigation \nprotocol based on the threshold\
    \ values of θv allowed to maintain an optimal plant water \nstatus. Pot weight\
    \ served as ET water balance validation, when changes in the crop \nbiomass were\
    \ negligible. This lysimeter prototype could be replicated to determine \naccurate\
    \ ET values in other crops. \nScientia Horticulturae 288 (2021) 110396\nAvailable\

    \ B S T R A C T   \nCitrus latifolia is increasingly being cultivated in Mediterranean\
    \ areas, where the need for precise irrigation \nimplies a sound knowledge of\
    \ the crop’s water requirements, which is carried out by monitoring the tree water\
    \ \nstatus in the plant-soil-atmosphere system. Two year-old lime trees (Citrus\
    \ latifolia Tan. cv. Bearss)  were \ncultivated in 45 L weighing pot-lysimeters\
    \ filled with a clay-loam soil and equipped with soil water sensors for \nrecording\
    \ the real-time soil water status. Irrigation, drainage, pot weight, and agro-meteorological\
    \ variables were \nalso recorded in real-time. Plant water relations - stem (Ψstem)\
    \ and leaf (Ψleaf) water potentials, and leaf gas \nexchange - were periodically\
    \ measured throughout the experiment. The automated irrigation protocol based\
    \ on \nthe volumetric soil water content was set to prevent tree water stress\
    \ (with mean seasonal values of Ψstem above \n-0.8 MPa and 7 μmol m−2 s−1 and\
    \ 80 mmol m−2 s−1, for net phtosynthesis and stomatal conductance, respec-\ntively).\
    \ From the soil water pot balance, the computed fortnightly ET mean values throughout\
    \ the growing \nseason varied from 0.25 to 2.56 L plant−1 day−1 in winter and\
    \ summer months, respectively. Maximum ET values \noccurred in July when evaporative\
    \ demand was highest and lime fruits were in their most active growing phase.\
    \ \nFor day length, lime tree biomass changes were negligible, and the pot tree\
    \ weight variations served for ET water \nbalance validation (r2=0.92***). The\
    \ contribution of this work is that it establishes a scalable weighing lysimeter\
    \ \nprototype for determining the ET of lime trees grown in Mediterranean semi-arid\
    \ conditions, using real-time soil \nwater balance monitoring managed by an irrigation\
    \ automation protocol.  This approach could be replicated for \nprecise ET measurements\
    \ in other crops.   \n1. Introduction \nLime trees (Citrus latifolia Tan.) usually\
    \ grow under warm/humid \nclimatic conditions near the equator and in subtropical\
    \ areas of the \nMediterranean Basin (Inglese and Sortino, 2019). Globally, lime\
    \ culti-\nvated area is concentrated in India (286.000 ha), Mexico (175.826 ha)\
    \ \nand China (126.804 ha) (FAOSTAT, 2019). In Europe, lime production \ncentres\
    \ on the Mediterranean regions of Italy and Spain, where the \nleading lime producer\
    \ is the Region of Murcia, with 12% of the national \nproduction (MAPA, 2019).\
    \ In this region production has increased by \nabout 18% in the last four years,\
    \ making this species a potential alter-\nnative to traditional Citrus cultivars\
    \ (CREM, 2019). \nHowever, in many areas of the world, water shortages are becoming\
    \ \nincreasingly common due to periodic droughts, more restrictive laws \nregulating\
    \ the use of water for agricultural production, and increased \ncompetition for\
    \ water resources with other non-agricultural uses (Fer-\neres and Soriano, 2007;\
    \ Fern´andez-García et al., 2020). Furthermore, \nclimate change is expected to\
    \ exacerbate this situation in the \nMediterranean Basin due to increasing potential\
    \ evapotranspiration, \nlower precipitation, and increases in the frequency and\
    \ intensity of \ndrought (IPCC, 2018). This will be felt most in the agricultural\
    \ sector, \nwhich is the main consumer of water (>70%) (AQUASTAT, 2020). Such\
    \ \na scenario will require new ways to maximize the precision of irrigation \n\
    so that water is used more efficiently, which, in turn, implies accurately \n\
    determining the crop water needs. \nCrop water requirements are linked with evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETc), \nwhich integrate crop transpiration and soil evaporation. ETc is an\
    \ \nimportant component of surface energy and hydrological balances, \nbeing responsible\
    \ for the greatest part of water consumption in agri-\ncultural production (Evett\
    \ et al., 2012). For this reason, an accurate \nknowledge of crop water requirements\
    \ (ETc) is essential for helping \ngrowers decide `when´it is necessary to irrigate\
    \ a crop and `how much´\nwater to apply. \nThere are several indirect methods\
    \ for calculating crop evapotrans-\npiration (ETc), such as the FAO-24 Pan evaporation\
    \ method (Eliades, \n1988; Chartzoulakis and Drosos, 1995), and FAO-56 crop coefficient\

    \ scientific \ncommunity (Fern´andez et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2013; Gong et al.,\
    \ 2020; \nSilva et al., 2020). This method considers climatic variables, which\
    \ are \nincluded in the reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0), and the crop\
    \ \ntype and its characteristics, all of which are included in a single crop \n\
    coefficient (Kc). ET0 is independent of crop characteristics and can be \nobtained\
    \ \nas \na \nfunction \nof \nmeteorological \nconditions, \nthe \nPenman-Monteith\
    \ equation being the most frequently used (Allen et al., \n1998). The Kc, however,\
    \ is intimately dependant on specific crop factors \nsuch as the phenological\
    \ stage, density, pruning, management, variety \nand rootstock (Doorenbos and\
    \ Kassam, 1979; Ruiz-Pe˜nalver et al., 2015; \nVera-Repullo et al., 2015) . It\
    \ is also dependant on climate, soil and \nirrigation conditions, which represents\
    \ a great disadvantage because it \ninvolves making adjustments to reflect local\
    \ conditions (Abrisqueta \net al., 2013). \nETc can also be accurately determined\
    \ through direct measurement \nof the soil water balance using weighing lysimeters\
    \ (Girona et al., 2011; \nEvett et al., 2012; L´opez-Urrea et al., 2014; Ruiz-Pe˜nalver\
    \ et al., 2015; \nVera-Repullo et al., 2015; Jim´enez-Carvajal et al., 2017),\
    \ a type of \nlysimeter consisting of a device which, based on weight differences,\
    \ \naccurately measures the inputs and outputs of water flows that affect the\
    \ \nsoil and tree mass. The soil water balance method is based on the idea \n\
    that crop evapotranspiration occurs at the expense of the water stored in \nthe\
    \ root-zone resulting from irrigation, rainfall, and capillary rise (in-\nputs),\
    \ while discounting runoff and drainage (outputs) (Cohen et al., \n1996). This\
    \ method allows ETc to be precisely determined, avoiding the \nimprecision associated\
    \ with a particular crop, climatic conditions or \nirrigation factors (Beeson,\
    \ 2011; L´opez-Urrea et al., 2012, 2014; Ruiz--\nCanales et al., 2013). In recent\
    \ years, lysimetric equipment and tech-\nniques have improved, enabling the more\
    \ accurate measurement of \nwater balance parameters (Meissner et al., 2010; Zupanc\
    \ et al., 2012). \nFor all these reasons, this method is frequently used to validate\
    \ the ETc \ndata obtained with other methods (Vaughan et al., 2007; Wegehenkel\
    \ \nand Gerke, 2013; Xu et al., 2013) and for the determination of crop \ncoefficient\
    \ (Kc) values (Allen et al., 1998; Akhand et al., 2014). \nOn the other hand,\
    \ given the practical difficulties involved in the \nprecise parameterization\
    \ of the water balance, soil sensors have been \nused for empirical site-specific\
    \ adjustment (Mounzer et al., 2008; Evett \net al., 2012; Vera et al., 2019).\
    \  Thus, the combination of water balance \nand sensors allows the crop water\
    \ needs to be accurately calculated. \nCapacitance-type soil water sensors are\
    \ widely used in precision irri-\ngation (Paltineanu and Starr, 1997; Abrisqueta\
    \ et al., 2012; Vera et al., \n2013, 2019, 2021). They function by determining\
    \ the dielectric \npermittivity of the soil around the sensor, which mostly depends\
    \ on the \nvolumetric soil water content (θv). \nThis study is aimed at measuring\
    \ the evapotranspiration of young \nlime trees (ET) during the growing season\
    \ in Mediterranean conditions, \nusing the water balance method. Two-year old\
    \ lime trees were planted in \npot-weighing lysimeters equipped with sensors for\
    \ the real-time moni-\ntoring of irrigation, drainage, pot weight, θv. Plant water\
    \ relations were \nassessed by measuring stem (Ψstem) and leaf (Ψleaf) water potentials,\
    \ as \nwell as leaf gas exchange (net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance)\
    \ \non a seasonal and diurnal basis. The novelty of the proposed method-\nology\
    \ is that it includes a soil-based irrigation scheduling protocol that \ncalculates\
    \ the correct irrigation dose based on a feed-back strategy. This \nstrategy involves\
    \ replenishing the water used by the plants based on \nchanges in θv as a control\
    \ system variable. \n2. Materials and methods \n2.1. Experimental conditions \n\
    The experiment was carried in a lime tree orchard located at the \nCEBAS-CSIC\
    \ experimental field-station in Murcia, Spain (38◦ 06′ 31′’ N, \n1◦ 02′ 14′’W)\
    \ at 110 m.a.s.l. The plant material consisted of two-year old \nlime trees (Citrus\
    \ latifolia Tan., cv. Bearss) grafted on Citrus macrophylla \nL. rootstock. \n\
    Fifteen trees were planted in 45 L polyethylene pots (410 mm \ndiameter and 420\
    \ mm height), containing a highly calcareous soil (45% \ncalcium carbonate), with\
    \ a clay loam texture, low organic matter con-\ntent and bulk density of 1.43\
    \ g cm−3. Soil water characteristics were \nobtained using the theoretical Saxton\
    \ model (Saxton et al., 1986). The \nsoil water content at field capacity (FC)\
    \ and permanent wilting point \n(WP) were 0.35 and 0.15 m3 m−3, respectively.\
    \ Pots were located in \nopen-air conditions, and painted white to prevent the\
    \ roots from over-\nheating in the sun. \nThe trees were drip irrigated with two\
    \ self-compensating emitters (2 \nL h−1 each) per pot, placed at two points to\
    \ ensure uniform water dis-\ntribution at the pot surface. \nLime trees showed\
    \ homogenous vegetative development: tree height \nof 1.01 ± 0.06 m, mean trunk\
    \ diameter (0.03 m above soil surface) of \n23.7 ± 1.88 mm, total leaf area of\
    \ 0.55 ± 0.01 m2 (≈ 155 leaves per tree, \n35.5 cm2 leaf−1), and a tree canopy\
    \ cover of 0.26 m2. \n2.2. Irrigation protocol \nAn automated irrigation scheduling\
    \ protocol was applied, using the \nvolumetric soil water content (θv) as a control\
    \ system variable. For this \npurpose, four pots containing trees of similar appearance\
    \ were selected \nand equipped with capacitance probes (one per pot) (EnviroPro\
    \ \nEP100G-04, Entelechy Pty Ltd., St. Agnes, Australia), for making \ncontinuous\
    \ θv and soil temperature measurements. The capacitance \nprobes were calibrated\
    \ for a clay-loam textured soil following the pro-\ncedure proposed by Paltineanu\
    \ and Starr (1997). Each probe was \ninstalled midway between tree trunk and pot\
    \ edge, and connected to a \nradio transmission unit, which read the values every\
    \ 5 min and recorded \naverage values every 15 min. Only sensors located at 0.20\
    \ and 0.30 m \ndepth were read. The radio-transmission units sent data to a gateway\
    \ \nconnected TCP/IP to the addVANTAGE cloud-based platform (ADCON \nTelemetry,\
    \ Vienna, Austria) for data processing and visualization. \nMaximum and minimum\
    \ θv threshold values were fixed in such a way \nthat \nthe \nfeed-back \nsystem\
    \ \ncontrol \nremotely \nacted \non \nthe \nelectro-hydraulic valve, triggering\
    \ or stopping the irrigation. \nAt the beginning of the experimental period, irrigation\
    \ threshold θv \nvalues were tested in order to provide an adequate plant water\
    \ status \nand no soil anoxia, avoiding tree water stress. θv values at 0.2 and\
    \ 0.3 m \ndepth were averaged to calculate threshold values. As a result, the\
    \ \nthreshold θv values were fixed to 30% of MAD (management allowed \ndepletion)\
    \ and field capacity (FC) to trigger and stop irrigation, \nrespectively. MAD\
    \ was calculated from the following equation (Mer-\nriam, 1966; Allen et al.,\
    \ 1998): \nMAD = α AWC\n(1)  \nwhere α is a dimensionless coefficient (equal to\
    \ 0.3), and AWC is the \navailable soil water content, calculated as: AWC = FC\
    \ – WP. \n2.3. Measurements \n2.3.1. Environmental conditions \nAgro-meteorological\
    \ data (air temperature, relative humidity, solar \nradiation, wind velocity and\
    \ rainfall) were recorded by an automated \nweather station (http://www.cebas.csic.es/general_spain/est_meteo.\
    \ \nhtml) located in the CEBAS-CSIC experimental field station, which \nread the\
    \ values every 5 min and recorded the averages every 15 min. \nFrom these data,\
    \ reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) values were \ncalculated hourly using\
    \ the Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et al., \n1998). Vapour pressure deficit\
    \ (VPD) was calculated from air tempera-\nture and relative humidity values (Allen\

    (2) \nUnder the experimental conditions, the runoff (RO) was zero, except \nfor\
    \ the heavy rain episode (82.4 mm in March). Additionally, under high \nfrequency\
    \ irrigation and the automated irrigation protocol applied, the \nsoil water content\
    \ variations (∆SW) were negligible and then ET could \nbe calculated as water\
    \ gained by irrigation (I) and rainfall (R) and water \nlost by drainage (D).\
    \ Hence, Eq. (2) becomes: \nET = I + R − D\n(3) \nThe four lime tree pots were\
    \ arranged as to fit in weighing pot- \nlysimeters (Fig. 1). The amount of water\
    \ applied through irrigation (I) \nwas measured with a pulse flowmeter (Sensus,\
    \ 120 HRI-A, Barcelona, \nSpain) located at the beginning of the fifteen pots.\
    \ Also, drip gauges \n(Pronamic, Ringkoebing, Denmark) were installed below the\
    \ emitter \nnear the capacitance probe to monitor real-time irrigation amounts\
    \ and \nto detect any flow rate failures during the irrigation events. Drainage\
    \ (D) \nwas measured with drip gauges (Pronamic ApS, Ringkoebing, Denmark) \n\
    located under each pot. ∆SW was monitored with capacitance probes (as \ndescribed\
    \ in Section 2.2.). \nThe four selected lime tree pots were placed on four calibrated\
    \ scales \n(150 kg load cell ± 20 g, ZMISSIL F2–150, Gram Precision, Spain) to\
    \ \ndetermine the pot weight (W), which, together with the water balance \nparameters,\
    \ were integrated into the telemetry platform (Fig. 1). \nThe contribution of\
    \ soil evaporation (E) to ET was evaluated by \ncovering the soil surface with\
    \ white plastic of two out the four lime tree \npots during several rain-free\
    \ cycles (each seven-days long) along the \nexperimental period. The difference\
    \ in ET values between covered and \nuncovered pot-lysimeters, as determined using\
    \ Eq. (3), was attributed to \nE. \n2.3.3. Plant water relations \nLime tree water\
    \ relations were evaluated by discrete measurements \nof stem (Ψstem) and leaf\
    \ (Ψleaf) water potentials, and leaf gas exchange \nparameters. On representative,\
    \ clear days of the growing season, Ψleaf \nand Ψstem were measured around solar\
    \ noon (12:00 h solar time) using a \npressure chamber (Soil Moisture Equipment\
    \ Corp., Model 3000, Santa \nBarbara, CA, USA) in mature leaves located near the\
    \ trunk on the north \nface of the trees. Ψleaf was measured on fully expanded\
    \ (3 to 5 months \nold), sun-exposed uncovered leaves, following the recommendations\
    \ \ndescribed in Hsiao (1990), while for Ψstem measurements the leaves \nwere\
    \ covered with aluminium foil at least 2 h before excision \n(McCutchan and Shackel,\
    \ 1992). \nLeaf gas exchange parameters - net photosynthesis (Pn, µmol m−2 \n\
    s−1) and stomatal conductance (gs, mmol m−2 s−1) - were measured in \nthe morning\
    \ (≈ 8:00 h solar time) the same days as Ψleaf, on sunny leaves \nusing a portable\
    \ photosynthesis system (LI-6400, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, \nUSA) equipped with a\
    \ broad leaf chamber (6 cm2). Measurements were \ntaken in near constant ambient\
    \ conditions: CO2 concentration ≈ 400 \nμmol mol−1 and light intensity ≈ 1200\
    \ μmol m−2 s−1. The air flow rate \ninside the chamber was maintained at ≈ 350\
    \ μmol s−1. \nIn addition, several diurnal cycles of Ψstem, Ψleaf and leaf gas\
    \ ex-\nchange parameters were determined on representative days of the main \n\
    Citrus phenological stages: flowering, stage I and II of fruit growth, and \n\
    harvest. Measurements were taken from pre-dawn to early afternoon at \n0.5 - 1.5\
    \ h intervals. \nWater balance and plant water relations measurements were taken\
    \ in \nthe four weighing pot-lysimeters, each one considered as a replicate (n\
    \ \n= 4). The lysimeters were placed at the centre of the experimental or-\nchard,\
    \ and the remaining 11 border lime trees were placed around them \naccording to\
    \ standard tree spacing (5 m x 6 m). \nLinear and nonlinear regression analysis\
    \ was applied to determine \nthe relationships between plant water relations and\

    \ data for the 2017 growing season are shown in \nTable 1. The weather was typically\
    \ Mediterranean: hot, dry summer and \nmild, wet winter. Total annual rainfall\
    \ and ET0 amounted 145.3 and \n1112.3 mm, respectively, which, considering the\
    \ 10-year seasonal \naverage data for the studied area (rainfall and ET0 of 250\
    \ and 1320 mm, \nrespectively) denoted a dry year (AEMET, 2020). \nMonthly ET0\
    \ was the highest in June, coinciding with the longest \ndays and January was\
    \ the wettest month. Annual daily average \nmaximum, mean and minimum temperatures\
    \ were 24.68, 18.67 and \n13.54 ◦C, respectively. In agreement with the evaporative\
    \ demand, the \nhighest temperatures were recorded in summer, with a maximum air\
    \ \ntemperatures during August, whereas the lowest temperatures were \nrecorded\
    \ in winter (especially in January). Mean VPD ranged from 3.36 \nkPa in June to\
    \ 0.98 kPa in January. Lastly, mean wind speed and solar \nradiation registered\
    \ their highest values in March and June, respec-\ntively. October was also characterized\
    \ as a windy month (Table 1). \n3.2. Soil water status and automated control of\
    \ irrigation \nThe volumetric soil water content differed slightly between the\
    \ four \npots with similar trends at the two depths (0.2 and 0.3 m) throughout\
    \ \nthe studied season (data not shown). The θv at both depths were aver-\naged,\
    \ representing the full soil profile. \nRainfall events were integrated in the\
    \ automated irrigation protocol \nas increases in the soil water content. For\
    \ example, the rainfall event on \n12th −14th March (82.4 mm) caused a rapid increase\
    \ in the soil water \ncontent, with values exceeding saturation values (θv ≈ 45%).\
    \ As a result, \nirrigation was delayed for six days (Fig. 3). \nData in Fig.\
    \ 3 also revealed that θv varied not only as a consequence \nof irrigation or\
    \ rainfall events, but also fluctuated following diurnal air \ntemperature and\
    \ root water uptake dynamics. These fluctuations were \nclosely related to the\
    \ evapotranspiration demand, confirming the \nsensitivity of this type of capacitance\
    \ water content sensor to the nearby \nenvironment of soil and plant roots (Vera\
    \ et al., 2017, 2021). \nThe pot weight (W) offered sound information on water\
    \ dynamics in \nthe whole plant-soil system, the values decreasing during daylight\
    \ hours \nwhen leaf stomata open and the plant water consumption, and \nremaining\
    \ fairly constant during the night (Fig. 3). The pot weight in-\ntegrated both\
    \ tree biomass and soil water content changes, revealing \nitself to be less stable\
    \ than θv over periods of time longer than one week \n(Fig. 2C). For this reason,\
    \ if pot weight is used as a control system \nvariable for automatic irrigation\
    \ management, the threshold values \nwould need to be adjusted as soon as the\
    \ plant biomass changed. \n3.3. Plant water relations \nDuring the experimental\
    \ period, the lime trees were well irrigated to \nshow midday Ψstem values close\
    \ to −0.8 MPa, ranging from −1.0 MPa \nduring the fruit growth stages to −0.4\
    \ MPa early in the season at the \nflowering stage (Fig. 4B). A parallel trend\
    \ with lower values was noted \nfor sunny transpiring leaves, with mean seasonal\
    \ Ψleaf values fluctuating \naround −1.1 MPa (Fig. 4B). The lowest values were\
    \ measured during the \nsummer months in response to increased evaporative demand,\
    \ when \nmaximum VPD values were recorded (Fig. 4A). These Ψstem values were \n\
    indicative of non-limiting soil water conditions, as widely reported for \nother\
    \ Citrus species, such as mandarin (Gonz´alez Altozano and Castel, \n2003; Ballester\
    \ et al., 2011; Pag´an et al., 2012; Conesa et al., 2014, \n2018), orange (P´erez-P´erez\
    \ et al., 2009; García-Tejero et al., 2010) \nlemon (Domingo et al., 1996; Ortu˜no\
    \ et al., 2005), and grapefruit \n(P´erez-P´erez et al., 2014; Romero-Trigueros\
    \ et al., 2017). In this sense, \nGonz´alez-Altozano and Castel (1999) established\
    \ a threshold range for \nΨleaf values of −1.3 to −1.5 MPa to avoid reductions\
    \ in mandarin fruit \nsize, similarly to that observed in grapefruit (Cohen and\
    \ Goell, 1988). \nThe mean seasonal values for leaf gas exchange were ≈ 7 µmol\
    \ m−2 \ns−1 and 80 mmol m−2 s−1, for Pn and gs, respectively (Fig. 4C), with more\
    \ \npronounced variations than in the case of Ψstem and Ψleaf values \n(Fig. 4B).\
    \ Although the mean values registered in our experiment were \nslightly lower\
    \ than those reported under field-grown non-limiting soil \nwater conditions,\
    \ the same seasonal leaf gas exchange trend has also \nbeen observed in orange\
    \  (Moreshet and Green, 1984; P´erez-P´erez et al., \n2008) and lemon trees (Domingo\
    \ et al., 1996; Alarc´on et al., 2006; \nOrtu˜no et al., 2006). \nGenerally, the\
    \ values of both leaf gas exchange parameters increased \nfrom the beginning of\
    \ the season onwards, as leaves aged, with \nmaximum values Pn of ≈ 11 µmol m−2\
    \ s−1 at harvest, after which the \nphotosynthetic activity tended to decrease\
    \ (Fig. 4C). The higher Pn \nvalues during the active fruit growth stages in lime\
    \ can be attributed to a \nfeedback effect of the fruit load on leaf photosynthesis\
    \ (Ben Mimoun \net al., 1996; García-Orellana et al., 2013). Furthermore, the\
    \ good linear \nrelationship found between Pn and gs [Pn = 52.01 gs + 2.76 gs;\
    \ r2 = 0.66, \np < 0.001] (data not shown) demonstrated the clear influence of\
    \ sto-\nmatal behaviour on leaf photosynthetic activity (Chaves et al., 1987).\
    \ \nIn an attempt to deepen our knowledge of plant water relations in \nyoung\
    \ potted lime trees under automated irrigation, the diurnal courses \nof plant\
    \ water status parameters were evaluated during the growing \nseason. Ψstem and\
    \ Ψleaf followed a circadian rhythm, following changes \nin the evaporative demand\
    \ (Fig. 5A), with the highest values recorded \npredawn (early morning) and the\
    \ lowest around midday (Fig. 5B), as is \nTable 1 \nMonthly values of total crop\

    \ cultivated plants including Citrus (S´anchez-blanco et al., \n1990; Ruiz-S´anchez\
    \ et al., 1997, 2007). Those values recorded for sunny \nfreely transpiring non-covered\
    \ leaves (Ψleaf) were lower than those for \nΨstem (Fig. 5B). The similar values\
    \ recorded for these two parameters \npredawn reflected a lack of transpiration\
    \ at that time of day. However, \nas the season progressed, the difference between\
    \ Ψstem and Ψleaf values \n(ΔΨ) became more pronounced, and the highest values\
    \ were recorded \nduring the last diurnal cycle studied (Fig. 5 B), coinciding\
    \ with harvest \nand confirming the above mentioned positive effect of fruits\
    \ on leaf \ntranspiration and photosynthesis processes. ΔΨ values have been closely\
    \ \nrelated with daily tree transpiration in lemon  (Ortu˜no et al., 2006; \n\
    García-Orellana et al., 2013) and almond  (Torrecillas et al., 1989) trees. \n\
    In a companion paper of Mira-García et al. (2020), the authors re-\nported a strong\
    \ dependence of Ψstem on VPD in field-grown lime trees. In \nlemon trees,  García-Orellana\
    \ et al. (2013) found a higher coefficient of \ndetermination in the Ψleaf vs.\
    \ VPD relationship than for Ψstem vs. VPD, \nunderlining the greater dependence\
    \ of Ψleaf on the prevailing atmo-\nspheric conditions at the time that measurements\
    \ are taken (Rodrigues \net al., 2012). Indeed, Ψleaf responds not only to soil\
    \ water status but also \nto other factors, including cultivar, environment, soil\
    \ type and the re-\nlationships between canopy and root system (García-Tejera\
    \ et al., 2021). \nIn this sense, Remorini and Massai (2003) suggested that the\
    \ Ψstem value \nat noon is a better indicator of plant water status than Ψleaf\
    \ in peach \ntrees. Moreover, Abrisqueta et al. (2015), Conesa et al. (2019) and\
    \ Vera \net al. (2013) indicated that Ψstem has long been accepted as the best\
    \ \nreference plant water status for early-maturing Prunus trees. Neverthe-\n\
    less, in our experimental conditions, both methods of estimating lime \ntree water\
    \ status were closely correlated [Ψstem = 0.92 (Ψleaf)2 + 2.56 \nΨleaf + 0.30;\
    \ r2= 0.79, p < 0.001], as Williams and Araujo (2002) found \nin vineyards, in\
    \ which both plant water status indicators were also \nsignificantly correlated\
    \ with θv. \nThe circadian pattern observed for gs and Pn were characterised by\
    \ \nmaximal stomatal opening and greatest photosynthetic activity early in \n\
    the morning as soon as solar radiation reached the plant leaves, followed \nby\
    \ a continuously decreasing tendency with minimal values reached by \nmidday (Fig.\
    \ 5C). As in most Citrus sp., this stomatal closure occurred in \nresponse to\
    \ the increasing evaporative demand and the rising air tem-\nperatures. (Sun and\
    \ Ma, 1999) indicated that the best temperatures for \noptimal crop development\
    \ of Citrus trees varied between 22 and 30 ◦C in \norder to avoid stomatal closure.\
    \ Several studies have pointed to a slight \nincrease in gas exchange in Citrus\
    \ leaves during afternoon hours, prob-\nably as a consequence of alleviations\
    \ in ambient conditions \n(S´anchez-Blanco et al., 1990; Nicol´as et al., 2008;\
    \ Mira-García et al., \n2020). \n3.4. ET in young lime trees \nHaving confirmed\
    \ that the automated irrigation protocol generated \nan adequate plant water status\
    \ in young potted lime trees, ET-water \nbalance computations were carried out\
    \ following Eq. (3). Although the \ndata were analysed on a weekly basis, for\
    \ practical purposes fortnightly \nET values are presented. \nFirst, it is important\
    \ to note that ET includes water losses resulting \nfrom soil evaporation (E)\
    \ and from plant transpiration through the \nstomata (T). Evaluation of the ET\
    \ in covered and uncovered pot- \nlysimeters showed that E accounted for a maximum\
    \ of 20% of ET in \nthe summer months (data not shown). The soil evaporation process\
    \ (E) \ndepends on temperature (Kerridge et al., 2013), so that increases in soil\
    \ \ntemperature lower the θv and increase the evaporation rate (Kidron and \n\
    Kronenfeld, 2015). Soil temperature in the potted lime trees varied from \n13\
    \ to 27 ◦C in winter and summer months, respectively, which indicated \nTable\

    \ was low. \nHowever, in field grown Citrus sp.,  Castel (1997) found that soil\
    \ evap-\noration accounted for about 8–30% ET in periods with little or no rain\
    \ \nand as much as 50% when rain was more frequent and abundant. In \ncereal crops,\
    \ the contribution of E to ET decreased from 80% at the \nbeginning cultivation\
    \ to 5% at the flag leaf stage (Silva et al., 2020). \nThe fortnightly evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) values obtained in the pot- \nlysimeters for two-year old lime trees grown\
    \ under Mediterranean cli-\nmatic conditions with a clay-loamy soil, along with\
    \ the main pheno-\nlogical stages and their corresponding Biologische Bundesanstalt,\
    \ \nBundessortenamt und CHemische industrie (BBCH) scale for Citrus sp. \nby Agustí\
    \ et al. (2003), are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that ET \ngradually increased\
    \ from the beginning of the year (starting with 0.25 L \nplant−1 day−1 in January)\
    \ to mid-July when maximum values (2.56 L \nplant−1 day−1) were reached. Subsequently,\
    \ ET gradually decreased \nuntil reaching 0.20 L plant−1 day−1 in December (Table\
    \ 2). \nThe same pattern has been also found in other studies in Citrus sp. For\
    \ \nexample, in young (3–4 years old) sweet orange trees grown under \nsurface\
    \ irrigation, Castel et al. (1987) reported evapotranspiration \nvalues (measured\
    \ by the water balance method) that varied from a \nminimum of 0.5 - 1 mm day−1\
    \ to a maximum of 3 mm day−1 for the \ncoldest and hottest months of the year,\
    \ respectively. In eight-year old \norange trees grown in lysimeters, Yang et\
    \ al. (2003) also observed \nminimum ET values in winter (0.22 mm day−1) and maximum\
    \ values in \nsummer (4.4 mm day−1). Using the eddy covariance method in man-\n\
    darin, Maestre-Valero et al. (2017) reported maximum ET values in \nsummer months\
    \ (about 4.3 mm day−1), and minimum values at the \nbeginning and at the end of\
    \ the year (≈ 0.11 mm day−1). \nIn drip irrigated Tahiti lime trees, Alves et\
    \ al. (2007) reported \nmaximum ET values in December (summer at a Brazilian latitude),\
    \ as \nmeasured in a weighing lysimeter. The authors found that ET varied \nfrom\
    \ 1.3 to 5 mm day−1 during the three-year study. Since the \nFig. 4. Seasonal\

    \ conditions in this study were quite similar to our \nexperimental conditions,\
    \ the slightly higher values than those obtained \nfor Bearss lime trees in our\
    \ study (Table 2) could be attributed to the \nincreased transpiration as a consequence\
    \ of the greater canopy devel-\nopment of field-grown Tahiti lime trees. \nApart\
    \ from the dependence of ET on meteorological parameters, as \nalso seen in other\
    \ tree crops (Yang et al., 2003; Girona et al., 2004; \nL´opez-Urrea et al., 2012;\
    \ Alberto et al., 2014; Maestre-Valero et al., \n2017; Peddinti et al., 2020),\
    \ its relation with the crop phenological stage \nwas also evident. In lime trees\
    \ ET gradually increased from flowering \n(0.39 L plant−1 day−1) to stage II of\
    \ fruit growth (2.50 L plant−1 day−1), \nand decreased after the harvesting period,\
    \ which included two pickings, \nwith minimum ET values reached during the inactive\
    \ vegetative growth \nperiod (0.2 L plant−1 day−1) (Table 2). The higher ET values\
    \ observed \nduring the active fruit development stage were attributed to high\
    \ water \nconsumption in the cell division and expansion processes (Peddinti \n\
    et al., 2020). \nThe pot weight, which remained constant at night and decreased\
    \ \nduring daylight hours, when plants consumed water (Fig. 3), was \nconsidered\
    \ a more global indicator in the water balance approach. For \nthis reason, it\
    \ can be used for ET measurements of young lime trees, as \nlong as biomass changes\
    \ are negligible (Fig. 2C). Data measured for one \nweek in May (Fig. 6) showed\
    \ that mean pot weight decreased from 49.2 \nto 48.0 kg in two consecutive days\
    \ (17th - 18th May), generating a \nFig. 5. Diurnal courses of: (A) crop reference\

    \ balance (Eq. (3)) \nthat week: the cumulative amount of irrigation water applied\
    \ was 8915 \nml and the drainage was 435 ml (Fig. 6), in other words 1.2 L plant−1\
    \ \nday−1. This value is included in the mean ET value proposed for the \nsecond\
    \ fortnight of May (Table 2). The pot weight therefore served for \nET validation,\
    \ as evidenced by the close relationship found between the \ntwo methods of calculating\
    \ ET: soil water balance (ETBALANCE) and pot \ntree weight variations (ETWEIGHT)\
    \ (Fig. 7). \n4. Conclusions \nUnder Mediterranean conditions and without water\
    \ limitation, \nfortnightly ET values of two-year-old lime trees (Citrus latifolia\
    \ Tan. cv. \nBearss) on C. macrophylla rootstocks grown in 45 L pots ranged from\
    \ \n0.25 to 2.56 litres per plant and day. \nThese ET values were obtained with\
    \ an automated irrigation proto-\ncol based on the 30% MAD criteria, using volumetric\
    \ soil water sensors, \nand checking the plant water status, with optimal values\
    \ of stem/leaf \nwater potentials and net photosynthesis of the lime trees. \n\
    A prototype of a simple and robust scalable weighing lysimeter was \nset up for\
    \ young potted lime trees, with real-time monitoring of irriga-\ntion parameters\
    \ and soil water balance, providing a practical and cost- \neffective way to measure\
    \ ET throughout the year. \nThe proposed automated irrigation approach allowed\
    \ accurate ET \nvalues to be obtained. Assuming a negligible change in tree biomass\
    \ for \nday-length periods, the pot weight which remained constant at night \n\
    and decreased during daylight hours when plant water consumption \noccurred, served\
    \ as a validation of ET. \nThis approach -a combination of pot-lysimeter, automated\
    \ MAD \nprotocol and soil-plant water status monitoring- could be replicated to\
    \ \ndetermine precise ET values for other crops. \nAuthor contributions \nStudy\

    \ latifolia Tan., cv. Bearss) grafted on C. \nmacrophylla L. rootstock. Trees\
    \ were planted in raised rows, spaced at 6 m x 5 m. The \nirrigation system consisted\
    \ of a double drip lateral line, with four pressure-compensated \nemitters, of\
    \ 4 L h−1 per tree. The trees were irrigated to fulfil plant water requirements\
    \ \nthroughout the experiment using an automated irrigation based on threshold\
    \ values of \nvolumetric soil water content (θv) measured with TDR probes. The\
    \ threshold values of θv \nwere fixed to 10 % of management allowed depletion\
    \ and field capacity to trigger and \nstop irrigation, respectively. The trees\
    \ were subjected to two cropping systems: open-field \n(as the most common agricultural\
    \ practice) and shade netting (trees grown inside a shade \nnet house).  \nMeteorological\
    \ variables such as precipitation, air temperature (Ta), relative \nhumidity (RH),\
    \ wind speed and solar radiation, were recorded in open-field and shaded \nconditions\
    \ by two automatic weather stations. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)\
    \ \nwas measured by a portable photosynthesis system. On a typical summer and\
    \ winter day, \ndiscrete measurements of stem water potential (Ψstem) by a pressure\
    \ chamber, and leaf gas \nexchange (stomatal conductance (gs) and net photosynthesis\
    \ (Pn)) with a portable \nphotosynthesis system, were made at 1-2 h intervals.\
    \ Canopy temperature (Tc) was \ncontinuously monitored these days with infrared\
    \ radiometer sensors. Canopy to air \ntemperature difference (Tc-Ta) and the canopy\
    \ thermal index (CTI) were calculated. Plant \nwater status was assessed in four\
    \ trees per cropping system, each considered as a \nreplication. \nResults and\
    \ Discussion \n Meteorological conditions were more demanding in summer (mean\
    \ Ta of 26 ◦C) \nthan in winter (mean Ta of 14 ◦C) season. In summer, Ta inside\
    \ shade net house was \nCHAPTER IV: ARTICLE II \n53 \n \nslightly higher than\
    \ in open-field, favouring a reduction of RH values. In winter, Ta and \nRH were\
    \ very similar in the two cropping systems studied. Regardless of the season,\
    \ PAR \nunder netting was lower than in open-field, due to light scattering effect\
    \ of the net.  \nPlant water status indicators showed diurnal and seasonal changes.\
    \ In both \ncropping systems, Ψstem followed a circadian pattern closely related\
    \ with vapor pressure \ndeficit (VPD) changes. In summer, the diurnal values of\
    \ Ψstem fluctuated more than in \nwinter. Leaf gas exchange parameters diurnal\
    \ course showed high values early in the \nmorning and minimum at midday. In summer,\
    \ accumulated daily gs and Pn were 54 and \n37 %, respectively, higher in shade\
    \ netting than in open-field conditions. The low PAR \nunder netting, resulted\
    \ in high stomatal conductance, which could improve CO2 uptake, \npromoting an\
    \ increase of photosynthetic capacity of shaded trees. In winter, leaf gas \n\
    exchange was similar in both cropping systems. Tc showed higher values in summer,\
    \ \nvarying from 20 to 40 ◦C, than in winter, varying from 3 to 20 ◦C. In both\
    \ seasons, trees \ngrown in shaded conditions showed at midday slightly higher\
    \ Tc values respect to open-\nfield trees. This fact could be due to the high\
    \ Ta and low RH values measured inside the \nshade net house, promoting a canopy\
    \ warming. Shaded lime trees, however, showed at \nmidday lower values of Tc-Ta\
    \ than in open-field conditions, especially in summer. This \nreduction in Tc-Ta\
    \ observed under netting led to a high degree of leaf cooling in this \ncropping\
    \ system. In the two seasons, CTI was lower in shaded than in open-field during\
    \ \nmost of the day. CTI and Ψstem showed a close relationship. \nConclusions\
    \ \nPlant water status indicators measurements were affected by diurnal and seasonal\
    \ \nchanges. The studied indicators showed different diurnal circadian rhythms,\
    \ with \nmaximum gs, Pn and Tc, and minimum Ψstem values recorded at midday. These\
    \ plant \nindicators were also affected by seasonal variations showing low values\
    \ in winter and \nhigh in summer. Cropping systems mainly affected leaf gas exchange\
    \ of lime trees, \nimproving the gs and Pn values of shaded trees. The monitoring\
    \ of Tc, Tc-Ta and CTI could \nserve as a good alternative to other traditional\
    \ plant water status indicators. \n \nPlants 2020, 9, 510; doi:10.3390/plants9040510\

    \ plant water status indicators are useful for managing precision irrigation in\
    \ \nregions with limited water resources. The aim of this work was to evaluate\
    \ the effect of shade \nnetting on the diurnal and seasonal variations of several\
    \ plant water status indicators in young lime \ntrees (Citrus latifolia Tan.,\
    \ cv. Bearss), grown at the CEBAS-CSIC experimental station in Murcia, \nSpain.\
    \ Stem water potential (Ψstem), leaf gas exchange (net photosynthesis (Pn) and\
    \ stomatal \nconductance (gs)), and canopy temperature (Tc) were measured on representative\
    \ days of winter \nand summer. The Ψstem daily pattern was quite similar in both\
    \ seasons under both conditions. \nHowever, the circadian rhythm of leaf gas exchange\
    \ was affected by shade conditions, especially in \nsummer, when shaded leaves\
    \ showed maximum gs values for a longer time, allowing higher net \nphotosynthesis\
    \ (37%). Canopy temperature behaved similarly in both conditions, nevertheless,\
    \ \nlower values were recorded in open-air than in shaded trees in the two seasons.\
    \ The canopy-to-air \ntemperature difference (Tc-Ta), however, was lower in shaded\
    \ trees during the daylight hours, \nindicating the higher degree of leaf cooling\
    \ that was facilitated by high gs values. The possibility of \ncontinuously recording\
    \ Tc makes it (or the proposed canopy thermal index, CTI) a promising index \n\
    for precise irrigation scheduling. Shade netting was seen to favour gas exchange,\
    \ suggesting that it \nmay be considered alternative to open-air for use in semi-arid\
    \ areas threatened by climate change. \nKeywords: canopy temperature; drip irrigation;\

    \ Introduction \nCitrus is one of the most important crops in the world, with\
    \ an annual production of 124 Mt, \nincreasing by 10 % over the last five years.\
    \ Spain is the most important citrus fruit producer in \nEurope and the largest\
    \ citrus exporter in the world (4.1 Mt) [1]. Citrus production is concentrated\
    \ in \nthe Comunidad Valenciana (3.1 Mt), Andalucía (2.2 Mt) and Region de Murcia\
    \ (0.8 Mt) [2]. In \nMurcia, lemon has traditionally been the main citrus species\
    \ (representing 64 % of the province’s \ncitrus production) [3], but in recent\
    \ years others species such as lime have contributed to \ndiversifying production,\
    \ as growers seek a higher economic return than that offered by traditional \n\
    local citrus varieties. Indeed, lime production in the region has increased by\
    \ 25% in the last three \nyears [4] and has become a good potential alternative\
    \ for growers. \nIn forthcoming years, climate change is set to increase temperatures\
    \ and hence evaporation [5], \nreducing water availability to an even greater\
    \ extent, having a detrimental effect on fruit tree \nproduction worldwide. Under\
    \ this scenario, especially in areas with limited water resources such as \nthose\
    \ in Mediterranean environments, the use of physiological water status indicators\
    \ for precision \nirrigation management is considered a suitable way of adjusting\
    \ the provided water to cover the \nneeds of plants, thus saving significant amounts\
    \ of water. Plant-based indicators rely on using the \nPlants 2020, 9, 510 \n\
    2 of 14 \n \nplant as a biosensor that integrates the soil and atmosphere water\
    \ status, as well as measuring the \nphysiological response to the water available\
    \ in the soil. The most commonly used are the \nconventional, non-automated methods\
    \ for measuring leaf or stem water potential, stomatal \nconductance or photosynthesis,\
    \ and automated methods for measuring sap flow, canopy \ntemperature, trunk diameter,\
    \ or leaf turgor pressure [6]. Canopy temperature is one of the plant \nwater\
    \ status indicators that has recently become popular due to the development of\
    \ infrared \nthermometry [6,7]. In the last few years, the use of canopy temperature\
    \ for irrigation scheduling has \nbeen tested in several fruit tree crops, including\
    \ cherry [8,9] avocado [10], almond [11], nectarine \n[12], peach [13] and also\
    \ citrus trees such as lemon [14,15]. However, less information is available \n\
    concerning lime. \nShading, which aims to protect crops against abiotic stresses\
    \ such as high air temperature or \nexcessive solar radiation, is regarded as\
    \ a good cropping technique to cope with climatic change. \nThis is likely due\
    \ to the net increases light scattering, thus reducing radiation and creating\
    \ an \noptimal microclimate for crop development [16]. As several studies have\
    \ pointed out [17,18], shaded \nconditions affect agrometeorological variables,\
    \ such as relative humidity, wind velocity and canopy \nand soil temperatures.\
    \ Additionally, changes in the microclimate can modify physiological water \n\
    status indicators. Many authors have pointed to the increased photosynthetic activity\
    \ that occurs \nunder reduced radiation, although it must be remembered that net-type\
    \ affects this response [19–21]. \nThe increase in CO2 uptake [22] and chlorophyll\
    \ synthesis [20] induced by shading has been seen to \nincrease tree growth and\
    \ fruit yield, as reported for several citrus and other woody tree species \n\
    [23–25]. Moreover, shade netting improves the quality of the fruit by boosting\
    \ protection against \nbiotic stress (diseases, insect pest) [26]. The ability\
    \ of shade netting to improve water use efficiency, \namong other physiological\
    \ traits, makes it a sound agricultural practice in areas with limited water \n\
    sources. \nFor these reasons, the aim of this study was to evaluate the diurnal\
    \ and seasonal variations of \nseveral plant water status indicators in lime trees,\
    \ making discrete measurements of stem water \npotential (stem) and leaf gas\
    \ exchange (stomatal conductance (gs) and net photosynthesis (Pn)), and \ncontinuous\
    \ measurements of canopy temperature (Tc) in a Mediterranean environment of south-east\
    \ \nSpain under two growing conditions: shade netting and open-air. \n2. Results\
    \ and Discussion \n2.1. Meteorological Conditions \nAs is typical of Mediterranean\
    \ climates, the meteorological conditions in the study area were \nmore demanding\
    \ in summer than in winter, with mean air temperature (Ta) of 26 ˚C in summer\
    \ \n(mean maximum and minimum of 32 and 21 ˚C, respectively) and 14 ˚C in winter\
    \ (mean maximum \nand minimum of 16 and 9 ˚C, respectively). Air temperature and\
    \ relative humidity (RH) were \nslightly different in the two cropping conditions\
    \ in both seasons (Figure 1). In summer (August), the \nmean open-air Ta was lower\
    \ (27.1 ˚C) and mean RH higher (65.5%) than in the shaded conditions \n(27.6 ˚C\
    \ and 64.1%, respectively). Although only slight differences were noted in the\
    \ mean values, \nthe greatest differences were found at midday, coinciding with\
    \ maximum Ta and minimum RH \nvalues (Figure 1A,B). Less pronounced differences\
    \ between cropping conditions were noted during \nwinter (February) with mean\
    \ Ta = 12.1 and 12.0 ˚C, and mean RH = 61.5 and 62.8%, for open-air and \nshaded\
    \ conditions, respectively. In this season, shaded conditions induced lower Ta\
    \ than the \nopen-air conditions during the night, but slightly higher values\
    \ during daylight hours (Figure 1C,D). \nPlants 2020, 9, 510 \n3 of 14 \n \n \n\

    \ Vertical grey lines indicate days of measurements \n(August 9th 2018 and February\
    \ 13th 2019). \nOn the selected measurement days (August 9th 2018 and February\
    \ 13th 2019), Ta varied between \n22.6 ˚C and 36.8 ˚C in summer and from 4.6 to\
    \ 15.8 ˚C in winter, in open-air conditions (Figure 2E,F). \nThe vapour pressure\
    \ deficit (VPD) showed a similar pattern, with maximal values in summer (up to\
    \ \n4 kPa) and minimal values in winter (below 1 kPa) (Figure 2C,D). However,\
    \ photosynthetically \nactive radiation (PAR) was quite similar in both seasons,\
    \ with maximum values (≈ 1900 µmol m−2 \ns−1), but with lower daylight hours in\
    \ winter (Figure 2A,B). \nRegarding the cropping conditions, the greatest differences\
    \ in the agrometeorological variables \nwere noted at midday, with higher Ta and\
    \ VPD values in the shaded than in open-air conditions \n(Figure 2). In the summer,\
    \ the maximum Ta was 2.0 ˚C lower in the open-air than under shade netting \n\
    (Figure 2E), and 1.0 ˚C lower in winter (Figure 2F). Similar results were reported\
    \ by Kührt et al. [27] in \napple trees and Alaphilippe et al. [26] in pear trees,\
    \ who observed that the air temperature in net \nconditions during daylight hours\
    \ was 0.7 ˚C higher. However, the contrary was described by Blakey et \nal. [24]\
    \ who observed that the air temperature was 2–3 ˚C lower in the shaded conditions\
    \ to cultivate \nmango trees, while Gimeno et al. [28] observed a reduction up\
    \ to 6 ˚C under the net shading cover \nprovided for lemon trees. Blakey et al.\
    \ [24] and Gimeno et al. [28] observed a reduction in the air \ntemperature of\
    \ 2–3 ˚C and 6 ˚C in mango and lemon trees, respectively under shaded conditions.\
    \ \nAlthough all netting is intended for protecting trees and fruits from sunburn,\
    \ mechanical injury \nfrom hail and wind, or other biotic/abiotic stresses, the\
    \ contrasting results could arise from the \ndifferent characteristics of the\
    \ nets (net colour, shading factor, among others) [17,18]. \nJanuary-February\n\

    \ lime trees grown in open-air (solid line) and shaded (dashed \nline) conditions.\
    \ Lines are the 15-min average values. \nAs indicated above (Figure 1), RH values\
    \ at midday were slightly lower in shade (mean 30%) \nthan in open-air (33%) conditions.\
    \ Similarly, Hunsche et al. [29] and Solomakhin and Blanke [30] \nobserved a reduction\
    \ (2–5%) in RH under netting. As a result of the higher Ta and lower RH in shade\
    \ \nconditions, VPD values were higher than in the open-air conditions, especially\
    \ in summer when the \natmospheric conditions were more demanding (Figure 2C,D).\
    \ This fact could be mediated by the \nsemi-permeable characteristics of the net\
    \ and the architecture of the net-house (see Materials and \nMethods) that caused\
    \ less air renewal and, therefore, reduced the advective effect inside the net\
    \ house. \nDuring night-time hours, Ta values were similar in both cropping conditions\
    \ in summer (Figure \n1A,2E), although there were some differences in the winter,\
    \ when Ta was lower (≈1.5 ˚C) in shaded \nthan in open-air conditions (Figures\
    \ 1C, 2F). A slight decrease in the air temperature (0.4 ˚C) during the \nnight\
    \ hours was noted under anti-hail black netting [27]. However, no differences\
    \ were noted in VPD \nvalues between cropping conditions at this time in either\
    \ season (Figure 2C,D). \nPAR values were significantly lower inside the net house\
    \ than in open-air conditions. The area \nunder the PAR curves (Figure 2A,B) shows\

    \ in PAR values in shaded lemon trees, compared with the 39 % reduction observed\
    \ \nin orange trees by Zhou et al. [21]. This reduction in the incident PAR in\
    \ the shade would be due to \nthe light scattering effect of the net, which disperses\
    \ the light and only allows part of incident \nradiation through. \n2.2. Stem\
    \ Water Potential \nDuring the experimental period, the trees were not affected\
    \ by limiting soil water conditions, as \nthe stem water potential (Ψstem) confirmed,\
    \ with values > −0.9 MPa (Figure 3A,B), indicating that the \nplant did not suffer\
    \ water stress [15,32,33]. As in most cultivated plants, Ψstem in both cropping\
    \ \nconditions showed a circadian pattern characterized by higher values at the\
    \ beginning of the day, \nafter which the values gradually decreased as evaporative\
    \ demand increased, reaching a minimum \nat around midday [15,19,34,35]. After\
    \ midday, as a consequence of a decrease in the evaporative \ndemand, the Ψstem\
    \ gradually increased until the end of the day (Figure 3A,B). \n \nFigure 3. Diurnal\
    \ course of stem water potential (Ψstem) on representative days of summer (August\
    \ 9th \n2018; A) and winter (February 13th 2019; B) in lime trees grown in open-air\
    \ (closed symbols) and \nshaded (open symbols) conditions. Each point is the average\
    \ of four replications. Vertical bars \nrepresent ± standard error (SE). Asterisks\
    \ indicate statistically significant differences between \ncropping conditions\
    \ at p ≤ 0.05. \nIn summer Ψstem values fluctuated between −0.25 and −1.0 MPa,\
    \ while in winter between −0.25 \nand −0.5 MPa. In winter, no statistically significant\
    \ differences were observed between cropping \nconditions. However, in summer,\
    \ significant differences were observed around 11:00 and 15:00 h \nsolar time\
    \ when shaded trees showed lower Ψstem values than open-air trees (Figure 3A,B).\
    \ The more \nnegative Ψstem values coincided with the higher VPD values (Figure\
    \ 2C,D), likely due to the linking \nbetween Ψstem and evaporative demand of the\
    \ atmosphere. In our experimental conditions, Ψstem was \nclosely related to VPD,\
    \ as demonstrated by the strong correlation between VPD and Ψstem (Figure 4).\
    \ \nHigher determination coefficient values (R2) were found when open-air and\
    \ shade net conditions \nwere considered separately but the covariance analysis\
    \ indicated no differences between the \nregression coefficients. Similar relationships\
    \ have been observed in studies made in lemon [15], \npeach [36], apricot [35],\
    \ almond [37] and avocado [10], highlighting the role of the atmosphere as a \n\
    driving force for the water transference processes, and emphasizing the suitability\
    \ of Ψstem as a \nrobust plant water status indicator [38–40]. \nWINTER\nSolar\

    \ courses of leaf gas exchange (stomatal conductance (gs) and net photosynthesis\
    \ \n(Pn)) pointed to maximal stomatal opening during the early morning hours and\
    \ minimum values at \nmidday [41] in both conditions, as illustrated in Figure\
    \ 5. In summer, gs in open-air grown trees \nincreased rapidly and then decreased\
    \ rapidly, whereas shaded trees maintained significantly higher \nstomatal conductance\
    \ values until midday (Figure 5A), resulting in a 54 % higher accumulated daily\
    \ \ngs compared with open-air trees. In the same way, an increase of stomatal\
    \ conductance (more than 50 \n%) was observed in several apple tree cultivars\
    \ grown under black shade net compared with those \ngrown in open-air conditions\
    \ [42]. \nA similar daily pattern was observed for net photosynthesis in summer,\
    \ with significantly \nhigher mean daily values (37 %) in shaded trees, although\
    \ a delay in reaching maximum Pn values \nwas noted with respect to open-air trees\
    \ (Figure 5C). These higher leaf gas exchange levels under \nshade conditions\
    \ could be due to the lime trees being exposed to lower incident PAR radiation\
    \ \n(Figure 2A), and such non-saturated conditions would allow the stomata to\
    \ remain open longer \n(Figure 5A). The higher stomatal opening would improve\
    \ CO2 uptake [22], increasing the \nphotosynthetic capacity of shaded trees, as\
    \ several studies have reported [16,20,43]. It should be \nmentioned that a cloudy\
    \ event (around 15:00 solar time) caused an abrupt decrease in PAR (Figure \n\
    2A) and VPD (Figure 2C) values. This unexpected condition did not consistently\
    \ affect the leaf gas \nexchange parameters (Figure 5A,C), which were following\
    \ the circadian rhythm of stomatal cycling \n(Figure 5A) as has been similarly\

    \ differences between cropping conditions at p ≤ 0.05. \nIn winter, the less demanding\
    \ climatic conditions led to lower gas exchange values, which \nbehaved similarly\
    \ in both cropping conditions, with only slight significant differences before\
    \ \nmidday when trees cultivated in the open-air had slightly higher values than\
    \ the trees grown in \nshaded conditions (Figure 5B,D). \nThe climatic conditions\
    \ clearly influenced gas exchange [44], but may also have been affected \nby the\
    \ feedback effect of the fruits on leaf photosynthesis [47], with higher Pn and\
    \ gs values recorded \nin August than in February (Figure 5). The presence of\
    \ fruits at their maximum growth rates just \nbefore harvesting (at the end of\
    \ August 2019) would have been responsible for this behaviour, as \nfound in Citrus\
    \ [15] and Prunus sp. [35,48]. \nThe daily gas exchange dynamics in both cropping\
    \ conditions showed maximum stomata \nopening and higher net photosynthesis values\
    \ early in the morning, as seen in other studies [33], \nconfirming that leaf\
    \ gas exchange in lime trees should be measured at this time of the day for \n\
    comparative purposes. Moreover, based on the higher correlations found with maximum\
    \ daily gs \nvalues [15], Ψstem should be measured at midday. \n2.4. Canopy Temperature\
    \ \nThe development of infrared thermometry techniques has made it possible to\
    \ measure canopy \ntemperature remotely, without any physical contact with the\
    \ plant. The continuous canopy \ntemperature (Tc) records for the lime trees showed\
    \ values varying from 20 to 40 °C in summer, and \nfrom 3 to 20 °C in winter (Figure\
    \ 6A,B). The minimum Tc values were recorded at the beginning and \nthe end of\
    \ the day, and maximum Tc values around midday. In both seasons, the canopy \n\

    \ \nwhen the meteorological conditions were more demanding (Figure 2), plants\
    \ grown in shade \nconditions had a higher Tc (2.70 and 2.65 ˚C, in summer and\
    \ winter, respectively) than in those \ngrown in open-air conditions (Figure 6A,B).\
    \ Blackey et al. [24] also observed an increase of 10 % in \nmaximum Tc in avocado\
    \ as a result of shade netting. However, in orange trees [21], canopy \ntemperature\
    \ was similar in non-netted (35.4 °C) and shaded (35.3 °C) trees. The slight increase\
    \ in the \nTc of shaded lime trees (Figure 6A,B) could have been due to the high\
    \ Ta and low RH values \nmeasured inside the net house at midday in both seasons\
    \ (Figure 1). However, it should be noted \nthat the microclimate of the leaf\
    \ boundary layer was slightly different from the measurements of the \nclimatic\
    \ sensors (Figure 2C,D), with lower VPDleaf values in shaded than in open-air\
    \ conditions, as \nmeasured by the LICOR, LI-6400. \n \nFigure 6. Diurnal course\

    \ \nShaded lime trees, however, showed lower values for the canopy-to-air temperature\
    \ difference \n(Tc-Ta) than the trees grown in open-air conditions, particularly\
    \ in summer, when Tc-Ta was negative \nduring the greatest part of daylight hours\
    \ (Figure 6C). This reduction in Tc-Ta led to a higher degree \nof leaf cooling\
    \ in shaded trees as a consequence of the increase in stomatal conductance in\
    \ the shade \nnet conditions (Figure 5A). In winter, Tc-Ta values were quite similar\
    \ in the two cropping conditions \nduring daylight hours, while lower values were\
    \ noted in open-air than in shaded trees during the \nnight (Figure 6D). \nCanopy\

    \ 5A). \nThe proposed canopy thermal index (CTI) based on the normalised Tc-Ta\
    \ values (equation 1) \nunder the two cropping conditions during one week of summer\
    \ and winter is presented in Figure 7. \nThe CTI pointed to lower values in shaded\
    \ than in open-air grown trees during most of the day \n(Figure 7). When the respective\
    \ measurement days are examined, a close relationship can be seen \nbetween CTI\
    \ and plant water status - the higher the CTI the lower the Ψstem -, as observed\
    \ in predawn \non August 9th (Figure 3A) and during the early afternoon of February\
    \ 13th (Figure 3B). Additionally, \nthe higher CTI values would explain the higher\

    \ 2020, 9, 510 \n10 of 14 \n \n3. Materials and Methods \n3.1. Plant Material\
    \ and Experimental Conditions \nThe experiment was carried out during the 2018–2019\
    \ growing season at the experimental field \nstation of CEBAS-CSIC in Murcia,\
    \ Spain (38° 06′ 31′’ N, 1° 02′ 14′’ W, 110 m a.s.l.). The plant material \ncomprised\
    \ three-year-old lime trees (Citrus latifolia Tan., cv. Bearss) grafted on Citrus\
    \ macrophylla L. \nrootstock. The soil of the 0–0.5 m layer was stony, highly\
    \ calcareous (45% calcium carbonate), with a \nclay loam texture and low organic\
    \ matter content. The average bulk density was 1.43 g cm−3. The soil \nwater content\
    \ at field capacity and permanent wilting point were 0.29 and 0.14 m3 m−3, respectively.\
    \ \nTrees were planted 5 m apart in raised rows (2 m wide and 0.4 m high), which\
    \ were 6 m apart. \nThe trees were irrigated with a double drip lateral line separated\
    \ 1 m, with four \npressure-compensated emitters, of 4 L h−1, located 0.7 m from\
    \ the tree trunk. The trees were irrigated \nto fulfil plant water requirements\
    \ throughout the experiment. The irrigation scheduling was \nautomated with soil\
    \ management that allowed depletion (MAD) of 10% [52]. The soil water content\
    \ \nwas monitored at a depth of 0.8 m by means of multi-depth capacitance probes\
    \ (EnviroPro®, \nEntelechy Pty. Ltd., Golden Grove, Australia) and the measurements\
    \ served as feedback for \nirrigation control by acting on electrovalves that\
    \ formed part of a telemetry system. The values were \nread every 5 min and the\
    \ averages were recorded every 15 min. The radio-transmission units sent \ndata\
    \ to a gateway connected to addVANTAGE web server software (ADCON Telemetry, Austria)\
    \ \nfor data processing and visualisation. Eight soil probes were calibrated and\
    \ installed 0.1 m from the \nselected emitter of representative trees (four for\
    \ each cropping condition). \n3.2. Cropping Conditions \nThe trees were subjected\
    \ to two cropping conditions: open-air (Figure 8A) and shade netting \n(Figure\
    \ 8B), each consisting of 60 trees. Both cases received the same amount of irrigation\
    \ water. The \nshade netting formed a net house 4.5 m high, with a zig-zag roof\
    \ (Figure 8B). The HDPE white \nagricultural net used had a 76 % light transmission\
    \ and 6 × 9 strands cm−2 (CYLNET). \nFour representative mid-row trees were selected\
    \ to monitor each cropping condition, the rest \nserving as border trees. \n \n\
    Figure 8. General view of lime trees (Citrus latifolia Tan., cv. Bearss) grown\
    \ in open-air (A) and shade \nnet house (B) conditions. \n3.3. Measurements \n\
    Precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation\
    \ were \nrecorded in real-time by an automatic weather station located at the\
    \ experimental site \n(http://www.cebas.csic.es/general_spain/est_meteo.html).\
    \ Additionally, a combined air temperature \nand relative humidity sensor was\
    \ installed at a height of 2 m in the middle of the shading net house. \nThe vapour\
    \ pressure deficit (VPD) for open-air and shade net were calculated hourly. The\
    \ \nA \nB \nPlants 2020, 9, 510 \n11 of 14 \n \nphotosynthetically active radiation\
    \ (PAR) was obtained from the measurements made by the \nquantum-sensor mounted\
    \ in the chamber of the photosynthesis system (Li-6400, LI-COR, Lincoln, \nNE,\
    \ USA). \nA typical summer (9th August 2018) and winter (13nd February 2019) day,\
    \ representative of high \nand low atmospheric water demand conditions, respectively,\
    \ served to evaluate plant water status. \nDiscrete measurements of stem water\
    \ potential (Ψstem) and leaf gas exchange were made at 1 to 2 h \nintervals. Continuous\
    \ records of canopy temperature (Tc) were recorded. \nThe Ψstem was measured with\
    \ a pressure chamber (Soil Moisture Equipment Corp., Model 3000, \nSanta Barbara,\
    \ CA, USA) in mature leaves located near the trunk on the north face of the trees.\
    \ One \nleaf per tree (four trees per cropping condition) was covered with aluminium\
    \ foil at least 2 h before \nexcision, following the recommendations described\
    \ in [53]. \nFully expanded (3 to 5 months old), sun-acclimated leaves (one leaf\
    \ per tree and four trees per \ncropping condition, from the exterior canopy were\
    \ used for gas exchange measurements: leaf net \nphotosynthetic rate (Pn), and\
    \ stomatal conductance (gs) were measured with a portable \nphotosynthesis system\
    \ (LI-6400, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA) equipped with a broad-leaf chamber (6 \n\
    cm2). Measurements were taken at near-constant ambient CO2 concentration (≈ 400\
    \ µmol mol−1) and \nthe airflow rate inside the chamber was about 350 µmol s−1.\
    \ \nCanopy temperature (Tc) was monitored using infrared radiometer sensors (Model\
    \ SI-431 \nseries, Apogee Instruments, Inc., Logan, UT, USA). The sensors were\
    \ mounted on galvanized metal \npoles and installed 0.5 m above the tree canopy\
    \ on two representative trees for each cropping \ncondition. The half field of\
    \ view (FOV) of these sensors was 14°, covering an area of 488 cm2 of the \ntree\
    \ canopy. The IRT sensors were calibrated by the manufacturer. They were connected\
    \ to the \nwireless sensor network, reading the values every 5 min and recording\
    \ average values every 15 min. \nThe average values of Tc were computed and Tc−Ta\
    \ values were calculated for open-air and \nshade conditions. The following index\
    \ is proposed, based on 15-min lapsed Tc−Ta values. The canopy \nthermal index\
    \ (CTI) was formulated as: \n\x01\x02\x03 =\n(\x02\x06 − \x02\b) − (\x02\x06 −\
    \ \x02\b)\n\v\f\n(\x02\x06 − \x02\b)\n\b\r − (\x02\x06 − \x02\b)\n\v\f\n \n(1)\
    \ \nwhere, (Tc−Ta)min: minimum Tc−Ta daily value and (Tc-Ta)max: maximum daily\
    \ Tc−Ta value. The index \nvaries between 0 and 1. \n3.4. Statistical Analysis\
    \ \nData were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistic software (version 25, SPSS Inc.,\
    \ Chicago, IL, USA \n2002). Analysis of variance was performed and the mean values\
    \ were compared by LSD0.05 test. \nRelationships between parameters were fitted\
    \ to linear regressions. \n4. Conclusions \nThe behaviour of plant water status\
    \ indicators in lime trees and agro-meteorological variables \nwere affected by\
    \ both diurnal and seasonal changes and cropping conditions. The studied indicators\
    \ \nidentified different circadian rhythms, with maximum gas exchange and canopy\
    \ temperature, and \nminimum stem water potential values, recorded at midday.\
    \ Moreover, these plant indicators \naffected by seasonal variations had lower\
    \ values in winter when the atmospheric demand conditions \nwere also lower. The\
    \ cropping conditions mainly affected the gas exchange of young lime tree \nleaves,\
    \ the stomata of plants cultivated in the shaded conditions closing later and\
    \ reaching \nmaximum values after the plants cultivated in open-air. This would\
    \ favour plant cooling, as \nindicated by the more negative values of the canopy-to-air\
    \ temperature difference in summer. Then, \nshade netting is an interesting cropping\
    \ technique and increasingly recognised as an alternative to \nopen-air in semi-arid\
    \ areas threatened by climate change, as the resulting increase in leaf gas \n\
    exchange would favour carbon assimilation. \nDue to the circadian rhythms of the\
    \ plant water status indicators in leaves, we recommend that \nthe stem water\
    \ potential be determined at midday, coinciding with the maximum evaporative \n\
    Plants 2020, 9, 510 \n12 of 14 \n \ndemand of the atmosphere and that gas exchange\
    \ is measured early in the morning before the \nstomata of the lime leaves close.\
    \ \nThe continuous measurement of canopy temperature using robust wireless infrared\
    \ \nradiometers could serve as a good alternative to other classical physiological\
    \ measurements for \nmeasuring plant water status. Although more research is needed\
    \ on the use of ground-based \nthermal imagery to detect water stress threshold\
    \ values in lime trees, the proposed canopy thermal \nindex (CTI), virtually independent\
    \ of the season of the year, could be used for tuning irrigation \nscheduling\
    \ in areas where the scarcity of water resources demands precise irrigation. \n\

    Objectives \nThe main purposes of this study was: (i) to assess plant and soil\
    \ water status and \nthermal response of lime trees to shading and soil water\
    \ deficits conditions and (ii) to \ndetermine threshold thermal-based values for\
    \ irrigation management. \nMaterials and Methods \n The experiment was conducted\
    \ during summer-autumn of 2021 at the \nexperimental field station of CEBAS-CSIC\
    \ in Murcia, Spain. The experimental plot of \n0.8 ha was cultivated with Bearss\
    \ lime trees (Citrus latifolia Tan.) grafted onto Citrus \nmacrophylla L. rootstock.\
    \ The trees were planted on 2016, on ridges at 6 m × 5 m tree \nspacing. They\
    \ were irrigated with a double drip lateral line, with four pressure-\ncompensated\
    \ emitters, of 4 L h−1 per tree. Irrigation was automatically managed based on\
    \ \nthreshold values of volumetric soil water content (θv) measured with TDR sensors.\
    \ The \nthreshold values of θv were fixed to 30 % management allowed depletion\
    \ and field \ncapacity to trigger and stop irrigation, respectively. The trees\
    \ were grown in two cropping \nsystems: open-field and shade netting. Each cropping\
    \ system was subjected to control \n(well irrigated) and stress (non-irrigated\
    \ from 7th June to 24th September 2021) treatments. \nEnvironmental data in open-field\
    \ and shaded conditions were real-time monitored by two \nautomatic weather stations.\
    \ Along the experimental period, plant water status was \nassessed by discrete\
    \ measurements of stem water potential (Ψstem), by a pressure chamber, \nand net\
    \ photosynthesis (Pn) and stomatal conductance (gs), with a portable photosynthesis\
    \ \nsystem. Additionally, canopy temperature (Tc) was continuously monitored with\
    \ infrared \nradiometer sensors. Subsequently, canopy to air temperature difference\
    \ (Tc-Ta), crop \nwater stress index (CWSI), canopy thermal index (CTI) and daily\
    \ integral thermal index \n(ΣTc-Ta) were calculated. In addition, the relationship\
    \ between Ψstem and Tc-Ta data in the \ntwo cropping systems studied was also\
    \ assessed from an irrigation management point of \nview. Plant and soil water\
    \ status were measured in four trees per irrigation treatment-\ncropping system,\
    \ each considered as a replication. \nResults and Discussion \n Control trees\
    \ of both cropping systems showed Ψstem values ranging from -0.59 to \n-1.19 MPa\
    \ pointed to an optimal water status, as revealed the high θv values in the active\
    \ \nroot zone. Ψstem gradually fell in stressed lime trees as θv values decreased.\
    \ In the two \ncropping systems studied, the soil drying curve showed a breaking\
    \ point, indicating the \nCHAPTER IV: ARTICLE III \n70 \n \nbeginning of severe\
    \ water stress in lime trees. This breaking point occurred earlier in \nopen-field\
    \ than in shaded conditions. When the soil water stress was moderate, lower \n\
    values of Ψstem, θv, gs and Pn, were observed in open-field than in shaded conditions,\
    \ \nindicating that shade netting conditions allowed better soil-plant water status.\
    \ When soil \nwater stress was severe, these water status indicators showed similar\
    \ and low values in \nboth cropping systems. When the water restrictions ended,\
    \ Ψstem, θv, gs and Pn gradually \nincreased to reach control values. Tc values\
    \ were higher in stress than in control trees in \nthe two cropping systems studied,\
    \ since in stress conditions a stomatal closing was \nfavoured, promoting a canopy\
    \ warming. Tc-Ta values were the lowest in shaded \nconditions, indicative of\
    \ good coupling plant-ambient in this cropping system. Higher \nvalues of CWSI,\
    \ CTI and ΣTc-Ta were observed in stressed trees than in control ones of \nboth\
    \ cropping systems indicating a worse plant water status.  \nThe midday Tc-Ta\
    \ threshold values proposed for triggering drip irrigation in lime \ntrees grown\
    \ under semi-arid conditions were 2.4 or 0.8 ◦C for open-field and shaded \nconditions,\
    \ respectively, when irrigation water availability allowed to fulfil plant water\
    \ \nrequirements. Under deficit irrigation conditions, the proposed values were\
    \ 2.9 or 1.3 ◦C, \nfor moderate water deficits (Ψstem = -1.5 MPa) and 3.4 or 1.8\
    \ ◦C, for severe water deficits \n(Ψstem = -2 MPa), for open-field and shaded\
    \ lime trees, respectively. \nConclusions \nThe response of lime trees to soil\
    \ water deficit was different in the two cropping \nsystems. Additionally, the\
    \ ability to detect water stress also differed for the soil and plant \nwater\
    \ status indicators studied. Even though drawbacks, Ψstem was a reliable tool\
    \ for \nassessing lime tree water status and along with the breaking point of\
    \ θv was useful for \nirrigation monitoring. Tc-Ta dynamics reflected the “heartbeat”\
    \ of lime trees. Soil water \ncontent sensors anticipated water stress detection\
    \ than thermal-based ones. The high Ψstem \ngs, Pn, and low Tc-Ta values observed\
    \ under netting, revealed that shading allowed a better \nsoil-plant water status.\
    \ The cropping system must be considered to propose Tc-Ta \nthreshold values for\
    \ lime irrigation management.\nAgricultural Water Management 272 (2022) 107843\n\

    \   \nMost lime trees are cultivated under open-field conditions. However, in\
    \ the Mediterranean area some growers \nuse shade screen to protect their orchards\
    \ against abiotic and biotic stresses, inducing changes in the plant’s \nsurrounding\
    \ microclimate that could affect its water status. This field experiment focuses\
    \ on the effect of shade \nscreen (high density polyethylene white net with 76%\
    \ light transmission) and irrigation on plant and soil water \nstatus of Bearss\
    \ lime trees. Two irrigation treatments were applied during the summer-autumn\
    \ to open-field and \nshaded lime trees: irrigated (control) and non-irrigated\
    \ (stress). Volumetric soil water content (θv), air temper-\nature (Ta) and canopy\
    \ temperature (Tc) were real-time monitored and several derived thermal indices\
    \ were \ncalculated. Stem water potential (Ψstem) and leaf gas exchange: net photosynthesis\
    \ (Pn) and stomatal conductance \n(gs) were measured on representative days. Withholding\
    \ irrigation caused a gradual decline in soil and plant \nwater status. θv decreased\
    \ from the outset in the non-irrigated treatments, showing breaking point connecting\
    \ the \nrapid and the slower soil drying processes. Significant differences in\
    \ Ψstem, and gs values were observed between \ncontrols and stressed trees 15\
    \ days after stress initiation. During early stages of water stress, lime trees\
    \ cultivated \nin open-field showed lower values of soil and plant water status\
    \ than those grown in shaded conditions. However, \nat the end of stress period,\
    \ similar values were noted for both cropping systems, pointing to severe water\
    \ deficit. \nTc and Tc-Ta values reflected the current lime tree water status.\
    \ The soil water content sensors anticipated the \nplant water stress situation\
    \ respect to thermal ones. The higher θv, Ψstem, gs, Pn and Tc values registered\
    \ in shaded \nlime trees revealed that shading allowed better soil-plant water\
    \ status and a 12-day window of opportunity to \nrespond to the imposed soil water\
    \ deficits. Threshold thermal-based values are proposed for precise irrigation\
    \ \nmanagement of lime trees in open-field and shaded conditions.   \n1. Introduction\
    \ \nLime tree are gaining in importance as an agricultural crop. Although \nnative\
    \ to South-Central China, Brazil is nowadays the main lime pro-\nducer, followed\
    \ by Mexico, Iran, Egypt and Colombia (CIRAD, 2021). \nHowever, recently its cultivation\
    \ has extended to the Mediterranean \narea, since it is well adapted to semiarid\
    \ conditions. Due to climatic \nchange (IPCC, 2021), the warmer climate may make\
    \ this area even more \nbeneficial for lime production, although the shortage\
    \ of water means \nadopting more efficient water management and cultivation practices\
    \ \nthat promote water saving. Monitoring the parameters of the \nsoil-plant-atmosphere\
    \ system is decisive for evaluating the plant re-\nsponses to irrigation regimes\
    \ and crop cropping system, allowing the \nprovided water to be adjusted to the\
    \ plant’s water requirements (Mir-\na-García et al., 2020). \nSoil water status\
    \ was assessed by soil water content (θv) measure-\nments, traditionally by gravimetric\
    \ methods, which are destructive, \ntime-consuming and not repeatable. Nowadays,\
    \ other indirect methods \nbased on the physical and chemical soil properties\
    \ like time domain \nreflectometry (TDR), capacitance and impedance are gaining\
    \ impor-\ntance (Hardie, 2020; Vera et al., 2021). The plant itself has long been\
    \ \nrecognized as the best indicator of its water status, which can be assessed\
    \ \nby direct measurements of leaf (Ψleaf) or stem water potentials (Ψstem), \n\
    or indirectly by reference to leaf gas exchange parameters (stomatal \nconductance\
    \ (gs), net photosynthesis (Pn)), traditionally considered as \ngood plant water\
    \ status indicators for irrigation scheduling purposes \n(Cifre et al., 2005;\
    \ García-Orellana et al., 2013; Hernandez-Santana \net al., 2019; Mir´as-Avalos\
    \ et al., 2016). However, the draw-back of the \nmanual measurements, is that\
    \ they are laborious, destructive and \ntime-consuming (Ballester et al., 2013b;\
    \ García-Tejero et al., 2011). \n* Corresponding author. \nE-mail address: mcruiz@cebas.csic.es\

    \ the progress made in telemetry have allowed real-time \nmonitoring of other\
    \ indirect plant-based water status indicators, such as \ntrunk diameter shrinkage,\
    \ sap flow or leaf turgor (Conejero et al., 2011; \nFern´andez, 2017; Rodriguez-Dominguez\
    \ et al., 2019). Also, canopy \ntemperature (Tc), long recognized as an indicator\
    \ of plant water status \n(Costa et al., 2013; Gates, 1964; Jones, 2004), can\
    \ be in-situ or remotely \nmeasured by infra-red thermometry or thermal imaging,\
    \ using infra-red \nradiometer sensors or thermal cameras. Thus, the measurement\
    \ of Tc is a \nreliable, rapid and non-destructive technique for monitoring plant\
    \ water \nstatus (Blaya-Ros et al., 2020; Leinonen et al., 2006; Romero-Trigueros\
    \ \net al., 2019). It is well known that Tc is influenced by atmospheric \nconditions\
    \ such as vapour pressure deficit and radiation level, among \nothers (Zhang et\
    \ al., 2017). To attenuate the effect of these environ-\nmental variables on the\
    \ absolute values of Tc different thermal indices \nhave been proposed: the difference\
    \ between canopy and air temperature \n(Tc-Ta), and the crop water stress index\
    \ (CWSI) are the most performing \n(Idso et al., 1981; Jackson et al., 1981).\
    \ Also, regression models have \nbeen suggested to predict leaf water potential\
    \ based on Tc or CWSI \nvalues in Prunus (Tormann, 1986; Wang and Gartung, 2010),\
    \ and Citrus \n(Cohen et al., 2005). \nIn addition, shade screen protect crops\
    \ against abiotic stresses, such \nas adverse weather conditions, or biotic stresses\
    \ such as pests and dis-\neases (Mditshwa et al., 2019). This cropping system\
    \ reduces the \nincoming radiation (García-S´anchez et al., 2015), affecting the\
    \ micro-\nclimate surrounding the plants and hence their physiological behaviour\
    \ \n(Manja and Aoun, 2019). In this sense, Incesu et al. (2016) observed an \n\
    increase in the photosynthesis rate in ‘Lane Late’ oranges cultivated \nunder\
    \ black netting, while Jifon and Syvertsen (2003) observed lower Tc \nvalues in\
    \ ‘Red Ruby’ grapefruit trees under aluminized screens. \nWhereas, shaded avocado\
    \ trees showed increased Tc with respect to \ntrees in open-field conditions (Blakey\
    \ et al., 2016). \nThis study is aimed to assess plant/soil water status and thermal\
    \ \nresponse of young lime trees to shading and soil water deficits. For this\
    \ \npurpose, the following objectives were proposed: (i) to evaluate the \nability\
    \ of discrete (Ψstem, gs and Pn) and continuous plant (Tc) and soil \n(θv) water\
    \ status indicators to detect water stress, (ii) to identify the best \nperforming\
    \ thermal-based indices, and (iii) to determine threshold \nthermal-based values\
    \ for irrigation management in semi-arid conditions. \nTo do this, it was necessary\
    \ to measure plant/soil water status and \nthermal-based indices under well-watered\
    \ and water deficit conditions \nin shaded and non-shaded trees. We tested the\
    \ hypothesis that micro-\nclimate caused by shade screen could affect these parameters\
    \ in shaded \nvs. non-shaded lime trees. This information will be relevant in\
    \ a future to \nmanage the irrigation in a higher efficient way. \n2. Materials\
    \ and methods \n2.1. Experimental site and plant material \nThe experiment was\
    \ conducted during spring-summer-autumn of \n2021 from DOY (day of year) 152–304\
    \ at the CEBAS-CSIC experimental \nfield station located in Santomera, Murcia,\
    \ southeaster Spain (38◦06′31′′\nN, 1◦02′14′′ W, 110 m above sea level). The experimental\
    \ plot of 0.8 ha \nwas cultivated with ‘Bearss’ lime trees (Citrus latifolia Tan.)\
    \ grafted onto \nCitrus macrophylla L. rootstocks, planted on 2016, on ridges\
    \ (2 m wide \nand 0.4 m high) at 6 m × 4 m tree spacing. The soil had a clay loam\
    \ \ntexture, average bulk density of 1.43 g cm−3, calcium carbonate content \n\
    of 45 %, and organic matter content of 1.4 %. The volumetric soil water \ncontent\
    \ (θv) at field capacity (FC) and permanent wilting point (WP) \nwere 0.33 and\
    \ 0.14 m3 m−3, respectively, obtained from the textural \ndata (Saxton et al.,\
    \ 1986). \nTrees were drip-irrigated with a double line per tree row separated\
    \ 1 \nm from each other, with four pressure-compensated emitters (4 L h−1) \n\
    per tree, all located 0.7 m from the tree trunk. Irrigation was automat-\nically\
    \ managed in the two cropping systems by monitoring θv in the \nactive root zone\
    \ (0.2–0.6 m soil profile), following the approach \ndescribed below for the control\
    \ treatment (sub-Section 2.2). Fertiliza-\ntion and weed and pest control were\
    \ carried out following the local \npractices of Citrus farmers. \n2.2. Cropping\
    \ systems and irrigation treatments \nIn this experiment two cropping systems\
    \ were studied: open-field \nand shade screen, each subjected to irrigated and\
    \ non-irrigated \ntreatments:  \n• Open-field cropping: lime trees grown under\
    \ natural ambient \nconditions, representing the most common agricultural practice\
    \ \n(Fig. 1A).  \n• Shade-screen cropping: lime trees grown in a 2400 m2 shade\
    \ screen \nhouse, 4.5 m high and with a zigzag roof (Fig. 1B). The high density\
    \ \npolyethylene white net used had 76 % light transmission and 6 × 9 \nstrands\
    \ cm−2. Shade screen was installed on April 2018.  \n• Irrigated treatment as\
    \ “control”: trees were irrigated to fulfil their \nwater requirements throughout\
    \ the experiment. The irrigation pro-\ntocol was automated, based on real-time\
    \ θv threshold values that \nacted on solenoid valves by means of a telemetry\
    \ system. Volumetric \nsoil water content was monitored by TDR sensors (model\
    \ 315 H, \nAcclima, Inc., USA) horizontally installed 0.1 m from the emitter and\
    \ \ncloser to the tree trunk, on representative lime trees at depths of 0.2, \n\
    0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 m. The values were read every 5 min and the av-\nerages were\
    \ recorded every 15 min. Radio-transmission units sent \ndata to a gateway connected\
    \ to an addVANTAGE cloud-based web \nserver platform (ADCON Telemetry, Klosterneuburg,\
    \ Austria) for \ndata processing and visualisation. Threshold θv values were based\
    \ on \nthe management allowed depletion (MAD) concept (Allen et al., \n1998; Merriam,\
    \ 1966), as a percentage (α) of the total available soil \nwater content (AWC)\
    \ that can be depleted (MAD = α AWC), where \nAWC = FC – WP. Irrigation was automatically\
    \ activated when mean \nθv values at 0.2–0.6 m soil depth (active root zone) reached\
    \ 30 % of \nAWC, and stopped at FC.  \n• Non-irrigated treatment as “stress”:\
    \ irrigation was withheld from \n7th June to 24th September 2021 (DOY 158–267),\
    \ coinciding with \nstage II of lime fruit growth. Before and after these dates,\
    \ irrigation \ndoses were the same as for control treatment. \nEach cropping system\
    \ consisted of a sub-plot of 60 lime trees. The \nirrigation treatments were distributed\
    \ in shaded and open-field condi-\ntions in a completely randomised design, with\
    \ four replications, each \nreplication consisting of one row of six trees, with\
    \ a total of 24 trees per \nirrigation treatment. One tree from each replication\
    \ served for mea-\nsurements and the rest of the plot were considered as borders.\
    \ \n2.3. Measurements \nEnvironmental data, in both open-field and shaded conditions,\
    \ were \nmonitored by two automatic weather stations located in the both sub-\
    \ \nplots. Values of air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), wind \nspeed,\
    \ solar radiation and precipitation were read every 5 min and the \naverages were\
    \ recorded every 15 min and transmitted to the cloud- \nbased web server platform\
    \ (sub-Section 2.2). The photosynthetically \nactive radiation (PAR) was measured\
    \ by the quantum-sensor mounted in \nthe chamber of the portable photosynthesis\
    \ system (model LI-6400, LI- \nCOR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Also monitored were hourly\
    \ crop reference \nevapotranspiration (ET0), following Penman-Monteith’ s equation\
    \ and \nvapour pressure deficit (VPD) (Allen et al., 1998). Daily average VPD\
    \ for \neach cropping condition was calculated from daily maximum and min-\nimum\
    \ Ta and RH data. \nVolumetric soil water content (θv) was monitored through the\
    \ \n0.2–0.8 m soil profile, every 0.2 m, using Acclima-TDR 315H sensors, \nA.B.\

    \       \nAgricultural Water Management 272 (2022) 107843\n3\nhorizontally installed\
    \ 0.1 m away the emitter on representative trees \n(three out of four in each\
    \ irrigation treatment and cropping system, \nn = 3). Values for θv were obtained\
    \ as indicated above (sub-Section 2.2); \na detailed description of the operation\
    \ of these dielectric sensors can be \nfound in Vera et al. (2021). \nStem water\
    \ potential (Ψstem) was determined around midday (12:00 \nsolar time) every ≈\
    \ 15 days on fully expanded leaves (one leaf per tree \nand replicate for each\
    \ treatment and cropping system, n = 4), using a \npressure chamber (model 3000,\
    \ Soil Moisture Equipment Corp., Cali-\nfornia, USA) and following the recommendations\
    \ of Hsiao (1990). \nLeaves, which had been bagged with foil-covered aluminium\
    \ envelopes \nat least 2 h before the measurements were taken (McCutchan and \n\
    Shackel, 1992), came from the north-facing side of the trees. \nLeaf gas exchange,\
    \ i.e. stomatal conductance (gs) and net photo-\nsynthetic rate (Pn), were measured\
    \ on the same days and in the same \ntrees as Ψstem, at around 08:00 solar time,\
    \ with a portable photosynthesis \nsystem (model LI-6400, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE,\
    \ USA) equipped with a \nbroad-leaf chamber (6 cm2) and CO2 injector. Measurements\
    \ were taken \nat a constant light intensity (≈1200 µmol m−2 s−1) provided by\
    \ the red \nand blue LED source mounted on the leaf chamber. The CO2 concen-\n\
    tration and airflow rate inside the chamber were maintained at \n≈ 400 µmol mol−1\
    \ and 350 µmol s−1, respectively. Sun-exposed fully \nexpanded leaves (one-two\
    \ leaves per tree and replicate for each treat-\nment and cropping system, n =\
    \ 4) were selected for measurements. \nCanopy temperature (Tc) was real-time monitored\
    \ using infra-red \nradiometer sensors (model SI-431 series, Apogee Instruments,\
    \ Inc., \nLogan, UT, USA). Six sensors were installed for each cropping system,\
    \ \nthree per irrigation treatment (n = 3). Each sensor was mounted on a \nbracket\
    \ attached to an aluminium pole, installed 6 m from the lime tree \nrow, aimed\
    \ at the middle south-facing side of the tree canopy (Fig. 2). \nThe half field\
    \ of view (FOV) of these sensors was 14◦, with a response \ntime of 0.1 s. The\
    \ sensors were calibrated by the manufacturer, with an \naccuracy of ± 0.2 ◦C.\
    \ They were connected to the cloud-based web \nserver platform (sub-Section 2.2),\
    \ which read Tc values every 5 min and \nrecorded average values every 15 min\
    \ \nThe following thermal-based indices were calculated throughout the \nexperimental\
    \ period: \n(i) Tc –Ta: the difference between canopy and the surrounding air\
    \ \ntemperature. \n(ii) CWSI (crop water stress index): calculated empirically\
    \ according \nto the equation described by Idso et al. (1981): \nCWSI =\n(Tc −\

    \ Water Stressed Baseline (NWSB), which is \nequivalent to a canopy transpiring\
    \ at the potential rate, and (Tc-Ta)UL is \nthe upper limit, which corresponds\
    \ to a canopy where transpiration has \nceased. The linear relationship between\
    \ Tc-Ta and VPD for well irrigated \ntrees (control treatment) was used to establish\
    \ the NWSB for each \ncropping condition. (Tc-Ta)LL was calculated by solving\
    \ the NWSB \nequation for the actual VPD. The (Tc-Ta)UL was a fixed value, taken\
    \ from \nthe maximum Tc-Ta value recorded in the stressed lime trees during the\
    \ \nexperiment. Only cloudless days were selected for the NWSB determi-\nnation\

    \ 25 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA), to \ndiscriminate between time and irrigation treatment–cropping\
    \ system \neffects. Post hoc pair-wise comparison between all means was performed\
    \ \nby the Least Significant Difference test at p < 0.05 (LSD0.05). Linear re-\n\
    gressions, Pearson´s correlation (R2), and the mean squared error (MSE) \nwere\
    \ used to assess the significance of the relationships between the \nmeasured\
    \ indicators. \n3. Results \n3.1. Soil-plant-atmosphere water status \nDuring\
    \ the experimental period, the reference crop evapotranspira-\ntion (ET0) varied\
    \ greatly from day to day, with higher values registered \nin open-field than\
    \ in shaded conditions (Fig. 3A). The maximum daily \nET0 values were noted in\
    \ mid-June (7.32 mm d−1), and the minimum at \nthe end of October (0.54 mm d−1)\
    \ in open-field conditions. Shaded \ncondition reduced ET0 by an average of 28\
    \ %, varying from the \nmaximum of 4.30 to the minimum of 0.59 mm d−1 in June\
    \ and October, \nrespectively (Fig. 3A). \nThe discrete measurements of plant\
    \ water status, on representative \ndays during the experimental period, showed\
    \ values of stem water po-\ntential (Ψstem) ranging from − 0.59 to − 1.19 MPa\
    \ in control trees of \nboth cropping systems (Fig. 3B). In turn, the real-time\
    \ soil water content \n(θv), on the same control trees, showed in the active root\
    \ zone \n(0.2–0.6 m), mean similar values in open-field (33.01 %) and in shaded\
    \ \nconditions (32.22 %) (Fig. 3C). However, higher θv at 0.8 m was \nobserved\
    \ in shaded conditions as irrigation episodes were not observed \nto reach this\
    \ depth in open-field conditions, or even was showed lower \nθv values (data not\
    \ shown). \nWithholding irrigation caused a gradual decline in soil and plant\
    \ \nwater status parameters (Fig. 3B, C). Ψstem values were statistically \nlower\
    \ in stressed than in control trees from the beginning of the stress in \nboth\
    \ cropping systems (Fig. 3B). In the early stages of water stress, lower \nvalues\
    \ of Ψstem were noted in open-field than in shaded conditions \n(Fig. 3B). Nevertheless,\
    \ as the stress progressed, Ψstem continued to \ndecrease in both cropping systems\
    \ with not statistically significant dif-\nferences between non-irrigated treatments\
    \ (Sopen-field and Sshaded) \n(Fig. 3B). \nAn earlier and more abrupt decrease\
    \ in θv was observed in non- \nirrigated open-field lime trees compared with shaded\
    \ trees. The θv \nvalues were lower in stressed open-field lime trees up to mid-July,\
    \ after \nwhich the decrease was similar in both cropping systems (Fig. 3C). At\
    \ \nthe end of the stress period (DOY 267), minimum values were recorded \nfor\
    \ both water status indicators, with statistically similar values in open- \n\
    field (θv = 17.5 % and Ψstem = −2.98 MPa) and in shaded (θv = 17.6 % \nand Ψstem\
    \ = −3.1 MPa) (Fig. 3B, C) conditions. \nIn addition, two phases were detected\
    \ in the soil drying curve of \nstressed lime trees, as drawn in Fig. 3C. A first\
    \ sharp reduction in θv \nvalues was observed (phase I), followed by a slower\
    \ rate of reduction \n(phase II). Phase I corresponded to DOY 173–189 in the case\
    \ of open- \nfield conditions, while it lasted from DOY 173–201 in shaded condi-\n\
    tions. During this phase, θv decreased by ≈ 30 % in both cropping sys-\ntems.\

    5\nperiod: DOY 189–259, and DOY 201–259, in open-field and shaded \nconditions,\
    \ respectively, θv decreased at a slower rate than during phase \nI. The breaking\
    \ point of these two phases occurred earlier in open-field \nthan in shaded conditions,\
    \ but at a similar θv value (≈ 20 %) in both \ncropping systems (Fig. 3C). This\
    \ intersection point of θv matched a \nsimilar value of Ψstem ≈ −2 MPa, which\
    \ was reached earlier in open- \nfield than in shaded lime trees (Fig. 3B). \n\
    During the recovery period, when the water restrictions ended and \nthe stressed\
    \ trees were irrigated the same as control trees (from DOY \n259–298), a gradual\
    \ increase in both θv and Ψstem values was observed. \nSimilar values of θv were\
    \ noted in stressed and control trees 15 days after \nre-irrigation (Fig. 3C),\
    \ whereas Ψstem recovered control values after one \nmonth, in both cropping systems\
    \ (Fig. 3B). \n3.2. Leaf gas exchange \nLeaf gas exchange measurement in well\
    \ irrigated trees showed high \nvalues of stomatal conductance (gs), and net photosynthesis\
    \ (Pn) (Fig. 4). \nShade screen reduced the incident photosynthetically active\
    \ radiation \n(PAR) by 22–47 % compared with the open-field conditions, with the\
    \ \nmaximum reduction observed in July-August corresponding to the \nmonths of\
    \ highest evaporative demanding (data not shown). A similar \nseasonally fluctuating\
    \ trend was noted in gs and Pn values in the control \ntrees in both cropping\
    \ systems. Nevertheless, average values were \nsignificantly higher in shaded\
    \ than in open-field conditions (Fig. 4), \nespecially apparent for gs, with a\
    \ seasonal value of 105.5 and \n122.3 mmol m−2 s−1 in open-field and shaded control\
    \ trees, respec-\ntively. However, similar average values of Pn (11.1 and 10.6\
    \ µmol m−2 \ns−1) were noted in open-field and shaded trees, respectively. \n\
    When the water stress was applied, the leaf gas exchange parameters \ngradually\
    \ fell in both cropping systems (Fig. 4). Values of gs in the \ncontrol and stressed\
    \ treatments statistically differed when irrigation \nbegan to be withheld in\
    \ both cropping systems (Fig. 4A). In the early \nstages of water stress, a greater\
    \ decrease in gs and Pn was noted in the \nFig. 4. Leaf gas exchange values during\

    under shade screen, respectively. At the end of the stress period, leaf gas \n\
    exchange values were low in the stressed lime trees, with no significant \ndifferences\
    \ between cropping systems, gs ≈ 23 mmol m−2 s−1 and Pn \n≈ 3.2 µmol m−2 s−1 (Fig.\
    \ 4). When the water stress period finished and \nall the trees were fully irrigated,\
    \ gs and Pn gradually increased, reaching \nsimilar values to those of the control\
    \ trees after one month (Fig. 4). \n3.3. Canopy temperature and thermal-based\
    \ indices \nDuring the experimental period, real-time canopy temperature (Tc)\
    \ \nrevealed widely varying daily values, with lower values recorded during \n\
    night periods (always > 10 ◦C in both cropping systems and irrigation \ntreatments)\
    \ and higher during light-hours. The maximum Tc values were \n44.5 and 45.7 ◦C\
    \ in the control trees grown in open-field and shaded \nconditions, respectively,\
    \ and up to 48 ◦C in both stress treatments (data \nnot shown). Fig. 5 shows Tc\
    \ and ambient conditions (Ta and VPD) for the \ndays when Ψstem and leaf gas exchange\
    \ were measured. The daily dy-\nnamics of VPD and Ta values revealed higher values\
    \ in the atmosphere \nsurrounding the lime trees grown in shade screen than in\
    \ open-field \nconditions during the daytime. Nevertheless, during the night,\
    \ the \nopposite was noted (Fig. 5A). It was clear that for both irrigation \n\
    treatments and cropping systems, the night-time Tc values remained \nabove 14\
    \ ◦C during the stress period and decreased to 10 ◦C during the \nrecovery period.\
    \ Maximum daily Tc values were observed at midday \n(around 12:00–14:00 GMT+2),\
    \ coinciding with the highest daily VPD \nand Ta values (Fig. 5A). The greatest\
    \ differences between irrigation \ntreatments and cropping systems were detected\
    \ at this time of the day, \nwith Tc being higher in lime trees grown in shaded\
    \ (Fig. 5C) than in \nopen-field conditions (Fig. 5B). For instance, on DOY 179\
    \ and 200, Tc \nexceeded 40 ◦C in open-field lime trees, while the same occurred\
    \ on four \ndays in shaded conditions. \nDaylight Tc was higher in stressed than\
    \ in control trees, especially at \nmidday, when differences were up to 6 and\
    \ 5 ◦C, in open-field (Fig. 5B) \nand shaded conditions (Fig. 5C), respectively.\
    \ This was more evident \nfrom DOY 173 and 189 onwards in open-field and shaded\
    \ conditions, \nrespectively. Tc in stressed trees remained above control values\
    \ during \nthe greatest part of the day and night hours in open-field trees. However,\
    \ \nin shaded conditions stressed trees showed similar or even lower values \n\
    of Tc than control trees during night-hours. During the recovery period, \nTc\
    \ as well as Ta and VPD values were lower than during the stress period, \nand\
    \ the Tc of the stress treatments recovered to reach similar values to \nthose\
    \ of the control at the end of the experimental period (DOY 298). \nTo normalize\
    \ the absolute value of Tc respect to Ta, several thermal- \nbased indices (Tc-Ta,\
    \ CWSI, CTI* and ∑Tc-Ta) were calculated \nthroughout the experimental period\
    \ (stress and recovery) in the \ndifferent irrigation treatments and cropping\
    \ systems studied. The can-\nopy to air temperature difference (Tc-Ta) varied\
    \ on a diurnal basis \n(Fig. 6) but to a lesser extent than Tc (Fig. 5B, C). Canopy\
    \ temperature \nremained below Ta during most of the daylight hours, with negative\
    \ Tc- \nTa values corresponding to night periods. Independently of the cropping\
    \ \nsystems, the highest Tc-Ta values were observed in stressed trees \n(Fig.\
    \ 6C, E). \nFurthermore, higher values of this thermal index were recorded in\
    \ \nopen-field (Fig. 6B, C) than in shaded conditions (Fig. 6D, E), again \nindependently\
    \ of the irrigation treatment. Average 15-min values of Tc- \nTa during the experimental\
    \ period was negative in control trees \n(−0.2 ◦C, in both cropping systems) and\
    \ positive in stressed trees (0.6 \nand 0.2 ◦C, in open-air and shaded conditions,\
    \ respectively). It can also \nbe observed in Fig. 6, that daily maximum Tc-Ta\
    \ in the control trees \nvaried around average value of 4.3 and 2.6 ◦C, in open-field\
    \ and shaded \nconditions, respectively, while they were 6.3 and 4.4 ◦C in the\
    \ stress \ntreatments, in open-field and shaded conditions, respectively (as out-\n\
    lined in Fig. 6B, C and D, F, respectively). Moreover, wider fluctuations \nin\
    \ daily Tc-Ta values were noted in stressed trees (Fig. 6C, E) than in \ncontrols\
    \ trees (Fig. 6B, D). \nThe crop water stress index (CWSI) was calculated using\
    \ Eq. 1 for \neach cropping system, with the lower limit taken from the Tc-Ta\
    \ vs. VPD \nlinear relation (named NWSB) of well irrigated lime trees. In the\
    \ analysis \nof all 15-min data, we noted a wide hysteresis with higher Tc-Ta\
    \ in the \nmorning (denoting warming) and lower in the afternoon (denoting \n\
    cooling). Considering only daylight values, differences remained \ndepending on\
    \ the time interval. Positive slopes of the linear regression \n(values of 0.22\
    \ and 0.10, for open-field and shaded conditions, respec-\ntively) were found\
    \ around midday (12:00–14:00 GTM+2). \nThe NWSB was then selected from the best\
    \ regression, which cor-\nresponded to the time interval 09:00–10:00 GMT+ 2 for\
    \ open-field trees \n(Tc-Ta = −0.90⋅VPD + 1.52, R2 = 0.77**), while the corresponding\
    \ time \ninterval selected for shaded trees was 10:00–12:00 h GMT+ 2 (Tc-Ta \n\

    \ differences among the slopes, and so one regression was \nconsidered for the\
    \ two cropping systems (Tc-Ta = −1.05⋅VPD + 1.57, R2 \n= 0.91***, MSE = 0.13).\
    \ \nIn an attempt to obtain the lower limit, the Tc-Ta vs. VPD regressions \n\
    for stressed lime trees were drawn using data from DOY 200 onwards \n(last part\
    \ of the stress period). They revealed quasi-parallel lines to the \nVPD axis,\
    \ with very low slopes for both cropping systems (data not \nshown). The intercept\
    \ on the Tc-Ta axis varied during the day, as can be \nobserved in Fig. 7, increasing\
    \ from the beginning of daylight hours and \nreaching maximum values around midday.\
    \ At this time of the day, \nhigher values were observed in open-field than in\
    \ shaded trees (≈ 6 and \n4 ◦C, respectively), showing a delay of about 2 h in\
    \ the case of shaded \ntrees (Fig. 7). Thus, the upper limit was selected for\
    \ the same time in-\nterval as that for which the lower limit was calculated,\
    \ 09:00–10:00 \nGMT+ 2 for open-field (1.51 ◦C), and 10:00–12:00 h GMT+ 2 for\
    \ \nshaded conditions (1.53 ◦C). Note that these values were similar to that \n\
    of the intercept for the above described NWSB (1.57 ◦C). \nThe CWSI values were\
    \ higher in open-field (Fig. 8A) than in shaded \nconditions (Fig. 8B) in control\
    \ treatment, while no-significant differ-\nences were observed between stressed\
    \ treatments. In open-field condi-\ntions, the differences between stress and\
    \ control treatment were \napparent after one month of stress, with maximum CWSI\
    \ values \nobserved by mid-July (DOY 200) in both irrigation treatments, reaching\
    \ \nvalues around 1 in stressed lime trees. After this time, the CWSI of \nstressed\
    \ trees remained ≈ 0.1 higher than in the control trees, but with \nno-significant\
    \ differences, during most of the irrigation withholding \nperiod (Fig. 8A). Nevertheless,\
    \ in shaded conditions the differences \nbetween both irrigation treatments were\
    \ minimal during the early stress \nperiod, and gradually increased, being statistically\
    \ significant higher as \nstress accumulated, with maximum CWSI values (close\
    \ to 1) being \nreached at the end of the stress period (Fig. 8B). In the recovery\
    \ period, \nthe CWSI decreased to 0.3 in both cropping systems (Fig. 8A, B), values\
    \ \neven lower than their respective control treatments. \nThe integration of\
    \ Tc-Ta values on a daylight time basis suggested a \nnew thermal-based index:\
    \ ∑ Tc-Ta. From the beginning of the experi-\nment ∑ Tc-Ta gradually increased\
    \ in all cropping systems and irrigation \ntreatments (Fig. 9A). At the end of\
    \ the experimental period, the fully \nirrigated trees showed values of 2057 and\
    \ 933 ◦C in open-field and \nshaded conditions, respectively. Nevertheless, the\
    \ stressed plants \nshowed 2119 and 1105 ◦C greater than their control, in open-field\
    \ and \nshaded conditions, respectively. The differences between control and \n\
    stress treatment were evident by the end of June (DOY 179) in open-field \ntrees,\
    \ and several days later in shaded trees. At the end of the \nexperimental period,\
    \ stressed shaded lime trees showed similar values to \nthose of the control trees\
    \ in open-field condition (Fig. 9A). \nFurthermore, Tc-Ta values were normalized\
    \ by dividing by the dif-\nference between maximum and minimum daily value (Eq.\
    \ 2). At the \nbeginning of the experiment (DOY 158), the trees cultivated inside\
    \ the \nshade screen house showed lower CTI* values (0.6 and 1.1 to control \n\
    and stress treatments, respectively) than the trees cultivated in open- \nfield\
    \ conditions (2.0 and 1.5 to control and stress treatments, respec-\ntively).\
    \ Differences between control and stress treatments occurred \nearlier and reached\
    \ higher values in open-field than in shaded condi-\ntions (Fig. 9B). At the end\
    \ of the recovery period, similar values of CTI* \nwere noted in control and stress\
    \ trees grown in shaded conditions (0.6 \nand 0.7, respectively). Nevertheless,\
    \ slightly different values were \nobserved in control and stress trees cultivated\
    \ in open-field conditions \n(1.9 and 2.7, respectively). \nFor both cropping\
    \ systems a linear regression model was made be-\ntween the punctual measurements\
    \ of Ψstem and leaf gas exchange and \nthe continuous measurements of thermal\
    \ indexes and θv. Only those \nbetween Ψstem and Tc-Ta are presented as they are\
    \ the most relevant \n(Fig. 10). Values of Tc-Ta were averaged for the time period\
    \ when the \nstem water potential was measured, around solar noon (12:00–14:00\
    \ \nGMT+2), which coincided with maximum daily evaporative demand \nconditions.\
    \ The relationship between Tc-Ta and Ψstem showed good \ncorrelation regardless\
    \ of the cropping system, with R2 fits of 0.57** and \n0.55** in open-field and\
    \ shaded conditions, respectively. Also of note \nwere the similar negative slopes\
    \ (≈ −1) in both cropping systems. This \nlinear correlation between both plant\
    \ water status indicators, although \nempirical, can be used as a guide for irrigation\
    \ management. Therefore, \nif the objective is to maintain the lime trees without\
    \ stress, the Ψstem \nshould be − 1.0 MPa, and, by solving this equation (Fig.\
    \ 10), Tc-Ta \nwould correspond to 2.4 or 0.8 ◦C for open-field and shaded lime\
    \ trees, \nrespectively. For a moderate water deficit condition (Ψstem \n= −1.5\
    \ MPa), the Tc-Ta would correspond to 2.9 or 1.3 ◦C, while for \nsevere water\
    \ stress conditions (Ψstem = −2.0 MPa), the Tc-Ta would be \n3.4 or 1.83 ◦C, for\
    \ open-field and shaded lime trees, respectively. \n4. Discussion \nDuring the\
    \ experimental period, the environmental conditions were \ncharacteristic of Mediterranean\
    \ climates, with high ET0 and VPD values \nin the summer months, coinciding with\
    \ the stress period (DOY \n158–267), and low values during autumn, in the recovery\
    \ period (DOY \n267–298). The microclimate surrounding lime trees differed slightly\
    \ in \nboth cropping systems, PAR radiation being lower under shade screen \n\
    than in open-field (Fig. 3A). This would be a consequence of the \nscreening increasing\
    \ light scattering (Nissim-Levi et al., 2008), leading \nto a decrease in the\
    \ incoming radiation (Omb´odi et al., 2015). This \nreduction depends, amongst\
    \ other factors, on the screen type, colour, \nand percentage of shading (Mditshwa\
    \ et al., 2019). In orange and in \navocado trees, Incesu et al. (2016) and Tinyane\
    \ et al. (2018), respec-\ntively, observed a reduction of PAR radiation ranging\
    \ from 9 % to 46 % \ndepending of colour and % shading. In our study reductions\
    \ in PAR were \nseasonal in character, pronounced reductions coinciding with summer\
    \ \nand the lower reductions with autumn, as was found by Zhou et al. \n(2018)\
    \ and Mira-García et al. (2020) in shaded Citrus trees. This seasonal \ncharacter\
    \ could be justified by a change in the solar inclination over the \nyear. The\
    \ reduction in incoming PAR radiation observed under netting \nsmoothed the ET0\
    \ values, an observation lent weight by Jagadale et al. \n(2018), who observed\
    \ reductions in the ET0 of 12–24 %, depending on \nthe colour of the shading screen.\
    \ In addition, the smoother values of ET0 \nmight have been the consequence of\
    \ reduced wind speed observed in \nthis cropping system. Similarly, Blakey et\
    \ al. (2016) and Wachsmann \net al. (2014) observed a reduction in wind speed\
    \ of up to 85–90%, in \navocado and mandarin trees, respectively grown under screening\
    \ \nconditions. \nThe evaluation of the ability of discrete (Ψstem, gs and Pn)\

    \ greatly affected \nby the soil water content and in a lesser extent by shading\

    \ in both \ncropping systems, as revealed by the high θv values in the active\
    \ root \nzone, which varied around field capacity values (Fig. 3C). The observed\
    \ \nfluctuations in θv would have been due to soil wetting /drying cycles \ncorresponding\
    \ to irrigation events and the periods between them. In the \nexperimental period\
    \ of our study, automated irrigation was carried out \ndaily or every other day,\
    \ as is normal for drip irrigation scheduling for \nCitrus during the summer months\
    \ in Mediterranean climates. In addi-\ntion, midday Ψstem values in control lime\
    \ trees pointed to the absence of \na water stress situation, with values > −1\
    \ MPa, which is indicative of an \noptimal water status for Citrus species, mentioned\
    \ in several studies \n(Ballester et al., 2014; Conesa et al., 2018; Pag´an et\
    \ al., 2012), and there \nwas no clear influence of the cropping system on Ψstem\
    \ dynamics \n(Fig. 3B). \nWithholding irrigation water decreased the soil water\
    \ status (Fig. 3C) \nfrom the beginning of water stress. The plant water status\
    \ gradually fell \nin stressed lime trees as θv values decreased, up to Ψstem\
    \ values (Fig. 3B), \nsimilar to that found in non-irrigated grapefruit trees\
    \ (P´erez-P´erez et al., \n2009) but lower than the levels measured in deficit-irrigated\
    \ sweet or-\nange trees (Gasque et al., 2016). When the water stress was moderate,\
    \ \nthe stress was affected by the cropping system, the decrease soil and \nplant\
    \ water status being earlier and more rapid in open-field than in \nshaded conditions.\
    \ Nevertheless, when the water stress was severe, the \ndecrease of soil and plant\
    \ water status was similar for both cropping \nsystems. Proof of this is that\

    \ irrigation in \nopen-field conditions and 15 days later in shaded conditions\
    \ (Fig. 3B). \nWhen this Ψstem value was reached, the transition from a relatively\
    \ rapid \nreduction in the soil water content slowed down in both stress treat-\n\
    ments (Fig. 3C). Known as the ‘breaking point’, this could be used as an \nindicator\
    \ of the beginning of severe water stress in lime trees, allowing \ncritical irrigation\
    \ monitoring. It must be pointed out that when the \nexperiment started, shaded\
    \ and open-field had different SWC values, as \na consequence of the different\
    \ microclimatic conditions in the two \ncropping systems (Fig. 3A and 5A). As\
    \ a result, the breaking point date \ndelayed in shaded compared with open-field\
    \ conditions, which is \nconsistent with the root water uptake rate of both cropping\
    \ conditions. \nSimilarly, the change in the day-time reductions of θv from a\
    \ sharp \ndecrease to a slower rate (Girona et al., 2002) has been suggested as\
    \ \nrepresenting the beginning of stress in Prunus (Abrisqueta et al., 2012) \n\
    and vegetable crops (Thompson et al., 2007). In the recovery period, \nwhen stressed\
    \ trees were re-irrigated, Ψstem gradually recovered to reach \ncontrol values,\
    \ indicating that plant water status is a true reflection of \nsoil water availability,\
    \ although also dependent on meteorological \nconditions (Suter et al., 2019).\
    \ \nWithholding irrigation for 110 days in our study induced statistically \n\
    lower average Ψstem values in stressed lime trees grown in open-field \n(−1.96\
    \ MPa) than in shaded (−1.78 MPa) conditions. However, \nsimilar Ψstem values\
    \ (≈ −3.0 MPa) were observed in both cropping \nsystems at the end of the stress\
    \ period (Fig. 3B), which is considered a \nsevere water stress situation for\
    \ perennial fruit trees (Hsiao, 1990). \nThe leaf gas exchange in control lime\
    \ trees showed greater day-to- \nday variability (Fig. 4), but with the characteristic\
    \ values of well- \nwatered trees (Mira-García et al., 2021). These fluctuations\
    \ were \ngreater than those observed in θv and Ψstem (Fig. 3B,C), indicating that,\
    \ \napart from soil water status, the leaf gas exchange was influenced by \nother\
    \ factors, including ambient conditions and changes in the internal \nABA concentration\
    \ (Rodriguez-Dominguez et al., 2019). The high gs and \nPn values observed coincided\

    \ was attributed to the feedback effect of the actively growing \nfruits on leaf\
    \ photosynthesis (Ben Mimoun et al., 1996). \nStomatal aperture in fully irrigated\
    \ trees was lower in open-field than \nin shaded conditions (Fig. 4A), perhaps\
    \ because the milder ET0 (Fig. 3A) \nand PAR conditions under shading favoured\
    \ stomatal aperture and \nphotosynthetic capacity, as observed in shaded Citrus\
    \ sp. (Alarc´on et al., \n2006; Mira-García et al., 2021). Likewise, De Freitas\
    \ et al. (2013) \nobserved a 56 % increase in gs and Bastías et al. (2012) a 28\
    \ % increase \nin Pn in apple trees grown under black net (50 % shading) and a\
    \ blue \nphoto-selective net, respectively. \nDuring the early stages of the water\
    \ stress period, the lime trees acted \nnormally in terms of leaf gas exchange.\
    \ Nevertheless, when the plant \nwater stress was moderate stomatal closure was\
    \ favoured in open-field \nconditions (Fig. 4A). As stress progressed and Ψstem\
    \ continued to \ndecrease (Fig. 3B) stomatal conductance (Fig. 4A) and net photosyn-\n\
    thesis (Fig. 4B) in both cropping systems reached values similar to those \nnoted\
    \ in Citrus sp. subjected to water deficits (García-Orellana et al., \n2007; P´erez-P´erez\
    \ et al., 2009). This indicates that, when the soil water \ncontent was very low,\
    \ shade screening was not sufficient to mitigate the \nnegative effect of water\
    \ stress on its own, as Lopez et al. (2018) sug-\ngested. Moreover, an asynchrony\
    \ effect between gs and Pn was detected \nin the response to water stress, Pn\
    \ decreasing (Fig. 4B) later than gs in the \nstressed lime trees (Fig. 4A). This\
    \ suggests that stomatal closure prevents \nthe outflow of water vapour to a greater\
    \ extent than the inflow of CO2. \nSince a decrease in transpiration due to stomatal\
    \ closure causes the \ncanopy temperature (Tc) to increase (as the so-called “evaporative\
    \ \ncooling “decreases), Tc has long been recognized as an indicator of the \n\
    plant water status (Gates, 1964). The development of infra-red sensors \nthat\
    \ measure infra-red radiation, which can determine surface temper-\nature without\
    \ touching it, has increased its use as an indicator of the \ndegree of plant\
    \ water stress related to water availability (Costa et al., \n2013; Jones, 2004).\
    \ In all the lime trees, Tc values varied greatly, \nfollowing marked circadian\
    \ rhythms, with high values during midday \nhours (also higher in stressed than\
    \ in control trees) and low at night \n(Fig. 5). Such fluctuations in Tc could\
    \ be due to the wide variations of gs \nin the diurnal cycle, as observed by S´anchez-Blanco\
    \ et al. (1990), who \nfound that gs values in field-grown lemon trees changed\
    \ every half hour. \nThe evaluation of the response of different thermal indexes\
    \ (Tc-Ta, \nCWSI, CTI* and ΣTc-Ta) to irrigation and shade screen allowed to \n\
    identify the best performing thermal-based index. The results showed \nthat the\
    \ daily course of Tc-Ta also varied, but to a lesser extent than Tc. \nThe Tc-Ta\
    \ dynamics throughout the experimental period could be \nlikened to the “heartbeat”\
    \ of lime tree water status, with higher values \nmonitored in stressed than in\
    \ control trees (Fig. 6). Negative Tc-Ta values \nindicate that an evaporative\
    \ cooling process is occurring, i.e. heat is \ndissipated by the water lost from\
    \ the stomata via transpiration, but as \nsoon as stomata close, the canopy temperature\
    \ raise several degrees \nabove the air temperature (Araus et al., 2008; Jones\
    \ et al., 2002; Lima \net al., 2016). It is clear that there were no differences\
    \ in Tc-Ta values \nbetween control and stress treatments in the absence of solar\
    \ heating \n(from approx. 20:00 h to 7:00 h the next morning). In spite of the\
    \ higher \nTc values in the lime trees grown under shade screening (Fig. 5B, C),\
    \ the \nTc-Ta values were lower in shaded conditions than in open-field trees\
    \ \n(Fig. 6), since the Ta was higher under screen (Fig. 5A), as has been \nobserved\
    \ in other studies (Alaphilippe et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2022). \nThis anti-intuitive\
    \ situation denoted that shaded trees were better paired \nwith the environmental\
    \ conditions they were in, which also led to lower \nTc-Ta values for stressed\
    \ trees compared with the stressed open-field \ntrees (Fig. 6). \nThe CWSI can\
    \ be calculated by empirical or theoretical methods. \nEven though the theoretical\
    \ method, based on the energy balance \n(Jackson, 1982), is more precise, its\
    \ complexity in terms of data \ncollection and calculation, has meant that the\
    \ empirical method, which \nis based on equations to determine the lower and upper\
    \ limits of canopy \nFig. 10. Relationship between Ψstem and Tc – Ta in in control\

    \ 272 (2022) 107843\n12\ntemperature, has tended to be favoured. The lower limit\
    \ is derived from \nthe linear equation between the VPD and Tc-Ta in well-watered\
    \ condi-\ntions, while the upper limit is considered a constant value from \n\
    non-transpiring canopies (Idso et al., 1981). Many authors have used a \nconstant\
    \ as the upper limit, assuming that canopy is always above air \ntemperature when\
    \ transpiration ceases, for example Ta + 4 ◦C, in \ngrapefruit trees (Romero-Trigueros\
    \ et al., 2019), or Ta + 5 ◦C in olive \ntrees (Agam et al., 2013). Also, the\
    \ upper limit could be assumed from \nthe intercept of the NWSB corrected for\
    \ Ta (Gonz´alez-Dugo et al., 2014) \nor from the maximum measured Tc-Ta value\
    \ (Irmak et al., 2000; Yang \net al., 2021). In our study, the lower limit was\
    \ derived from the linear \nequation between the VPD and Tc-Ta in well-watered\
    \ lime trees, \nalthough it resulted highly time-dependent, and the maximum Tc-Ta\
    \ \ndifference measured under severe water stress conditions was fixed as \nthe\
    \ upper limit (Fig. 7), which also coincided with that value assumed by \nthe\
    \ intercept of the NWSB, confirming the versatility of both methods. \nWe found\
    \ that CWSI calculations were too empirical and too time \ninterval-dependant,\
    \ with wide day-to-day variations (Fig. 8). Other \nproposed thermal indices,\
    \ based on absolute Tc-Ta values, were used as a \nreliable way to monitor real-time\
    \ plant water status: ΣTc-Ta (Fig. 9A) \nand CTI*(Fig. 9B). CTI*, compared to\
    \ CWSI, better discriminated dif-\nferences between irrigation treatments and\
    \ cropping conditions. In our \nstudy, the cropping system and irrigation treatment\
    \ had a clear effect on \nboth thermal-based indices, in such a way that higher\
    \ values of ΣTc-Ta \nand CTI* were observed in open-field than in shaded conditions,\
    \ and in \nstressed than control trees. Along the experimental period, the highest\
    \ \nvalues corresponding to stressed open-field trees (Fig. 9). This indicates\
    \ \nthat in this cropping system (open-field) the meteorological conditions \n\
    were less favourable, inducing a poorer plant thermal water status \n(Mira-García\
    \ et al., 2020). At the same time, higher values of both \nthermal indices were\
    \ observed in stressed trees than in control trees of \nboth cropping systems,\
    \ confirming that restrictions in the soil water \navailability induce stomatal\
    \ closure (Blanco et al., 2019; De la Rosa \net al., 2014), thus increasing the\
    \ values of the thermal indices. \nThermal point or thermal imagery data relationships\
    \ with Ψstem and \ngs have been suggested for irrigation scheduling in Citrus\
    \ and fruit trees \n(Egea et al., 2017; Gonz´alez-Dugo et al., 2014; Romero-Trigueros\
    \ et al., \n2019; Zhang et al., 2017). However, apart from that of Sepaskhah and\
    \ \nKashefipour (1994) on sweet lime trees in Iran, to our knowledge no \nstudies\
    \ have been carried out in lime trees. In our study, the correlation \nbetween\
    \ Tc-Ta and Ψstem to determine threshold thermal based values for \nirrigation\
    \ scheduling, differed in open-field and shaded conditions. \nNevertheless, a\
    \ similar linear correlation (slope ≈ 1) was noted in the \ntrees cultivated under\
    \ screening and open-field conditions, but with a \ndifferent intercept (Fig.\
    \ 10). Similar lineal adjustment between Tc-Ta \nand Ψstem was found by Ballester\
    \ et al. (2013a) in ‘Clementina de Nules’ \ncultivated in open-field conditions.\
    \ The midday Tc-Ta threshold values \nproposed for triggering drip irrigation\
    \ in lime trees grown in semi-arid \nconditions were 2.4 or 0.8 ◦C for open-field\
    \ and shaded conditions, \nrespectively, but only when irrigation water availability\
    \ is sufficient to \nfulfil plant water requirements. Under deficit irrigation\
    \ conditions, the \nproposed values were 2.9 or 1.3 ◦C, for moderate water deficits\
    \ (Ψstem \n= −1.5 MPa) and 3.4 or 1.83 ◦C, for severe water deficits (Ψstem \n\
    = −2 MPa), for open-field and shaded lime trees, respectively. Simi-\nlarly, Tormann\
    \ (1986) proposed two Tc-Ta threshold values for irriga-\ntion management of nectarine\
    \ trees, based on two levels of plant water \nstatus (Ψstem values) - well irrigated\
    \ and moderately stressed. According \nwith our findings, shading conditions should\
    \ be taken into account when \nseeking threshold values for irrigation management,\
    \ tailoring guidelines \nto the needs of sustainable agriculture. \nThe statistically\
    \ higher Ψstem and leaf gas exchange values and lower \ncanopy to air temperature\
    \ differences recorded in shaded than in open- \nfield lime trees revealed that\
    \ the shade screening allowed better soil- \nplant water status conditions. Furthermore,\
    \ it can be assumed that \nwater consumption by trees was lower, since the irrigation\
    \ applied was \nthe same in both crop conditions. Consequently, shade netting\
    \ \nconditions allowed a window of opportunity of ≈ 12 days to postpone a \nwater\
    \ deficit situation with respect to open-field conditions. This could \nbe the\
    \ result of the improved water use efficiency induced by shade \nscreening, as\
    \ has been noted in several Citrus sp., including mandarin \n(Wachsmann et al.,\
    \ 2014), orange (Medina et al., 2002), lemon (Alarc´on \net al., 2006; Nicol´as\
    \ et al., 2008) and grapefruit (Jifon and Syvertsen, \n2003) trees. \nEarly signs\
    \ of a water deficit situation are desired. In this sense, the \nsoil water content\
    \ sensor, wrapped around by the plant roots (thus \nbehaving rather like a physiological\
    \ sensor), anticipated the lime tree \nwater status situation respect to thermal-based\
    \ indices. Nonetheless, \nboth monitoring systems showed close agreement as regards\
    \ the water \ndeficit level throughout the experiment. \n5. Conclusion \nThis\
    \ study has revealed that the response of lime trees to soil water \ndeficits\
    \ differed in the two cropping systems studied (open-field and \nshaded) and that\
    \ the ability to detect water stress also differed for the \nsoil/plant water\
    \ status indicators studied. The main conclusions can be \nsummarised as: (i)\
    \ Precise estimates of the soil-plant-atmosphere com-\nponents are needed to improve\
    \ irrigation management; (ii) Ψstem is a \nreliable tool for assessing lime tree\
    \ water status and along with the \nbreaking point of θv are useful for irrigation\
    \ monitoring; (iii) The \nthermal-based indices serve as an alternative to other\
    \ classical discrete \nphysiological measurements for remotely monitoring lime\
    \ tree water \nstatus, while the daily Tc-Ta dynamics reflects the “heartbeat”\
    \ of lime \ntrees; (iv) Soil water content sensors anticipate water stress detection\
    \ \nbetter than thermal-based sensors; (v) The higher Ψstem gs, Pn, and lower\
    \ \nTc-Ta values observed in shaded than in open-field lime trees reveals that\
    \ \nshading allows a better soil-plant water status and lowers water con-\nsumption,\
    \ thus delaying plant water stress; (vi) The cropping system \nmust be considered\
    \ to propose Tc-Ta threshold values for lime tree drip \nirrigation management.\

    \ \n \nObjectives \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the robustness of infrared\
    \ thermometry to \nestimate stomatal conductance (gs) in grapefruit trees for\
    \ different water sources, \nirrigation strategies and phenological stages. In\
    \ addition, the ability of different thermal \nindices to determine gs at different\
    \ thermal data intervals, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) \nand photosynthetically\
    \ active radiation (PAR) conditions was tested. \nMaterials and Methods \nThe\
    \ experiment was carried out in 2019-2020 in a 0.5 ha orchard at Murcia, Spain.\
    \ \nThe experimental plot was cultivated with 14-year-old ´Star Ruby´grapefruit\
    \ trees (Citrus \nparadisi Macf.,) grafted onto Citrus macrophylla L. rootstock\
    \ and planted at 6 m x 4 m. \nThe irrigation system consisted of a single lateral\
    \ drip line with four pressure-\ncompensated emitters of 4 L h-1 per tree. Irrigation\
    \ was scheduled according to crop \nevapotranspiration (ETc) accumulated during\
    \ the previous week.  \nThe robustness of infrared thermometry to estimate gs\
    \ was assessed for different i) \nwater sources: transfer water (TW, optimal for\
    \ agricultural uses) and saline reclaimed \nwater (RW), ii) irrigation strategies:\
    \ full irrigation (FI) and regulated deficit irrigation \n(RDI), and iii) phenological\
    \ stages: flowering-sprouting (FS) and fruit growth (FG). FI \ntrees were irrigated\
    \ at 100 % of ETc during the experimental period. Trees in RDI regime \nwere also\
    \ irrigated at 100 % of ETc except in the phase II of fruit growth, when they\
    \ were \nirrigated at 50 % of ETc. In this study, correlations of canopy temperature\
    \ (Tc), canopy to \nair temperature difference (Tc-Ta) and crop water stress index\
    \ (CWSI) vs gs were tested \nunder several thermal data average intervals (60\
    \ min and timepoint), VPD (VPD≤2 and \nVPDglobal) and PAR (PAR1200 and PAR>1200)\
    \ conditions.  \nMeteorological conditions were recorded in real time from a weather\
    \ station located \nat the experimental site. The gs was punctually measured with\
    \ a portable photosynthesis \nsystem and Tc was continuously monitored by infrared\
    \ sensors. The average values of Tc \nwere normalised by calculating the Tc-Ta\
    \ and CWSI indices. \nResults and Discussion \n  As for water quality, TW-FI trees\
    \ showed higher gs than RW-FI trees, due to the \nhigh leaf concentration of salts\
    \ (Cl- and/or Na+) and B+ in RW irrigated trees, which \nreduced leaf gas exchange\
    \ and consequently promoted canopy warming. The amount of \nCHAPTER IV: ARTICLE\
    \ IV \n87 \n \nwater applied (FI or RDI) also interfered in the behaviour of both\
    \ physiological \nparameters. Thus, RDI trees showed a decrease in stomatal aperture\
    \ and an increase in \nTc. \nIn this study, correlations of Tc, Tc-Ta and CWSI\
    \ vs gs were tested under several \nthermal data average intervals, VPD and PAR\
    \ conditions. Results suggested that gs values \nwere more closely related to\
    \ the preceding 60 min averaged Tc values than with timepoint \nTc data. This\
    \ fact indicated that gs integrated previous values of Tc, which in turn \ndepended\
    \ on meteorological and plant hydric conditions. In relation with VPD it was \n\
    observed that within a range between 0 and 2 kPa, Tc increased simultaneously\
    \ with VPD \nwhile gs remained stable, leading to a decrease in the strength of\
    \ thermal indices-gs \ncorrelations. A more direct relationship between thermal\
    \ indices and gs was found at PAR \nequal to 1200 µmol m-2 s-1, than when PAR\
    \ exceeded 1200 µmol m-2 s-1. This is due to a \nPAR value higher than 1200 µmol\
    \ m-2 s-1 a reduction of gs was observed, indicating that \nit is the saturating\
    \ PAR of grapefruit trees. \nIn relation to the different phenological stages\
    \ studied, in FS the best indicators \nwere the normalised thermal indices (Tc-Ta\
    \ and CWSI), and in FG the absolute values of \nTc. This fact indicated that Tc\
    \ was less sensitive to changes in gs values when climatic \nconditions were less\
    \ demanding as occurred in FS stage. Nevertheless, in FG, the increase \nin the\
    \ atmospheric demand gave rise to the Tc was more influenced by plant intrinsic\
    \ \nfactors (greater or lesser stomatal opening) than by Ta. \nConclusions \n\
    The robustness of the different thermal indices (Tc, Tc-Ta and CWSI) for estimating\
    \ \ngs was the highest at 60 min thermal average data, at VPD between 0 and 3.5\
    \ kPa, and at \nPAR 1200 μmol m-2 s-1. At these conditions, trees under RDI and\
    \ those irrigated with RW \nshowed the best thermal indices-gs correlations. CWSI\
    \ and Tc-Ta estimated gs better \nduring FS and Tc during FG, independently of\
    \ quality of the irrigation source and the \namount of water applied. Overall,\
    \ thermal-based indices have demonstrated to be a useful \ntool to estimate gs\
    \ in grapefruit trees irrigated with different strategies and water sources, \n\
    and to be able to precise irrigation management.\nAgricultural Water Management\

    \ for \ndifferent: (i) irrigation strategies: full irrigation (FI) and regulated\
    \ deficit irrigation (RDI), (ii) water sources: \ntransfer water (TW) -optimal\
    \ for agricultural uses- and saline reclaimed water (RW) and (iii) phenological\
    \ stages: \nflowering-sprouting (FS) and fruit growth (FG). During two growing\
    \ seasons, measurements of gs and canopy \ntemperature (Tc) were taken in 14-year-old\
    \ ´Star Ruby´grapefruit trees (Citrus paradisi Macf.,). Air temperature \n(Ta)\
    \ was also recorded and then the derived thermal indices: Tc-Ta, and CWSI (crop\
    \ water stress index) were \ncalculated. Subsequently, thermal-gs correlations\
    \ were established at different averaged thermal data intervals, \nand VPD (vapour\
    \ pressure deficit) and PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) conditions.\
    \ The results indi-\ncated that both, water quality and deficit irrigation, affected\
    \ negatively gs and Tc during FG. In addition, the \nhighest r2 values in thermal\
    \ indices-gs correlations were found when i) the thermal data was averaged 60\
    \ min \nbefore the gs measurement, ii) gs was measured over a wide range of VPD\
    \ (between 0 and 3.5 kPa), and iii) PAR \nwas 1200 µmol m−2 s−1. The ability of\
    \ the thermal indices to estimate gs improved under RDI and RW conditions, \n\
    when compared to the control treatment (TW-FI). Moreover, the thermal indices\
    \ that more accurately estimated \ngs were Tc-Ta and CWSI in FS (P < 0.001), and\
    \ the absolute values of Tc in FG (P < 0.001). Overall, thermal \nindices obtained\
    \ by infra-red sensors could be a useful tool to estimate gs in grapefruit trees.\
    \ However, irrigation \ntreatment, water quality, tree phenological stage and\
    \ environmental conditions (VPD and PAR) must be \nconsidered when interpreting\
    \ thermal indices-gs correlations.   \n1. Introduction \nCitrus is one of the\
    \ main fruit tree species cultivated, accounting for \n16% (138 Mt) of the total\
    \ fruit production worldwide (FAOSTAT, 2020). \nSpain is the most important Mediterranean\
    \ citrus-growing country with \na production of 6.0 Mt, being the main exporter\
    \ of grapefruit in Europe, \nwith a 48% of total European exports of this crop\
    \ (FAO, 2021). Citrus \nproduction is highly dependent on the availability of\
    \ water resources, \nwhich in turn is affected by the ongoing climate change scenario\
    \ (IPCC, \n2018). Water shortages negatively affect citrus yield and fruit quality\
    \ \n(Capra et al., 2011; Romero-Trigueros et al., 2020), leading to important\
    \ \neconomic losses. To avoid these undesirable effects, an optimal use of \n\
    irrigation water is needed. In this sense, the use of irrigation strategies \n\
    such as regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) contributes to increase water \nproductivity\
    \ (Puig-Sirera et al., 2021), with null or low affection of yield \nand fruit\
    \ quality (Coyago-cruz et al., 2019). Similarly, irrigation with \nnon-conventional\
    \ water sources such as reclaimed water (RW) is a good \noption because it mitigates\
    \ the problem of water shortage (Li et al., \n2021). However, both techniques\
    \ require proper irrigation management \nbecause RDI and RW can negatively affect\
    \ both the soil and the crop \n(Romero-Trigueros et al., 2017). \nIrrigation scheduling\
    \ based on plant water status indicators could \nalso be of interest since they\
    \ allow to match crop water needs with its \nsupply (Fern´andez, 2017). Previously,\
    \ stem water potential (Ψstem), \nstomatal conductance (gs) and trunk diameter\
    \ variations were used as \nplant water stress indicators and/or for irrigation\
    \ scheduling purposes \n(Hernandez-Santana et al., 2019; Intrigliolo et al., 2011;\
    \ Mir´as-Avalos \net al., 2016). However, their direct measurements are punctual,\
    \ labo-\nrious and time consuming (Grant et al., 2006) and do not allow real-time\
    \ \nirrigation scheduling, unless sensors that measure continuously, as \n* Corresponding\

    \ (Mir´as-Avalos et al., 2016) or leaf turgor pressure sensors, \nare used. In\
    \ this sense, canopy temperature (Tc), could be easily, \nremotely, and rapidly\
    \ measured using infra-red thermometry sensors \n(IRTs) (Cifre et al., 2005; Jones,\
    \ 2004), as opposed to gs and Ψstem. In \naddition, IRTs allow to study a large\
    \ population of leaves (Bellvert et al., \n2016) and their measurements can also\
    \ be extrapolated from the leaf to \nthe field scale (Gonz´alez-Dugo et al., 2014).\
    \ These characteristics make \nTc and its derived thermal indices, the difference\
    \ between canopy and \nair temperature (Tc-Ta) and the crop water stress index\
    \ (CWSI), inter-\nesting for irrigation scheduling purposes. In several studies\
    \ (Baluja et al., \n2012; Ben-Gal et al., 2009; Pagay and Kidman, 2019), correlations\
    \ be-\ntween thermal indices and traditional indicators of plant water status\
    \ (gs \nand Ψstem) were detected. In grapefruit trees under saline and water \n\
    stresses, strong correlations were found between several thermal indices \n(Tc,\
    \ Tc-Ta and CWSI) measured by IRTs and Ψstem (Romero-Trigueros \net al., 2019).\
    \ However, grapefruit has recently been defined as an iso-\nhydric species (Romero-Trigueros\
    \ et al., 2021), since it shows a rapid \nstomatal closure in response to water\
    \ stress conditions. Thus, in this \ncrop, gs is a more reliable indicator of\
    \ plant water status than Ψstem. \nHowever, there is a lack of knowledge about\
    \ the usefulness of the \ndifferent thermal indices (Tc, Tc-Ta and CWSI) for estimating\
    \ gs, in \ngrapefruit trees under saline and water stresses. In addition, little\
    \ is \nknown in reference to what time of day, corresponding to a given VPD \n\
    (vapour pressure deficit) and PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) \nconditions,\
    \ it is best to correlate IRT readings and gs measurements. \nTherefore, the main\
    \ objective of this study was to estimate gs using \nIRTs in grapefruit trees\
    \ cultivated under different irrigation strategies: \nfull irrigation (FI) and\
    \ regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) and combined \nwith two water sources: transfer\
    \ water (TW) and saline reclaimed water \n(RW). The specific objectives were:\
    \ (i) to assess the seasonal trend of gs \nand Tc; (ii) to evaluate the influence\
    \ of various irrigation strategies, \nwater sources, and crop phenological stages\
    \ in thermal indices vs gs \ncorrelations and (iii) to determine which thermal\
    \ index correlated best \nwith gs. In addition, the ability of different thermal\
    \ indices to determine \ngs was tested at different averaged thermal data intervals\
    \ (60 min and \ntimepoint) and VPD (VPDglobal and VPD≤2) and PAR (PAR1200 -equal\
    \ to \nsaturating irradiance- and PAR>1200 -over saturating irradiance-) con-\n\
    ditions. In this sense, the working hypothesis were that IRTs can be \nuseful\
    \ for estimating gs and that correlations between different thermal \nindices\
    \ and gs will change depending on treatment, crop phenological \nstage, different\
    \ thermal data intervals, and environmental conditions. \n2. Materials and methods\
    \ \n2.1. Plant material and experimental conditions \nThe experiment was carried\
    \ out in a 0.5 ha of the commercial or-\nchard “Lo Montero” located in Molina\
    \ de Segura, Spain (38◦07′18′′N, \n1◦13′15′′W) during two growing seasons (2019\
    \ and 2020). The experi-\nmental plot was cultivated with adult (14 years old,\
    \ planted in 2005) \n´Star Ruby´ grapefruit trees (Citrus paradisi Macf.,) grafted\
    \ onto Citrus \nmacrophylla L. rootstocks planted at 6 m x 4 m. The irrigation\
    \ system \nconsisted of a single lateral drip line with four pressure-compensated\
    \ \nemitters of 4 L h−1 per tree, located at 0.8 m from the axis of the \ntrunk.\
    \ Irrigation was scheduled based on crop evapotranspiration (ETc) \naccumulated\
    \ during the previous week. ETc was calculated multiplying \nthe reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET0, Allen et al., 1998) and specific \ncrop coefficients (Kc) for grapefruit\
    \ trees (Pedrero et al., 2015). \nAll the trees were fertilised equally (215,\
    \ 110 and 150 kg ha−1 year−1 \nof N, P2O5 and K2O, respectively) through the drip\
    \ irrigation system. \nWeeds were eradicated by applying pest control methods\
    \ commonly \nused by farmers. \n2.2. Water sources and irrigation strategies \n\
    The experimental plot was irrigated with two water sources: transfer \nwater (TW)\
    \ and saline reclaimed water (RW). The TW was pumped from \nthe Tajo-Segura canal\
    \ and the RW from the tertiary wastewater treat-\nment plant (WWTP) in Molina\
    \ de Segura. The TW was considered \noptimal water for agricultural use due to\
    \ its low values of electrical \nconductivity (EC), close to 1 dS⋅m−1 (average\
    \ value for 2019 and 2020: \n0.91 ± 0.10 dS⋅m−1). The RW was characterised by\
    \ having a high salt \ncontent and an EC value close to 4 dS⋅m−1. The RW was automatically\
    \ \nmixed in the irrigation control-head with TW to reduce its EC value ≈\n3.5\
    \ dS⋅m−1 (average value for 2019 and 2020: 3.19 ± 0.52 dS⋅m−1) in \norder to avoid\
    \ significant yield losses (Maas, 1993). The high level of \nsalinity in RW (Table\
    \ 1) was the result of a high concentration of Cl-, Na+\nand B+, which was approximately\
    \ 7 times higher than in TW. Moreover, \nthe concentration of K+ and NO3\n- was\
    \ also high in this saline water \nsource. \nTwo irrigation strategies were applied\
    \ for each water source: full \nirrigation (FI) and regulated deficit irrigation\
    \ (RDI). In the FI treatments \n(TW-FI and RW-FI), trees were irrigated at 100%\
    \ of ETc during the \nexperimental period. However, the trees cultivated under\
    \ the RDI \nregime (TW-RDI and RW-RDI) were also irrigated at 100% ETc except\
    \ in \nphase II of fruit growth (from 1st July to 15th September), when they \n\
    were irrigated at 50% of ETc. These irrigation strategies (FI and RDI) and \n\
    water sources (TW and RW) have been applied since 2007, allowing the \nassessment\
    \ of long-term effects of these practices on grapefruit tree \nperformance. Thus,\
    \ the combined treatments evaluated were: TW-FI, \nRW-FI, TW-RDI and RW-RDI. TW-FI\
    \ was considered the control treat-\nment in this study. The annual amounts of\
    \ water applied in the FI \ntreatments (TW-FI and RW-FI) were 5125.2 and 4978.4\
    \ m3 ha−1 in 2019 \nand 2020, respectively. However, in the RDI treatments (TW-RDI\
    \ and \nRW-RDI) they were 3930.1 and 3941.1 m3 ha−1 in 2019 and 2020, \nrespectively.\
    \ \nThe data obtained were separated into two distinct experimental \nperiods,\
    \ referred to P1 and P2. P1 was just before the RDI period and \ncomprised from\
    \ 1st April to 30th June 2019 and 2020 (DOY 91–181 and \n92–182, respectively).\
    \ This period coincided mainly with the pheno-\nlogical stages of flowering-sprouting\
    \ (FS) and with low evaporative \ndemand months. P2 referred to the RDI period\
    \ and included the time \ninterval between 1st July and 15th September 2019 and\
    \ 2020 (DOY \n182–258 and 183–259, respectively). In these months, the evaporative\
    \ \ndemand was high and the main phenological stage was fruit growth \n(FG). \n\
    The experiment was laid out in a completely randomised design with \nfour replications\
    \ per treatment. In each replicate, the trees were \ndistributed in 3 rows (12\
    \ trees in total) and measurements were taken on \n1 tree of the central row.\
    \ The rest of the trees were considered as border \ntrees. \nTable 1 \nPhysical\

    \ such as rainfall, air temperature (Ta), \nrelative humidity (RH) ET0 and solar\

    \ the experimental site. The VPD \nwas calculated every hour using the measured\
    \ Ta and RH data. \nThe gas exchange parameters, gs and net photosynthesis (A),\
    \ were \nmeasured with a portable photosynthesis system (LI-6400, LICOR, \nLincoln,\
    \ NE, USA), equipped with a broad leaf chamber (6 cm2). Inside \nthe measuring\
    \ chamber, the ambient CO2 concentration and airflow rate \nwere almost constant,\
    \ being 400 µmol mol−1 and 300 µmol s−1, \nrespectively. Measurements were taken\
    \ on mature leaves located on the \nsunny side of the trees, on three leaves per\
    \ tree and four trees per \ntreatment (one per replicate). \nDuring the experimental\
    \ period, Tc was continuously monitored \nusing one infra-red sensor per tree\
    \ (Apogee instruments, Utah, USA, \nmodel SIF-111). The sensors were mounted on\
    \ galvanised metal poles \nand installed approximately 0.5 m above the tree crown.\
    \ The sensors \nhad a field of view (FOV) of 22◦ and were connected to data loggers\
    \ \n(model CR1000, Campbell Scientific Ltd., Shepshed, UK), which read \nvalues\
    \ every 5 min and recorded average values every 15 min. Tc was \nmeasured on four\

    \ data. The time interval over which the \nthermal data are averaged could vary\
    \ the significance of the relation-\nships between the thermal indices (Tc, Tc-Ta\
    \ and CWSI) and gs. For this \nreason, two-time intervals of thermal data were\
    \ studied: timepoint and \npreceding 60 min average data (60 min, henceforth).\
    \ The timepoint data \nreferred to the Tc value at the time of the gs measurement.\
    \ The 60 min \nincluded all the values of Tc and Ta recorded during the hour prior\
    \ to the \ntime of measurement of gs. Therefore, the derived thermal indices (Tc-Ta\
    \ \nand CWSI) were calculated in two different ways: i) considering the \nthermal\
    \ timepoint data, and ii) using the preceding 60 min average data \nof Tc and\
    \ Ta. In a previous test, the preceding 15 and 30 min average \nthermal data were\
    \ also evaluated. However, these data are not included \nhere because of strength\
    \ of the relationship between thermal indexes \n(Tc, Tc-Ta and CWSI) and punctual\
    \ stomatal conductance (gs) was lower \nat these thermal timeframes (preceding\
    \ 15 and 30 min average thermal \ndata) than at timepoint and preceding 60 min\
    \ average thermal data. \nThen, the thermal indices (Tc, Tc-Ta and CWSI) were\
    \ correlated with the \npunctual gs measurements at the two-time intervals cited\
    \ above and \ntaking into account the two experimental periods separately: P1\
    \ and P2 \nof both years, 2019 and 2020. \n2.3.2.2. VPD conditions. To find out\
    \ the degree of influence of VPD on gs \nand Tc measurements of our experiment\
    \ (Fig. 2), VPD and these two \nphysiological parameters (Tc and gs) were measured\
    \ in control treatment \ntrees (TW-FI) on different days and times, during the\
    \ two growing sea-\nsons (2019 and 2020). Measurements of gs were carried out\
    \ at saturating \nlight intensity (1200 µmol m−2 s−1) and at ambient air temperature\
    \ and \nrelative humidity. VPD values were collected at the same time that gs\
    \ \nmeasurements were performed. \nIn addition, a diurnal course of VPD and gs\
    \ was carried out in P2 of \n2019 in all the treatments studied. Measurements\
    \ of gs were carried out \nhourly at saturating light intensity (1200 µmol m−2\
    \ s−1) and at ambient \nair temperature and relative humidity. VPD values were\
    \ collected at the \nsame time that gs measurements were performed. Subsequently,\
    \ the \nhourly values of gs and VPD were correlated (see Fig. 1S Supplementary\
    \ \nMaterial) across treatments. Then, the thermal indices were correlated \n\
    with gs values at two different VPD levels: VPD≤2, which comprised gs \nand thermal\
    \ data measured at VPD equal or below 2 kPa, and VPDglobal, \nwhich included all\
    \ gs and thermal data, regardless of VPD at the time of \nmeasurement. In our\
    \ study, VPDglobal ranged from 0 to 3.5 kPa. \n2.3.2.3. PAR conditions. PAR could\
    \ have an effect on the thermal \nindices-gs correlations. To test this influence,\
    \ PAR and the two physio-\nlogical parameters (gs and Tc) were measured in the\
    \ control treatment \n(TW-FI) in different days and hours during two growing seasons\
    \ (2019 \nand 2020) (Fig. 3). \nIn addition, a PAR-photosynthesis curve was made\
    \ for each experi-\nmental period (P1 and P2) in the control treatment (TW-FI)\
    \ (Fig. 2S \nSupplementary Material). Then, the thermal indices were correlated\
    \ \nwith gs values at two different PAR levels: PAR1200 (equal to saturating \n\
    irradiance) and PAR>1200 (over saturating irradiance). PAR>1200 (over \nsaturating\
    \ irradiance) was a non-fixed value and ranged between 1300 \nand 1600 µmol m−2\
    \ s−1, depending on the environmental PAR condition \nat the time of gs measurement.\
    \ \n2.4. Statistical analysis \nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s\
    \ multiple test \n(P < 0.05) were performed to assess differences between treatments.\
    \ \nBefore ANOVA analysis, the assumptions of normality and homosce-\ndasticity\
    \ were checked. Relationships between Tc and VPD, gs and PAR, \nand thermal indices\
    \ (Tc, Tc-Ta and CWSI) and gs were fitted to linear \nregressions. Their coefficients\
    \ of determination (r2) are shown in the  \nFigs. 2B, 3, 4 and 5. Then, the coefficients\
    \ of correlations (r) were \ncalculated and used to assess the strength of these\
    \ relationships. The \nrelationships between gs and VPD were fitted to quadratic\
    \ regressions. \nThe statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS (version\
    \ 25, SPSS \nInc., Armonk, NY, USA 2002). \n3. Results \n3.1. Meteorological conditions\
    \ and seasonal trend of gs and Tc \nMeteorological data for 2019 and 2020 are\
    \ shown in Fig. 1A. The \ntotal annual rainfall and ET0 were 508.20 mm and 1413.23\
    \ mm, \nrespectively, in 2019, and 351.01 mm and 1374.47 mm, respectively, in\
    \ \n2020. The maximum rainfall was recorded in September 2019, ac-\ncounting for\
    \ the 49.64% of the annual rainfall. In P1, before the RDI \nperiod, weather conditions\

    \ with significant differences between treatments on several days \n(Fig. 1 D,\
    \ E). The highest values of gs and the lowest values of Tc were \nobserved in\
    \ the FI treatments (RW-FI and TW-FI), and the opposite \nbehaviour was observed\
    \ in the RDI treatments (RW-RDI and TW-RDI) \n(Fig. 1B, C, D and E, respectively).\
    \ In September 2019, coinciding \nwith the rainiest month, gs and Tc values were\
    \ quite similar in the \ndifferent irrigation treatments studied (Fig. 1B, D).\
    \ \nThe global seasonal average of Tc was higher in P2 (23.96 ◦C) than in \nP1\
    \ (19.48 ◦C), as expected, coinciding with the months of high evapo-\nrative demand.\
    \ The same trend was also observed for gs, with higher \nvalues in P2 (96.58 mmol\
    \ m−2 s−1) than in P1 (55.19 mmol m−2 s−1). \n3.2. Relationships between punctual\
    \ measurements of gs and thermal \nindices at different time intervals, VPD and\
    \ PAR conditions \nThe assessment of the relationships between the three thermal\
    \ \nindices (Tc, Tc-Ta and CWSI) and gs at different thermal data intervals, \n\
    VPD and PAR conditions are described in the Section 3.2.1., 3.2.2. and \n3.2.3.\
    \ \n3.2.1. Thermal data time intervals: timepoint and preceding 60 min \nCorrelations\
    \ between the different thermal indices and gs consid-\nering the two thermal\
    \ time intervals are shown in Table 2. An overall \nincrease in the r2 value and\
    \ on the significance of the correlations in the \n60 min data was observed, respect\
    \ to timepoint data. \nConsidering the different treatments and only this average\
    \ data in-\nterval (60 min), there was no clear trend in P1, with higher r2 values,\
    \ in \nsome cases, for the trees irrigated with RW and, in other cases, for the\
    \ \ntrees irrigated with TW (Table 2). However, in the second period (P2), \n\
    the RDI trees irrigated with RW showed the highest r2 values, except for \nthe\
    \ Tc-Ta vs gs correlation, where the RW-FI treatment showed the \nhighest degree\
    \ of correlation. \n3.2.2. VPD conditions \nIn our experiment, Tc and gs were\
    \ strongly influenced by VPD con-\nditions, with r2 value of 0.64 and 0.80 (P\
    \ < 0.001) for the correlations \nbetween Tc and gs with VPD, respectively (Fig.\
    \ 2). \nThus, VPD was a key variable for appropriately estimating gs from \nthermal\
    \ indices. Besides, it is important to know the VPD value above \nwhich the influence\
    \ on gs and Tc is greatest. \nWe observed that gs increased while VPD values ranged\
    \ from 0 to 1.8 \nkPa (Fig. 1S, see Section 2.3.2). However, when VPD values were\
    \ higher \nthan 1.8 kPa, a turning point occurred, from which gs values began\
    \ to \ndecrease. This behaviour was more accentuated from 2.0 kPa, threshold \n\
    value of VPD that we used to study the influence of VPD on the \ncorrelations\
    \ between gs and thermal indices. \nWhen thermal indices-gs correlations were\
    \ evaluated at the two \ndifferent VPD levels: VPD≤2 and VPDglobal. In general,\
    \ higher r2 values \nwere observed for the VPDglobal conditions than for VPD≤2,\
    \ in the three \ncorrelations studied (Tc vs gs, Tc-Ta vs gs, CWSI vs gs) (Table\
    \ 3). Only in \nsome exceptions, the VPD≤2 condition had r2 values higher than\
    \ \nVPDglobal. Considering only VPDglobal data, all correlations between \nthermal\
    \ indices and gs were significant. \nTaking into account only VPDglobal data,\
    \ concerning water sources, in \nP2, the highest r2 values were observed for trees\
    \ irrigated with RW \n(Table 3). Nevertheless, in P1, no clear trend was observed.\
    \ Regarding \nthe amount of water applied (FI and RDI treatments), there was no\
    \ clear \npattern in P2 (Table 3). For instance, in the Tc vs. gs correlation,\
    \ the RW- \nRDI treatment showed a r2 higher than that obtained for RW-FI. In\
    \ other \ncases, the r2 values were similar in the FI and RDI treatments. For\
    \ \nexample, in the CWSI vs. gs correlation, the RW-RDI and RW-FI treat-\nments\
    \ showed r2 values of 0.55 and 0.58, respectively. Overall, both RW \nand RDI\
    \ treatments increased the magnitude of r2 in the thermal indices \nvs gs correlations\
    \ with respect to the control treatment (TW-FI). \n3.2.3. PAR conditions \nIn\
    \ our study, Tc and gs of trees were strongly influenced by PAR levels \nthroughout\
    \ the vegetative cycles of 2019 and 2020, with r2 value up to \n0.5 (P < 0.001)\
    \ in both cases (Fig. 3). In such a way that, the higher PAR \ncorresponded with\
    \ a higher gs (Fig. 3A) and Tc values (Fig. 3B). \nIn the PAR- photosynthesis\
    \ curves (Fig. 2S Supplementary Material \nand see Section 2.3.2), when PAR was\
    \ higher than 1200 µmol m−2 s−1, a \nphoto-inhibition was observed, leading to\
    \ a reduction of gs values. For \nthis reason, the threshold value of 1200 µmol\
    \ m−2 s−1 was considered \nkey to study the influence of PAR in the estimation\
    \ of gs by thermal data. \nWhen thermal indices-gs correlations were plotted considering\
    \ the \ntwo different PAR levels: PAR1200 and PAR>1200, the results pointed to\
    \ a \nhigher r2 at PAR1200 than at PAR>1200 in all correlations studied \n(Table\
    \ 4). In the Tc vs gs correlations, this was especially evident for RW- \nFI treatment,\
    \ which showed an r2 of 0.52 (P < 0.01) at PAR1200 and an r2 \nof 0.25 (no significant)\
    \ at PAR>1200. In CWSI vs gs correlations, all \ntreatments showed a higher r2\
    \ for PAR1200. The same trend was observed \nin Tc-Ta vs gs correlations, with\
    \ high r2 values in almost all treatments \nwhen PAR1200 was considered. \nAs\
    \ for the periods, in P1, and at PAR1200, there was no definite trend \nsince\
    \ the highest r2 were shown, in some cases, by the RW and, in other \ncases, by\
    \ the TW (Table 4). On the contrary, in P2, the use of RW and/or \nRDI generally\
    \ improved the significance of the correlations respect to \nthe control treatment\
    \ (TW-FI). \nThus, the highest r2 values of the correlations between thermal \n\
    indices (Tc, Tc-Ta and CWSI) and gs were shown at 60 min averaged \nFig. 3. Relationship\

    \ between gs and thermal indices in different \nexperimental periods and irrigation\
    \ treatments \nOn the one hand, the three correlations (Tc vs gs, Tc-Ta vs gs\
    \ and CWSI \nvs gs) were, first, globally adjusted, without taking into account\
    \ treat-\nments and periods. The r2 values obtained were significant (data not\
    \ \nshown), however, the level of significance of these correlations \nincreased\
    \ when the different experimental periods were considered \n(Fig. 4). The r2 values\
    \ ranged from 0.42 to 0.62, depending on the \nthermal index and the period (Fig.\
    \ 4A, B and C). In general, all corre-\nlations showed a high significance level\
    \ (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001). \nIn P1, coinciding with the phenological stage of\
    \ FS, the highest r2 \nvalues (r2 =0.52, P < 0.001) were observed for the normalised\
    \ thermal \nindices (Tc-Ta and CWSI). Unlike what was observed in P1, in P2, which\
    \ \ncoincided with the phenological stage of FG, the absolute values of Tc \n\
    showed a higher r2 value (r2 =0.62, P < 0.001) than the normalised \nthermal indices\
    \ vs gs. \nOn the other hand, to study the influence of irrigation treatments\
    \ and \nwater quality in thermal indices vs gs correlations, we considered the\
    \ \nfour treatments of P2: RW-FI, RW-RDI, TW-FI and TW-RDI (Fig. 5). In all \n\
    the correlations studied, RW-FI trees showed slightly greater r2 values \nthan\
    \ TW-FI trees, and the same trend was observed for the RDI treat-\nments (RW-RDI\
    \ and TW-RDI) (Fig. 5). As an example, in the case of Tc vs \ngs correlation,\
    \ the value of r2 for TW-FI was 0.52 and for TW-RDI, RW-FI \nand RW-RDI were 0.56,\
    \ 0.70 and 0.64, respectively. In addition, the \nabsolute value of Tc was the\
    \ best index in P2 (Fig. 4) since, the r2 values \nwere higher for the Tc vs.\
    \ gs regressions (Fig. 5A) than for those \nconsidering the two normalised thermal\

    \ strategy on gs and Tc \ndynamics in different crop phenological stages \nIn\
    \ this work, prior to the evaluation of estimation of gs using IRT \nsensors,\
    \ we assessed whether the use of RW or deficit irrigation at \ndifferent crop\
    \ phenological stages can influence the dynamics of Tc and \ngs of grapefruit\
    \ trees. The measurements of gs and Tc which were carried \nout in the different\
    \ treatments during FS (P1) and FG (P2) phenological \nstages of 2019 and 2020\
    \ suggested that when the weather conditions \nwere mild (P1) water quality had\
    \ no effect in gs and Tc seasonal dy-\nnamics, in agreement with what was observed\
    \ previously by Romero--\nTrigueros et al. (2014) in the same crop. However, when\
    \ the weather \nconditions were more demanding, stomatal aperture was greater\
    \ in all \ntrees, compared to P1. This favouring of stomatal aperture could be\
    \ \naimed at increasing CO2 uptake and subsequently photosynthetic ca-\npacity\
    \ and production of photo-assimilates, which are necessary for fruit \ndevelopment.\
    \ A recent study in lime trees (Mira-García et al., 2021) also \nobserved an increase\
    \ in gs coinciding with fruit development stage. In \naddition, warming of the\
    \ canopy was also observed in P2, as a conse-\nquence, among other factors, of\
    \ an increase in Ta during the summer \nmonths, as Tc is mainly driven by environmental\
    \ factors such as Ta or RH \n(Pineda et al., 2021). In contrast, both RW and RDI\
    \ influenced stomatal \nregulation of grapefruit trees in P2 and, therefore, they\
    \ affected canopy \nwarming dynamics. As for water quality, TW-FI trees showed\
    \ a higher \nstomatal conductance than RW-FI trees, due to the high leaf concen-\n\
    tration of salts (Cl- and/or Na+) and B+ in trees irrigated with RW \n(Romero-Trigueros\
    \ et al., 2017), which reduce leaf gas exchange \n(Pedrero et al., 2015). The\
    \ amount of water applied (FI or RDI) also \ninterfered in the behaviour of both\
    \ parameters. RDI trees showed a \ndecrease in stomatal aperture, in agreement\
    \ with what has been \nobserved by other authors (Anjum, 2008; Gonz´alez-Dugo\
    \ et al., 2019; \nMelgar et al., 2008) in Citrus. Regardless of treatment, Tc\
    \ showed the \nopposite response to gs, as expected, in such a way that a high\
    \ stomatal \naperture induced a reduction in canopy temperature and vice versa\
    \ \n(Costa et al., 2012). \n4.2. Relationship between thermal indices and gs at\
    \ different time \nintervals, VPD and PAR conditions \nIn this study, one of the\
    \ main objectives was to estimate gs by \ndifferent thermal indices: Tc, Tc-Ta\
    \ and CWSI. However, the relationship \nbetween gs and thermal indices could be\
    \ influenced by the time interval \nin which temperature data are averaged and\
    \ the VPD and PAR condi-\ntions when gs was measured. Therefore, as a novelty\
    \ of this work, cor-\nrelations of Tc, Tc-Ta and CWSI vs gs were tested under\
    \ several thermal \ndata average intervals (60 min and timepoint), VPD (VPD≤2\
    \ and \nVPDglobal) and PAR (PAR1200 and PAR>1200) conditions. \nThe results suggested\
    \ that gs values were more closely related to the \npreceding 60 min averaged\
    \ Tc values than with timepoint Tc data, sug-\ngesting that gs integrated previous\
    \ values of canopy temperature, which \nin turn depends on meteorological (Grant\
    \ et al., 2016) and plant hydric \nconditions (Romero-Trigueros et al., 2019).\
    \ In a previous unpublished \nstudy, the authors also evaluated other thermal\
    \ data average intervals \n(15 and 30 min), but their results are not shown here\
    \ since the r2 values \nobtained with these intervals were lower than those obtained\
    \ at 60 min \nMoreover, meteorological conditions such as VPD also influence the\
    \ \nvalues of gs (Diaz-Espejo et al., 2007) and Tc (Mahan et al., 2016). Here,\
    \ \nVPD was correlated with Tc so that an increase in VPD promoted a linear \n\
    increase in canopy heating. Nevertheless, unlike Tc, the influence of VPD \non\
    \ gs changed depending on VPD conditions: at low VPD conditions \n(VPD≤2), stomatal\
    \ conductance was less sensitive to changes of VPD, as \nalso pointed out by Y´a˜nez\
    \ et al. (2021), than Tc. This is, as VPD increase, \nwithin a range between 0\
    \ and 2 kPa, Tc increased simultaneously with \nVPD while gs remained stable,\
    \ leading to a decrease in the strength of \nthermal indices-gs correlations.\
    \ An additional meteorological condition \nwhich influenced the dynamic of the\
    \ stomata was PAR, as observed in \nour results and in a recent study also performed\
    \ on grapefruit trees \n(Romero-Trigueros et al., 2019). Another recent study\
    \ performed on \nlime trees reported that a 53% increase in PAR led to a 46% reduction\
    \ in \nthe accumulated daily gs value (Mira-García et al., 2020). In our work,\
    \ \nboth physiological parameters, gs and Tc, were influenced by PAR, with \n\
    high r2 values between them. In the case of Tc, an increase in PAR caused \na\
    \ direct canopy warming. However, in the case of gs, the clear reduction \nin\
    \ gs values when PAR exceeded 1200 µmol m−2 s−1 indicated that this \nvalue is\
    \ the saturating PAR in grapefruit trees. This justified why when \nthermal indices-gs\
    \ correlations were assessed at two PAR levels (PAR1200 \nand PAR>1200), a more\
    \ direct relationship between Tc and gs was found \nat PAR equal to 1200 µmol\
    \ m−2 s−1. \n4.3. The best thermal index for estimating gs \nA significant r2\
    \ value between thermal indices-gs was found in \nseveral species, such as almond\
    \ trees (Gonz´alez-Dugo et al., 2012), \nvineyards (Baluja et al., 2012), and\
    \ spinach (Masseroni et al., 2017). \nHere, in CWSI vs gs correlation, r2 values\
    \ were slightly lower than those \nobserved in other studies performed on Firmiana\
    \ platanifolia (Yu et al., \n2015), sunflowers planted in pots (Nielsen and Anderson,\
    \ 1989), and \nvines cultivated in soil (Belfiore et al., 2019). The same was\
    \ observed for \nthe Tc-Ta vs gs correlation, where the r2 value was slightly\
    \ lower here \nthan for a ‘Clementina de Nules’ commercial orchard (Ballester\
    \ et al., \n2013). This could be because in those studies Tc-Ta and CWSI were\
    \ \ncalculated from thermal image data and not from IRT sensors data (like \n\
    in our study), and normally the thermal images are taken on the same \npart of\
    \ the tree where gs is measured (Leinonen et al., 2006). Here, the \nmeasurements\
    \ of gs were performed in the lower part of the canopy, \nwhile our IRT sensors\
    \ took measurements in the upper part of the can-\nopy. This fact indicates that\
    \ the accuracy of our model could be \nimproved by carrying out future trials\
    \ where both physiological vari-\nables (Tc and gs) are measured in the same area\
    \ of the tree. Moreover, the \ncorrelations of our work were assessed at two different\
    \ phenological \nstages: P1 and P2 coinciding with the phenological stages of\
    \ \nflowering-sprouting and fruit growth, respectively. The fact that most \n\
    suitable indicators in P1 were the normalised thermal indices (Tc-Ta and \nCWSI),\
    \ and in P2 the absolute values of Tc, indicated that Tc was less \nsensitive\
    \ to changes in gs values when climatic conditions were less \ndemanding. In P1,\
    \ the crop temperature depended mainly on external \nclimatic conditions rather\
    \ than plant water status. On the contrary, in \nP2, the increase in the atmospheric\
    \ demand gave rise to the canopy \ntemperature was more influenced by plant intrinsic\
    \ factors (greater or \nlesser stomatal opening) than air temperature, according\
    \ to Shoa et al. \n(2021). Thus, thermal measurements needed less normalisation\
    \ in P2, in \nline with another study (Meron et al., 2013) in which climatic conditions\
    \ \nwere evaluated. Besides, we also evaluated the influence of treatments \n\
    on the thermal indices vs gs correlations. For all treatments studied \n(RW-FI,\
    \ RW-RDI, TW-FI and TW-RDI), Tc was the best thermal indicator \nfor more accurately\
    \ estimating gs in P2. \nStomatal conductance has already used for irrigation\
    \ scheduling in \nother crops (Hernandez-Santana et al., 2019) and is the plant\
    \ water \nstatus indicator more reliable for grapefruit (Romero-Trigueros et al.,\
    \ \n2021). For this, in future trials, after improving the accuracy of the \n\
    correlations, it would be advisable to validate the use of gs (estimated by \n\
    thermoradiometers) to schedule irrigation in grapefruit trees. That is, to \n\
    define the optimal gs values in the different phenological stages and \nirrigation\
    \ strategies, and then to translate these gs values into threshold \nvalues of\
    \ thermal indices, for an efficient irrigation management. \nIn summary, the ability\
    \ of thermal indices obtained by thermometry \nto estimate gs in grapefruit trees\
    \ under RW and RDI was evaluated here. \nThe results can be summarised in the\
    \ following statements: i) the value \nof gs at a given moment integrated the\
    \ Tc of the previous 60 min; ii) the \nestimation of stomatal conductance by IRT\
    \ improved when gs and Tc \nA.B. Mira-García et al.                          \

    \ \nto VPD<2 kPa) and when PAR did not exceed 1200 µmol m−2 s−1; iii) \nthe absolute\
    \ value of Tc was the most suitable thermal indicator in all \ntreatments during\
    \ fruit growth stage, and iv) the ability of Tc to estimate \ngs improved when\
    \ RW and RDI strategies were used, compared with TW- \nFI. \n5. Conclusion \n\
    The robustness of the different thermal indices (Tc, Tc-Ta and CWSI) \nfor estimating\
    \ stomatal conductance of grapefruit trees was tested for \nthe first time on\
    \ several thermal data intervals and environmental \nconditions. The results suggested\
    \ that thermal indices-gs correlations \nhad the highest degree of correlation\
    \ when preceding 60 min thermal \naverage data, VPDglobal and PAR1200 were considered.\
    \ In these time in-\ntervals and environmental conditions, trees under deficit\
    \ irrigation and \nthose irrigated with reclaimed water showed an increase in\
    \ the thermal \nindices-gs r2 values. We also found the most suitable thermal\
    \ indicator in \neach of the different phenological stages and irrigation treatments\
    \ \nstudied. Normalised thermal indices were the most robust during \nflowering-sprouting\
    \ (P1), and the absolute values of Tc during fruit \ngrowth phenological stage\
    \ (P2), independently of quality of the irriga-\ntion source and the amount of\
    \ water applied. \nNevertheless, the maximum variance explanation achieved was\
    \ \naround 70% due to, among other factors, the gs measurements were \nperformed\
    \ in the middle part of the tree canopy, while IRT sensors were \nplaced above\
    \ the canopy. Thus, in future research the precision of these \nrelationships\
    \ should be improved by determining the proper part of the \ntree where gs and\
    \ Tc should be measured. Then, it would be interesting \nto test the capacity\
    \ of the model for scheduling irrigation and/or esti-\nmation of the threshold\
    \ of gs or Tc at which irrigation should be triggered \nor stopped. \nFunding\

    CHAPTER V: GENERAL CONCLUSIONS \n99 \n \nThe main conclusions derived from this\
    \ thesis, which is aimed to integrate novel \nmultidisciplinary approaches to\
    \ the sustainability of precision irrigation on citrus crops \n(grapefruit and\
    \ lime) grown under Mediterranean conditions, were: \nLime water requirements\
    \  \n- Under Mediterranean conditions and without water limitation, evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) \nvalues of two-year-old lime trees (Citrus latifolia Tan. cv. Bearss)\
    \ grown in 45 L pots \nranged through the crop cycle from 0.25 to 2.56 L plant-1\
    \ and day-1. \n- For day-length periods, when changes in tree biomass were negligible,\
    \ pot weight served \nfor ET-water balance validation in lime trees. \n- A prototype\
    \ of a simple and robust scalable drainage-weighing lysimeter, with real-time\
    \ \nmonitoring of irrigation and soil water balance parameters, provided a practical\
    \ and cost-\neffective way to measure ET in lime trees, with potential use in\
    \ other crops. \nSoil and plant water status indicators threshold values for precise\
    \ irrigation \nmanagement  \n- Automated irrigation protocol, based on the soil\
    \ maximum allowed depletion (MAD) \nconcept, ensured an optimal soil and lime\
    \ trees water status. \n- In the dried soil curve, the breaking point that connected\
    \ the rapid and the slower \nvolumetric soil water content (θv) decrease was indicative\
    \ of the beginning of severe \nwater stress in lime trees, allowing a precise\
    \ irrigation management.  \n- Midday canopy-to-air temperature difference (Tc-Ta)\
    \ threshold values proposed for \ntriggering drip irrigation in lime trees grown\
    \ in semi-arid conditions were 2.4 and 0.8 ◦C \nfor open-field and shaded conditions,\
    \ respectively, when irrigation water availability was \nsufficient to fulfil\
    \ plant water requirements. Under deficit irrigation conditions, the \nproposed\
    \ values were 2.9 and 1.3 ◦C for moderate water deficits (stem water potential,\
    \ \nΨstem = -1.5 MPa) and 3.4 or 1.8 ◦C, for severe water deficits (Ψstem = -2\
    \ MPa), for open-\nfield and shaded lime trees, respectively.  \nEffect of cropping\
    \ system on plant and soil water status indicators  \n- Soil and plant water status\
    \ indicators values were affected by diurnal and seasonal \nchanges and by cropping\
    \ system (shading and open-field).  \nCHAPTER V: GENERAL CONCLUSIONS \n100 \n\
    \ \n- Cropping system mainly affected the leaf gas exchange, with the highest\
    \ stomatal \nconductance (gs) values in lime trees cultivated in shaded conditions.\
    \  \n- Shading favoured plant cooling, as indicated by the more negative Tc-Ta\
    \ values in this \ncropping system with respect to open-field conditions.  \n\
    - Under netting a better soil-plant water status was promoted, delaying plant\
    \ water stress \nappearance and resulting in an interesting cropping technique\
    \ to cope with climate change \nin semi-arid areas. \n- Cropping system must be\
    \ considered to propose Tc-Ta threshold values for lime tree drip \nirrigation\
    \ management. \nDiscrete vs. continuous plant water status indicators  \n- In\
    \ grapefruit trees, correlations between canopy temperature (Tc), Tc-Ta and crop\
    \ water \nstress index (CWSI) with gs had the highest degree of correlation when:\
    \ (i) thermal data \nwas averaged 60 min before gs measurements, (ii) at vapor\
    \ pressure deficit (VPD) \nbetween 0 and 3.5 kPa, and (iii) at photosynthetically\
    \ active radiation (PAR) 1200 μmol \nm-2 s-1.  \n- Normalised thermal indices\
    \ (Tc-Ta and CWSI) were the most robust to estimate gs in \ngrapefruit trees during\
    \ flowering-sprouting, and the absolute Tc values during fruit growth \nphenological\
    \ stage, regardless of quality of irrigation source and the amount of water \n\
    applied.  \n- Thermal-based indices served as an alternative to other classical\
    \ discrete physiological \nmeasurements, as gs and Ψstem, for remotely and real-time\
    \ monitoring lime and grapefruit \nwater status.  \nEffects of water source and\
    \ irrigation strategy on plant water status \n- Grapefruit trees under regulated\
    \ deficit irrigation and those irrigated with reclaimed \nwater showed the best\
    \ thermal indices-gs correlations. \n- Regulated deficit irrigation and irrigated\
    \ with reclaimed water promoted stomatal \nclosure and consequently an increase\
    \ in canopy warming in grapefruit trees. \n \n \n101 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCHAPTER\

    \ Japanese plum (Prunus salicina) farming in the Western Cape (South Africa) is\
    \ an important\nindustry for the export market and job creation and is a large\
    \ water user; however, adequate informa-\ntion on water requirements of this crop\
    \ is not available in this semi-arid area. The objective of this\nstudy was to\
    \ determine seasonal plum water requirements for the purpose of water use planning\n\
    and allocation. The study made use of experimental data from four fully bearing,\
    \ high-yielding plum\norchards (cv African Delight and Fortune) in two major plum\
    \ production regions (Robertson and\nWellington). Crop water requirements and\
    \ the soil water balance were modelled with the physically\nbased HYDRUS-2D model.\
    \ Seasonal crop water requirements were estimated to be between 524 mm\n(cv Fortune\
    \ in Wellington) and 864 mm (cv African Delight in Robertson). Initial basal crop\
    \ coefﬁ-\ncients (Kcb) ranged between 0.98 and 1.01, whilst Kcb for the mid-stage\
    \ averaged between 1.11 (cv\nAfrican Delight in Robertson) and 1.18 (cv Fortune\
    \ in Wellington). Modelling scenarios indicated that\nsoil water redistribution\
    \ beyond the root zone continues at reduced rates after the soil dries to levels\n\
    below ﬁeld capacity. Irrigation management needs to be balanced with other farming\
    \ practices to\nreduce leaching and impacts on water resource quality, as well\
    \ as with the economics of the farm.\nKeywords: African Delight; crop water productivity;\

    South Africa is a major exporter of stone and pome fruits. Amongst them, the Japanese\n\
    plum (Prunus salicina) fruit industry is well-established and primarily aimed\
    \ at supplying\nplums to the export market. Plums in South Africa are cultivated\
    \ on 5319 ha, and the plum\nindustry employs 5904 laborers and 23,616 dependents\
    \ [1]. South African peak production\nwas achieved in 2016 (87,746 metric tons),\
    \ whilst exports were slightly declining in the\nlast 6 years. The Western Cape\
    \ is the dominant producing area, with the most represented\ncultivars in 2019\
    \ being Angeleno/Sumplumsix, Laetitia, Fortune, Ruby Sun and African\nDelight\
    \ [1]. As with other commercial fruit types in South Africa, plum production is\
    \ totally\nreliant on irrigation. Therefore, the availability of adequate water\
    \ is critical for sustainable\nproduction [2]. Given the increased frequency of\
    \ droughts in regions such as the Western\nCape and the competition for water\
    \ use amongst different economic sectors, it is imperative\nthat the fruit industry\
    \ be provided with tools and information on maximum water use that\nwould inform\
    \ water use licensing and allocations. The water use of plum orchards is not\n\
    known, and research is needed to close this important information gap in order\
    \ to improve\nwater productivity and to maintain South Africa’s global competitiveness\
    \ with respect to\nthe production and export of plums.\nSeveral methods and strategies\
    \ for crop water requirements and irrigation scheduling\nare known from previous\
    \ research. Jovanovic et al. stressed the importance of an integrated\napproach\
    \ for measurement of atmospheric, plant and soil variables in order to accurately\n\
    interpret plant–water relations [3]. Much of the past research focused on the\
    \ determination\nof crop water requirements based on atmospheric measurements\
    \ and crop coefﬁcients [4,5].\nHorticulturae 2023, 9, 395. https://doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae9030395\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/horticulturae\nHorticulturae 2023, 9, 395\n2 of 15\n\
    However, little experimental work was conducted in South Africa on crop coefﬁcients\
    \ of\nplums and their disparities dependent on cultivar, growth stage, climatic\
    \ conditions and\nirrigation methods. Such crop coefﬁcients can be directly used\
    \ to inform real-time irrigation\nscheduling and to develop robust orchard soil\
    \ water balance models that distinguish\nbetween plant transpiration and soil\
    \ evaporation. The application of such water balance\nmodels could then be extended\
    \ to other growing regions and for planning purposes.\nIn day-to-day irrigation\
    \ management, the aim of the farmers is to replenish the soil\nwater depleted\
    \ in the root zone through evapotranspiration. Traditionally, soil water\nbalance\
    \ models conceptualize soil layers as “reservoir tanks” sized depending on soil\
    \ water\nretention properties. The soil water balance is described with the well-known\
    \ equation:\n∆S = (P + I + U) − (R + D + ET + Ec) − ∆V\n(1)\nwhere P is precipitation,\
    \ I is irrigation and U is capillary rise (gains to the soil); R is overland\n\
    ﬂow or run-off, D is deep percolation, ET is evapotranspiration and Ec is evaporation\
    \ from\nthe wet canopy (losses from the soil); the term ∆V represents the change\
    \ in water stored\nin vegetation, and it is generally negligible. Solving the\
    \ equation for soil water storage\n(∆S) provides the required information on when\
    \ and how much to irrigate. The equation is\nsteady-state, with all units being\
    \ volume per unit area for a given time interval. Inﬁltrating\nrainfall and irrigation\
    \ water reﬁll the top soil layer to ﬁeld capacity (FC). Any excess water\nis redistributed\
    \ to the next soil layer, and so on. Excess water reﬁlling the bottom soil\nlayer\
    \ contributes to drainage (deep percolation), and it is lost to the plants. This\
    \ simplistic\none-dimensional representation of reality is, therefore, referred\
    \ to as the “cascading” or\n“tipping-bucket” model. It is intuitive and relatively\
    \ undemanding in terms of input data\nrequired. However, the main shortfall is\
    \ that water movement in the soil is not replicated\nbased on physical grounds.\
    \ As such, one-dimensional cascading soil water balance models\nare not able to\
    \ move soil water upwards (capillary rise) and side-wards (horizontally),\nand\
    \ they do not allow variations in allowable soil water depletion level depending\
    \ on the\natmospheric evaporative demand [6].\nA more realistic representation\
    \ of water movement in the soil is given by physically\nbased models that redistribute\
    \ water according to gradients in water potential energy.\nThese models make use\
    \ of the mass balance continuity equation for unsaturated water ﬂow\ndescribed\
    \ by Richards [7]. The equation can be solved iteratively with a ﬁnite-difference\n\
    solution, where the soil proﬁle is subdivided into a grid of nodes and water is\
    \ redistributed\nbetween adjacent nodes in all directions based on soil water\
    \ potential gradients and\nhydraulic conductivities [7]. These transient types\
    \ of models have been discussed in [3,8].\nHowever, besides the sound physical\
    \ approach, ﬁnite-difference models are data-intensive,\nand they also bear inherent\
    \ inaccuracies due to simpliﬁed assumptions. Soil properties are\nusually heterogeneous,\
    \ which limits the practical ability to populate these models with\naccurate input\
    \ data. In addition, bulk soil properties are usually used as inputs that do not\n\
    describe the micro-scale intricacies of soil conduits, especially in well texturally\
    \ sorted soils\nthat may have solid particles and micro-pores of different sizes\
    \ and distribution.\nIn the irrigation practice, it is not uncommon that farmers\
    \ tend to over-irrigate based\non their visual experience of the water status\
    \ of their crops. There are a couple of known\nreasons for intentional over-irrigation.\
    \ Firstly, farmers tend to over-irrigate as “assurance”\nto reduce the risk to\
    \ crop loss, particularly in semi-arid and arid areas prone to drought.\nIt was\
    \ demonstrated that the practice of deﬁcit irrigation is beneﬁcial in areas of\
    \ water\nshortage to increase crop water productivity; however, this increases\
    \ the risk of yield\nreduction [9]. Secondly, the practice of over-irrigation\
    \ is justiﬁed when poor irrigation water\nquality is used, and an additional volume\

    \ collection, processing and modelling are described below using the African\n\
    Delight orchard at Smuts Bros (Robertson) as an example. The same methodology\
    \ was\napplied to the other three orchards. The African Delight orchard in Robertson\
    \ was a 3.8 ha\nhigh-density, full-bearing, 7-year-old orchard characterized by\
    \ a well-drained loamy soil\nwith a shallow conglomerate layer. Volumetric soil\
    \ water content at FC was estimated to\nbe 0.17 m m−1 given the large percentage\
    \ of stones (Table 1). The trees were grafted on\nMariana rootstock with a cover\
    \ grass between rows. Irrigations were performed with two\ndripper lines per row,\
    \ with drippers spaced 0.5 m apart and discharge rates of 2.3 L h−1.\nThe wetted\
    \ bulb was approximately 1.0 m on both sides of the row, which was the estimated\n\
    width of the bulk root system conﬁrmed through ﬁeld observations. The depth of\
    \ the bulk\nroot system was about 0.8 m. Irrigations were scheduled based on soil\
    \ probes and an\nIrricon logging system [13].\nFour calibrated AquaCheck Basic\
    \ II probes were installed to measure volumetric soil\nwater content down to a\
    \ depth of 0.8 m (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 m), two in the row\nand two\
    \ mid-way between rows, and half-hourly data were collected regularly with an\n\
    AquaCheck logger [14]. Canopy fractional interception of radiation (fc) and leaf\
    \ area index\n(LAI) were measured with an LAI-2200C plant canopy analyzer [15].\n\
    2.2. HYDRUS-2D Modelling\nThe HYDRUS-2D/3D model [11] was used to simulate water\
    \ transport in the 2D\norchard system. There were a number of reasons for using\
    \ HYDRUS in this speciﬁc study.\nFirstly, the model is ﬁt to describe a two-dimensional\
    \ water balance system with micro-\nirrigation, where a portion of the land is\
    \ wetted (along tree hedgerows), and another\nportion is non-wetted (between tree\
    \ rows). Secondly, the HYDRUS model uses Richards’\nequation [7], which gives\
    \ a more physically based representation of soil water redistribution\ncompared\
    \ to traditional tipping bucket/cascading soil water balance models. It is, however,\n\
    Horticulturae 2023, 9, 395\n6 of 15\nalso more data-intensive. Thirdly, given\
    \ the underlying physics of the 2D processes, it\nwas deemed that the HYDRUS model\
    \ would give realistic and accurate results of the ﬁeld\nwater balance, in particular\
    \ the volume of water that passes the root system and ends up\nrecharging groundwater\
    \ due to over-irrigation.\nIn order to parametrize the HYDRUS model for the African\
    \ Delight orchard in Robert-\nson, a model domain geometry was constructed in\
    \ HYDRUS-2D. The model domain had a\nrectangular shape to represent a row cross-section\
    \ of the orchard (Figure 3). The dimensions\nof the cross-section were 4 m (tree\
    \ row width) × 1 m (soil depth). The grid mesh was\ngenerated automatically and\
    \ is visible with blue lines in Figure 3. The simulated processes\nwere water\
    \ ﬂow and root water uptake at a time interval of 1 day with daily outputs (from\n\
    1 September 2021, beginning of irrigation season, to 9 March 2022, end of harvest).\

    \ was assumed to be 100 s m−1, resulting in Fr = 1.\nThe purple boundary nodes\
    \ in Figure 3 represent a special time-variable boundary\ncondition, namely surface\
    \ drip with dynamic wetting, and they were used to simulate\nsurface drip (or\
    \ micro-jet) wetting of the surface [11]. Irrigation volumes were obtained\nfrom\
    \ the farm, and the surface area associated with transpiration was set to be 2\
    \ m. The\nboundary nodes in white on the vertical faces of the domain represented\
    \ no ﬂux boundaries,\nassuming that no horizontal ﬂuxes occur in the soil (Figure\
    \ 3). The bottom boundary was\na free drainage boundary (dark green boundary nodes)\
    \ across which water percolation\nbeyond the root zone was calculated (Figure\
    \ 3).\nThe Van Genuchten–Mualem soil hydraulic model was used to characterize\
    \ unsatu-\nrated hydraulic conductivity vs. pressure head. Soil hydraulic parameters\
    \ were calculated\nwith a neural network prediction incorporated in HYDRUS, based\
    \ on volumetric soil water\ncontent at ﬁeld capacity (0.17) and permanent wilting\
    \ point (0.06) estimated with the gravi-\nmetric method, texture of the loamy\
    \ soil and bulk density (1.2 g cm3). Initial conditions\nwere set with soil water\
    \ content at FC, as simulations started on 1 September 2021 at the\nend of the\
    \ rainy season. Root distribution in the orchard was set to decrease linearly\
    \ down\nto a depth of 0.8 m, based on discussions held with farm managers on the\
    \ soil volume\nexplored by tree roots. The root water uptake model of Feddes et\
    \ al. was selected for the\nHorticulturae 2023, 9, 395\n8 of 15\nsimulations with\
    \ no solute stress [17]. Root water uptake parameters of the Feddes model\nfor\
    \ deciduous fruits were selected from the database incorporated in HYDRUS.\nObservation\
    \ nodes in HYDRUS-2D were set to correspond to the sensor positions of\nthe AquaCheck\
    \ probes. The model was calibrated by comparison between the soil water\ncontents\
    \ measured with AquaCheck probes and those simulated with HYDRUS-2D for each\n\
    soil depth. Input parameters of HYDRUS-2D, in particular soil hydraulic properties\
    \ and\nroot distribution patterns, were changed until the best ﬁt was obtained\
    \ between observed\nand simulated data. The statistical measure was the mean absolute\
    \ error (MAE), and the\ncalculations were performed in Excel.\n3. Results\n3.1.\
    \ Case Study of African Delight in Robertson\nHYDRUS-2D simulations for the African\
    \ Delight orchard in Robertson were run for\nthe period from 1 September 2021\
    \ (beginning of the vegetative season) until 9 March\n2022 (completion of harvest,\
    \ coinciding with a marked reduction in irrigation rate and\nfrequency). Initial\
    \ Kcb at the beginning of the season (1 September 2021) was calculated\nfrom Kd\
    \ and LAI measurements (LAI = 1.63) [16]. The value of LAI was increased linearly\n\
    until day 45 of the season (15 October 2021), when full cover was reached at mid-stage,\n\
    and Kcb was calculated accordingly. The value of Kcb for the mid-stage until harvest\n\
    was calculated based on the average fc (0.78) and average LAI (2.08) measured\
    \ with the\nLAI-2200C plant canopy analyzer. Values of fc and LAI did not change\
    \ much during the\nfull cover period because the trees were pruned to reduce vegetative\
    \ growth and facilitate\nharvesting. The canopy density coefﬁcient Kd was calculated\
    \ to be 0.77 at full cover, and a\nstandard value of mean leaf resistance was\
    \ assumed to be 100 s m−1 [16]. The average Kcb\nat full cover was calculated\
    \ to be 1.11, which is very close to the values estimated in [16,18].\nThe model\
    \ was calibrated via comparison between simulated soil water content and\nthose\
    \ observed with AquaCheck probes. Figure 4 represents simulated and observed\n\

    \ and peaks of measured\ndata with an MAE of 0.028 m m−1. It is interesting to\
    \ note the ﬂuctuations in soil water\ncontent data from the onset of the irrigation\
    \ season. The decreasing trends in soil water\ncontent were also consistent in\
    \ the beginning of the season and during short periods when\nirrigations did not\
    \ take place.\nThe soil water balance components are summarized in Table 2. Reference\
    \ evapotran-\nspiration and rainfall were calculated/measured from the weather\
    \ station data. Irrigation\ndata were obtained from the farm and used as inputs\
    \ into the model. Soil evaporation,\nactual root water uptake (plant transpiration)\
    \ and free drainage were calculated with\nthe HYDRUS-2D model. The crop water\
    \ requirement of the well-irrigated orchard was\ncalculated as the sum of root\
    \ water uptake and evaporation directly from the soil. It is\nevident from Figure\
    \ 4 and Table 2 that the orchard was over-irrigated, especially during\nthe mid-stage\
    \ of the growing season. The speciﬁc reason for the over-irrigation was the\n\
    unevenness of orchard pollination, where trees were better pollinated and produced\
    \ more\nfruits at the edges of the 3.8 ha ﬁeld, and this section of the ﬁeld was,\
    \ therefore, used to\nschedule irrigations. A weaker pollination of the trees\
    \ occurred in the middle of the ﬁeld,\nwhere the AquaCheck probes were installed\
    \ for monitoring soil water content.\nHorticulturae 2023, 9, 395\n9 of 15\n \n\
    The model was calibrated via comparison between simulated soil water content and\
    \ \nthose observed with AquaCheck probes. Figure 4 represents simulated and observed\

    Horticulturae 2023, 9, 395\n10 of 15\nwas omitted from the simulation, whilst\
    \ irrigation was set at 80% of the real measurements.\nThe results of the hypothetical\
    \ scenario are shown in Table 2. It is evident that, compared\nto real measurements,\
    \ root water uptake decreased slightly, and soil evaporation decreased\nsubstantially.\
    \ Free drainage decreased substantially; however, some drainage occurred\nregardless\
    \ of the irrigation volumes that maintained the soil water content below FC. This\n\
    was due to weaker, but continued water redistribution in the soil at levels even\
    \ below FC\nas well as the drying of the sub-soil that resulted in stronger water\
    \ potential gradients.\n3.2. Water Balance Summary of Four Orchards\nThe same\
    \ methodological procedure described for the African Delight orchard in\nRobertson\
    \ was used to calculate the water balance for the other three orchards. However,\n\
    the season duration was different for each orchard, as reported in Table 3. The\
    \ duration\nof the growing season coincided with the end of harvesting and a drastic\
    \ reduction of\nirrigation volumes and frequency in each orchard. The growing\
    \ season of the late-maturing\ncultivar African Delight was longer compared to\
    \ that of the mid-maturing Fortune. Table 3\nalso summarizes the initial canopy\
    \ cover fc and LAI, measured with the LAI-2200C plant\ncanopy analyzer during\
    \ dormancy, and the calculated initial Kcb. The average measured fc\nand LAI and\
    \ the calculated Kcb at full canopy development (mid-stage) are also shown in\n\
    Table 3. Crop heights, used in the calculation of Kcb values, are controlled on\
    \ the farms for\nthe purpose of managing canopy growth and facilitating harvesting.\n\

    Table 4 represents the components of the water balance calculated with the calibrated\n\
    HYDRUS-2D model. Cumulative reference evapotranspiration and rainfall were calculated\n\
    for the duration of the growing season. The values were, therefore, higher for\
    \ crops with a\nlonger growing season. The difference in total rainfall between\
    \ Robertson and Wellington\nwas noticeable (Table 4). Irrigation volumes depended\
    \ primarily on the duration of the\ngrowing season and the occurrence of rainfall.\
    \ The common practice on the farms is to\nincrease irrigation volumes from the\
    \ beginning of the growing season in September up\nto rates and frequency that\
    \ support full development until harvest, and then to decrease\nvolumes and frequency\
    \ for controlling canopy growth and carry-over effects to the next\nseason. Seasonal\
    \ irrigation was the highest in the African Delight orchard in Robertson\n(943\
    \ mm); this orchard was also the most successful in terms of yield (51 t ha−1).\
    \ However,\nthis led to intentional over-irrigation due to heterogenous pollination\
    \ of the orchard. As a\nresult, drainage (deep percolation) was also the highest\
    \ in this orchard. It should also be\nnoted that irrigations in the African Delight\
    \ orchard in Robertson are difﬁcult to manage\nbecause of the high percentage\
    \ of stones and conglomerates in the soil that reduce the\neffective soil water\
    \ retention capacity (FC is lower than in other orchards, Table 1).\nHorticulturae\

    \ was slightly higher, and transpiration (actual root\nwater uptake) was slightly\
    \ lower for African Delight in Robertson compared to the same\ncultivar in Wellington\
    \ (Table 4). This was mainly due to the difference in growing season\n(Table 3)\
    \ and planting density. The 4 m spacing between rows in Robertson, compared\n\
    to 3.5 m spacing in Wellington, allowed for less canopy cover, resulting in more\
    \ light\npenetration between the rows and soil evaporation. Irrigations in the\
    \ African Delight\norchard in Wellington were estimated on a weekly basis, due\
    \ to the absence of the farm\nmanager during the course of the season. However,\
    \ the total seasonal volumes were\nrecorded. For cultivar Fortune, the harvesting\
    \ season occurred later in Robertson compared\nto Wellington. As a result, the\
    \ Fortune orchard in Robertson was irrigated for longer;\ntherefore, higher soil\
    \ evaporation and transpiration were calculated.\nSeasonal crop water requirements,\
    \ determined as the sum of soil evaporation and\nactual root water uptake calculated\
    \ with HYDRUS-2D, ranged between 524 mm for cultivar\nFortune in Wellington and\
    \ 864 mm for African Delight in Robertson (Table 4). These are\nthe recommended\
    \ water allocations for these cultivars in these two production regions.\nBy far\
    \ the highest crop yield was obtained for the African Delight orchard in Robertson\n\
    (51 t ha−1, with 43 t ha−1 of fruit of sufﬁciently good quality for packing).\
    \ The yields in the\nremaining orchards were similar to each other. Biophysical\
    \ water productivity, calculated\nas the ratio of yield to evapotranspiration\
    \ (sum of soil evaporation and root water uptake),\nranged between 4.4 kg m−3\
    \ for African Delight in Wellington and 7.3 kg m−3 for Fortune\nin Wellington.\n\
    4. Discussion\nThe HYDRUS-2D model coupled with the two-step crop coefﬁcient approach\
    \ of the\nFAO56 [4] was adopted to calculate the soil water balance and crop water\
    \ requirements\nin four irrigated plum orchards in the Western Cape. Crop coefﬁcients\
    \ (Kc) and basal\ncrop coefﬁcients (Kcb) provided in [4] and revised in [5] represent\
    \ values under standard\nclimatic conditions. However, different cultivation strategies,\
    \ methods and technologies\nmay require adjustments of Kc and Kcb to account for\
    \ environmental stresses and speciﬁc\nmanagement practices (e.g., cultivar, irrigation\
    \ method and management, row spacing,\ncanopy density, cover crops, etc.). This\
    \ was corroborated in a modelling study with the\nCropSyst model on plum cultivars\
    \ Angeleno and Red Beaut with different pruning over\n3 years (2010–2012) [19].\
    \ The main conclusion was that different Kc at full canopy were\nrequired in order\
    \ to accurately simulate evapotranspiration, depending on canopy sizes\nand different\
    \ tree vigor exhibited by the two cultivars [19]. According to Fereres and\nGoldhamer,\
    \ higher crop coefﬁcients may occur in high-density orchards and when using\n\
    cover crops [20]. Allen and Pereira [16] proposed a methodology to adjust crop\
    \ coefﬁcients\nbased on LAI, fc and rl. In the current study, the methodology\
    \ of Allen and Pereira [16] was\nused to adjust crop coefﬁcients for full-bearing\
    \ cultivars African Delight and Fortune in the\nHorticulturae 2023, 9, 395\n12\
    \ of 15\nWestern Cape. The results of crop coefﬁcients, evapotranspiration (crop\
    \ water requirements)\nand plum water productivity were compared to internationally\
    \ available data.\nThe initial Kcb (0.98–1.01) and the mid-stage Kcb at full canopy\
    \ cover (1.11–1.18)\nobtained in the current study (Table 3) are consistent with\
    \ values reported in the literature\nfor high-density orchards [16,18]. In other\
    \ published research, crop coefﬁcients (Kc) of\naround 1 at mid-season were recommended\
    \ for stone fruits [21]. Naor et al. proposed\nan optimum Kc between 0.6 and 0.8\
    \ in the month prior to harvest, based on a multi-level\nirrigation and crop load\
    \ experiment conducted on cv Black Amber [22]. Intrigliolo et al.\nestimated Kc\
    \ to be between 0.29 in March and 0.57 in June in 10-year-old Japanese plum cv\n\
    Black Gold cultivated in Spain (average seasonal Kc was 0.46) [23]. In South Africa,\
    \ Dzikiti\nand Schachtschneider found the Kc coefﬁcient to be between 0.9 and\
    \ 1.0 for an African\nDelight plum orchard in Robertson during peak irrigation\
    \ season [24].\nIn the current study, seasonal evapotranspiration (crop water\
    \ requirements) was\ncalculated to be between 524 and 864 mm (Table 4). Dzikiti\
    \ and Schachtschneider esti-\nmated total seasonal evapotranspiration of African\
    \ Delight in Robertson to be 921 mm\nusing eddy covariance measurements, with\
    \ an estimated peak maximum transpiration\nof 20 L tree−1 d−1 (2.7 mm d−1 by accounting\
    \ for the planting density) using heat pulse\nvelocity sap ﬂow measurements [24].\
    \ In work conducted on Japanese plums cv Angeleno\nin Spain, Samperio et al. estimated\
    \ average water input over 5 years to be between 962\nand 1211 mm a−1 (irrigation\
    \ + rainfall) depending on well-irrigated and deﬁcit irrigation\ntreatments [25].\
    \ Samperio et al. also reported average irrigation of 639 mm a−1 in a control\n\
    full-irrigation treatment and average annual rainfall of 520 mm a−1 (total of\
    \ 1159 mm a−1)\nin a 5-year experiment on cv Red Beaut [26]. Monino et al. estimated\
    \ annual water input\n(irrigation + rainfall) to be between 895 and 1287 mm a−1\
    \ for cv Angeleno (9-year-old trees),\ndepending on the deﬁcit irrigation strategy,\
    \ in an experiment conducted in Spain over\n3 years [27]. Intrigliolo and Castel\
    \ used an adjusted Kc for canopy size (average value of\n0.5 for the season) to\
    \ estimate crop water requirements of Japanese plum cv. Black Gold in\nSpain [28].\
    \ Seasonal evapotranspiration, calculated as the sum of irrigation and effective\n\
    rainfall from April to October, was between 409 and 558 mm, depending on the irrigation\n\
    water treatment and crop load. Intrigliolo et al. reported irrigation water requirements\n\
    to be between 250 and 311 mm season−1 (from April to September) for cv Black Gold\
    \ in\nSpain [23].\nIancu measured evapotranspiration of plums using non-weighing\
    \ lysimeters in Roma-\nnia [29]. Actual evapotranspiration was measured to be\
    \ 622 mm for the period from April\nto October, with daily values ranging from\
    \ 1.69 mm d−1 in April to 4.24 mm d−1 in July,\nand with the soil evaporation\
    \ component from bare-soil lysimeters being quite high. Choo-\ntummatat et al.\
    \ researched the effects of different trellis systems (Lincoln, Vase, Palmette\n\
    and Tatura) on water use of 6-year-old plum trees (cv Laroda and Santa Rosa) in\
    \ Western\nAustralia [30]. Soil water balance calculations indicated that average\
    \ water consumption\nunder irrigation practices commonly adopted on commercial\
    \ farms in the area varied\nbetween 7.2 and 8.2 mm d−1 in the period of rapid\
    \ fruit growth (mid-December). Estimates\nof evapotranspiration were also conducted\
    \ using remote sensing information. Mhawej and\nFaour used the SEBALIGEE system,\
    \ a Google Earth Engine-based platform adopting the\nSurface Energy Balance for\
    \ Land—Improved (SEBALI) model, to estimate seasonal actual\nevapotranspiration\
    \ in California between 2017 and 2019 at 30 m spatial resolution [31]. The\nUSDA\
    \ NASS Cropland Data [32] were used to identify crops at 30 m spatial resolution.\n\
    Average plum evapotranspiration was estimated to be 994 ± 188 mm a−1.\nCrop water\
    \ productivity is usually expressed as crop yield (or economic yield) divided\n\
    by crop water consumption (or evapotranspiration). Lack of measurements or estimates\
    \ of\nactual evapotranspiration precludes the use of this deﬁnition of crop water\
    \ productivity. As\nevapotranspiration was seldom measured/estimated in the plum\
    \ experiments reviewed in\nthe literature, little reliable information was found\
    \ on crop water productivity. In the current\nstudy, biophysical crop water productivities\
    \ ranged from 4.4 kg m−3 to 7.3 kg m−3 (Table 3).\nDzikiti and Schachtschneider\
    \ reported a plum water productivity of 5.97 kg m−3 of water\nHorticulturae 2023,\
    \ 9, 395\n13 of 15\ntranspired [24]. Intrigliolo and Castel calculated crop water\
    \ productivities between 4.2 and\n7.5 kg m−3 for Japanese plum cv Black Gold grown\
    \ in Spain, depending on the irrigation\nwater treatment and crop load [28]. Monino\
    \ et al. estimated plum water productivity\n(9-year-old trees cv Angeleno) to\
    \ be between 5.6 and 13.4 kg m−3 depending on the deﬁcit\nirrigation strategy\
    \ [27]. Values of crop coefﬁcients, evapotranspiration and crop water\nproductivities\
    \ estimated in the current study were generally well within the range of those\n\
    reported in the literature, which gives conﬁdence that realistic values were simulated\n\
    with HYDRUS-2D.\nIn the hypothetical scenario analysis (Table 2), the ﬁnite-difference\
    \ HYDRUS-2D soil\nwater balance model indicated that water losses out of the root\
    \ zone may occur even at\nsoil moisture values below FC as a result of soil water\
    \ redistribution. These losses at ﬁeld\nscale may be viewed as irrigation return\
    \ ﬂow into the water resource system, as this water\ncould be re-used downstream.\
    \ The practice of slight over-irrigation may be justiﬁed due to\nthese water losses\
    \ at ﬁeld scale, besides representing an ”assurance” means of controlling\nsoil\
    \ salinity. Torrecillas et al. drew attention to the variability of plum responses\
    \ to water\nstress, especially in early maturing cultivars [33]. More severe and\
    \ longer water stress may\ncause slower rehydration and affect the water stress-sensitive\
    \ stages of the plant, especially\nwhen such recovery is limited by the irrigation\
    \ system design and water availability. This\nmay commonly occur in commercial\
    \ orchards, where it would be, therefore, prudent to\nmaintain soil and sub-soil\
    \ sufﬁciently wet throughout the growing season, as shortfalls in\nsoil water\
    \ content may not be easily replenished with micro-irrigation systems. Paltineanu\n\
    et al. demonstrated that soil physical properties are more variable in orchards\
    \ compared\nto arable soils with homogeneous tillage, and less favorable to plants\
    \ in the inter-row soil\nvolume compared to intra-row, mainly due to mechanization\
    \ trafﬁc [34]. This should be\nconsidered in irrigation management, as soil physical\
    \ properties determine the soil water\nretention capacity and ultimately root\
    \ water uptake.\nHowever, any beneﬁcial effects of over-irrigation should be weighed\
    \ against poten-\ntially negative effects that may manifest through leaching of\
    \ nutrients/chemicals and\neconomic losses. Nutrients, pesticides and other chemicals\
    \ are some of the most expensive\ninputs in farming, and their loss bears economic\
    \ costs to the farm. In addition, they impact\nthe water resources and environment,\
    \ which may imply remediation costs. The practice of\ndeﬁcit irrigation has been\
    \ recently investigated, where reduced irrigation results in lower\nyields, but\
    \ better quality fruit and higher proﬁts [33]. Much research can be found in the\n\
    literature on deﬁcit irrigation strategies speciﬁcally targeted to non-critical\
    \ phenological\nstages to reduce plum water use and improve fruit quality [25,27,35,36]\
    \ and carry-over\neffects to subsequent seasons [23,26,27,37–41]. In these instances,\
    \ the economic yield water\nproductivity [42] may be considered a more inﬂuential\
    \ factor in irrigation management\nthan biophysical water productivity. It is\
    \ clear that further research is required on ﬁnding\na ﬁne balance between irrigation\
    \ management, scheduling and other practices to reduce\nwater use and sustain\
    \ proﬁtable farming.\n5. Conclusions\nSeasonal plum water requirements calculated\
    \ with the HYDRUS-2D model differed\ndepending primarily on the duration of the\
    \ growing season (mid- or late-season cultivar)\nand canopy cover (pruning to\
    \ control vegetative growth). This information is invaluable to\nplum producers\
    \ in order to plan irrigations and obtain correct water allocations. It appears\n\
    that the methodology of Allen and Pereira [16] may be applicable to extrapolate\
    \ crop\ncoefﬁcients to sites with different irrigation and crop management in\
    \ order to calculate crop\nwater requirements. The comparison of the soil water\
    \ balance calculated with the physically\nbased HYDRUS-2D model using real data\
    \ and a hypothetical scenario of deﬁcit irrigation\ndemonstrated that water redistributes\
    \ dynamically in the soil, and deep percolation of water\nbeyond the root system\
    \ continues even after the soil dries to levels below FC, although at\nmuch reduced\
    \ rates. This amount of water is not always accounted for in simpliﬁed soil\n\
    water balance models, and it needs to be considered in irrigation scheduling to\
    \ replenish\nHorticulturae 2023, 9, 395\n14 of 15\nthe water loss from the soil\
    \ proﬁle. It is essential that scientists collaborate closely with\nfarmers to\
    \ acquire on-the-ground information for improving the accuracy of irrigation\n\
    scheduling, yields and proﬁts, in combination with other farming practices.\n\

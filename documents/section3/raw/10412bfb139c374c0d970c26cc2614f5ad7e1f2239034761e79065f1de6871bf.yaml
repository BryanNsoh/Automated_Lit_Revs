    \ ISSN: 2210-142X Date: 2023-01-29 Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), particularly in critical infrastructures, necessitates strict\
    \ security and privacy standards. Owing to data proliferation, Cyber-physical\
    \ systems (CPS) rely on computing platforms for the provision of services and\
    \ resources. The futuristic “Beyond 5G” (B5G) enabled critical IoT infrastructures\
    \ cannot run on centralized systems due to their security vulnerabilities that\
    \ compromise the basic Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability (CIA) triad. Blockchain\
    \ technology (BCT) is emerging as a key enabler in addressing IoT’s security challenges,\
    \ and it is compliant with the Fog-IoT architecture. The Ethereum platform has\
    \ ushered an unprecedented development in BCT by facilitating application development.\
    \ Blockchain (BC) connects the users’ chain identity to the transactions associated\
    \ with their tokenized digital assets and confers the ability to audit the system.\
    \ The history of canonical transactions is recorded in an immutable fashion facilitating\
    \ data tracking and deterrence of data repudiation. A Consensus mechanism (CM)\
    \ governs the state transitions and the node behavior in building trust relationships\
    \ between various entities in the absence of a central authority. Through Smart\
    \ Contracts(SCs), distributed and trustworthy access control can be achieved for\
    \ IoT systems besides enhancing automation. We argue that BCT adoption is inevitable\
    \ in securing futuristic B5G enabled IoT critical infrastructures for ensuring\
    \ flexible and fine-grained access control, authentication, communication, and\
    \ data security. Various challenges are associated with their adoption, such as\
    \ the rising cost of Ethereum and constraints in the IoT environment. To facilitate\
    \ BC solutions for IoT security, the functionality of BCT must be complemented\
    \ with other technologies such as Machine Learning (ML), Edge Computing (EC),\
    \ and InterPlanetary Filesystem(IPFS). Show full item record Files in this item\

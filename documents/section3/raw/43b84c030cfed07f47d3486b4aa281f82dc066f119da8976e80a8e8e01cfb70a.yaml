    Source Abstract: It is essential to increase the productivity of agricultural
    and farming processes to improve yields and cost-effectiveness with new technology
    such as the Internet of Things (IoT). In particular, IoT can make agricultural
    and farming industry processes more efficient by reducing human intervention through
    automation. In this study, the aim to analyze recently developed IoT applications
    in the agriculture and farming industries to provide an overview of sensor data
    collections, technologies, and sub-verticals such as water management and crop
    management. In this review, data is extracted from 60 peer-reviewed scientific
    publications (2016-2018) with a focus on IoT sub-verticals and sensor data collection
    for measurements to make accurate decisions. Our results from the reported studies
    show water management is the highest sub-vertical (28.08%) followed by crop management
    (14.60%) then smart farming (10.11%). From the data collection, livestock management
    and irrigation management resulted in the same percentage (5.61%). In regard to
    sensor data collection, the highest result was for the measurement of environmental
    temperature (24.87%) and environmental humidity (19.79%). There are also some
    other sensor data regarding soil moisture (15.73%) and soil pH (7.61%). Research
    indicates that of the technologies used in IoT application development, Wi-Fi
    is the most frequently used (30.27%) followed by mobile technology (21.10%). As
    per our review of the research, we can conclude that the agricultural sector (76.1%)
    is researched considerably more than compared to the farming sector (23.8%). This
    study should be used as a reference for members of the agricultural industry to
    improve and develop the use of IoT to enhance agricultural production efficiencies.
    This study also provides recommendations for future research to include IoT systems''
    scalability, heterogeneity aspects, IoT system architecture, data analysis methods,
    size or scale of the observed land or agricultural domain, IoT security and threat
    solutions/protocols, operational technology, data storage, cloud platform, and
    power supplies. Keywords: Internet of Things; IoT; agricultural; smart farming;
